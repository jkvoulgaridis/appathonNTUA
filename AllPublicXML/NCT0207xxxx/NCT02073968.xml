    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well intensity modulated radiation therapy adjusted by
      positron emission tomography (PET) scanning together with combination chemotherapy works in
      treating patients with stage II-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Radiation therapy uses
      high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. In intensity-modulated radiotherapy, multiple beam
      angles and dozens of beam segments are used to deliver highly conformal radiation therapy.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving PET-adjusted IMRT together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy (based on post-treatment PET findings) of dose-painted
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent chemotherapy for locally-advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy (based on clinical endpoints including locoregional control
      [LRC], disease-free survival [DFS], and overall survival [OS]) of dose-painted IMRT with
      concurrent chemotherapy for LA-NSCLC.

      II. To evaluate the safety of dose-painted IMRT with concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy for
      LA-NSCLC.

      III. To evaluate the utility of post-treatment PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging as a
      predictor of clinical outcomes following treatment with this novel approach.

      IV. To explore, in a preliminary manner, whether metabolomic markers in the blood and urine
      prior to and during the course of treatment are associated with treatment response, clinical
      endpoints, and treatment-related adverse events such as radiation pneumonitis.

      OUTLINE:

      RADIATION THERAPY: Patients undergo PET-adjusted IMRT or proton beam radiation therapy five
      days a week for 5 weeks.

      CONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 5 weeks beginning week 1 of thoracic radiotherapy.

      CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning approximately 4-6 weeks after the completion of all
      radiation therapy and when esophagitis and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy are grade 1 or
      less, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500, and platelet count &gt; 100,000, patients may
      receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment may
      repeat every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity at the discretion of the treating physicians.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12-16 weeks, 19 weeks, every
      3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for a total of 5 years.

CONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 3 hours and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 6 weeks beginning week 1 of thoracic radiotherapy.
CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning approximately 4-6 weeks after the completion of all radiation therapy and when esophagitis and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy are grade 1 or less, ANC &gt; 1500, and platelet count &gt; 100,000, patients may receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment may repeat every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity at the discretion of the treating physicians.
