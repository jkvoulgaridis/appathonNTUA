    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 24 in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS for pain is a subjective measure and it consists of a 100 millimeter (mm) line with two end points representing 'no pain' to 'pain as bad as it could be'. Participants are asked to rate their pain by placing a mark on the line corresponding to their current level of pain. The distance along the line from the 'no pain' marker is then measured with a ruler giving a pain score out of 10.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 24 in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT fatigue scale includes 13 statements, which measures fatigue/asthenia for participants with chronic, life-threatening illnesses. For each question, a participant rates his/her condition for the past week on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). A score is calculated by averaging the individual question scores, with lower scores indicative of less fatigue.</description>
