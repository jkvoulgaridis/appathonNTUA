    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies an imaging technique known as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic
      resonance imaging (DCE MRI) in identifying the presence of pancreatic cancer. DCE MRI is a
      procedure that takes detailed pictures of functional and structural properties inside the
      body using magnetic field imaging. These images may better characterize pancreatic cancer in
      patients at high risk or in patients who may have undergone chemotherapy for pancreatic
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the ability of DCE-MRI to identify the presence of pancreatic cancer in patients at
      high risk for hereditary pancreatic cancer.

      II. Assess the ability of DCE-MRI to identify the presence of pancreatic cancer in patients
      with cystic lesions of the pancreas.

      III. Assess the ability of DCE-MRI to accurately predict tumor margins in patients who have
      undergone chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.

      IV. Obtain DCE-MRI scans of from healthy volunteers (Group 4), to establish baseline imaging
      parameters of the normal, non-diseased pancreas for use as a comparator to affected
      pancreata.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Clinical factors associated with the presence of pancreatic cancer will be assessed in
      each of the three experimental groups, including disease free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 groups.

      ARM I (High-risk for familial or hereditary pancreatic cancer): Patients undergo DCE MRI
      yearly for a minimum of 3 scans.

      ARM II (Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [IPMN]): Patients undergo DCE MRI prior to
      surgery for resection of IPMN.

      ARM III (Pancreatic cancer): Patients who undergo chemotherapy prior to resection will have 2
      DCE MRI scans; one study scan prior to undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, as well as one study
      scan following neoadjuvant therapy as part of their pre-operative work up in addition to the
      standard imaging studies. For patients that do not require chemotherapy treatment prior to
      resection they will have just one DCE MRI scan prior to surgical resection.

      ARM IV (Healthy volunteers): Patients undergo a single DCE MRI examination.

             potential

          -  ALL PARTICIPANTS: Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document

          -  GROUPS 1, 2, AND 3: &quot;All participants&quot; described above

          -  GROUPS 1, 2, AND 3: Must be consented for the Oregon Pancreatic Tumor Registry (OPTR)

          -  GROUPS 1, 2, AND 3: Group 1: participants identified as being high-risk for familial

             requirements:

               -  Have a strong family history of pancreatic cancer; this is defined as pancreatic

                  first- degree relatives; or,

               -  Have a known high-risk genetic syndrome (e.g., BRCA 1&amp;2, STK11, CDNK2A, PRSS1,
                  and MSH 2&amp;6)

          -  GROUPS 1, 2, AND 3: Group 2 participants identified as having IPMN on standard
             radiographic imaging that meets criteria for resection based on symptoms or on

             described above

          -  HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (Group 4): Group 4 participants must have no history of cancer,
             pancreatic disease, or family history of pancreatic cancer.

               -  Family history will be defined as pancreatic cancer occurring in one first-degree
                  relative and two other relatives, or two first-degree relatives

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants unable or unwilling to give written, informed consent or to undergo MRI
             imaging

          -  Participants with multiple drug allergies, and/or subjects who have had an allergic
             reaction to any intravenous iron replacement product, or a known history of
             hypersensitivity to ferumoxytol

          -  Participants with concurrent clinical diagnosis, evidence of suspected
             hemochromatosis, or other diseases of iron metabolism (i.e., iron overload)

          -  Cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, restrictive heart disease, or bronzing of the skin

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown, but potential
             risk, for adverse events, as small animal trials have linked ferumoxytol
             administration (at very high doses) to birth defects (e.g., soft-tissue malformations
             and decreased fetal weights); it is not known whether ferumoxytol is present in human
             milk; breastfeeding, however, should be discontinued if the mother receives
             ferumoxytol while nursing

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive participants on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             ferumoxytol

          -  Participants with diagnosis of renal insufficiency or glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
             &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m^2

          -  Adult patients who require monitored anesthesia for MRI scanning

          -  Participants with any contraindications to gadolinium-based contrast agents

          -  Participants who have a contraindication for MRI (e.g. metal in their bodies, a
             cardiac pacemaker, or other incompatible device), or are severely agitated or
