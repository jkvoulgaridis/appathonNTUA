      This study will test the use of ketamine for treatment of depression in adolescents that have
      not responded to other treatments. We will also examine neurobiological mechanisms of
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression frequently emerges during adolescence and is associated with severe outcomes.
      Current interventions do not lead to remission for many adolescents. Treatment-resistant
      depression (TRD) in adolescence is an ominous prognostic indicator for a lifetime of
      suffering and increased risk for suicide. Efforts should be directed toward novel
      interventions that could alter this perilous course. Theoretically, restoration of healthy
      development during this critical window would substantially improve outcomes over the
      lifespan.

      Ketamine is a noncompetitive, high-affinity antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type
      glutamate receptor that has long been used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in
      children and adults, and recently has been investigated for its rapid antidepressant effects.
      Randomized, double-blind, saline-controlled trials in adults with TRD have demonstrated that
      a single, subanesthetic infusion of intravenous (IV) ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes
      can produce a rapid (within 2 hours) antidepressant response (Ibrahim et al., 2011; Zarate et
      al., 2006). Recent evidence suggests that serial doses of ketamine may be even more effective
      and may lead to more prolonged remission (aan het Rot et al., 2010; Murrough et al., 2012).
      Our current research at using serial dosing of IV ketamine among adult veterans with TRD over
      a 2-week period has shown promising results, with a response rate of 92% among the 12
      participants to date.

      No results from any studies examining effectiveness of either single-dose or serial-dose
      ketamine have yet been published in adolescents with TRD. Because of the ongoing
      neurodevelopment in adolescence, which is thought to confer enhanced neuroplasticity, it is
      possible that adolescents with TRD could show greater responses and more sustained remission
      than adults with TRD. The biological mechanisms of depression impacted by ketamine are only
      now being uncovered in adults (Zarate et al., 2013). Characterization of the neural
      mechanisms underlying ketamine response or non-response in adolescents with TRD will
      represent a significant advance. The specific aims of this preliminary study are as follows:

      Aim #1: To determine the efficacy of repeated-dose subanesthetic IV ketamine among adolescent
      patients with TRD.

      Hypothesis: Based on previous results in adults with TRD, we predict that response rates will
      improve over the course of six treatments of ketamine.

      Aim #2: To explore durability of antidepressant response to repeated dose of IV ketamine in a
      4-week observational period.

      Hypothesis: Based on the inherent neuroplasticity in adolescence due to ongoing
      neurodevelopment, adolescents may show a more durable clinical response than has been seen in
      adults.

      Aim #3: To study the neurobiological mechanisms of response to ketamine. We will examine
      relevant biological systems using several different brain imaging indices and measures of
      intracellular functioning from peripheral blood.

    <measure>Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDRS-R measure is given in interview form to child and parent separately. A consensus is then created with best-estimate for 17 items (each with a range of 1-5 or 1-7) using both sources of information. The total score is the sum of 17 item scores, ranging from 17-113 with higher scores indicating greater depression symptoms.</description>

Items are rated on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extreme). Total scores are a sum of the 27 item scores and range from 0 to 108, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>

          <title>Socioeconomic Status (SES)</title>
          <description>SES was measured using the Hollingshead Four Factor Index of Socioeconomic Status, an instrument measuring the marital status, retired/employed status, educational attainment, and occupational prestige of the parents of child participants. Parent education is rated on a 7-point scale. Parent occupation is coded on a 9-point scale. Education and occupation scores are then weighted to obtain a single score for each parent (range 8 to 66). For households with 2 parents, scores are averaged. Higher scores indicate greater socioeconomic status (more financial and social resources).</description>

        <title>Change in Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS)</title>
        <description>CADSS is a 27-item instrument measuring symptoms of dissociative stress, with 19 items completed by the patient and 8 items completed by the clinician. Items are rated on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extreme). Total scores are a sum of the 27 item scores and range from 0 to 108, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>
