  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to characterize the relationship between changes in emotional distress,
      opioid use, and pain throughout surgery and recovery. Additionally, the investigators aim to
      compare the effectiveness of post-surgical motivational interviewing and physician-guided
      opioid weaning vs. usual care on reducing persistent opioid use. Overall, the proposed
      research will advance knowledge regarding the role of psychological factors contributing to
      persistent opioid use after surgery.
