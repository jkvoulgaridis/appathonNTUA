      To investigate the effect of nurse led follow up talks to prevent posttraumatic stress (PTS)
      symptoms and improve quality of life and sence of coherence after an intensive care unit
      (ICU) stay.

      Secondly:

      Investigate level of psychological distress, quality of life, hope and work participation in
      ICU patients after an ICU stay and factors associated with these outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ICU patient experiences total dependence on health care professionals and technical
      devices. Some patients report unpleasant memories such as pain, feeling helpless, or
      delusional experiences from the ICU stay and many report physical or mental symptoms after
      discharge from the ICU. Return to work rate after ICU treatment differs. Most ICU patients
      receive analgesics and sedatives to relieve pain and discomfort during the stay. Thus many
      patients have few memories from their time being critically ill. For patients with few
      memories from the ICU stay this represents an interruption in the patient's life history.
      Since personal identity is influenced by the stories we tell about ourselves, loss of memory
      from a period with critical illness might be experienced as a threat towards self-confidence
      and sense of coherence. Some patients with traumatic memories from the ICU develop PTS
      symptoms after discharge.

      In order to help the earlier ICU patient to achieve a life with less physical and mental
      complaints, some ICUs have established a follow up program in outpatient clinics after
      discharge from hospital, but there is sparse evidence of the effectiveness of this
      intervention, and what type of follow up that best help the patients.

      The primary aim of the study is to:

      Investigate if a group of previous intensive care patients receiving nurse led follow up
      talks three times after discharge from the ICU have less post traumatic stress symptoms,
      pain, increased sense of coherence and, work participation and health related quality of life
      (HRQL) three, six and twelve months after discharge from the ICU compared to a control group
      receiving standard care.

      Secondary aim:

      Investigate level and predictors of anxiety, depression, PTS symptoms, hope, pain, HRQOL and
      work participation in intensive care patients ICU patients first year after discharge from
      ICU.

    <intervention_model_description>Those who give their written informed consent will fill out the Post Traumatic Stress Scale 10 Intensive care screen (PTSS 10-I) Patients with a score equal or above 25 (indicating suffering from PTS symptoms) will be randomized to intervention or control group. Randomization will be performed using the computer program WebCRFNTNU. Patients who score below 25 will be included in an observation group and receive questionnaires at the same time points as the intervention and control group.
To be able to detect a difference of 10 between the groups as significant with 80% power and allow for 20% dropout, a total of 250 patients with PTS-10 score like or above 25 have to be included in the randomized part of the study. In the autum 2016 a new statistician in the procject recalculated the power and found the need for 134 randomized patients. The inclusion was then terminated.</intervention_model_description>
