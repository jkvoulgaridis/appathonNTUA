    <textblock>
      In this study, we test whether a two-week 8-session neutral attention bias modification (ABM)
      training and a two-week 4-session positive ABM could reduce depressive symptoms relative to
      placebo controls in adolescents with major depressive disorder at posttraining and follow-ups
      during one year.

      Depression is a common health problem in adolescents. Negative attentional bias has been
      theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of depression, suggesting that
      reduction of such biases may treat symptoms of depression. Recent studies have shown that
      attention bias modification(ABM) training could reduce depressive symptoms in both dysphoria
      and previously depressed adult patients.To test the effectiveness of ABM training on the
      treatment of depressive symptoms in depressed adolescents, we designed a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo controlled trial in adolescents with major depressive disorder(MDD).

    <description>Attention bias modification training (ABMT) is a a variation of attention tasks to modify attentional biases, in which a probe always appears in the location of relatively positive stimuli after the two stimuli, one neutral and one emotional, were simultaneously presented.
Participants complete 8 sessions (320 trials each with 20 minutes) over two weeks of neutral ABMT to shift attention toward neutral, in which a probe appeared in the location of neutral with 90% probability, and sadness-related with 10% probality. At a 9-week follow-up, participants completed 4 more sessions (480 trials each with 30 minutes)over two weeks of positive ABMT to shift attention toward positive words,in which a probe appeared in the location of 67% positive or 33% neutral.</description>
