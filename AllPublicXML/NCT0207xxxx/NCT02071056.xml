  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether the DNA from cancer tumor cells can be found in
      the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) that bathes the brain and spinal cord of patients before
      malignant the cancer cells themselves are able to be found in the CSF. The researchers doing
      this study hope this information can be used to develop a way to diagnose LM earlier .

    <textblock>
      The contents of dead/dying tumor cells can be detected in the bloodstream, and this may be
      enhanced by the leaky vasculature of solid tumors. Circulating tumor DNA has been detected in
      plasma from patients with osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, and in
      cerebrospinal fluid from patients with cancer-associated neoplastic meningitis. Until
      recently, it was impractical to develop an assay to routinely quantify circulating tumor DNA
      due to heterogeneity between patients and tumors. Advances in genomic technology now permit
      sequencing a tumor genome to identify patient-specific genomic aberrations. Major genomic
      alterations (i.e., insertions, amplifications, deletions, inversions, translocations) can be
      readily detected using PCR primers and probes which will recognize tumor DNA but not normal
      DNA, permitting creation of a personalized assay to quantify tumor DNA levels in bodily
      fluids. We therefore propose a pilot study to determine whether circulating tumor DNA levels
      increase in CSF prior to cytological evidence of LM in patients with a history of cancer
      originating from a visceral organ.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must have a previously diagnosed solid tumor malignancy originating from a
             visceral organ (i.e., outside of the CNS), and present with signs and/or symptoms
             consistent with carcinomatous meningitis (headache, vision dysfunction, hearing loss,
             cranial nerve deficit, cognitive dysfunction, focal weakness or numbness suggestive of
             cranial neuropathy or radiculopathy, cauda equine syndrome, meningismus, and/or bowel
             or bladder dysfunction).

          2. Age ≥ 18 years.

          3. Patients will meet accepted standard of care and follow FDA guidance for low molecular
             weight heparin use prior to lumbar puncture, specifically INR &lt; 1.4 and PT within
             normal range for DHMC laboratory, and platelet count &gt;50,000. For enoxaparin use,
             delay of Lumbar puncture to allow at least 12 hours after administration of
             prophylactic doses, such as those used for prevention of deep vein thrombosis. Longer
             delays (24 hours) are appropriate to consider for patients receiving higher
             therapeutic doses of enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily). A
             postprocedure dose of enoxaparin should usually be given no sooner than 4 hours after
             lumbar puncture. Aspirin and other antiplatelet therapy is permitted without timing
             constraints prior to or after lumbar puncture.

          4. Patient must consent to provide up to additional CSF (10 mL) and blood (10 mL) when
             these fluids are drawn as part of clinically indicated procedures.

          5. Patient must consent to permit genetic analysis of their cancer.

          6. Patient capable of giving informed consent.

          7. MRI of clinically symptomatic area (spine and/or brain) and/or head CT within the last
             3 months to exclude brain disease that would contraindicate lumbar puncture.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of a CNS mass creating mass‐effect or midline shift such that lumbar puncture
             is contraindicated.

          2. Previous or current hematological malignancy.

          3. Previous or current primary CNS malignancy.

          4. Prior treatment for CNS metastasis.

          5. Known CNS autoimmune or inflammatory disease (i.e., Multiple Sclerosis,
             neurosarcoidosis, chronic fungal, rickettsial or bacterial meningitis).

          6. Patient is currently receiving treatment for LM.

          7. Patient was previously diagnosed with LM.
