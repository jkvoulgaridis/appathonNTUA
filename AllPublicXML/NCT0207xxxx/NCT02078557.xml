      This study will assess multiple doses of MK-8892 administered to participants with pulmonary
      hypertension &quot;out of proportion&quot; (PHOOP) and heart failure with reduced left ventricular
      ejection fraction (rEF). It is hypothesized that generally safe and well tolerated multiple
      doses of MK-8892 will achieve a true reduction from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance
      (PVR) greater than 12%.

      Sixteen participants with PHOOP/rEF were to receive multiple doses of MK-8892 titrated to the
      highest tolerated dose for each participant (up to 4 mg daily), and to undergo evaluation for
      safety and systemic hemodynamics and cardiac function. Only 4 participants were enrolled and
      completed the study due to a strategic business decision by the sponsor to terminate the
      clinical conduct of all MK-8892 ongoing trials including this trial.

    <description>Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is the general pressure which the right ventricle must counteract to pump blood through the lungs. PVR was measured by right heart catheterization performed prior to dosing at baseline (Day 1) and 4 hours postdose on Day 28. Percentage change in PVR from baseline at Day 28 was calculated as [(Baseline-Day 28)/Baseline]. Standard deviation is reported as a percentage.</description>
