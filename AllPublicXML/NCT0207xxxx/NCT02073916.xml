      This open-label, single-center Phase Ib study will assess the safety and tolerability of
      combining trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with Lapatinib and Abraxane in patients with
      metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will receive Abraxane on Day 1 of each
      1-week cycle and T-DM1 on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Patients with take Lapatinib orally
      daily. Patients will receive the study treatment for 12 weeks.
