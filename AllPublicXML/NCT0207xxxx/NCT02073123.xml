      To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the established dose of indoximod in combination with
      immune checkpoint inhibition as measured by the best overall response rate (ORR) (complete
      response (CR) + partial response (PR))across both standard of care agents administered
      sequentially in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of melanoma is increasing. Based upon data obtained between 2004 and 2006, the
      lifetime probability of developing melanoma in the United States is estimated to be 1 in 37
      for men and 1 in 56 for women. In the United States, melanoma is the fifth leading cancer in
      men and the seventh in women. Locally confined, fully-resectable disease may be curable with
      current therapy; but Stage IV metastatic disease (or relapsed/recurrent disease) is highly
      refractory to therapy. Thus, experimental clinical trials provide an accepted treatment
      option for metastatic or relapsed/refractory melanoma.

      The current study is designed as a prospective trial to evaluate the combination of indoximod
      and checkpoint inhibitors in adult patients with metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab,
      pembrolizumab and nivolumab will be used at the recommended approved doses for this
      indication.

      The current trial will be done in two phases: a Phase 1b dose escalation of indoximod in
      combination with ipilimumab, starting at half the recommended single-agent dose, to establish
      the recommended Phase 2 dose for the combination.

      This will be followed by a three arm expansion study testing a fixed dose of indoximod (at
      the recommended Phase 2 dose) combined with standard-dose ipilimumab, pembrolizumab or
      nivolumab.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigational or commercial
      cancer directed agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered.

      Safety assessment will follow the guidelines provided in the National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version.4.03.

      Patients will be followed both clinically and radiographically starting 12 weeks after
      initiation of treatment then every 8 weeks for tumor evaluation. Post-treatment scans will be
      compared to the baseline scan and responses will be assessed based using mWHO and immune
      related response criteria (irRC) described by Wolchok et al. (Wolchok et al., 2009).

    <description>Phase 1 component:
Evaluate the safety (adverse events - type, incidence, severity, duration, causality and treatment intervention) of the combination of indoximod and ipilimumab when given concomitantly.
The safety and tolerability ipilimumab followed by Indoximod will be assessed by listing the overall incidence of AEs. The AEs will be summarized and classified by body system and by treatment group. The type, incidence, severity, and causality of each AE, the duration of the event, and any required treatment interventions will be tabulated. Physical examination results will be presented in the patient data listings. The DLT will be listed per dose level and treatment along with overall frequencies. The data from the expansion part (Phase II) will be used for this part of safety and tolerability assessment.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2 Dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>22 months</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 1 component:
To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of indoximod in combination with ipilimumab in patients with unresectable melanoma.
A minimum of nine patients will be treated depending on DLT. Each dose will be administered to a cohort of 3 patients. If 0 out of 3 or less than 2 out of 6 patients experienced a DLT at any given dose level, the dose escalation will proceed to the next dose level. The MTD is generally the largest dose level at which at most 1 out of 6 patients experiences a DLT. IF DLT is not reached at the highest dose level (1200mg twice daily), no further escalation will proceed and this dose level will be declared the recommended Phase II dose</description>

Dose escalation:
If 0 of the 3 subjects forming the first cohort experience RLT, 1200mg BID cohort will be enrolled
If 1 of the 3 subjects in any cohort experiences a RLT, then enrollment into that cohort will increase to a total of 6 subjects
If &gt; 1 of the 3-6 subjects experience a RLT, then the MTD has been exceeded and further enrollment into the cohort will cease
If &gt;1 subject at 600mg BID experiences a RLT, the dose will be de-escalated to 400mg BID. If &gt;1 subject at this level experiences a RLT, one additional de-escalation to 200mg BID is allowed
Dosing cycles are 21 days in length during the combination immunotherapy component (first 4 cycles) and 28 days during indoximod monotherapy. Patients will continue until they experience disease progression or limiting toxicity
Phase 2 Treatment Plan (Cohort 2) Will receive fixed dose of indoximod determined in phase 1</description>

          -  Patients who have had prior therapy with immune checkpoint inhibition or or indoximod
             are excluded from the trial.

          -  Any other cancer, unless the patient has been disease-free for ≥5 years
