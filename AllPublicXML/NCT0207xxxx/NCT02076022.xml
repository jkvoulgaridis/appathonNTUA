  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a prospective, randomized clinical study to assess the efficacy of minimally
      invasive autologous fat transfer addressing pain and poor prosthetic fit at amputation sites.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that autologous fat grafting can provide a minimally invasive therapy
      facilitated by enabling technology of specialized instrumentation to effectively mitigate
      pain syndromes at amputation sites, by introducing volume stable subcutaneous tissue over
      bony prominences and peripheral nerve trunks, thereby avoiding surgical revisions and
      preserving limb length.

      We further hypothesize that enriching the fat graft with autologous adipose stromal cells
      utilizing the Tissue Gensis Cell Isolation System (CIS), a regenerative medicine approach,
      will lead to improved retention of the fat graft over time and result in a more favorable
      outcome.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Treat painful amputation sites in 30 patients with fat grafting to provide additional
           subcutaneous tissue padding over bony structures and nerve trunks. Limb anatomy and
           healing of the graft over time, along with stability/persistence of the new tissue, will
           be assessed by high resolution CT scanning with 3D reconstruction. Patients will be
           followed for 24 months after treatment to define long term outcomes. The primary outcome
           measures will be pain at the amputation site and improved ability to tolerate a
           prosthesis. Patients will be randomized to receive either standard fat grafting (15
           patients)or cell enriched fat grafting (15 patients). Patients will be enrolled who have
           pain at an amputation site that limits function and/or interferes with the ability to
           use a prosthesis.

        2. Assess biologic properties of the cells within the fat graft and correlate with clinical
           outcomes. This will include adipose stem cell yield per volume of fat tissue, cell
           proliferation, capacity for adipogenic differentiation, lipolysis, and cell
           sub-population analysis by multiparameter flow cytometry. Results of these assays will
           be correlated with graft volume retention to search for predictors of good clinical
           outcome that are related to variation on adipose biology between subjects.

        3. Measure quality of life in patients before and after autologous fat grafting using
           validated psychosocial measures. This will include, among other tools, SF 36, the Beck
           inventory, and instruments designed for assessing limb function.

      Study Design:

      Single center site, prospective, randomized, pilot outcomes study with treatment performed at
      the University of Pittsburgh.

      The primary outcome measurements will be: 1) fat graft retention at the amputation site; and
      2) improved ability to tolerate a prosthetic device. This study will examine if fat grafting
      with cell enrichment using the Tissue Gensis Cell Isolation System, (CIS) will demonstrate
      increased fat retention and decreased pain compared to standard fat grafting alone.

      Clinical Impact:

      This study will significantly impact military trauma care by validating a minimally invasive
      cell based technique for alleviating pain at amputation sites and improving function with a
      prosthesis. Importantly, the goal will be reached without invasive surgery, increased risk,
      and a prolonged recovery. Given the high amputation rate in the current conflicts, this work
      is highly relevant to the care of the wounded warrior. A major goal of this study will be to
      transfer the techniques and knowledge gained to physicians throughout the Department of
      Defense healthcare system.

             chemotherapy or radiation treatment

          -  Known coagulopathy symptoms /diagnosis

          -  Systemic disease that would render the fat harvest and injection procedure, along with
             associated anesthesia, unsafe to the patient (e.g., scleroderma, lupus, vasculatures,

          -  Subjects with an Axis I DSM-IV diagnosis (e.g., Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder) who
             are found to be clinically (i.e. medically) unstable at baseline. Individuals who
             manifest either: 1) evidence of currently active alcohol or psychoactive drug abuse or
             dependence on the SCID interview, or 2) a GAF score of 40 or lower due to any acute
             psychiatric symptomatology (e.g. suicidality, psychosis, severe depression or mania)
             will be reviewed by the Co-I for Psychosocial Assessment with the PI for determination
             of possible medical instability. Final determination of medically unstable status will
             be made by the PI on the basis of overall medical status and appropriateness for
             medical procedures; the patient may be considered ineligible for study participation
             per the Physician's discretion.

          -  Subjects with abnormal blood biochemistry or any other abnormal laboratory finding
             considered clinically significant in that it would deem the subject inappropriate for
             surgical procedures. This criterion will help to exclude subjects with severe
             nutritional deficiency, anemia, coagulopathy, renal and liver dysfunction, diabetes,
             and peripheral vascular disease, as determined by the investigator (i.e. CBC with
             Differential, platelets, comprehensive metabolic panel to include electrolytes,
             bun/creatinine, liver function test and coagulation tests). As general safety
             measures, we will exclude patients with lab values listed below: Hct less than 30% INR
             greater than 1.8 Creatinine greater than 2.0 Liver function tests (ALT, AST,
             Bilirubin) greater than 2 times upper limit Albumin- Less than 2.0 Platelets less than
             70

          -  Subjects who per the clinical discretion of the investigator, would not be appropriate
             for the study. (e.g. a potential medication and/ or medical diagnosis that is not
             captured in above exclusion, but which could render the subject's participation in the
             study unsafe, or would have an adverse effect on fat metabolism or fat healing).

It will be divided into small aliquots and centrifuged in a sterile rotor (3000 rpm for 3 minutes/1200g), and top fluid oil layer from the fat tissue fractions were removed, and transferred into 1ml syringes and injected into the amputation stump. This graft preparation will be performed in the operating room. Standard fat graft material will serve as a control treatment and will be injected into limb using specialized injection cannulas</description>

          <description>Enhanced Fat Grafting: The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cell suspension (device output) will be processed using the Tissue Genesis Cell Isolation System™
The Standard graft material and the stromal vascular fraction cells will be mixed and subsequently injected into the amputated stump at a concentration of 2.0 - 3.0 x 10 6 stromal vascular cells/ml of injected fat graft to each site. The volume of each injected fat graft will depend on the volume requirements for each injured extremity.
To manually combine the standard fat graft material and the SVF suspension (device output), each of the syringes will be connected via luer to luer lock. The contents of the lipoaspirate syringe are transferred to the SVF syringe and the cell suspension will be injected slowly back and forth between the two (2) syringes. The final 1 mL SVF-fat graft syringe is now considered cell-enriched and ready for injection into the subject.</description>

        <title>Efficacy of Autologous Fat Transfer at Pain Modulation at Respective Amputation Sites</title>
        <description>Assess the efficacy of minimally invasive autologous fat transfer at the amputation sites and the modulation of pain at the respective sites
Compare two minimally invasive techniques as an alternative to invasive operations, with the understanding that this therapy does not preclude more invasive procedures in the future. We further hypothesize that enriching the fat graft with autologous adipose stromal cells utilizing the Tissue Genesis Cell Isolation System (CIS), a regenerative medicine approach, will lead to improved retention of the fat graft over time and result in a more favorable outcome.
Subjects reported pain on a scale of 0-5 where 5 was the worst pain and 0 was no pain.</description>

This graft preparation will be performed in the operating room. Standard fat graft material will serve as a control treatment and will be injected into limb using specialized injection cannulas</description>

          <description>Enhanced Fat Grafting: The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cell suspension (device output) will be processed using the Tissue Genesis Cell Isolation System™
The Standard graft material and the stromal vascular fraction cells will be mixed and subsequently injected into the amputated stump at a concentration of 2.0 - 3.0 x 10 6 stromal vascular cells/ml of injected fat graft to each site. The volume of each injected fat graft will depend on the volume requirements for each injured extremity.
To manually combine the standard fat graft material and the SVF suspension (device output), each of the syringes will be connected via luer to luer lock. The contents of the lipoaspirate syringe are transferred to the SVF syringe and the cell suspension will be injected slowly back and forth between the two (2) syringes. The final 1 mL SVF-fat graft syringe is now considered cell-enriched and ready for injection into the subject.</description>
