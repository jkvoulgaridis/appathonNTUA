  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In partnership with patients, caregivers, advocacy groups and clinicians, the investigators
      plan to:

      Aim 1: Adapt and refine PREPARE in Spanish through cognitive interviews with Spanish-speaking
      Latinos and stakeholders.

      Aim 2: Conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of PREPARE plus a
      previously-tested, easy-to-read- AD (intervention) versus the AD alone (control) to:

      2a. Engage older Spanish-speaking Latinos in multiple ACP behaviors (i.e., identify and
      discuss wishes with surrogates and clinicians and complete ADs) measured by self-report,
      chart review, surrogate reports, and

      2b. Direct observation.

      2c. Improve self-efficacy and satisfaction with medical decision making.

      2d. Determine whether PREPARE efficacy varies by literacy, decision control preferences, and
      clinician-patient language concordance.

      Aim 3: Disseminate PREPARE with input from patients, surrogates, and stakeholders.

    <textblock>
      PREPARE is a website (www.prepareforyourcare.org) that teaches patients how to identify what
      is most important in life, how to communicate their preferences to clinicians and loved ones,
      and how to make informed decisions. It is written at a 5th grade level and includes
      voice-overs of text and closed captioning of videos that model advance care planning
      behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of PREPARE plus an easy-to-read
      advance directive, versus an advance directive alone, to improve patient engagement in
      multiple advance care planning behaviors including discussions with surrogate decision makers
      and clinicians in addition to advance directive completion. The investigators will also
      determine whether PREPARE can empower and activate patients within clinical encounters with
      their clinicians and help to decrease health disparities in advance care planning.

    <measure>New Advance Care Planning Documentation in the Medical Record at 15 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months after study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is documentation of advance care planning wishes in the medical record. ACP documentation for the purposes of this study includes the easy-to-read advance directive or other valid advance directives or living wills, a durable power of attorney for healthcare document (DPOAHC), a physicians orders for life sustaining treatment (POLST) form, or other documentation of patients wishes for medical care (ie, documentation of oral directives by a physician, or code status, such as full code or do not resuscitate or do not intubate orders or notes by a physician).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported Engagement in Advance Care Planning Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcomes were chosen to measure the full process of Advance Care Planning (ACP) using validated questionnaires, such as the patient-reported ACP Engagement Survey. This questionnaire includes both Behavior Change Process and ACP Action measures. Behavior Change Process measures include knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy, and readiness for several ACP actions. The Process measures are assessed on an average 5-point Likert scale with a low of 1 and a high of 5, with high scores indicating more ACP engagement. Action measures include ACP actions such as identifying a surrogate decision-maker, identifying values and goals for medical care, choosing the level of leeway in surrogate decision-making, discussing one's wishes with clinicians and surrogates, and documenting one's wishes in an advance directive. Action measures use &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; response options and are measured on a 0- to 25-point scale, where 0 is no action and 25 means they have engaged in more ACP actions.</description>

    <description>The PREPARE arm will review the PREPARE website plus the easy-to-read advance directive (AD). Participants will review PREPARE on their own for ≥20 minutes with staff present to answer questions. During PREPARE, participants answer preference questions and make an action plan (i.e., commitment to engage in advance care planning). To ensure home access to PREPARE content, participants will be given a website login and PREPARE content in digital video disc (DVD), booklet, and pamphlet format as well as the action plan and AD. One to three days before a primary care visit, the PREPARE arm will receive a reminder to come to their appointment and to bring their action plan.</description>

        <title>New Advance Care Planning Documentation in the Medical Record at 15 Months</title>
        <description>The primary outcome is documentation of advance care planning wishes in the medical record. ACP documentation for the purposes of this study includes the easy-to-read advance directive or other valid advance directives or living wills, a durable power of attorney for healthcare document (DPOAHC), a physicians orders for life sustaining treatment (POLST) form, or other documentation of patients wishes for medical care (ie, documentation of oral directives by a physician, or code status, such as full code or do not resuscitate or do not intubate orders or notes by a physician).</description>

To ensure home access to PREPARE content, participants were given a website login and PREPARE content in digital video disc (DVD), booklet, and pamphlet format as well as the action plan and AD. One to three days before a primary care visit, participants in the PREPARE arm received a reminder phone call to come to their primary care appointment and to bring their action plan.</description>

        <title>Self-reported Engagement in Advance Care Planning Behaviors</title>
        <description>Secondary outcomes were chosen to measure the full process of Advance Care Planning (ACP) using validated questionnaires, such as the patient-reported ACP Engagement Survey. This questionnaire includes both Behavior Change Process and ACP Action measures. Behavior Change Process measures include knowledge, contemplation, self-efficacy, and readiness for several ACP actions. The Process measures are assessed on an average 5-point Likert scale with a low of 1 and a high of 5, with high scores indicating more ACP engagement. Action measures include ACP actions such as identifying a surrogate decision-maker, identifying values and goals for medical care, choosing the level of leeway in surrogate decision-making, discussing one's wishes with clinicians and surrogates, and documenting one's wishes in an advance directive. Action measures use &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; response options and are measured on a 0- to 25-point scale, where 0 is no action and 25 means they have engaged in more ACP actions.</description>
