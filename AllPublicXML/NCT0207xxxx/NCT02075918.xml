      Purpose: To improve the diagnosis and assessment of severity of acute alcoholic hepatitis
      Participants: Patients admitted to one of ten centers with acute alcoholic hepatitis
      Procedures (methods): Consecutive patients admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis will be
      enrolled in an NIH U01 study of acute alcoholic hepatitis where liver tissue, blood and stool
      will be collected to discover and validate factors associated with diagnosis, severity of
      disease and survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of new targeted therapies for alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is one of the more
      urgent needs in clinical hepatology. To reach this goal, large multidisciplinary networks are
      required. The proposed initiative &quot;Integrated Approaches for Identifying Molecular Targets in
      Alcoholic Hepatitis&quot; (InTeam) will coordinate a multidisciplinary group composed of
      clinicians, physician-scientists, basic scientists and bioinformatics experts. The
      overarching hypothesis of InTeam is that the most rational way to provide a useful framework
      for future clinical trials in (AH) consists of the (i) determination of key drivers of the
      disease process, (ii) classification of molecular profiles and subtypes of AH, and (iii)
      identification of &quot;druggable&quot; targets based on both key drivers and molecular classification.
      Moreover, mouse models for AH are lacking making it impossible to evaluate promising targets
      in preclinical mouse studies in a meaningful manner. For this purpose, InTeam will integrate
      data obtained from molecular pathology studies in human AH and functional studies of key
      pathways in animal models. The proposed InTeam consortium includes three research projects,
      ten clinical centers, a Human Biorepository and a Mouse Models Core. The Human Biorepository
      Core will generate the to-date largest collection of samples from patients with AH from 10
      academic liver centers and a comprehensive database that will serve as a basis for the
      proposed translational studies and be a valuable asset for the broader scientific community.
      The Mouse Models core will conduct murine studies after establishing and evaluating mouse
      models of AH based on the pathophysiology and molecular drivers of human AH determined by
      this consortium.
