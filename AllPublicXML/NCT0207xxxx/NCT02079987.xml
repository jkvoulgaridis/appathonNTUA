  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if assigning older, chronically ill patients a
      healthcare coach after they leave the Emergency Department (ED) improves their quality of
      life and reduces the need for hospital-based care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will review the ED electronic medical record in real-time to determine ED
      patients' study eligibility. Older, chronically ill ED patients who are eligible and agree to
      participate in the study will be randomly assigned to a healthcare coach and Care Transition
      Intervention or usual, post-ED care.

      At the time of enrollment, all subjects will be asked to provide informed consent for study
      investigators to request Medicare Claims to determine how many ED visits, hospital admissions
      and doctor office visits the subject had at least 30 days after the index ED visit. All
      research participants will be asked basic personal information such as age, race, sex,
      employment and marital status. All subjects will be asked to complete a baseline survey about
      their quality of life.

      If the subject is assigned to the Care Transition Intervention, the healthcare coach will
      visit the subject at home within 3 days of the ED visit. The coach will talk with the subject
      about following up with a regular, personal doctor and symptoms that indicate a worsening
      health condition. The coach will help the subject understand their medicines and help the
      subject make a personal health record (PHR). The coach will tell the subject about the Area
      Agency on Aging. If the subject receives usual care, they but will be given the usual
      discharge instructions from the ED nurse and doctor. If the subject receives the Care
      Transition Intervention, the coach will also call the subject at least 3 times after the ED
      visit and review the same items listed above.

      All enrolled subjects will be asked to complete a phone survey within 31-60 days of the ED
      visit. This survey will again ask subjects about their quality of life.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Function Between Baseline and 60 Days Post-ED Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 60 days after index ED Visit</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Physical Function instruments measure self-reported capability. Each of 7-items in the physical function instrument used in this study has five response items ranging in value from one to five. Thus, the minimum score for the Physical Function Instrument used is 7 and the maximum score is 35. The raw score is translated to a T-score using PROMIS conversion tables. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For positively-worded concepts like Physical Function, a T-score of 60 is one SD better than average. A Physical Function T-score of 40 is one SD worse than average. Change in Physical Function is the difference between baseline and 60 day T-score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Anxiety Between Baseline and 60 Days Post-ED Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 60 days after index ED Visit</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Anxiety instruments measure self-reported fear, anxious misery, and hyperarousal. Each of 8-items in the Anxiety Instrument used in this study has five response items ranging in value from one to five. Thus, the minimum score for the Anxiety Instrument used is 8 and the maximum score is 40. The raw score is translated to a T-score using PROMIS conversion tables. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For negatively-worded concepts like Anxiety, a T-score of 60 is one SD worse than average and an Anxiety T-score of 40 is one SD better than average.</description>

    <measure>Change in Informational Support Between Baseline and 60 Days Post-ED Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 60 days after index ED Visit</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Informational Support instruments measure perceived availability of helpful information or advice. Each of 5-items in the Informational Support Instrument used in this study has five response items ranging in value from one to five. Thus, the minimum score for the Informational Support Instrument used is 5 and the maximum score is 25. The raw score is translated to a T-score using PROMIS conversion tables. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For positively-worded concepts like Informational Support, a T-score of 60 is one SD better than average and a T-score of 40 is one SD worse than average.</description>

        <title>Change in Physical Function Between Baseline and 60 Days Post-ED Visit</title>
        <description>PROMIS Physical Function instruments measure self-reported capability. Each of 7-items in the physical function instrument used in this study has five response items ranging in value from one to five. Thus, the minimum score for the Physical Function Instrument used is 7 and the maximum score is 35. The raw score is translated to a T-score using PROMIS conversion tables. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For positively-worded concepts like Physical Function, a T-score of 60 is one SD better than average. A Physical Function T-score of 40 is one SD worse than average. Change in Physical Function is the difference between baseline and 60 day T-score.</description>

During each contact, the patient advocate reviews the four components of the Care Transition Intervention: 1: Follow-up Medical Visit. 2: Knowledge of Red Flag Symptoms. 3: Medication Reconciliation. 4: The Personal Health Record (PHR).
