  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To satisfy a postmarketing requirement, the sponsor has been requested to conduct a Phase
      1/Phase 2 single-group clinical study to investigate the pharmacokinetics and preliminary
      safety and efficacy of omacetaxine following a fixed-dose administration to patients with CP
      or AP CML who have failed 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the trial was not feasible due to the inability to accrue additional clinical study
      sites and enroll an adequate number of subjects, the FDA released the sponsor from the
      postmarketing requirement on 13 November 2017 and the study was stopped prematurely.
      Therefore, the study did not progress to the Phase 2 portion.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved a Major Response at Any Time During Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Month 15 (longest treatment duration)</time_frame>
    <description>The Independent Data Monitoring Committee assessments are summarized. Major response for participants with chronic phase CML was a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) defined as a complete cytogenetic response with no Ph+ metaphases, or a partial cytogenetic response with up to 35% Ph+ metaphases. Note that a complete hematologic response was not considered a major response.
Major response for participants with accelerated phase CML was a major hematologic response (MaHR) defined as a complete hematologic response or no evidence of leukemia, and/or a major cytogenic response (MCyR).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Longest Duration of Response At Study Termination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 541 (longest progression/survival follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was defined for responders as the time interval from the first reported date of a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) or a major hematologic response (MaHR) to the earliest date of objective evidence of disease progression (ie, development of accelerated-phase CML), relapse (ie, loss of complete hematologic or major cytogenetic response), or death. Kaplan-Meier estimates for duration of response were not performed due the small enrollment population and early termination of the study. What is reported is the longest duration of response observed prior to disease progression, death, lost to follow-up or study termination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had a Molecular Response at Any Time During Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Month 15</time_frame>
    <description>Molecular response was defined by the decrease in the amount of BCR-ABL (an abnormality of chromosome 22) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or by the actual percentage of BCR-ABL mRNA transcripts (ratio of BCR-ABL transcript numbers to the number of control gene transcripts).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Were Alive and Progression-Free at Study Termination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 541 (longest progression/survival follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time interval from the date of first dose to the date of the earliest objective evidence of disease progression (ie, development of accelerated-phase CML), relapse (ie, loss of complete hematologic or major cytogenetic response), or death. Kaplan-Meier estimates for time for progression-free survival were not performed due the small enrollment population and early termination of the study. What is reported is the number of participants who were alive and progression-free at the time of study termination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Were Alive at Study Termination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 541 (longest progression/survival follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time interval from the date of the first dose to the date of death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier time estimates for overall survival were not performed due to the small enrollment population and early termination of the study. What is reported is the number of participants who were alive at the time of study termination.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 14 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia were screened for enrollment into this study. Of the 4 patients who were not enrolled, 2 were excluded on the basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria and 2 for “other” reasons.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 14 patients screened, 9 patients at 3 centers in the US and 1 patient at a single centre in France met entry criteria and were considered to be eligible for enrollment into the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants whose body surface area (BSA) is less than 1.7 m^2. All participants were given a fixed dose of 2.5 mg omacetaxine by subcutaneous injection twice daily.

[Cycle 1 was an exception since participants were not dosed a second time on Day 1, nor at all on Days 2+3 to accommodate the PK study objective.] Participants then received maintenance cycles of 7 days twice daily treatment followed by 21 days without treatment (1 maintenance cycle) for as long as they continued to benefit up to a period of 12 months following the first dose.</description>

        <description>The Independent Data Monitoring Committee assessments are summarized. Major response for participants with chronic phase CML was a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) defined as a complete cytogenetic response with no Ph+ metaphases, or a partial cytogenetic response with up to 35% Ph+ metaphases. Note that a complete hematologic response was not considered a major response.
Major response for participants with accelerated phase CML was a major hematologic response (MaHR) defined as a complete hematologic response or no evidence of leukemia, and/or a major cytogenic response (MCyR).</description>

        <title>Longest Duration of Response At Study Termination</title>
        <description>Duration of response was defined for responders as the time interval from the first reported date of a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) or a major hematologic response (MaHR) to the earliest date of objective evidence of disease progression (ie, development of accelerated-phase CML), relapse (ie, loss of complete hematologic or major cytogenetic response), or death. Kaplan-Meier estimates for duration of response were not performed due the small enrollment population and early termination of the study. What is reported is the longest duration of response observed prior to disease progression, death, lost to follow-up or study termination.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE that that began or worsened after treatment with study drug. Severity rating of 3=Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening 4=Life-threatening consequences and 5=Death. Relation to study drug is determined by the investigator. A serious adverse event (SAE) includes death, a life-threatening AE, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or any important medical event requiring immediate intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above.</description>
