  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab and bendamustine
      treatment in participants with refractory or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
      Participants receive up to six 28-day cycles of treatment. Treatment consists of intravenous
      (IV) administration of obinutuzumab and bendamustine. Treatment time is expected to last 6
      months, and participant follow-up will last 2 years.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as AEs. An SAE was any AE that was any of the following: fatal, life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, and was considered a significant medical event by the investigator.</description>

DP: at least one of the following characteristics: increase ≥ 50% in lymphocytes up to at least 5 x 10^9/L, appearance of new palpable lymph nodes, increase ≥ 50% of the longest diameter of any previous area of clinically significant lymphadenopathy, increase ≥ 50% of the size of the liver and/or spleen, transformation to a more aggressive histology, after treatment progression of any cytopenia: decrease of hemoglobin levels of more than 20 g/L or to below 100 g/L and/or decrease of platelet counts by more than 50% or to below 100 x 10^9/L and/or decrease in the neutrophil counts by more than 50% or to below 1.0 x 10^9/L if the marrow biopsy also shows infiltration of clonal chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as AEs. An SAE was any AE that was any of the following: fatal, life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, and was considered a significant medical event by the investigator.</description>
