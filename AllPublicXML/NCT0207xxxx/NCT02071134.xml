      The purpose of this registry is to compile characteristics of world-wide outcomes for the use
      of Boston Scientific's commercially available Vercise DBS system in the treatment of
      Parkinson's disease.

      Additionally, the utilization of Guide XT (GXT) System when used as a planning tool for the
      programming of patients with the Boston Scientific's Vercise DBS Systems is also evaluated.
