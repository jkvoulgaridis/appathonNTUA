    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to analyse :

        -  Psychic experience of ear aplasia in children ;

        -  the modalities of their psychic functioning ;

        -  and the psychological repercussions of the plastic reconstruction surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with an ear aplasia have various cares (ENT, speech therapy, hearing aids and
      tomodensiometry) up to the proposal of the plastic reconstruction surgery at 9/10 years old.

      The surgical technique used and preferred within Necker Hospital for these children is that
      of Saturo Nagata (1994).

      This surgical protocol takes place in two times, spaced by 9 months. This surgery does not
      allow hearing better since it targets is only a reconstruction of the pinna. To date, no
      research has highlighted the subjective experience of a child with an aplasia of ear and of
      what this surgery engages and demands on the side of psychological work.

      The purpose of this research is to interrogate the children's subjective experience with an
      unilateral ear aplasia and who wishes a plastic reconstruction surgery for their aplase ear.

    <measure>Hermann Rorschach test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Hermann Rorschach test (1927) Test or projected test composed of 10 boards. Analysis by the psychogram (following the Chabert method).
Psychic functioning of the child by description of: the mechanisms of defenses, the type of anxiety, the affective tone and the image of the body. The capacity to give adapted responses according to the boards as well as the narrative capacity of the child will make it possible to release tracks as for its psychic functioning.</description>

    <measure>Thematic Apperception Test</measure>

    <description>TAT: Thematic Apperception Test by MURRAY H.A. (1935) Projective test where the boards are different from the sex of the child (boy 13 boards, girls 14 boards).
Quantitative analysis using the 4-dimensional tabulation sheet :
Series A: Rigidity
Series B: Lability
Series C: Conflict Avoidance
Series E: Emergencies of Primary Processes
Psychic functioning of the child by description of: the mechanisms of defenses, the type of anxiety, the affective tone and the image of the body.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>CDI: Inventory of Childhood Depression by M. Kovcas &amp; A.T. Beck (1977) L.MOOR and C.MACK.
Scale from 7 to 17 years. The score ranges from 0 to 54. The scale of rating goes from 0 to 2 with an alternation in the quotation of the articles so that the subject is not influenced by a same scheme of proposal by item.
A score greater than or equal to 15 would be synonymous with depression but confirmed in clinical interview.</description>

    <measure>KIDSCREEN-27</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>KIDSCREEN-27 from Kidscreen group europe (2006) -42 authors in all- The KIDSCREEN-27 is scored on a 5 point scale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = moderately, 4 = a lot, 5 = extremely).
Assessement of quality of life in children.
The score can be calculated for each dimension:
Physical activities and health - 5 items;
The mood in general and the feeling - 7 elements;
Family life and free time - 7 articles;
Friends (social support and peers) - 4 elements;
At school (School Environment) - 4 elements.</description>
