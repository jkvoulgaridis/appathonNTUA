  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Baduanjin seems to be effective for improving body mass index and fasting sugar in male
      individuals with schizophrenia.

      Aim This study was to explore the effect of Baduanjin on the five metabolic parameters and
      body mass index in participants with chronic schizophrenia.

      Methods We recruited 92 participants from 3 chronic wards and nursing homes in eastern and
      northern Taiwan. Participants were assigned by blocked randomization into experimental group
      and control group. Those in the experimental group received 60 minutes, three times a week
      for 12 weeks of Baduanjin program training, while those in the control group received
      physical activity for thirty minutes. We collected the blood pressure, fasting blood sugar,
      triglyceride, high density cholesterol, waist circumference, and body mass index three times:
      before the intervention, end of the intervention immediately and 3-month follow up.
      Chi-squared and independent samples t test were used to compare the groups differences in the
      demographic characteristics and outcome indicators at the baseline for male and female
      separately. Demographic variables were controlled. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)
      were used to examine the effects of groups, time, group and time interaction by sex.

      This study explored the effect of Baduanjin on metabolic parameters and body mass index in
      people with schizophrenia. We recruited 92 participants from 3 rehabilitation units in
      Taiwan. Participants were assigned by blocked randomization into an experimental group or
      control group. Those in the experimental group received 60 minutes of Baduanjin three times a
      week for 12-weeks, while those in the control group received physical activity for thirty
      minutes. We assessed five metabolic parameters and body mass index at three timepoints:
      baseline, posttest and 3-month follow up.

    <description>The entire program continued for 6 months (March to October 2016), and the intervention was performed for 60 min 3 times for 12-weeks ; particular attention was paid to the disease characteristics of the patients with chronic schizophrenia and to preventing excessive fatigue. Every session began with a 20-min warm-up, followed by 20 min of Baduanjin program, and ended with a cool-down session. The participants were instructed, with the assistance of a video, to practice Baduanjin program in a group by two authors who are experienced in the psychiatric nurses and had been trained in this program.</description>
