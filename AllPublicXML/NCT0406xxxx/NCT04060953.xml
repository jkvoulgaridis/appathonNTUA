  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of a health-related quality of life report based on the SPADE
      cluster (sleep disturbance, pain interference with activities, anxiety, depression, and low
      energy/fatigue) derived from the PROMIS-29 instrument in patients with chronic low back pain.
      Half of the participants will receive the report, while the other half will not.

    <textblock>
      The health-related quality of life report provides participants with an overall score on the
      SPADE cluster and scores on each of its five component scales. The recently released Federal
      Pain Research Strategy states that pain cannot be measured in isolation, but rather should be
      assessed in conjunction with other outcome measures in 'non-pain domains,' such as quality of
      life. It recognizes that pain may be affected by, and affect, such patient attributes as
      sleep, mood, cognition, function, and quality of life. Further, the report states that
      improvement in pain without concomitant improvement in other domains may not constitute a
      clinically meaningful outcome. This study aims to assess the utility of a health-related
      quality of life report in improving quality of life, back pain intensity, and back-related
      disability in participants with chronic low back pain.

    <description>SPADE Cluster Score (acronym represents Sleep Disturbance, Pain Interference, Anxiety, Depression, and Low Energy/Fatigue subscales derived from the PROMIS-29). Each raw subscale score ranges from 4 to 20. Each subscale raw score is then converted to a population-normed &quot;t-score,&quot; with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. The SPADE Cluster Score is then computed as the mean of these five subscale t-scores. Higher t-scores on the SPADE Cluster and each of its component scales represent worse outcomes.</description>
