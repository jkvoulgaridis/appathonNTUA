    <textblock>
      This randomized phase 2 study will evaluate 2 novel immunotherapy combinations in which
      pembrolizumab is integrated with ramucirumab and paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric
      and GEJ adenocarcinoma. A total of 58 patients will be enrolled to the study. Each arm will
      have 26 patients. Although the study has a randomized design, patients in both arms will
      receive study drug (pembrolizumab).

    <description>All patients receive pembrolizumab monotherapy (generally once every 3 weeks). Then this is followed by ramucirumab + paclitaxel (study drug[s] are generally given once per week). As study treatment moves forward, a patient-tailored disease-specific algorithm is applied in which pembrolizumab is re-introduced and integrated with ramucirumab + paclitaxel if clinical benefit is anticipated.
NOTE: All registered patients receive pembrolizumab, then patients are randomized to Arm A (ramucirumab + paclitaxel with patient-tailored disease-specific potential re-introduction of pembrolizumab with ramucirumab + paclitaxel) or Arm B (concurrent pembrolizumab with ramucirumab + paclitaxel)</description>

          -  Other active malignancy which requires current treatment and which in the opinion of
             the site investigator is likely to interfere with evaluation of disease assessment.
