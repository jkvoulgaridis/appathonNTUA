    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well azacitidine and venetoclax work in treating patients
      with high risk acute myeloid leukemia that is in remission. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as azacitidine and venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      treated with 5-azacytidine (azacitidine; AZA) combined with venetoclax (VEN) as maintenance
      therapy after achieving remission.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess modified RFS of pts with AML treated with 5-azacytidine combined with venetoclax
      as maintenance therapy.

      II. To assess overall survival (OS) of pts with AML treated with 5-azacytidine combined with
      venetoclax as maintenance therapy.

      III. To assess event-free survival (EFS) of pts with AML treated with 5-azacytidine combined
      with venetoclax as maintenance therapy.

      IV. To assess the duration of remission (CRd) of pts with AML treated 5-azacytidine combined
      with venetoclax as maintenance therapy.

      V. To assess toxicity and safety of 5-azacytidine combined with venetoclax as maintenance
      therapy in pts with AML.

      VI. To assess the effects of 5-azacytidine combined with venetoclax on dynamics of minimal
      residual disease (MRD) and their relationship to outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 1 hour daily on
      days 1-5, and venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6-12
      months thereafter.
