    <textblock>
      ABNL-MARRO (A Basket study of Novel therapy for untreated MDS/MPN and Relapsed/Refractory
      Overlap Syndromes) is an international European-American cooperation providing the framework
      for collaborative studies to advance treatment of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative
      neoplasms (MDS/MPN) and explore clinical-pathologic markers of disease severity, prognosis
      and treatment response.

      ABNL MARRO 001 (AM-001) is an Open label, randomized phase 1/2 study within the framework of
      the ABNL-MARRO that will test novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPN. Each Arm of AM-001
      will test an active myeloid target compound in combination with ASTX727, an oral drug
      combining fixed doses of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) decitabine and the
      cytidine deaminase inhibitor E7727, also known as cedazuridine in a single tablet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AM-001 is the first clinical study to be conducted within the infrastructure of ABNL MARRO in
      conjunction with the MDS/MPN IWG. AM-001 will include three treatment Arms. Each Arm tests
      ASTX727 in combination with a novel targeted agent. Additional Arms may be added as new
      treatment compounds/alternative treatment combinations complete safety testing in Phase 1
      studies in myeloid diseases.

      Current Arms of AM-001 include: Arm 1: ASTX727 + itacitinib (INCB039110; JAK1 inhibitor); Arm
      2: ASTX727 + INCB053914 (Pan-PIM inhibitor); Arm 3: ASTX727 + INCB059872 (LSD1 inhibitor)

      Primary Objective Phase 1:

      - Characterize the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of each novel oral targeted agent in
      combination with oral ASTX727 in order to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and
      schedule.

      Primary Objective Phase 2:

      - To test whether the overall response to each novel ASTX727 combination therapy in MDS/MPN
      patients is sufficiently high to warrant further investigation in more definitive trials.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To expand the safety analysis of each treatment combination in MDS/MPN patients.

        -  To assess the morphologic bone marrow response in MDS/MPN patients treated on each Arm
           of the study.

        -  To estimate the effect of each treatment combination on patient survival

        -  To test the applicability of the proposed MDS/MPN IWG response criteria across multiple
           Arms of this study.

      Tertiary/Exploratory objectives:

        -  To investigate genetic biomarkers of response in MDS/MPN.

        -  To characterize molecular responses to individual treatments.

        -  To evaluate synergistic effects of hypomethylation by ASTX727 and specific pathway
           blockade by study compounds.

        -  To explore the use of automated quantification of spleen volume from CT exams as a
           measure of clinical benefit

        -  To test and/or validate diagnostic algorithms and prognostic indices for MDS/MPN
           patients

        -  To investigate the correlation of patient reported outcomes with disease severity and/or
           treatment response

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF); must
             voluntarily sign an ICF; and must be willing and able to meet all study requirements.

          -  Must have morphologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS/MPN, excluding JMML, in
             accordancewith WHO (2016) diagnostic criteria.

          -  Treatment-naïve patients (patients who have had no prior disease-modifying therapy)
             may enroll in any AM-001 Arm that is open to accrual in phase 1 or phase 2.
             Treatment-naïve patients may have received recombinant erythropoietin, danazol,
             hydroxyurea or anagrelide, which are not considered to be disease-modifying therapy
             for the purpose of this study.

          -  After an appropriate wash-out period, patients who have failed (or were intolerant to)
             prior therapy with a regimen(s) containing a DNMTi may enroll in any Arm in phase 1b
             or any Arm which has met the criterion of the first Simon's Stage and are open to
             accrual in the second Simon's Stage in phase 2. Except in the first stage of the phase
             2, there are no limits on number of prior therapies if the patient meets all other
             eligibility criteria. Previously treated patients include:

               -  Patients treated with DNMTi therapy prior to enrollment in AM-001 who failed to
                  achieve a complete remission, per the MDS/MPN IWG response criteria, after at
                  least 4 cycles of DNMTi therapy

               -  ;Patients enrolled in AM-001, or patients treated off-study with a regimen
                  containing a DNMTi, who have definitive disease progression as defined in the
                  protocol after at least 2 cycles of the prior therapy—this includes patients who
                  fail to achieve a response with clearly progressive disease and patients who
                  achieve an initial response who then lose that response;

               -  Patients enrolled in AM-001 who have stable disease as best response at the
                  second response evaluation after 6 cycles of the prior AM-001 therapy;

               -  Patients treated on AM-001 who had and recovered from an adverse event that
                  precludes further therapy on that Arm; after recovery from a toxicity that is
                  likely to be related to ASTX727, enrollment in another AM-001 may occur provided
                  that dose modifications are made as appropriate.

          -  Must be willing to undergo bone marrow biopsy with aspiration during screening and
             bone marrow aspiration with tissue collection for disease assessment and correlative
             studies periodically throughout the trial.

             due to prior systemic treatments, excluding alopecia.

          -  Must have adequate hepatic and renal function during screening as demonstrated by:

               -  ALT (SGPT) and AST (SGOT) ≤ 3x the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN);

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN or ≤ 2x ULN, if upon judgment of the treating
                  investigator the elevated bilirubin is due to extramedullary hematopoiesis
                  related to the underlying MDS/MPN or to Gilbert's disease;

               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance (eCCR) &gt;/=40
                  ml/min/1.73m2 Patients must have eCCR &gt;/= 60ml/min/1.73m2 to enter into the
                  INCB59872 arm. eCCR may be calculated using the standard institutional formula.
                  The estimation tool/formula employed and result must be declared in the case
                  report form (CRF).
