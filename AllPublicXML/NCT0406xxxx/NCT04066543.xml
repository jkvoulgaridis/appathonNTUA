  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to include 40 patients with middle-advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
      .These patients were randomly allocated to TACE treatment group or TACE+Anlotinib treatment
      group.The treatment effectiveness, local tumor control and survival outcome between the two
      groups were compared.

    <description>The modified Seldinger puncture was used to puncture the cutaneous-femoral artery, insert the catheter and perform hepatic artery angiography. The location, morphology and blood supply of liver tissue lesions were comprehensively understood. The use of chemotherapeutic drugs and the dosage of iodized oil as the embolic agent were determined according to the general situation. The catheter was injected into the supply vessel of the tumor, and 5-FU and adriamycin were injected according to the situation. The embolic agent was injected with iodized oil as carrier, mixed with chemotherapeutic drugs at the same time, and then assisted with gelatin sponge for embolization. Antiemetic drugs were given before treatment and hepatoprotective drugs were given after operation. Until the disease progresses.</description>
