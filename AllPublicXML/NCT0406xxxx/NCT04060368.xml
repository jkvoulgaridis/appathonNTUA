      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of ESG with OverStitch®
      system (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, TX, USA) compared to LSG on 1) histological improvement
      in NASH; 2) all-cause mortality and liver-related outcomes In obese subjects with
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

    <description>To evaluate the effect of ESG compared to LSG on liver histology in obese subjects with NASH with or without fibrosis by assessing the following endpoint: The proportion of subjects undergoing ESG relative to LSG achieving NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis. NASH resolution is defined as the disappearance of ballooning and the disappearance or persistence of minimal lobular inflammation (grade 0 or 1) The worsening of fibrosis is defined as the progression of at least one stage.</description>

             [eGFR] of less than 60 ml / min / 1.73 m2). If an abnormal value is obtained at the
             first screening visit, the eGFR measurement may be repeated before randomization
             within the following time frame: minimum 4 weeks after the initial test and maximum 2
             weeks before the expected randomization. An abnormal repeated eGFR (less than 60 ml /
