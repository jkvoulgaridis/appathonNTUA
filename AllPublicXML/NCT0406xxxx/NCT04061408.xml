  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastasis accounted for 10-15% of all breast cancer patients and even higher in
      patients with triple negative and HER2 overexpressed subtype. Stereotactic radiation is the
      standard option for patients with 1-4 brain metastases. Among patients with 1-4 brain
      metastases, many studies suggest that stereotactic radiation results in fewer neurologic side
      effects than whole brain radiation. Also, several studies had demonstrated that 5-10 lesions
      had similar overall survival by using whole brain radiotherapy or stereotactic radiotherapy.
      Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy(FSRT) is increasingly administered in the brain
      metastatic patients and retrospective studies had shown that FSRT had better local control
      and lower brain radiation necrosis than single fraction stereotactic radiation. Therefore, In
      this study, we explore to treat 1-10 brain metastasis lesion in breast cancer patients with
      FSRT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients with 1-10 brain metastasis will be treated with FSRT for brain
      metastasis. 3 to 5 fractions and 8Gy per fraction will be used for these patients based on
      the lesion number and volume.
