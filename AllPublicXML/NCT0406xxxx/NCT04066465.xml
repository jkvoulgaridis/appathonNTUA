  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumors are the second most frequent malignant diseases in children and adolescents. In
      the study the short and medium term consequences of proton therapy on cognitive processes in
      particular on executive functions in pediatric patients shall be
      highlighted/analysed/evalutated. In a second step, these results are to be compared with

        1. a group of children and adolescents who had only /exclusively had operative therapy and

        2. with a healthy control group. Thus, the extent to which these treatment options differ
           in terms of their short and medium-term effect is assessed. Methods of
           neurocognitive/neurophysiology brain research approaches are applied that may
           potentially visualize even small / subtle changes in mental activities/neurocognitive
           function. Therefore the effects of treatment can be evaluated and the neuropsychological
           outcome of children and adolescents with brain tumors can be improved.

      Radio(chemo)therapy with protons is conducted according to current treatment standards or,
      for patients participating in a clinical intervention study, according to the study protocols
      of the GPOH. Only patients with prescribed radiation doses &gt; 40 Gy (RBE) will be included.
      Treatment planning, the target volume and radiotherapy will be performed according to the
      current treatment standards. For patients participating in a clinical intervention study,
      radiotherapy is corresponding to study protocol of the GPOH. Risk organs (e.g. brain stem,
      chiasma, optic nerves, gll. Lacrimals, lenses, inner ears and spine) are contoured and the
      radiation doses for these organs are limited according to institutional guidelines.
      Radiotherapy is performed according to guidelines, i.e. 5 days a week for 4-6 weeks, usually
      on an outpatient basis.

Neurological status and neurocognitive testing on core executive functions (inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility) and Quality of life measurements are performed regularely during follow-up using standardized KINDL® questionnaires for general quality of life and specific for oncologic diseases. In addition to the treatment parameters of the radio(chemo)therapy protocol, further radiation doses to brain substructures and organs at risk are documented.</description>
