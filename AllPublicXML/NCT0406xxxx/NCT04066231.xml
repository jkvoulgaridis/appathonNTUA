  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that the VIPUN Gastric Monitoring System (GMS) can discriminate
      healthy physiological and pharmacologically-inhibited gastric motility, using a codeine-model
      in healthy adults (S60320 / AFMPS80M0687).

      Erythromycin is a gastroprokinetic agent, known to stimulate gastric contractility. A single
      dose of 200 mg erythromycin has been shown to induce a prolonged period of enhanced phasic
      contractile activity.

      The primary aim of this investigation is to validate the ability of the VIPUN GMS to
      discriminate between normal and pharmacologically-enhanced fasting gastric motility in
      healthy adults.

      The performance of the VIPUN GMS can be enhanced by data-driven optimization of the VIPUN
      Motility Algorithm, used to quantify gastric motility.
