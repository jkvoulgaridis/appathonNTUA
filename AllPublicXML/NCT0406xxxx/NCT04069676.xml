      This project aims:

        -  to study behavioral and cerebral activity specificity (latency and amplitude of evoked
           potentials, time frequency maps and cerebral connectivity) in predictive process
           (top-down regulation) during visual recognition of static and dynamic stimuli in adults
           participants with autism spectrum conditions compared to typically developed
           participants.

        -  to study the relation between predictive process and autonomous response (heart activity
           and electrodermal activity)

        -  to explore potential sex differences between autistic males and females

      Once eligibility criteria would have been verified, information on the study will be given
      and non opposition of the participant will be collected.Then, the participant will be
      comfortably installed in order to pass the Landolt C task (visual acuity task) on a computer.
      If his vision is normal, electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and
      electrodermal activity (EDA) of participants, will be recorded during visual processing and
      recognition tasks. Stimuli will include emotional and non emotional pictures and films,
      filtered in coarse-to-fine versus fine-to-coarse sequences in order to stimulate or not
      predictive process described by Bar (2007).

      The participant will also have to complete an abbreviated version of the Wechsler Adult
      Intelligence Scale, IVth edition (Wechsler, 2003), and the Autism Spectrum Quotient
      (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) if he never did it before. The aim is to pair as much as possible
      group by IQ and to verify that control participants don't present autistic traits above the
      Autism Spectrum Quotient cutoff. Groups will also be paired by age and education level.
