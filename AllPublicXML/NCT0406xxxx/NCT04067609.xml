    <textblock>
      Investigating if giving post-operative dexamethasone to patients with a history of opioid use
      disorder on medication assisted treatment during pregnancy improves their pain scores and
      decreases their opioid use after cesarean section.

      For this study, the researchers are most interested in an option that would be able to be
      administered consistently (same time/same way): that labor nurses could give and without
      requiring the patient to have had an epidural placement. Further, Gabapentin, clonidine and
      ketamine are associated with CNS effects like sedation or confusion that could make health
      care providers less likely to be comfortable giving these women additional oxycodone due to
      possible worsened sedation or respiratory depression. Lastly, the researchers wanted to give
      a drug that both obstetricians and pediatricians were comfortable with from extensive use in
      our maternal population. Thus, a single administration IV dexamethasone was chosen for this
      study. Dexamethasone has been used as an adjunct for post-operative pain management in many
      types of surgeries. Although no large randomized trials exist, several small trials suggest
      an analgesic and opioid sparing effect of dexamethasone post-operatively for both pregnant
      and non-pregnanat patients; however these studies excluded patients on MAT

    <measure>change of morphine use</measure>
    <time_frame>within 72 hours of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of total morphine dose equivalents used by the patient during this period will be examined. The total morphine dose equivalents will be calculated from the total narcotic dose and appropriate conversion (i.e. dilaudid dose to morphine dose equivalents). This will be calculated as a total daily dose for the hospital stay and an average dose/d over the entire hospital stay. These 2 separate calculations will be used because it is presumed that narcotic use will decrease with each day post-op. Calculating an average dose/d over the entire hospital stay will account for women who are discharged on different postoperative days.</description>

          -  History of opioid use disorder with current use of MAT during pregnancy,

          -  Scheduled for cesarean delivery for their current pregnancy for any indication
             [examples of elective c-section (decision made for c-section to be performed prior to
             onset of labor): fetal malpresentation, suspected macrosomia, prior c-section,
             abnormal placentation, patient preference],

          -  Negative toxicology screen upon admission to the hospital for their cesarean section,
             no prior administration of betamethasone for fetal lung maturity within 24h of their
