  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the cognitive strengths and weaknesses of children with
      autism and the possible effect of age and IQ on Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, 5th
      Edition. Such analysis will help us for prompt and early intervention.

      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are characterized by deficits in both social interaction and
      communication, as well as by restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, and are a type
      of Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by
      deficits in adaptive functioning, an intelligence quotient (IQ) that falls at least two
      standard deviations below average (i.e., below 70), and onset prior to adulthood (American
      Psychiatric Association, 2000).

      Although ID is not a core symptom of ASD, there is an established relationship between the
      two constructs. Seventy percent of children with AD have a co-morbid diagnosis of ID (Bolte &amp;
      Poustka, 2002; Fombonne, 2005). It has been suggested that many children who would have been
      diagnosed with ID in the past would today receive an ASD diagnosis, even with identical
      symptomatology (Lecavalier et al., in press).

      The SB5 is a descendent of the very first intelligence measure ever created. It tests general
      intellectual ability, and the Fifth Edition affords the ability to report Full Scale,
      Abbreviated, Nonverbal, and Verbal IQ scores(Roid, 2003).. One of the updated features of the
      SB5 is the nonverbal component, in that close to half of the responses no longer require
      verbal answers (Coolican, Bryson &amp; Zwaigenbaum, 2008).The Full Scale IQ is derived from the
      verbal and nonverbal scales, each with five subtests bearing the same names: Fluid Reasoning,
      Knowledge, Quantitative Reasoning, Visual Spatial Processing, and Working Memory.
