  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, 12-week trial to test the feasibility of a PP-MI intervention for
      patients recently admitted following ACS. PP-MI is a novel positive psychology-based health
      behavior intervention that is adapted for patients hospitalized for ACS. The intervention
      aims to cultivate positive emotions in this vulnerable population that could provide broad
      and significant health benefits, and may have distinct—and more powerful—effects than simply
      attempting to dampen negative emotions.

      The primary aim is to assess whether the intervention exercises are feasible and linked with
      immediate boosts in positive affect upon completion. The secondary goal is to provide the
      research team with greater experience recruiting inpatients with an ACS, successfully
      completing intervention sessions, and administering psychological and medical assessments by
      phone.

      The initial study visit will occur in-person two weeks after discharge from the hospital.
      Participants will meet with a member of the study staff (the study &quot;trainer&quot;) and complete
      self-report questionnaires assessing health behavior adherence and mental and physical
      health. Then, a study interventionist will provide a treatment manual for the positive
      psychology + motivational interviewing intervention, review the rationale for the initial
      exercise, and assign the first exercise. If the participant is in the positive psychology +
      motivational interviewing condition, the trainer will explain the rationale for both the
      positive psychology and goal-setting and motivational interviewing portions of the program,
      and will be assigned the first exercise. Participants will then be given an accelerometer,
      which they will be asked to wear for 7 days to ensure that they are comfortable with the
      device and that useable data can be obtained from the participant. Participants will then
      complete twelve 30-minute weekly phone sessions with a study trainer. The phone sessions
      primarily will include a review of the prior week's session content and a discussion of the
      rationale and assignment of the next week's exercise/assignment. Upon the completion of these
      calls, a blinded member of the study staff will call participants to administer self-report
      outcome measures. Participants will also be asked to wear an accelerometer at the follow-up
      timepoint as an objective measure of physical activity, which they will return by mail to the
      study staff.
