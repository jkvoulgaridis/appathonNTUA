  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions and a targeted glucose control is key to prevent
      microvascular complications as well as long-term macrovascular disease.

      Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is mandatory to implement
      safe and effective adjustments in insulin therapy in order to reduce glucose levels and
      prevent hypoglycemic episodes. It is known that a higher rate of glucose testing (up to 8
      times/day) is associated with improved glucose control, however, long-term repeated daily
      glucose tests are painful, inconvenient and difficult to pursue.

      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an alternative to SMBG, but the use of conventional
      CGM has been limited by the need of repeated calibration using capillary glucose testing,
      relatively short sensor lifespan and high costs. The recently introduced CGM FreeStyle Libreâ„¢
      (Abbott Diabetes Care, Witney, UK) flash glucose monitoring (FGM), a new generation of
      glucose testing device, has the advantage to be user friendly by just scanning the reader
      over the sensor.

      The FGM system does not require calibration, has a long sensor lifetime of 14 days and it's
      relatively affordable, explaining the widespread use of the device.

      The Flash Glucose Monitoring-FGM is a real-time glycemic monitoring system called &quot;hybrid&quot; as
      it is not equipped with alarms capable of alerting the patient to cut-off value for the hypo-
      or hyperglycemia, but allows the glycemic trend to be viewed at request.

      Patients will be identified and enrolled in the Diabetes Departments of different
      hospitals/clinics in the Emilia Romagna region, Italy. Patients will be divided in two groups
      A (naive patients,) and B (patients already using the device at enrollment) and followed for
      12 months.

      Study design is observational prospective and includes 3-months follow up visits until the
      12-month final evaluation.

      At each visit, patient clinical data, adherence and side effects will be recorded and data
      download from the device will be performed.

    <description>Change in Diabetes Quality Of Life- DQOL score from baseline.
The original DQOL is a 60-item instrument to assess the diabetes-related QOL of participants. The instrument provides an overall scale score, as well as four subscale scores for 1) satisfaction with treatment, 2) impact of treatment, 3) worry about the future effects of diabetes, and 4) worry about social/vocational issues.
Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale and are of two general formats. One format asks about the frequency of negative impact of diabetes itself or of the diabetes treatment and provides response options from 1 (never) to 5 (all the time). The second format asks about satisfaction with treatment and quality of life and is scored from 1 (very satisfied) to 5 (very dissatisfied).
Higher scores on DQOL items and subscales are, therefore, negatively valenced, indicating problem frequency or dissatisfaction.</description>
