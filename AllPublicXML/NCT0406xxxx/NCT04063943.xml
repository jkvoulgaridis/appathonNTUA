  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the safety and performance of the Sidus Stem-Free
      Shoulder Arthroplasty System in unilateral primary total shoulder arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The data collected from this study will serve the purpose of assessing safety and performance
      of the Sidus Shoulder.

      Safety: Will be assessed by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events (AE),
      serious adverse events (SAE), and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE).

      Performance: Will be determined by analyzing the implant survival, overall pain and
      functional performances (based on the ASES Patient Questionnaire and range of motion) and
      radiographic parameters of subjects who received the Sidus Shoulder. Implant survival will be
      based on removal or intended removal and determined using the observed component years (OCY)
      model as it is not anticipated that there will be adequate data at the 10 years follow-up to
      support Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis. In the instance that there is sufficient data to
      perform Kaplan-Meier analysis, the analysis will be performed.

    <measure>Performance: ASES Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be determined by analyzing the ASES Questionnaire in subjects who received the Sidus Shoulder. ASES consists of 3 subcomponent scores including pain, instability and activities of daily living. The pain score can be 0 to 10 with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. The instability score can be 0 to 10 with 0 being no instability and 10 being the worst instability imaginable. The activities of daily living consists of 10 questions with ordinal responses of 0, 1, 2, and 3. 3 involves no limitation and 0 is unable to do. The 3 subcomponents combine to make the overall ASES score which can range from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst possible score and 100 being the best.</description>
