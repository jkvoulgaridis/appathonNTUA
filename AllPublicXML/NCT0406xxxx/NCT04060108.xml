    <textblock>
      This study is a biomarker study designed to characterize how MDMA impacts the reward circuits
      of the human brain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the effect of acute MDMA modulation on the functioning of
      reward-related human brain circuits. Reward-related brain circuits will be assessed using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging.

      Participants will include volunteers who report more than two prior uses of MDMA (also known
      as Ecstasy), when they were 18 years or older.

      The investigators will recruit individuals who have previously tried MDMA rather than those
      who are MDMA-na√Øve.

      Participants will receive an oral dose of MDMA (~.75mg/kg and 1.5mg/kg) and placebo (saline)
      at 3 separate study sessions. Following established procedures, these three sessions will be
      randomized in a blinded protocol in order to limit expectancy effects.

      Throughout each session, participants will be monitored. Functional imaging will commence
      after the drug has reached peak levels, following previously established time courses for
      MDMA administered orally. Participants will also be monitored after the functional imaging
      session. Secondary effects of MDMA on behavior and self-reported experience will be assessed.

      In the assessment of the acute effects of MDMA, the investigators will take into account the
      cumulative effects of prior drug exposure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reward circuit activation as assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks after adminstration of MDMA or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>During functional magnetic resonance imaging the reward circuit will be engaged by reward and related emotional tasks, and circuit activation will be quantified by blood flow in regions of interest and the extent of functional connectivity between them</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral responses on the WebNeuro computerized test battery assessing cognitive capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 hours after the adminstration of MDMA or Placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy data are quantified as number of errors and lower values indicate better performance. The results across all the individual tests are aggregated to a singe report that details function as compared to a normative database.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported responses as assessed by the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 hours after the adminstration of MDMA or Placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Responses are quantified on a 4-point scale and summed for total DASS score and for each Depression, Anxiety and Subscale score. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported responses as assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 hours after the adminstration of MDMA or Placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Responses are quantified as summed scores for negative and positive mood states. Scores range from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) and measures six different dimensions of mood swings over a period of time including: Tension or Anxiety, Anger or Hostility, Vigor or Activity, Fatigue or Inertia, Depression or Dejection, Confusion or Bewilderment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of subjectively experienced intoxication as assessed by a visual analogue intoxication scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 hours after the adminstration of MDMA or Placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Responses will be quantified in intervals of 10 on a visual analogue scale of 1 to 100</description>
