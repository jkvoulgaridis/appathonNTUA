  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the present research program is to determine how a healthy whole-diet
      approach impacts on cardiometabolic health in adults. With its interdisciplinary approach,
      the study depicts mechanisms behind disease progression and the impact of healthy dietary
      patterns and physical activity on changes in markers of low-grade systemic inflammation
      together with the exploration of knowledge and attitudes about healthy diets and physical
      activity. The study has a preventive character as it targets middle-aged and older adults
      (55+) without manifest disease.

      This two arm randomized-controlled study includes the following groups: Controls and Healthy
      Diet group.

      The study will particularly address the following aspects:

        -  determine food literacy, perceived attitudes and barriers for the adoption of new
           dietary habits incorporating increased fruit and vegetable intake in adults.

        -  explore the effects of a randomized controlled intervention promoting healthy dietary
           patterns (increased intakes of fruit and vegetable, whole-grain, nuts and low fat dairy
           products and replacing saturated with unsaturated fats and decreased red meat and salt
           consumption) for a period of 4 months on components of the metabolic syndrome, a large
           panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and metabolomic profile in adults.

        -  assess the long-term adherence to healthy dietary patterns in adults.

        -  provide support for behavioural change and evaluate participants' perception of this
           support.
