      2 dose (RP2D) of SNDX-5613 in patients with acute leukemia.

      In Phase 2, patients will be enrolled in 3 indication-specific expansion cohorts to determine

      Phase 1 dose escalation will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SNDX-5613 in patients with acute leukemia. Patients with R/R acute
      leukemia are to be enrolled agnostic of genetic mutation status. Patients will be enrolled in
      one of two dose-escalation arms:

        -  Arm A: Patients not receiving any strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor/
           inducers.

        -  Arm B: Patients receiving strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors for antifungal
           prophylaxis.

      In Phase 2, patients will be enrolled in 3 indication-specific expansion cohorts to determine
      the efficacy, short- and long-term safety, and tolerability of SNDX-5613:

        -  Cohort 2A: Patients with MLLr acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/mixed phenotype acute
           leukemia (MPAL).

        -  Cohort 2B: Patients with MLLr AML.
