    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will to investigate the effect of foot exercises in patients with type
      2 diabetic and peripheral neuropathy. Subjects will be randomly allocated to either the
      control or intervention group. Data will be collected using investigator-developed forms:
      patient information form and the diabetic foot exercises log. Patients in the intervention
      group will be received standard treatment and performed foot exercises for three times a week
      8 weeks; the control group will be received standard treatment but no exercises. The
      intervention and control groups will be examined and measured at the 4th and 8th weeks.

      Purpose of our study investigation of the effects foot exercises in patients with type 2
      diabetic and peripheral neuropathy.

      Excepted results: Routine treatment + foot exercises pain, flexibility, edema, muscle
      strength, sensation, quality of life we believe that there will be good progress in
      peripheral neuropathy effects, Leeds assessment of neuropathic symptoms and signs(LANSS)
      results.

      In this context, it is planned that patients randomly divided into 2 groups. Group 1 control
      group. Group 2 intervention group. Patients in the intervention group will be received
      standard treatment and performed foot exercises for three times a week 8 weeks. The patients
      will be evaluated by clinical measurements and scales based on patient notification at the
      4th and 8th weeks.

    <measure>Pain assessment with The Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) pain scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Pain at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) Pain Scale evaluates sensory dysfunction and whether the pain is caused by neuropathic mechanisms or not. The LANSS comprises a 5-item questionnaire regarding pain symptoms and two items for clinical signs involving self-administered sensory tests for the presence of allodynia and decreased sensation to pinprick. Responses to each item are binary (yes or no) and each item is weighted differently depending on the odds ratio of a positive response to each item to predict that the pain is primarily neuropathic. The possible scores range from 0 to 24, with a score of 12 or greater considered to be suggestive of neuropathic pain</description>

    <description>Participants are asked to mark the point where they feel their pain on a 10 centimeter (cm) horizontal line. 0-no pain, 10-unbearable pain. Night, activity and pain conditions are evaluated separately at rest.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of functional capacity with 6 minutes walking test</measure>
    <time_frame>1th day, 8th week</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-minute walk test is one of the functional exercise capacity assessment tests. In this test, participants are asked to walk as long as possible within 6 minutes in a 30 meter (m) corridor. When they feel fatigue or pain, they are advised to stop and rest when they feel ready to walk. At the end of 6 minutes, the total distance of the patients walking is recorded. Heart rates, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, O2 saturation, perceived fatigue and dyspnea levels are recorded before and after the test.</description>

    <measure>Two Point Discrimation Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1th day, 8th week</time_frame>
    <description>The two-point discrimination test is used to assess if the patient is able to identify two close points on a small area of skin, and how fine the ability to discriminate this are. It is a measure of tactile agnosia, or the inability to recognize these two points despite intact cutaneous sensation and proprioception.</description>

    <measure>Serum creatinine</measure>
    <time_frame>1 th day, 8th week</time_frame>
    <description>The kidneys are responsible for keeping the level of creatinine in the blood within a normal range. The typical reference range for serum creatinine is 60 to 110 micromoles per liter (μmol/L) (0.7 to 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)) for men and 45 to 90 μmol/L (0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL) for women.</description>

    <measure>Albumin levels</measure>
    <time_frame>1 th day, 8th week</time_frame>
    <description>A normal albumin range is 3.4 to 5.4 g/dL. If you have a lower albumin level, you may have malnutrition. It can also mean that you have liver disease or an inflammatory disease. Higher albumin levels may be caused by acute infections, burns, and stress from surgery or a heart attack.</description>
