    <textblock>
      The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of lullaby intervention on anxiety and
      prenatal attachment in women with high-risk pregnancy. The study involved women with
      high-risk pregnancy who were assigned randomly to the intervention (n=30) or control (n=30)
      groups in a state hospital in Turkey. For two successive days, the intervention group
      listened to lullabies for 20 minutes once a day, meanwhile touched the abdomen and thought
      about their babies, but the control group did not. Data from the outcomes of anxiety and
      attachment were collected at baseline and at the end of the second day. Vital findings were
      measured on each study day, both before and after the lullaby intervention/usual care.

    <textblock>
      Women with high-risk pregnancy may experience anxiety and low prenatal attachment due to many
      problems with pregnancy and hospitalization. It is reported that anxiety can have negative
      effects on prenatal attachment. The anxiety during pregnancy may adversely affect the health
      of the pregnant woman and fetus.

      The study participants divided into two groups, one that received listening to lullabies
      intervention for two days (intervention group) and the other receiving the usual care
      (control group). During the study period, 777 pregnant women were admitted to the clinic and
      were assessed for eligibility for the study on 2 days a week. The pregnant women (n=76) who
      met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study were recruited.
      Participants were randomized in equal numbers to the intervention (n=38) and control groups
      (n=38) by withdrawing computer randomized sampling numbers (using Microsoft Excel 2010) from
      concealed envelopes to determine their group status. Participants were numbered according to
      their order of admittance to the hospital. After obtaining informed content and collecting
      baseline data, main researcher randomly chose one code for each woman. There could be one
      participant or two participants of each group in each day. Data was collected together until
      the sample size was reached. Participants were blinded to the group assignment.

      Participants were recruited by simple random sampling from the perinatology clinic at a state
      hospital in Turkey. An estimation of sample size was calculated at an effect size of 2.43
      with a 5% level of significance on the primary outcome of anxiety in a sample study.
      According to G power 3.1.7, a target sample size of 60 was estimated. Initially, 777 pregnant
      women were eligible, but 701 were excluded from the study. Some participants withdrew due to
      preterm birth (n=5), referral to another hospital (n=1) or discharged from hospital (n=10).
      Finally 60 participants who completed the lullaby intervention were included in data
      analysis. As a result of the study, the power of the test (α=0.05, 95% confidence interval)
      was 99.9% for each group n=30.

      The preliminary study included five women at risk of preterm delivery who met the inclusion
      criteria. They were subjected to a lullaby intervention, and their study variables were
      evaluated. The women in the preliminary study were not included in the main study.

      The lullaby intervention consisted of 10 different lullabies with a mean duration of two
      minutes, for a total of 20 minutes. The lullabies were among the best-known ones from the
      Turkish culture. At the place of study, an academician of the Music Education Department of
      the University, Fine Arts Faculty was consulted regarding the lullaby recital.

      The pregnant women in the intervention group listened to the lullabies for 20 minutes per
      day, for two successive days using an MP3 player. To provide a homogeneous intervention and
      to avoid bias, the personal lullaby preferences of the pregnant women were ignored.

      While they were listening to the lullaby, they were told to think about their babies, and
      feel them by touching the abdomen. This intervention was performed in single patient rooms
      during bed rest, when the participants were available and felt ready. The doors and windows
      of the room was closed, and the participants were left alone. A disposable ear-tip was used
      for each participant. Before the initiation of the recital, the MP3 player was checked and
      the participants were instructed in the operation of the MP3 player (turning on, turning off,
      adjusting volume). The tempo of the lullaby was concordant with the normal heart rate (about
      60-80 beats per minute), the participant determined and adjusted the volume to suit.

      The control group received only the usual care of the hospital, resting in reclined position.
      All of the participants in both groups were ensured to have empty bladders and closed their
      cellphones, and none received any medical interventions during the lullaby intervention/usual
      care.

      The study data was collected between 11:30 and 13:30 after lunch when no medical care,
      diagnostic tests or routine follow-up were administered. Initially, sociodemographic and
      obstetric data were collected by face-to-face interviews with participants. Intervention
      effect outcomes were anxiety and attachment which were measured at baseline. Anxiety was
      measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and attachment was measured by the
      Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI). Before pregnant women filled the STAI and PAI, the
      instructions were read aloud to them and then they responded the questionnaires in silence.
      The STAI and PAI were reassessed at the end of the study (day 2) after the lullaby
      intervention/usual care. Vital findings were also measured on each study day, both before and
      after the lullaby intervention/usual care. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures and
      pulse rates of all participants were measured using a digital sphygmomanometer. The
      respiratory rate was measured by observing the chest and count the number of respirations out
      loud for one full minute using a digital watch while at bed rest (the same device was used
      for each participant). The level of satisfaction with listening to lullabies was assessed
      after the lullaby intervention at the end of the study using a 10-point Likert-type scale.

      After the purposes and procedures of this study was explained, signed informed consent was
      obtained from all participants. Participants could withdraw from the study at any time.
      Participants were assured of privacy and that their identity was protected. The study was
      based on voluntariness. Usual care and treatment of pregnant women in each groups were not
      intervened during the study period. When the research was completed, the results of the study
      were explained and the lullaby cd was delivered to the control group.

      Data were analyzed by IBM SPSS v.23. Categorical data were analysed using the chi‐square test
      for homogeneity of characteristics between two groups. Parametric tests were used if the data
      was normally distributed, but if not, nonparametric tests were used. A Pearson Chi-square
      test, Fisher's exact test, and Yates' continuity correction were used to compare the
      categorical data. The continuous data was compared using a Student's t or Mann-Whitney
      U-tests. A Paired sample t-test or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were used to compare the paired
      scores of the STAI and PAI and the vital findings within the groups. The relationship between
      these three parameters was analyzed using a Spearman-correlation test. Statistical
      significance was considered p&lt;0.05.

      There are also some limitations in this study. Firstly, only state anxiety of the pregnant
      women was assessed, and future studies would benefit from taking also trait anxiety into
      consideration. It was a single-center study; therefore, the generalizability of the results
      to other women with high-risk pregnancy is unclear. Since the perinatology clinic where the
      study was carried out was newly opened, there were some disruptions and most pregnant women
      were transferred from this clinic to other clinics of hospital and discharged from hospital
      before the required hospital stay; therefore, the study could only be performed with pregnant
      women hospitalized for 3 days.
