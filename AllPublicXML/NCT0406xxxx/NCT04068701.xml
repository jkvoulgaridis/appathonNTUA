  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though females are 2- to 10-times more likely to suffer an anterior cruciate ligament
      (ACL) injury, males represent the largest population of total ACL injuries. Consequently,
      there is a larger population of males that endure significant pain, functional limitations,
      and radiographic signs of knee osteoarthritis (OA) within 12 to 20 years of injury. To reduce
      the burden of OA, The National Public Health Agenda for Osteoarthritis recommends expanding
      and refining evidence-based prevention of ACL injury. Specialized training that targets
      modifiable risk factors shows statistical efficacy in high-risk athletes; however, clinically
      meaningful reduction of risk has not been achieved. A critical barrier that limits successful
      training outcomes is the requirement of qualified instructors to deliver personalized,
      intuitive, and accessible feedback to young athletes. Thus, a key gap in knowledge is how to
      efficiently deliver objective, effective feedback during training for injury prevention. The
      investiagator's long-term goal is to reduce ACL injuries and the subsequent sequela in young
      male athletes.

      aNMT integrates biomechanical screening with state-of-the-art augmented reality headsets to
      display real-time feedback that maps complex biomechanical variables onto simple visual
      feedback stimuli that athletes &quot;control&quot; via their own movements. The central hypothesis is
      that aNMT biofeedback will improve joint mechanics in evidence-based measures collected in
      realistic, sport-specific virtual reality scenarios. Specifically, the purpose of this
      investigation is to determine the efficacy of aNMT biofeedback to improve high-risk landing
      mechanics both in a laboratory task and during sport-specific scenarios. Based on the
      investigator's preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize that aNMT biofeedback will
      produce greater improvements in localized joint mechanics compared to neuromuscular training
      that incorporates sham feedback during the drop vertical jump (DVJ) task. In the secondary
      Aim, the investigators hypothesize aNMT will produce improved localized joint mechanics and
      global injury risk techniques during sport-specific maneuvers assessed in immersive virtual
      environments compared to the sham feedback. The expected outcomes will support increased
      efficiency and enhanced efficacy of feedback for personalized and targeted injury prevention
      training. The positive impact will be the improvement of injury risk mechanics and the
      potential to reduce injury on the field of play. A randomized, repeated-measures design will
      be used to test the two hypotheses for Aim 1: First, that aNMT will produce greater
      improvements in localized joint mechanics compared to the sham feedback group during the DVJ
      task; second, based on the preliminary data the investigators expect that innovative aNMT
      will lead to graduated joint improvements and reduced global injury risk mechanics that will
      exceed the overall task transferred reductions in high risk biomechanics following 12
      real-time biofeedback training sessions. Previously described techniques will be used to
      measure biomechanical risk factors during a DVJ task performed at the beginning and end of
      the 6-week pre-competition training period. Athletes will be randomized into one of two
      groups: 1) aNMT biofeedback or (2) sham (augmented reality glasses with a stimulus that will
      provide exercise repetition count). Each athlete, as well as the statisticians, will be
      blinded to the intervention. All athletes will receive 12 training sessions over a 6-week
      period during their pre-competition season and each of the groups will have longitudinal
      assessment of biomechanical outcome measures captured at each biofeedback session.
