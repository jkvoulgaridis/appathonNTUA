  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive respiratory diseases such as asthma or COPD are a common reason for emergency
      room visits. Currently, nasal gill capnography and oxygen saturation measurement (SpO2) are
      the only two non-invasive means of continuously monitoring a respiratory pathology. To date,
      Respiratory Functional Explorations (CFE) and more particularly spirometry, are considered as
      the reference examinations for the diagnosis or monitoring of asthma or COPD. However,
      physical and physical constraints make their use almost impossible in the context of the
      emergency with patients presenting to emergencies in respiratory distress, often require
      oxygen therapy or even non-invasive ventilation. Only pulmonary auscultation can make the
      diagnosis of acute decompensation of obstructive pathology. This technique is qualitative and
      imprecise, sometimes leading to a diagnostic uncertainty resulting in delay in taking charge
      and inappropriate therapy.

      Studies have shown a change in the capnography curve in obstructive airway disorder and a
      strong correlation between some capnography parameters and spirometry parameters such as the
      Tiffeneau ratio (FEV1 / FVC), suggesting capnography as a simple and effective technique for
      the diagnosis of obstructive syndrome of patients in emergencies.
