      Purpose: To determine unmet functional needs in patients referred to the Palliative Care Unit
      at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital will be asked to fill out self reported
      questionnaires regarding problem intensity, problem burden and felt needs, physical
      functioning, emotional functioning, fatigue, sleep, distress. Furthermore patients physical
      function will be evaluated.

      Physical functioning is found to be an important predictor for survival and physical ability
      'to do what one wants' affects quality of life in cancer patients in palliative care and
      their spouses. Despite this, physical functioning is reported as a neglected dimension in
      palliative care quality of life outcome measures, and advanced cancer patients report that
      they do not receive the help they need. The vast majority of patients with advanced cancer
      described unmet palliative care needs, and with the most frequently reported problems being;
      fatigue (73%), limitations doing physical activities (65%), limitations in work and daily
      activities (58%), worry (58%), difficulties with sexuality (54%), pain (52%) and problems
      with concentration (43%). Furthermore, limitations in physical functioning and physical
      activity is a leading cause of distress and psychological problems a rehabilitative approach
      in palliative care integrated in the interdisciplinary interventions to the patients must be
      maintained throughout the entire illness trajectory from diagnosis through treatment,
      rehabilitation and palliative care to address such problems.

      However, prevalence of patient unmet needs and reported physical functioning and performance
      is reported to differentiate largely between palliative units.

      In order to address the functional needs of patients receiving specialist palliative care
      studies of their specific needs are required. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
      investigate the patient reported unmet needs for function and supportive occupational- and
      physiotherapy rehabilitation interventions in the palliative unit at Copenhagen University
      Hospital, Rigshospitalet. Furthermore, we aim to investigate if observations, additional
      disease-specific patient reported outcomes and assessment of physical function and
      performance can support the unmet needs.
