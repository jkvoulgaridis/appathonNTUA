  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery diseases (CAD) are multifactorial diseases which prognosis and risk factors
      are improved with increased physical activity (PA). Thus, CAD rehabilitation (CR) program is
      mainly based on recovering sufficient exercise capacity and promoting regular personalized PA
      associated to modifications in lifestyle habits to improve control of cardiovascular risk
      factors and health-related quality of life. However, most of patients do not achieve the
      recommended levels of PA which may be partly due to numerous barriers that hamper the return
      to a physically active lifestyle. One promising interventions strategy is so-called 'brief
      interventions' (BI) to increase PA in health care settings used to initiate change for an
      unhealthy behavior in individuals and consisting in &quot;verbal advice, discussion, negotiation
      or encouragement, with or without written or other support or follow-up&quot;. An 'extended brief
      intervention' (EBI) is similar but usually lasts more than 30 minutes and is delivered on a
      one-to-one or group basis and can be composed of multiple brief sessions. However, in CAD
      patients, the effect of such interventions on PA level and behavior remains unclear, as well
      as predictor patterns associated with better outcomes.

      The investigators aimed to assess the effect of a 4-day PA education program with multiple
      EBI and exercise on the level and barriers to PA in CAD patients and characterize the profile
      of participants (barriers to PA) with better outcomes.

    <description>The investigators included 32 patients who participated to a monocentric 4-day program for secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease, between January 2017 and October 2018. Participation to the program was on a voluntary basis and individuals were referred by their own physician, cardiac rehabilitation center or spontaneously. Eligibility criteria included age 18 years and older, stable coronary artery disease with appropriate medical certificate of fitness and no current medical conditions affecting sports participation. Patients unable to give written constent, with impaired cognitive functions, chronic motor deficiency or severe medical disorder (other than heart disease) significantly affecting functional abilities and individuals with insufficient information about medical history of documented coronary disease were excluded.</description>

    <description>Each program included 8-12 patients. During the four days, the participants had 4 collective sessions of educational information on PA and heart disease and 2 one-to-one sessions for promoting personal advice and experience on PA behavior. The participants had 6 sessions of PA and 2 food-counseling sessions.</description>
