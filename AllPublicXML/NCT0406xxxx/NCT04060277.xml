      This phase II trial studies how well Triplex vaccine works in preventing cytomegalovirus
      (CMV) infection in patients undergoing a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CMV is a
      virus that may be carried for life and does not cause illness in most healthy individuals.
      However, in people whose immune systems are lowered (such as those undergoing stem cell
      transplantation), CMV can reproduce and cause disease and even death. The Triplex vaccine is
      made up of 3 small pieces of CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (the chemical form of genes)
      placed into a weakened virus called modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) that may help produce
      immunity (the ability to recognize and respond to an infection) and reduce the risk of
      developing complications related to CMV infection.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if CMV-MVA multi-peptide CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine (Triplex)
      reduces the frequency of clinically significant CMV reactivation in CMV positive (+)
      haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haploHCT) adult recipients from when
      letermovir (Prevymis) prophylaxis is stopped at day (d)100 until d180 post HCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Triplex in vaccinated, haploHCT recipients by
      assessing the following: non-relapse mortality (NRM) at d180 post-HCT, severe (grade 3-4)
      acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) (Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] 5.0) probably or definitely related to the
      vaccination within 2 weeks from each vaccination at d180 post-HCT.

      II. To characterize CMV related events in recipients of Triplex compared to placebo, by
      assessing time-to viremia (number of days from d100 to the date of &gt;= 625 IU/mL), duration of
      viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late CMV viremia/disease (&gt;= 625 IU/mL, &gt; 200
      and =&lt; 365 days post-HCT), use of antiviral drugs (triggered by clinically significant
      viremia), cumulative number of CMV specific antiviral treatment days.

      III. To evaluate the impact of Triplex on transplant related outcomes up to d365 post-HCT by
      assessing the incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse, non-relapse
      mortality, all-cause mortality, infections.

      IV. To determine if Triplex increases levels, function and kinetics of CMV-specific T cell
      immunity in vaccinated compared to placebo treated, CMV seropositive HCT-recipients.

      V. To determine whether vaccination induces adaptive natural killer (NK) cell population
      changes, and increase in the highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells.

      VI. To compare GVHD biomarkers between the vaccine and placebo groups up to d365 post-HCT.

      VII. To determine if immunity to 3 CMV antigens contained in the Triplex vaccine correlates
      with protection against CMV events, and if T-cell increases reflect vaccine response and
      exceed placebo immune response levels up to d365 post-HCT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive letermovir per standard of care (SOC) on days 7-100 and multi-peptide
      CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on days 100 and 128 post-HCT.

      ARM II: Patients receive letermovir per SOC on days 7-100 and placebo IM on days 100 and 128
      post-HCT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 365 days post-HCT and then
      for an additional 2 years post-HCT.

             including willingness to be followed for one year post-HCT

          -  Planned peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow (BM) HCT for the treatment of
             the following hematologic malignancies:

               -  Lymphoma (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin)

               -  Myelodysplastic syndrome

               -  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second remission (for acute
                  lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma, the disease status must be in
                  hematologic remission by bone marrow and peripheral blood. Persistent
                  lymphadenopathy on computed tomography [CT] or CT/positron emission tomography
                  [PET] scan without progression is allowed.)

               -  Acute myeloid leukemia in first or second remission

               -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia in first chronic or accelerated phase, or in second
                  chronic phase

               -  Other hematologic malignancies judged appropriate by the clinical principal
                  investigators (PIs), including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myeloproliferative
                  disorders and myelofibrosis. Patients with multiple myeloma and those with
                  non-malignant disease such as aplastic anemia are excluded

                    -  Adult cases of multiple myeloma (MM) are excluded as HCT is not standard of
                       care for MM, and is only performed in very advanced cases with an associated
                       high risk of relapse and NRM. Adults with aplastic anemia are excluded
                       because their standard management includes T cell depletion with agents such
                       as anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), which is not permissible on this protocol.
                       Patients undergoing a second haploHCT are not eligible (patients who have
                       undergone a previous autologous HCT are eligible)

          -  Planned HCT with minimal to no-T cell depletion of graft

          -  Conditioning and immunosuppressive regimens according to institutional guidelines are
             permitted

          -  Negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test (female patient
             of childbearing potential only) within two weeks of registration

          -  Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and
             active hepatitis B virus (HBV) (surface antigen negative) within 2 months of
             registration and no history of disseminated cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV)
             related disease

          -  Agreement by females of childbearing potential and sexually active males to use an
             effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for up to d90 post-HCT. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating on the trial, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior investigational CMV vaccine

          -  Experimental anti-CMV chemotherapy in the last 6 months

          -  Live attenuated vaccines (from the time of HCT to d70 post-HCT)

          -  Medically indicated subunit (Engerix-B for HBV; Gardasil for HPV) or killed vaccines
             (e.g. influenza, pneumococcal, or allergy treatment with antigen injections) (from the
             time of HCT to d70 post-HCT)

          -  Allergy treatment with antigen injections (from the time of HCT to d70 post-HCT)

          -  Alemtuzumab or any equivalent in vivo T-cell depleting agent (or CD34+ selection)
             (from the time of HCT to d70 post-HCT)

          -  Antiviral medications with known therapeutic effects on CMV such as ganciclovir
             (GCV)/valganciclovir (VAL), foscarnet (FOS), cidofovir, CMX-001, maribavir. Acyclovir
             has no known therapeutic efficacy against CMV and is allowable as standard of care to
             prevent herpes simplex virus (HSV) (from the time of HCT to d70 post-HCT)

          -  Prophylactic therapy with CMV immunoglobulin or prophylactic antiviral CMV treatment
             EXCEPT Prevymis prophylaxis (prior to d100) (from the time of HCT to d70 post-HCT)

          -  Conditioning regimens d30 prior to trial participation and up to d180 post-HCT

          -  Other investigational product - concurrent enrollment in other clinical trials using
             any investigational new drugs (IND) with unknown effects on CMV or with unknown
             toxicity profiles is prohibited (from the time of HCT to d70 post-HCT)

          -  Other medications that might interfere with the evaluation of the investigational
             product (from the time of HCT to d70 post-HCT)

          -  Patients with active autoimmune conditions requiring systemic immunosuppressive
             therapy within the previous 5 years are not eligible

          -  Patients considered by PIs/protocol team to have a complicated prior therapy or HCT
             regimen, or who have a low survival probability (e.g., refractory leukemia and/or
             undergoing 2nd HCT)

          -  Poor risk disease/disease status including: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast
             crisis, acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) beyond 2nd

          -  Pregnant women and women who are lactating. Triplex risks to pregnant women are
             unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the administered vaccine, also
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this study

          -  Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., social/ psychological issues, etc.

          -  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to
             comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to
             feasibility/logistics)
