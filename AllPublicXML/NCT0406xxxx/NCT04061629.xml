  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on standard and historical practice, the predictive size of the endotracheal tube (ETT)
      to be used in children has been based on various formulas. However, no study has clearly
      compared these formulas to determine the optimal size of cuffed ETTs. Furthermore, they were
      developed when using a polyvinylchloride cuff and not the thinner polyurethane cuff which is
      in common clinical use today. Hence, the purpose of this current study is to evaluate which
      of the currently available formulas most closely predicts the appropriate size of cuffed ETT
      to be used based not only on the fit within the trachea, but more importantly the intracuff
      pressure after the cuff is inflated to seal the airway.
