  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a multicenter retrospective study that included intravascular ultrasound
      (IVUS) in patients with delayed stent insertion based on fractional flow reserve (FFR) in
      moderately narrowed coronary lesions. We would like to see the effect of lesion
      characteristics on clinical course.

      From January 2007 to August 2014, patients who meet the criteria for selection and exclusion
      from Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital, Seoul National University Hospital, Inje
      University Busan Paik Hospital, and Ulsan University Hospital are included.

        1. Target patient screening The database will select patients who meet the selection and
           exclusion criteria.

        2. target patient characteristics The age, sex, smoking status, medical history
           (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia), diagnosis, and left ventricular blood
           count measured by echocardiography should be checked through a computerized medical
           record.

        3. coronary angiography Coronary angiography images of the subjects in the blinded state
           are analyzed to investigate the length of lesions, reference vessel diameter, and
           minimal vessel diameter.

        4. intravascular ultrasound In the blinded state, the vessel's vessel area, plaque area,
           lumen area, etc. are measured by analyzing intravascular ultrasound images of the
           patient using EchoPlaque (Indec Systems, Mountain View, CA).
