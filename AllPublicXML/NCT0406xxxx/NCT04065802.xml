    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radioablation (STAR) ablation is a safe and feasible option for
      cardiomyopathy patients for management of refractory ventricular tachycardia.

      STAR can be performed with available cardiac imaging, prior mapping/electrogram information,
      and standard ECGs without a multi-electrode ECG vest.

      Study Hypotheses:

        1. Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radioablation (STAR) ablation is a safe and feasible option for
           cardiomyopathy patients for management of refractory ventricular tachycardia.

        2. STAR can be performed with available cardiac imaging, prior mapping/electrogram
           information, and standard ECGs without a multi-electrode ECG vest.

      Study Objectives:

        1. Evaluate the safety of STAR in a local cohort

        2. Estimate effectiveness of STAR in reducing VT burden

      Study Design: Prospective single center, single arm, non-randomized trial.

      Number of patients: 20 patients

      Study Duration: Enrollment will occur over three years and at least minimum follow up of six
      months

      Study Population: Adult patients with a cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia who have
      failed conventional anti-arrhythmic management.

      Primary safety endpoint: Any treatment-related serious adverse events in the first 90 days.

      Primary efficacy endpoint: Reduction in VT episodes tracked by ICD with a six week blanking
      period.

      Statistical methodology: Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test to compare the number of
      treated episodes before and after.

      Assessment of events: Adjudicated by study investigators

      Economic Analysis: Costs and resources required for STAR .Compare costs between the patients
      undergoing STAR with conventional catheter-based VT ablation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        18 years of age and have an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) with:

          1. Structural heart disease: ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy diagnosed with
             cardiac imaging demonstrating either segmental myocardial dysfunction, or presence of
             scar.

          2. At least one of the following monomorphic VT events despite prior attempted catheter
             ablation (or contraindication for ablation), and despite treatment with a class III
             antiarrhythmic drug (contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated):

        A: Sustained monomorphic VT documented on 12-lead ECG or rhythm strip terminated by
        pharmacologic means, DC cardioversion or manual ICD Therapy.

        B: ≥3 episodes of monomorphic VT treated with antitachycardia pacing (ATP), at least one of
        which was symptomatic C: ≥ 5 episodes of monomorphic VT treated with antitachycardia pacing
        (ATP) regardless of symptoms D: ≥1 appropriate ICD shocks, E: ≥3 monomorphic VT episodes
        within 24 hours VT events must be confirmed by ECG/monitor or ICD download.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received prior radiotherapy to the anticipated treatment field

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Unable to unwilling to provide informed consent

          -  New York Heart Association class IV heart failure or inotrope use limiting the safe
             transport to the radiotherapy suite

          -  Patients in whom the only ventricular arrhythmias are ventricular fibrillation,
             torsade de pointes, or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.

          -  Active coronary ischemia in the last 30 days.
