    <textblock>
      Prospective, non-randomized, single-center study of adult subjects referred for
      echocardiography. Total of 200 enrolled subjects at 1 site

      Enrolled subjects will undergo:

      Vivio system data capture, standard of care transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Vivio
      analysis will not be available to non-Avicena personnel

    <description>The Vivio System is an electronic auscultatory device and optical sensor, plus software application intended to provide support to the physician in the evaluation of heart sounds in patients. The product will analyze the acoustic signals of the heart and signals from a captured arterial (carotid) waveform. The analysis procedure will identify and analyze specific heart sounds and arterial waveform features captured by the Vivio device, to devise a scoring system for severe aortic stenosis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult subjects (21 years of age or older).

          2. Referred for transthoracic echocardiography by physician/primary care
             provider/cardiologist.

          3. Willing and able to participate in all study evaluations and allow access to medical
             testing and records.

          4. Ability to understand and sign an informed consent or have a legally authorized
             representative to provide informed consent on behalf of the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock or the need for inotropic/mechanical
             circulatory support.

          2. Need for bedside echocardiogram (inpatient).

          3. Prosthetic device previously implanted at aortic valve position.

          4. Inability to palpate carotid pulse

          5. History of carotid sinus hypersensitivity (i.e. fainting in response to touching or
             positioning the neck).

          6. History of significant carotid artery disease or treatment (surgery, stenting, &gt; 50%
             stenosis in both left and right carotid artery).

          7. Open skin lesions at target site of Vivio examination.
