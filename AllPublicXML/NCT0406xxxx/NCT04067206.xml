    <textblock>
      This study investigated the effects of three interventions —recorded mother's voice, white
      noise, and MiniMuffs, muffs used to attenuate environmental sounds— applied during a heel
      lance on pain and comfort in premature infants. This randomized controlled research was
      conducted in a state hospital tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit. Sixty-four
      premature neonates with a gestational age of 31-36 who were stable, didn't receive mechanic
      ventilation and has been started feeding participated. The infants were randomly assigned to
      four groups: i) white noise , ii) recorded mother's voice, iii) MiniMuffs (earmuff), and iv)
      control. Five minutes before the procedure the white noise and mother's voice played and
      MiniMuffs placed on babies' ears. The heel lance procedure was recorded on a camera. The
      camera recordings were evaluated for premature infants' pain and comfort according to the
      Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) and the Comfort behavior (COMFORTneo) scale.

      Auditory interventions are commonly used during procedural analgesic administration in
      premature neonates. This study investigated the effects of three interventions —recorded
      mother's voice, white noise, and MiniMuffs, muffs used to attenuate environmental sounds—
      applied during a heel lance on pain and comfort in premature infants. This experimental study
      is a randomized controlled research. The data for the research were collected between
      September 2017 - April 2019. The sample comprised 64 premature infants with gestational ages
      of 31-36 weeks, who had been hospitalized at the Neonatal Intensive Cate Units (NICU). All
      infants in the study were in their first postnatal week. The study routine included a heel
      lance procedure to determine the level of bilirubin and hematocrit. The heel lance was
      performed with a lancet and the blood was transferred to the hematocrit pipette. All heel
      lances were conducted by the same nurse. Power analysis was conducted to determine the number
      of samples needed. Predicting that the NIPS score would decrease by 30-35% and decrease from
      6 to 4-4.5 with 0.05 error and 80% power, the intervention groups yielded 64 infants divided
      into four groups of 16 as the target sample number. 80 infants included in the study, taking
      into account the loss of sample. Sixteen infants were excluded from the study. Sixty-four
      premature infants submitted for heel lance were evaluated.The randomization list was prepared
      by a third person using R version 3.1.3 package program and considering the gender factor.
      The list was concealed from the researcher and the family of the baby, and it was given to
      the researcher only during the procedure. The infants were randomly assigned to four groups.
      The infants were randomly assigned to four groups: i) white noise , ii) recorded mother's
      voice, iii) MiniMuffs, and iv) control. Five minutes before the procedure the white noise and
      mother's voice played and MiniMuffs placed on babies' ears. Heel lance procedures were
      recorded with a camera. Camera recording started before the procedure and continued until the
      baby stopped crying. The videos evaluated independently by two scientists (observers) who
      were specialists in neonatal services and pain. Observers evaluated infants' comfort, pain,
      and distress based on NIPS and COMFORTneo. In order to evaluate the agreement between the
      observers for the total scores of NIPS and COMFORTneo, pain estimation, and distress
      estimation, intraclass correlation coefficient were determined.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain (Neonatal Infant Pain Scale-NIPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>During procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Neonatal Infant Pain Scale: The Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), developed by Lawrence et al. (1993), is a behavioral scale and can be used with both full-term and preterm infants. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients of the scale were 0.95, 0.87, and 0.88 before, during, and after the procedure, respectively. In NIPS, five behavioral indicators (facial expression, cry, arms, legs, and state of arousal) and one physiological parameter (breathing pattern) are assessed. Each behavioral indicator is scored with 0 or 1 except &quot;cry&quot;, which has three descriptors (scored with a 0, 1, or 2). The total pain score ranges between 0 and 7 with 0-2 points indicating mild to no pain, 3-4 indicating mild to moderate pain, and &gt;4 indicating severe pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>COMFORT (COMFORTneo Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>during procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The COMFORTneo scale is a Likert-type scale consisting of seven parameters: alertness, calmness/agitation, respiratory response, crying, body movements, facial tension, and muscle tonus. As well as determining comfort, the COMFORTneo scale is a tool that includes the Numerical Assessment Scales, which allow nurses to assess the pain and distress of the baby. &quot;Respiratory response&quot; and &quot;crying&quot; scores were recorded from the infants connected to mechanical ventilators and spontaneously breathing infants, respectively. The lowest score on the scale is 6 and the highest is 30. If the total score of the scale is between 14-30, the baby has pain or distress, is uncomfortable, and needs intervention to provide comfort. In addition, 4-6 points from the Numerical Assessment Scales indicates moderate and 7-10 points indicates severe pain and distress.The validity and reliability study of the Turkish version of the scale was conducted. Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.82-0.92.</description>
