  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to conduct a clinical study in individuals with transradial
      amputations to compare function using a 1-DOF or 2-DOF wrist. All prostheses will be attached
      to a single DOF Otto Bock hand and controlled using a pattern recognition system equivalent
      to the Coapt system. This study will enable the investigator to quantify the relative
      functional value of powered wrist flexion during both in-laboratory testing and home use. In
      addition, the investigators will address the effectiveness of different hand-wrist
      combinations to enhance patient-centered clinical decision making.

      The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the functional importance of a multi
      function wrist compared to a single degree of freedom wrist. This will be accomplished
      through in laboratory testing and an 8-week home trial. The first aim will involve
      in-laboratory functional performance testing with a 1-DOF or a 2-DOF wrist and a one degree
      of freedom hand.

      Changes in performance will be assessed with multiple outcome measures that include both
      quantitative and qualitative testing of prosthesis control and functional performance. The
      second aim will determine how a 2-DOF wrist impacts control and home use of a one degree of
      freedom hand. Subjects will compete an 8 week home based trial. Participants will be
      instructed to complete a written home log of activities and electronic logging usage data
      will also be collected for each experimental condition. The investigators hypothesize that
      adding a wrist flexion/extension module to a wrist rotation module and a single-DOF terminal
      device will provide significant improvements in function for transradial amputees.

Using blocked randomization, which will be achieve using a simple randomization script written in
Matlab. The two study conditions that will be analyzed are:
Condition A—a single DOF terminal device with a 1-DOF (rotation) wrist Condition B—a single DOF terminal device with a 2-DOF (rotation + flexion/extension) wrist
Condition A is the control condition in this project as it represents the state-of-the-art in clinical care. Condition B is the experimental arm.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Measuring the function of upper limb prostheses is challenging and requires multiple test formats. A toolkit of functional outcome tests recommend by the Academy of Prosthetics and Orthotics ULPOM committee will be used to measure functional effectiveness of prosthetic treatment will be used as the primary outcome measure. The outcome measures to evaluate prosthesis use includes both quantitative and qualitative testing of prosthesis control and functional performance.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks for Condition A; Baseline and 8 weeks for Condition B</time_frame>
    <description>An objective test of unilateral hand function that can be used to evaluate functionality of passive, mechanical, or myoelectric hands without bias to type [31]. Movement of abstract objects (classified into six prehension patterns) and activities of daily living are timed by the subject. Scores are compared to a normalized, able-bodied control score of 100.</description>

    <measure>Modified Box and Blocks Test of Manual Dexterity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks for Condition A; Baseline and 8 weeks for Condition B</time_frame>
    <description>A timed test that evaluates gross manual dexterity. Small (1-inch) blocks are moved one at a time from one side of a box to the other over a wooden partition. The final score is the number of blocks transferred in 1 minute, typically averaged over three trials. For this test, only opening and closing of the terminal device is required, although subjects with transradial amputations do typically use compensatory movements. It is possible that a 2-DOF wrist may move inadvertently and impair performance on this task. As a result, we would view either an improvement or no change in this score to be a positive finding.</description>

    <description>An observational assessment tool that measures the subject's ability to control a myoelectric hand. The ability to control gripping, holding, releasing, and coordinating 30 items is scored on a 4-point capability scale. The prosthetic hand is used in an active assist or passive support role. Rasch analysis is used to convert capability ratings to a single measure of each subject's functional ability. Both Ms Turner and Dr. Miller are trained to complete this assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>For the TAC Test, participants must move the virtual hand into a target posture and hold it there for a preset period of time. The TAC Test can require movement of from one to all available degrees of freedom (e.g. hand grasp plus wrist motion). Results are measured in terms of classification accuracy, completion rate, completion time, and path efficiency. This test will be used to ensure that subjects have satisfactory PR control over all DOFs prior to starting their home trial.</description>

             with study requirements, ability to communicate experiences, or ability to give
             informed consent: The ability to understand and comply with requirements of the study
             is essential in order for the study to generate useable, reliable data. The ability to
             obtain relevant user feedback through questionnaires and informal discussion adds
             significant value to this study.
