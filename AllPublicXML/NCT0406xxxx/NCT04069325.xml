  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of simiaowan in prevention of
      acute flares in chronic gout patients initiating febuxostat therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial. To
      determine whether oral simiaowan at standard clinical doses (6g twice daily), compared to
      placebo, can reduce the incidence of acute gout flares and decrease the serum uric acid
      level.

    <intervention_model_description>72 subjects will be randomized to two parallel groups (36 subjects per group) to receive simiaowan 6g twice daily or placebo. All subjects will be given febuxostat 40mg once daily as background therapy. Placebo will be administered to individuals randomized to that treatment group in a form identical to the simiaowan. The first investigational medicinal product dose will be administered the day after the randomization.</intervention_model_description>
