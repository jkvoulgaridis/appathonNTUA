             inclusive

          -  Must be in good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, ECG,
             serum/urine biochemistry, hematology, and serology tests

          -  Negative hepatitis panel and negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)antibody
             screens

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men who are sexually active with WOCBP
             must use acceptable method(s) of contraception. The individual methods of
             contraception and duration should be determined in consultation with the investigator.
             WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the
             investigational drug is less than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a
             period of 30 days after the last dose of investigational product.

          -  Women must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the start of
             investigational product.

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding.

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men that are sexually active with WOCBP must
             follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug
             is less than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 90 days after
             the last dose of investigational product.

          -  Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or
             surgically sterile) and azoospermic men do not require contraception.

             seizure), cardiovascular, psychiatric (including known addictive disorders),
             musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological, or dermatological disorders, including
             all cancers

          -  Any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the investigator in
             consultation with the BMS Medical Monitor, could jeopardize the subject's safety,
             tolerability, or pharmacokinetics of 18F-BMS-986327.&quot;

          -  Any major surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration - Existence of a cold,
             upper respiratory tract infection, or fever within 5 days prior to check-in

          -  Presence or history of any abnormality or illness that may affect absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or elimination of the study drug

          -  Donation of blood or plasma (exclude the screening visit) within 2 months prior to
             check in through end of synthesis (EOS), inclusive
