  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment and treatment of Septic Shock (SS) is a thorny issue in current care. Fluid
      resuscitation is one of the key measures for SS treatment. Current fluid resuscitation is
      dominated by empirical treatment or early target-directed therapy. The former has a clear
      goal of recovery, and the latter is complicated to implement and has many complications. It
      is known that patients with SS due to insufficient tissue perfusion, the distribution of
      blood flow in the peripheral center to the center, may lead to an increase in the
      central-peripheral-room temperature difference, suggesting that this index has potential
      value for direction of fluid resuscitation. This study intends to measure the severity of SS
      and efficacy of fluid resuscitation by measuring the &quot;central-peripheral-room temperature&quot;
      gradient of patients as well as comparing temperature gradient with hemodynamic indexes
      (PICCO) and indexes of ultrasound capacity assessment, providing more convenient indicators
      for sepsis and fluid resuscitation assessment.

    <textblock>
      Sepsis remains a great challenge for clinicians. Early and timely fluid resuscitation is the
      basic measure for the treatment of sepsis. It is important to quickly diagnose the severity
      of sepsis and evaluate the effects of fluid resuscitation. Existing monitoring methods such
      as blood pressure, urine volume, blood lactate, central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2),
      cardiac output (CO), stroke volume variability (SVV), etc. have certain limitations or
      invasive disadvantages. Clinically, effective and convenient non-invasive means are needed
      for monitoring. Present research revealed that microcirculatory dysfunction and tissue
      hypoperfusion have a very important role in the pathophysiological mechanism of sepsis, and
      will be associated with severe organ dysfunction, which is closely related to serious adverse
      prognosis. Importantly, tissue hypoperfusion can cause central and peripheral body
      temperature changes. Studies have shown that clinical assessment of peripheral skin
      temperature can identify potential severe organ dysfunction in patients with stable
      hemodynamics. The latest study found that patients with septic shock have greater
      central-peripheral body temperature differences than sepsis patients, and the temperature
      difference between peripheral-room temperature is smaller. That is, the
      central-peripheral-room temperature gradient changes show a reduction of tissue perfusion,
      suggesting microcirculatory disorders and organ dysfunction. In addition, the body
      temperature gradient is simple and non-invasive, and is a bedside indicator that predicts
      tissue perfusion.
