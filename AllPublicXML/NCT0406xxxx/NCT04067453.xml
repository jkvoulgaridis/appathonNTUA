  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      External anal sphincter is a Skeletal muscle under voluntary control. As described in
      previous studies, it is mainly composed of type 1 fibers. Fatigability is a concept which has
      been studied and described many times in skeletal limbs muscles. Two types of fatigue are
      described, peripheral of central fatigue. Fatigue can been physiologic but also pathologic
      (due to an affection of the muscle, the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous
      system). Many tools have been used to measure muscle fatigability (direct strength measure on
      isometric contraction, electromyography, echography, oxymetry...).

      Besides many fatiguing methods have been developed for every each muscle depending on its
      histological structure.

      Anal sphincter fatigability has already been described in few manometric studies with
      particularly 2 measures: Fatigue Rate and Fatigue Rate Index. Moreover, no fatiguing protocol
      has been standardized to study it.

      The primary aim of this study is to define a fatiguing protocol for external anal sphincter
      in order to study it in further studies. Secondary aims are to assess Electromyography as a
      tool for measuring this fatigability and finally to assess the link between anal sphincter
      fatigability and symptoms reported by patients.

      Patients over 18 years old, consulting for an Anorectal Manometry with a voluntary command on
      the external anal sphincter are included.

      History and treatment, height, weight, sex, age, Fatigue impact scale, digestive symptoms
      with Neurologic Bowel Disorders score and Wexner scale, urinary tract symptoms with Urinary
      Symptom Profile (USP) score and electromyography (Root Mean Square (RMS) and Mean Power
      Frequency (MPF)) and manometric data (contraction peak, fatigue rate, fatigue rate index)
      were recorded.

      The fatiguing protocol consists in 10 sustained external anal sphincter contractions with
      maximal voluntary contraction of 20 seconds followed by 10 seconds of resting. A training
      contraction is made before the fatiguing protocol. At the end of the protocol, patients
      undergo a classical anorectal manometry.

      Primary outcome is the difference on root mean square in electromyography between the first
      and the last fatiguing contraction.

      Secondary outcomes were mean power frequency and manometric data (i.e. Fatigue Rate index
      (FRI), Fatigue Rate (FR), contraction Peak)

      Influence of age, sex, symptoms, pathologies, weight on fatigability will be studied in a
      second analysis
