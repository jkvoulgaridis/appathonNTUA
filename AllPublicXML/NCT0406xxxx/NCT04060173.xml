        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be medically documented as healthy and acceptable at screening.

          -  Subjects must have serum uric acid level at screening ≥ 7.0 mg/dL for men, ≥ 6.0 mg/dL
             for women.

          -  Subjects must have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0 and 34.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Subjects must have a body weight of 50 kg or higher.

          -  The subject agrees to abstain from alcohol consumption for 48 hours prior to dosing,
             for the duration of the in-house study period, and for 48 hours prior to each
             in-clinic follow up visit.

          -  The subject is a nonsmoker.

          -  Women must be non-pregnant and non-lactating, and either surgically sterile or
             postmenopausal for ≥ 12 months.

          -  Men must be surgically sterile, abstinent or if engaged in sexual relations with a
             female partner of child-bearing potential, the participant must be using a condom with
             spermicide from Screening and for a period of 30 days after the last dose of Study
             Drug. The Investigator will assess the adequacy of methods of contraception on a
             case-by-case basis.

          -  Subjects must have a complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count within the normal
             range or considered not clinically significant by the principal investigator.

          -  Other than elevated serum uric acid, subjects must have normal blood chemistry or
             results considered not clinically significant by the investigator.

          -  Subjects must have a normal urinalysis or results considered not clinically
             significant by the investigator including a normal protein/creatinine ratio per local
             lab reference ranges (≤ 200 mg/g) and a urine creatinine result that does not exceed
             300 mg/dL. Any out of range values may be repeated per Investigator discretion.

          -  Subjects must have a normal ECG or results considered not clinically significant by
             the principal investigator.

          -  Subjects must be able to comply with the study and follow-up procedures.

          -  Subjects are able to understand the study procedures and risks involved and must
             provide signed informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any history or clinical manifestations of significant metabolic,
             hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurologic, hepatic,
             renal, urological, or psychiatric disorders.

          -  Subjects who are positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B surface
             antigen, and/or Hepatitis C virus.

          -  Subjects who have used prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal remedies
             within 3 weeks before Day 1 of study medication dosing.

          -  Subjects who are positive for urine drug and alcohol screening tests.

          -  Subjects who have undergone major surgery within 3 months prior to Day 1.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Subjects who received any investigational test article within 5 half-lives or 30 days,
             whichever is longer, prior to Day 1 study medication dosing.

          -  Recent blood donation for more than 500 mL within 2 months of screening.

          -  Abnormal ECG including QTc &gt; 470 (F) and &gt; 450 (M).

          -  Subjects who consumed Seville oranges- or grapefruit-containing foods or beverages
             within 7 days before Day 1 and during the entire study duration.

          -  Subjects with any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would place
             him/her at undue risk, or potentially compromise the results or interpretation of the
             study.

          -  Prior exposure to ABP-671.
