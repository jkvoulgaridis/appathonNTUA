    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib in combination with
      nab-paclitaxel or trastuzumab with nab-paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy in early stage or
      locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      The study evaluate the pathological complete response rate, event-free survival, disease-free
      survival, overall survival and safety of pyrotinib in combination with nab-paclitaxel or
      trastuzumab with nab-paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy in early stage or locally advanced
      HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will receive 4 cycles of pyrotinib in combination with
      nab-paclitaxel or 4 cycles of trastuzumab with nab-paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy, then
      undergo surgery, then receive 4 cycles of epirubicin in combination with cyclophosphamide,
      then complete 1 year of trastuzumab.
