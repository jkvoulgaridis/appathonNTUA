  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether a combination of two drugs, dasatinib
      (D) and quercetin (Q) [D+Q], penetrate the brain using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in older
      adults with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). This combination of drug therapy has been shown
      to affect dying cells in humans with other chronic illnesses and in Alzheimer's mice models.
      The study team want to know if this combination of medications will reach the brain in order
      to evaluate if this intervention may be effective for treating AD symptoms in future studies.
      This is also known as a &quot;proof of concept&quot; study.

  <detailed_description>

      Up to 40 potential candidates will be pre-screened to identify eligible men and women ages 65
      years and over with a clinical diagnosis of early AD on a stable dose of cholinesterase
      inhibitors for at least 3 months (for example, Aricept).

      Eligible participants will undergo laboratory assessments of blood and urine, receive study
      medications over a twelve week period, and complete pre- and post-treatment testing
      including: an MRI for digital imaging of the brain; lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal
      fluid; memory and thinking assessments; quality of life questionnaires; and tests of walking,
      balance and strength, all of which will be done for research purposes only.

      Participants must be accompanied by a Legally Authorized Representative and have no travel
      plans for 4-5 months that would interfere with study visits.
