  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs), an evidence-based early autism
      spectrum disorder (ASD) intervention approach, target key behaviors that help language
      development. While efforts to use NDBIs are increasing worldwide, important gaps in our
      knowledge remain on whether the behaviors targeted by NDBIs are cross-culturally valid. This
      study in South Africa, a multi-cultural setting, will provide critical information on NDBI
      treatment targets and a novel digital outcome measure of treatment response.

    <description>The Griffiths Scales of Child Development, Third Edition (Griffiths III) is a comprehensive, developmental measure for continuous use from birth to 6 years (72 months). Although not standardized in South Africa (standardization samples are from the United Kingdom and Ireland), this developmental assessment is widely used in South Africa. The Griffiths III provides an overall measure of a child's development, as well as an individual profile of strengths and needs across five areas: Foundations of Learning; Language and Communication; Eye and Hand Coordination; Personal-Social-Emotional; and Gross Motor.</description>

    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3) is an individually-administered measure of adaptive behavior that is widely used to assess individuals with intellectual, developmental, and other disabilities. The Vineland-3 contains 5 domains each with 2-3 subdomains. The main domains are:Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, Motor Skills, and Maladaptive Behavior. The Caregiver Interview Form uses the Vineland semistructured interview technique to elicit information about the examinee's adaptive functioning from a parent or caregiver.</description>

    <description>SenseToKnow is an app developed for mobile devices that is designed to elicit autism risk behaviors. In order to administer the app, children sit on the parent's lap with the mobile device at eye level for the child. The app is comprised of a set of stimuli (videos and games) that are designed to elicit autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms, such as facial expressions. Multi-modal time-series video-frame-level data streams from the computer vision analysis output of SenseToKnow will be summarized with descriptive statistics and visualizations. We extract landmarks and determine the correct features from them to yield precise measurements of attention, gaze, affect, and posture. Each computer vision analysis feature will be transformed into one or more binary, count, or continuous participant-level summary variable (for e.g. number of times orienting to name).</description>

    <description>Twelve one hour sessions, skill is introduced by &quot;Help is in your hands&quot; Community ESDM videos. Session skills include specific strategies caregivers can use to increase their child's attention to people and their child's communication; strategies to identify, create and use joint activity routines to engage with and teach their child; in addition to ways to use the ABCs of learning to teach their child new behaviors. &quot;Help is in your hands&quot; Community ESDM materials also provide video examples of other caregivers using the session skill with their child. The early childhood development practitioner then coaches the caregiver in the session skill, in at least two activities. The goal of coaching was to provide enough support for the caregiver to experience success in implementing the new skill with their child. Coaching is followed by caregiver reflection and a discussion of generalization of the new skill across various daily activities, using a daily activities visual aid.</description>
