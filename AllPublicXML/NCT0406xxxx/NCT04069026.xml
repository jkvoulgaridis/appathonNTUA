  <brief_title>A First-in-Humans Dose Finding Study for an Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Inhibitor (AhRi) in Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to gather relevant information regarding the safety of
      BAY2416964 and how well the drug works in participants with a type of solid tumors that
      cannot be cured by currently available drugs. Researchers want to find the highest dose of
      BAY2416964 that participants could take without having too many side effects, how the drug is
      tolerated and the way the body absorbs, distributes and gets rid of the study dug. BAY2416964
      is a small molecule which blocks the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (a protein involved in immune
      cell reaction to tumor cells) allowing the body to use its immune response against the tumor
      cells.
