  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the efficacy of tailored anti-microbial
      susceptibility guided-therapy via gastric juice PCR, compared with empirical standard triple
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eradication of H. pylori is an important clinical issue due to its association with many
      gastrointestinal diseases such as peptic ulcer and even gastric cancer. However, with the
      global trend of increasing antibiotic resistance, the eradication rate of
      clarithromycin-based standard triple therapy has declined to less than 80%. To overcome such
      alarming antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial susceptibility-guided therapy is recommended.
      However, the literature on gastric juice PCR as susceptibility-guided therapy is scant;
      therefore, the investigators conducted this prospective randomized controlled trial with the
      aim of investigating the efficacy of antibiotic susceptibility-guided therapy via gastric
      juice PCR for first-line eradication.

    <description>In the group of gastric juice susceptibility-guided therapy, the eradication regimen was based on the susceptibility results of gastric PCR. If clarithromycin was sensitive, the regimen contained rabeprazole 20mg B.I.D, amoxicillin 1000mg B.I.D, and clarithromycin 500mg B.I.D for seven days. If clarithromycin was resistant and levofloxacin was sensitive, the regimen was rabeprazole 20mg B.I.D, amoxicillin 1000mg B.I.D, and levofloxacin 500mg QD for seven days. If clarithromycin and levofloxacin were both resistant, the regimen was either reverse-hybrid therapy (rabeprazole 20mg B.I.D x 14 days, amoxicillin 1000mg B.I.D, x 14 days, clarithromycin 500mg B.I.D for 7 days, and metronidazole 500mg B.I.D for 7 days) or high dose dual therapy (rabeprazole 20mg Q.I.D and amoxicillin 1000mg Q.I.D for 14 days). Owing to this open design, either reverse-hybrid therapy or high dose dual therapy was chosen by doctors' preference.</description>
