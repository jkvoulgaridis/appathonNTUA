      This study investigates whether blood monocytes' surface bound- immunoglobulin E affects the
      innate immune responses against herpes simplex viruses in atopic dermatitis patients with
      eczema herpeticum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some of atopic dermatitis patients (AD) have severe herpes simplex viral (HSV) infections,
      which could cause erosive skin lesions all over the body. This condition is termed as eczema
      herpeticum (ADEH+). Scientists have found that ADEH+ patients have significantly increased
      blood immunoglobulin (Ig) E compared to AD patients without eczema herpeticum and healthy
      people. Increased IgE in blood could bound to immune cells' surface, such as monocytes. Since
      monocytes serve as the first line defense to fight viral infection, their surface-bound IgE
      may interfere their anti-viral immune responses, and consequently results in more severe
      viral infections. The purpose of this study is to learn more about how increased IgE affect
      body's immune ability to fight herpes simplex viruses. This study includes three groups: AD
      patient without eczema herpeticum complication(ADEH-); AD patient with eczema herpeticum
      complication(ADEH+) and healthy controls. Study results will be compared between groups.
