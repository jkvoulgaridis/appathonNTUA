  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, single-arm clinical study will evaluate the probable benefit
      and safety of the LIPOSORBER® LA-15 System for the treatment of adult patients with nephrotic
      syndrome associated with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, when the standard
      treatment options, including corticosteroid and/or calcineurin inhibitors treatments, have
      been unsuccessful or not well tolerated, and the patient has a GFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2, or the
      patient has post-renal transplant recurrence. Treatment for FSGS is considered unsuccessful
      if the patient is unresponsive to standard therapy (e.g., at least 8 weeks of
      corticosteroids) and fails to achieve complete or partial remission. A standard treatment is
      considered not well tolerated if the patient experiences severe side effects without
      providing an acceptable level of clinical benefit.

      This study will enroll up to 35 adult patients at 3-10 clinical sites. The duration of the
      treatment phase of the study will take approximately 9 weeks for a total of 12 apheresis
      treatments with the LIPOSORBER® LA-15 System; the treatments will be given twice weekly for 3
      weeks followed by once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients will undergo follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 12,
      and 24 months after the final apheresis treatment.

      This study is conducted as a Post Approval Study imposed by Humanitarian Device Exemption
      (HDE) order to confirm the safety and efficacy of the LIPOSORBER® LA-15 System in the
      treatment of drug-resistant primary FSGS and post Transplant recurrence.

    <description>LIPOSORBER® LA-15 is a blood purification therapy; selectively removes apoprotein B-containing lipoproteins such as LDL from circulating blood and rapidly reduces the plasma cholesterol level. It was originally developed for prevention of coronary atherosclerosis progression in patients with serious hyperlipidemia such as familial hypercholesterolemia.
In the late 1980's, LDL-A was used to improve dyslipidemia in Nephrotic Syndrome, initially to prevent organ damage. LDL-A was found to improve both the dyslipidemic condition and clinical symptoms (proteinuria and hypoproteinemia).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient is deemed suitable for inclusion in the study if the patient has nephrotic
        syndrome associated with primary FSGS when:

        • Standard treatment options, including corticosteroid and/or calcineurin inhibitors, are
        unsuccessful or not well tolerated and the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 60
        ml/min/1.73 m2.

        or

        • The patient is post renal transplantation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General Exclusion Criteria

             There may be unknown risks to an embryo/fetus. Sexually active women of childbearing
             potential should avoid pregnancy during the use of the LIPOSORBER device and

             hours prior to each apheresis treatment (Note: The time period to withhold ACE
             inhibitors should be prolonged, if determined by the treating physician, considering
             each individual's renal function and the biological half-life of the ACE-inhibitor
             currently in use.)

          2. Currently being administered antihypertensive drugs other than ACE inhibitors (e.g.,

          7. Cardiac impairments such as uncontrolled arrhythmia, unstable angina, decompensated
             congestive heart failure, or valvular disease
