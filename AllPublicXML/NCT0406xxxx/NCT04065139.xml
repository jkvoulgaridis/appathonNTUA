  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal metastasis is a common pattern in advanced gastric cancer leading to a terminal
      condition in a very short time. Whatever recent progress regarding systemic chemotherapy
      using multi drugs association median survival is limited to 6 months with altered quality of
      life (QoL) after 4 months for all patients. We postulated that a new innovative health
      technology for delivering intraperitoneal pressurized aerosol of chemotherapy (Doxorubicin
      and Cisplatin) during laparoscopy can transform that situation offering to double the
      survival with QoL preservation. Interestingly, PIPAC procedure is made to be applied
      repeatedly, every 4 to 6 weeks. This therapeutic strategy allows to improved Intra Peritoneal
      (IP) drugs impregnation and maintained Intra-Veinous (IV) chemotherapy meanwhile. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate and compare 24-month progression free-survival in
      patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastric cancer treated either with IV chemotherapy
      and Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) or with IV chemotherapy alone,
      with preservation of quality of life.
