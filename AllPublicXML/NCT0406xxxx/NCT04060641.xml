  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a multi-gene panel to determine
      which subjects are likely to respond to renal denervation therapy with Medtronic's Symplicity
      Spyral™ multi-electrode renal denervation system.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess if renal denervation (RDN) effectiveness using the
      Symplicity SpyralTM multi-electrode renal denervation system is associated with ranked
      genomic scoring from the Geneticure multi-gene algorithm for renal denervation. The present
      study will assess if subjects who have a high genetic score, based on the hypothesized
      importance of the organ systems involved, will have differential responsiveness to RDN in a
      descending order. The genetic scoring is collectively ranked in a specific order, in that:

        -  Subjects with a &quot;high level of general functionality&quot; (functionality in the sympathetic
           nervous system (SNS), cardiac, vascular (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)),
           and renal system genotypes will be most responsive to RDN.

        -  Subjects with high number of functional genotypes of SNS, cardiac, and RAAS will be the
           next most responsive group.

        -  Subjects with functionality in genotypes of SNS and cardiac systems will demonstrate the
           next most responsive group.

        -  Subjects with functionality in the SNS genotypes will demonstrate some degree of
           responsiveness.

        -  Subjects with functionality in the renal system, but not SNS, cardiac, nor RAAS, will be
           the least responsive to this therapy.
