    <textblock>
      This phase II/III trial studies how well circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA)
      testing in the blood works in predicting treatment for patients with stage IIA colon cancer
      after surgery. ctDNA are circulating tumor cells that are shed by tumors into the blood.
      Finding ctDNA in the blood means that there is very likely some small amounts of cancer that
      remain after surgery. However, this cancer, if detected, cannot be found on other tests
      usually used to find cancer, as it is too small. Testing for ctDNA levels may help identify
      patients with colon cancer after surgery who do benefit, and those who do not benefit, from
      receiving chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rate of ctDNA clearance in &quot;ctDNA detected&quot; patients treated with or
      without adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of stage IIA colon cancer. (Phase II) II.
      To compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) in &quot;ctDNA detected&quot; patients treated with or
      without adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of stage IIA colon cancer. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the prevalence of detectable ctDNA in patients with stage IIA colon cancer
      following surgical resection.

      II. To estimate time-to-event outcomes (overall survival [OS], recurrence-free survival
      [RFS], and time to recurrence [TTR]) by ctDNA marker status and treatment for patients with
      resected stage IIA colon cancer.

      III. To estimate the rate of compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or active surveillance
      for patients with resected stage IIA colon cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the association of quantitative ctDNA levels with time to event outcomes (RFS,
      OS, and TTR).

      II. To characterize genomic profiles associated with recurrence using a ctDNA assay in
      patients with resected stage IIA colon cancer.

      III. To model the cost effectiveness of the use of ctDNA versus standard of care in this
      setting.

      IV. To evaluate performance of a ctDNA assay after incorporation of patient tumor and
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (BLOOD STORED AND TESTED FOR ctDNA LATER): Patients undergo active surveillance.

      ARM II (BLOOD TESTED FOR ctDNA AT BASELINE): Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (ctDNA DETECTED): At the discretion of the investigator, patients receive either
      oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1, leucovorin IV over 2 hours on day 1,
      and fluorouracil IV bolus over 2-4 minutes on day 1 and then by continuous IV over 46-48
      hours repeated every 14 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity or oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 repeated every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II (ctDNA NOT DETECTED): Patients undergo active surveillance.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 months and then every 6
      months for 2 years.

             to Gilbert?s disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and

          -  Alkaline phosphatase must be &lt; 2.5 x ULN for the lab (within 28 days before
             randomization); and

             clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula for patients with creatinine
             levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN for the lab (within 28 days before randomization).

          -  Pregnancy test (urine or serum according to institutional standard) done within 14
             days before randomization must be negative (for women of childbearing potential only).

          -  Patients receiving a coumarin-derivative anticoagulant must agree to weekly monitoring
             of international normalized ratio (INR) if they are randomized to Arm 2 and receive
             capecitabine.

          -  Colon cancer histology other than adenocarcinoma (i.e., neuroendocrine carcinoma,
             sarcoma, lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc.).

          -  Pathologic, clinical, or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease. This includes
             isolated, distant, or non-contiguous intra-abdominal metastases, even if resected
             (including the presence of satellite nodules constituting N1c disease in the absence
             of lymph node involvement).

          -  Tumor-related bowel perforation.

          -  History of prior invasive colon malignancy, regardless of disease-free interval.

          -  History of organ transplantation.

          -  Any prior systemic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy; or radiation

             not permitted).

          -  Other invasive malignancy within 5 years before randomization. Exceptions are colonic
             polyps, non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix.

               -  Clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation,
                  symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, active myocardial
                  ischemia, or indwelling temporary pacemaker.

               -  Ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia that requires treatment

          -  Co-morbid illnesses or other concurrent disease that, in the judgement of the
             clinician obtaining informed consent, would make the patient inappropriate for entry
             into this study (i.e., unable to tolerate 6 months of combination chemotherapy or
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the
             prescribed regimens or prevent required follow-up).
