  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative fasting is intended to lower the amount of gastric contents in order to decrease
      the incidence of aspiration associated with endotracheal intubation. However, recent studies
      show that longer fasting time does not reduce aspiration associated complications. Especially
      in pediatric patients, long fasting time increases patients' unpleasantness and therefore
      increases postoperative recovery quality. It also induces hypoglycemia. In many studies,
      ingesting clear liquids 2 hours up to general anesthesia decreases gastric contents and
      therefore the incidence of aspiration pneumonia, postoperative nausea and vomiting. Therefore
      anesthesiologist associations in the US and Europe recommend to drink small amount of clear
      liquid (water) up to 2 hours before the surgery.

      Nuss bar operation, or repair surgery of pectus excavatum is mostly done in pediatric
      patients. The procedure itself is very painful, requiring paramount amount of analgesics. Use
      of opioid analgesics increases postoperative nausea and vomiting.

      In this study, our aim is to evaluate preoperative fasting time and how preoperative
      supplement of clear liquid affects the quality of recovery postoperatively.

    <measure>Modified-Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively at the surgery waiting room</time_frame>
    <description>MyPas scale measures 4 categories: Activity, Vocalizations, Emotional Expressivity and State of Apprent Arousal. Each category has 1 to 4 scales for activity, emotional expresivity and state of apprent arousal, and 1 to 6 for vocalizations, that each describes the child's anxiety status. The observer collects total score ranging from 4 to 18.</description>
