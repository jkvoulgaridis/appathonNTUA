  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VOICE Of bvFTD study is a telephone interview research study about life with or at risk
      for behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The study aims to understand how
      bvFTD impacts individuals' day to day lives, how people think about themselves, and what
      challenges they face.

      The VOICE Of bvFTD study is a study being conducted at the University of Pennsylvania. The
      study was developed and initiated in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
      Public Health and the National Human Genome Research Institute. The goal of this study is to
      learn more about what it is like to live with or at high risk of developing behavioral
      variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The study will involve telephone interviews to help
      learn as much as possible about living with bvFTD. The hope is that this will guide future
      research, resource development, and clinical practice.

      Participants will have at least two phone calls from the study team. During the initial phone
      call, which will take about 15 to 20 minutes, the participant will be asked some basic
      questions about demographics and the study details will be reviewed as part of the consent
      process. During another call the participant will be asked some questions to assess his or
      her thinking, and will complete the interview which will last about 30 to 60 minutes. There
      are no physical or medical procedures included in this study. The consent process, screening,
      interview scheduling, and the interview itself will take place over two or three phone calls,
      which may occur over several weeks.

      A person may be able to take part in this study if they are a person with bvFTD, or if they
      have been found to have a genetic change that causes bvFTD.

        Participants for the study will be recruited through the University of Pennsylvania and
        ClinicalTrials.gov. Previously, participants were also recruited through Johns Hopkins
        University, through a dementia research study at the National Institutes of Health, through
        the Penn FTD Center Caregiver Conference, and through through a private Facebook group for
        individuals with C9orf72 mutations.
