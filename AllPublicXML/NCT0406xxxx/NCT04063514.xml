    <textblock>
      The limitation of treating intrinsic brain pathologies has been circumvented with
      neurosurgical techniques; however, less invasive approaches may be desirable particularly for
      widespread or multifocal disease and when long term and repetitive administration is
      required. This study seeks to investigate the efficacy of focused ultrasound combined with
      microbubbles in opening the blood brain barrier.

      Patients with either low grade gliomas or neurodegenerative dementias will be evaluated for
      study candidacy. Participants will receive an intravenous infusion of Definity micro bubbles
      in tandem with focused ultrasound; a pre-and-post fMRI will be obtained to evaluate any
      changes in perfusion.

      There are no immediate benefits for patients who choose to participate; however, the
      information gained from this study will contribute to the research base and help patients in
      similar situations in the future.

    <textblock>
      Treatment of intrinsic brain diseases is challenging because brain barrier (BBB) limits the
      delivery of drugs, particulates and cellular elements such as stem cells to the central
      nervous system (CNS). This limitation is often circumvented with neurosurgical techniques,
      however, less invasive approaches may be desirable particularly for widespread or multifocal
      disease and when long term and repetitive administration is required.

      The diagnosis for the participants will be either low grade gliomas. A baseline fMRI and
      follow up routine fMRI's will be taken and evaluated for any changes in perfusion. During the
      scans, The ultrasound placement will last for one hour, during which, there will be an
      infusion of Definity microbubbles intravenously over ten to thirty minutes as per routine
      approved application.

      This study seeks to investigate the efficacy of focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles
      in opening the blood brain barrier. This physiological effect would have significant clinical
      applications. The ability to open the blood brain barrier has the potential to revolutionize
      the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain, allowing for more localized and efficient
      delivery. There are no immediate benefits for patients who choose to participate; however,
      the information gained from this study will contribute to the research base and help patients
      in similar situations in the future.

    <description>Some functional neuroimaging scans (e.g., high resolution T1-weighted images; Arterial Spin Labeling [ASL]; Dynamic Contrast Enhanced [DCE] perfusion sequences; post-contrast T1-weighted images, Susceptibility Weighted Imaging [SWI], T2 weighted imaging, and T2 Flair) will be used to evaluate longitudinal changes in perfusion as an efficacy measure. The scans will be acquired within one hour before and after the study procedures of focused transcranial ultrasound and infusion of definity microbubbles. Voxel-based comparisons showing perfusion values relative to the acquired data range will be used for quantification and comparison of baseline and post-procedure scans.</description>

    <description>With focused ultrasound, there is an expected accentuation of local perfusion and potential temporary opening of the blood brain barrier with the aim is to provide better delivery of therapeutic agents including medication, particulates and cellular elements for treatment of neoplastic, inflammatory and degenerative brain diseases. The present study seeks to investigate differences in perfusion between areas treated and untreated by this modality in order to further explore its use in clinical application for the treatment of brain disease.</description>
