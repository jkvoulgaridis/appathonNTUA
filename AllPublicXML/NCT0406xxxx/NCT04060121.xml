      The purpose of this study is study bowel symptoms, quality of life, and personal factors that
      may affect your health. In Aim 1 of this study participants will be invited to complete 6
      survey-based questionnaires online.

      In Aim 2 of this study will monitor the effectiveness of a 12 week therapy program on bowel
      symptoms and overall quality of life.

      For Aim 1, investigators will conduct a cross-sectional survey study examining prevalence of
      early adverse life events and post-trauamatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with
      constipation-predominant IBS or chronic constipation.

      For Aim 2, investigators will recruit and enroll individuals who have a history of early
      adverse life events or possible PTSD for a 12 week outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy
      program as outlined below:

      Visit 1 (Participants will present to the GI Office at one of our dedicated locations
      including the downtown Digestive and Liver Disorders (DaLD) clinic, Springmill Clinic, or IU
      North Multispeciality Clinic) At this screening visit, participants do the following:

        -  Read and sign the informed consent after all your questions about the study will be
           answered

        -  Have a medical history taken including demographics, symptoms and history of illness

        -  Medications will be reviewed

        -  A physical exam will be performed by the physician.

        -  Vital signs will be measured.

        -  Participants will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires

        -  Participants will be provided a bowel pattern diary to record bowel symptoms over the
           course of the study

        -  The study visit may take 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete

      Day 1-15 (Run-In Phase):

      â€¢ Participants be asked to record stool symptoms and patterns in a diary daily starting from
      Day 1 to Day 15. The daily dairy can either be completed on paper or by phone or on the web.

      Day 16-100 (Visit 2-13): During this time, participants will undergo regular sessions with a
      dedicated GI psychologist. They will receive one 60-minute session every week for 10-12
      weeks. The treatment schedule will include education on the relationship between bowel
      symptoms and stressful life events with instructions on ways to cope and manage symptoms
      through the use of relaxation techniques, such as breathing exercises and other methods for
      self calming. During the 10 to 12 weeks of therapy, participants will be given assignments
      and asked to monitor your progress.

      Visit 14:

        -  After participants have completed your treatment sessions, they will be asked to fill
           out the same questionnaires that they completed at the screening visit.

        -  We will also confirm completion of the study.

        All adults' ages 18 years or older will be eligible for participation. We will solicit
        participation and extend survey invitations to participants who have undergone clinical
        evaluation for constipation with anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion testing at the
        IU GI Motility Laboratory.
