  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the known link between dietary patterns and disease, it has been observed that the
      specific response of each individual to dietary components highly varied, and this may limit
      the impact of the nutritional interventions to improve public health. These observations
      provided the basis to the development of the Nutritional Genomics at the beginning of the
      90s, which main goal was to study the interaction between dietary factors and the genome that
      modulate phenotypic expression. From this idea, in the recent years, Precision Nutrition has
      been emerged as a therapeutic approach that takes into account all individual's
      characteristics to develop targeted nutritional advices. The main goal of Precision Nutrition
      is to maintain or improve health by using genetics, phenotypic, clinical, dietary and other
      information to provide more precise and more efficacious personalized healthy eating advice
      and to motivate appropriate dietary changes. However, all the genotype-dependent advice must
      be based on scientific evidence. Most of the available evidence in support of personalized
      nutrition has come from observational studies with risk factors as outcomes, and it was
      needed randomized controlled trials using clinical endpoints to ratify these results.

      The main objective of the Platform for Clinical Trials in Nutrition and Health (GENYAL) is to
      contribute to Precision Nutrition Research by the construction, for the first time, of a
      human gene and phenotype database to be used in: 1) The evaluation of the efficacy of
      different foods, functional foods and bioactive compounds capsules on general population and
      by genotypes and 2) The performance of nutritional genetics and nutrigenomics studies. For
      that purposes, GENYAL has a permanent recruitment of volunteers, which are phenotypically and
      genotypically characterized, and give consent to be contacted to perform clinical trials and
      nutritional intervention studies. Therefore, GENYAL may help to increase the existing
      knowledge for moving along to Nutritional Genomics research to its practical application in
      Precision Nutrition; contributing in the improvement in health and disease prevention through
      dietary recommendations based on the genome.

    <description>The validated Spanish version of the MLTPAQ is used to quantitatively measure the average physical activity practice (kcal/day) by the volunteers. Based on the Compendium of physical activities (PA), Energy Expenditure in Physical Activity (EEPA) is estimated as follows: EEPA = I x N x T; where &quot;I&quot; is the degree of intensity for each physical activity in kcal/min; &quot;N&quot;, the number of times that physical activity is developed; and &quot;T&quot;, the time in minutes spent in each session.
The MLTPAQ is administered to assess the quality of PA according to their intensity code: low (intensity code of &lt;=4 kcal/min), moderate (4.5-5.5 kcal/min) and high (&gt;=6 kcal/min).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in physical activity pattern according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning and before 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity (PA) is assessed using the validated Spanish version of the IPAQ.
The continuous score is expressed as metabolic equivalents (MET)-min per week: MET level x minutes of activity x events per week.
The pattern of PA is classified into 3 categories in accordance with the intensity:
Low: the lowest level of physical activity.
Moderate: any one of the following criteria: &gt;=3 days of vigorous activity of at least 20 min/day or &gt;=5 days of moderate-intensity activity or walking of at least 30 min/ day or &gt;=5 days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 600 MET-min/week.
High: any one of the following criteria: vigorous-intensity activity on at least 3 days and accumulating at least 1500 MET-min/week or &gt;=7 days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 3000 MET-min/week.</description>
