  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine whether participants who receive a personalized
      feedback report and educational materials about risky cannabis use will be less likely to
      report risky cannabis use at follow-up compared to participants who only received educational
      materials.

      This project aims to reduce risky cannabis use among those with less severe cannabis use,
      most of whom will never seek formal treatment. All of the participants will receive
      educational material regarding risky cannabis use and its prevention. Half of the
      participants will also be assigned by chance to receive a personalized feedback report.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. Participants who receive the full personalized feedback intervention will be less likely
           to report risky cannabis use at 3- and 6-month follow-ups compared to participants who
           receive educational materials only (Primary Hypothesis).

        2. Participants who receive the full personalized feedback intervention will report greater
           reductions in their perceptions of how much others use cannabis at a 3-month follow-up
           compared to participants who receive educational materials only.

        3. Reductions in perceptions of how much others use cannabis at 3-month follow-up will be
           positively associated with reduction in the participant's risky cannabis use at 6-month
           follow-up.

      A 2-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial will be conducted to test these hypotheses
      with follow-ups occurring at 3 and 6 months after randomization. Online media advertisements
      will be used to recruit people currently using cannabis. The advertisements will be placed
      across Canada using locations found successful in previous trials to rapidly recruit
      participants (e.g. Google AdWords).
