             diameter &gt;15mm in nodular lesions or long diameter &gt;10mm in external nodules,
             accompanied by increased FDG uptake).The absence of measurable lesions and increased
             diffuse FDG uptake in the liver should be excluded.

             7) adequate organ and bone marrow function, no serious hematopoietic dysfunction,

        value).

        coagulation function: INR≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal value;PT and APTT≤1.5 upper
        limit of normal (unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy and PT and APTT are
        within the expected range of anticoagulant therapy at time of screening).

             (shall not exceed the method detection limit), in the activity of the ruled out the
             need for treatment after hepatitis b or hepatitis c infection, before the
             experiment.Hepatitis b carriers, hepatitis b patients who are stable after drug
             treatment and hepatitis c patients who have been cured can be enrolled.
