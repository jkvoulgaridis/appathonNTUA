  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obliterative arterial disease of the lower limbs (AOMI) is associated with a high risk of
      cardiovascular events, with a linear relationship between a fall in the systolic pressure
      index and a risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Critical ischemia is the most
      severe stage of AOMI, associated with decubitus pain and / or foot ulceration. The severity
      of this arterial involvement involves functional prognosis of the lower limb with a high risk
      of amputation, as well as the patient's vital prognosis. In these patients, the rate of
      amputation and mortality at 1 year can reach 20%. Consequently, the goal of management in a
      multidisciplinary setting is threefold: the treatment of pain, improvement of the functional
      prognosis and improvement of the patient's vital prognosis. Revascularization should be
      attempted as often as possible for the purpose of limb salvage and improvement of patient
      survival.

      In the vascular medicine department, the indication and modalities of the revascularization
      procedure are discussed at a multidisciplinary consultation meeting. The
      medical-radiological-surgical expertise takes into consideration the patient's terrain and
      comorbidities and the technical possibilities according to the arterial damage. With the
      modernization and development of endovascular equipment dedicated to the hamstrings, the
      interventional radiology techniques in the management of critical ischemia allow the
      treatment of one or more arterial axes as well as a very distal revascularization in the
      arteries. foot with a lower morbidity-mortality compared to surgery, especially in the most
      fragile patients. Since 2013, the endovascular revascularization procedures performed by the
      interventional radiology team have been an integral part of the management of patients with
      critical ischemia hospitalized in the vascular medicine department.

      In patients with critical ischemia at high risk of major amputation and without the option of
      traditional endovascular or surgical revascularization, an endovascular revascularization
      technique for leg rescue is discussed as a last resort in multidisciplinary staff. This
      technique, performed by the interventional radiology team (MDP and GA), consists of an
      extra-anatomic endovascular femoro-popliteal bypass. We wish to describe the limb salvage
      rate and the preservation of autonomy in the 15 patients treated with this revascularization
      technique since 2013 in the vascular medicine department of the GHPSJ.
