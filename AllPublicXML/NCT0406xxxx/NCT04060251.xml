  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how different pre-operative therapeutic approaches
      affect quad strength and patient satisfaction after total knee replacements. There are three
      treatments groups: standard physical therapy protocol, the use of CyMedica NMES garments, and
      a telemedical home therapy program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital and
      meet all eligibility criteria will be informed about the study and asked if they would like
      to participate. The research assistant (RA) will screen upcoming surgeries and call all
      qualifying patients to inform them of the study. Those who show interest will be offered the
      opportunity to discuss with both the RA and Principal Investigator (PI). Upon agreement, the
      patient's consent will be obtained and they will be randomly assigned to one of three
      treatment groups using a computer-generated randomization.

    <description>Use only iGetBetter for the 3 months preceding surgery. After surgery, you will be given a new, Post-Op program to use for 2-3 months.

    <description>You will use iGetBetter starting 3 months out from surgery. You will receive CyMedica's electrical-stimulation garment during the preoperative appointment. In addition to iGetBetter, you will wear the conductive garment two times each day for the last 3 weeks before surgery. After surgery, for the first 3 weeks you will only use the conductive garment, and will not use iGetBetter. After those 3 weeks, you will receive outpatient physical therapy in addition to wearing the brace, approximately twice per week for the next 6-8 weeks. You will not need to return the brace after this time is up, and you may keep the brace, if you so choose, at no cost.</description>

    <description>All the patients in Group 2 will be given the CyMedica Orthopedics e-vive system 3 weeks before the surgery. The patients will begin using the unit after their first pre-intervention measurements are taken.
Patients will be instructed to apply the e-vive NMES Strength therapy twice a day, 5 days a week. The NMES Strength program is 20 minutes in length. Treatment intensity (adjustable from 1 to 100 in NMES programs) is required to be set at the highest tolerable limit for the patients.
Stimulation from the garment will have the following parameters: frequency of 50 Hz; pulse duration of 5 ms; time on: 12.8 seconds; and time off: 10 seconds. The total contraction time in a 20-minute treatment will be 11 minutes. The waveform will be pulsed and asymmetrical.</description>
