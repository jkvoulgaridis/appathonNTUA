  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to establish a protocol for metabolic rate measurements obtained using
      continuous monitoring of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production in a whole room
      calorimeter setting.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the duration and time course of the thermic effect
      of single meals consumed by subjects who have been previously fasting for 12 hours overnight.
      Capturing the full thermic effect of a meal may take up to 8 hours, depending on the calorie
      load, nutrient composition of the meal, and rate of digestion. The investigators will test
      meals consisting of conventional foods that are low (20% of energy), moderate (40% of energy)
      or high (60% of energy) in fat calories, as fat is thought to slow the digestive process. The
      investigators will test a liquid meal, that is high (60% of energy) in fat calories, as
      liquid foods are thought to move more quickly through the digestive process. Another purpose
      of this study is to determine the test-retest reproducibility for the meals described above.
      To accomplish reproducibility, a volunteer will be permitted to repeat a test day two times
      using the same test meal.

The survey has eight scales; physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health. All 36 items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores.</description>
