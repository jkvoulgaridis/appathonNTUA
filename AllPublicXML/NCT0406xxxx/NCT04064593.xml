  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AMISLEEP study is nested in the &quot;FRENCHIE&quot; registry.

      The objective is to use routine clinical and polygraphic data to capture SDB/SAS (Sleep
      Disordered Breathing/Sleep Apnea Syndrome) physiological heterogeneity in relation to
      clinically relevant cardiovascular outcomes.

      Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that unique clusters (phenotypes) of patients
      could be identified by applying unsupervised learning methods to these data and that the
      clusters would be differentially associated with risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes
      (ACS), TIA, stroke or death). The ultimate goal is to identify patients more at risk that
      could be included in interventional studies that would test whether SDB/SAS treatment can
      improve this risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients included in the &quot;FRENCHIE&quot; registry (Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patients
      hospitalized within 48h from symptom onset) are eligible, and will be asked for their written
      informed consent for this nested study in case of the absence of any non-inclusion criteria.

      Baseline clinical examination and laboratory tests are based on the usual care and are those
      collected in &quot;FRENCHIE&quot;.

      A simplified polygraphy is performed during the hospitalization for AMI. Starting and ending
      of the recording will be programmed based on patient interview regarding usual sleep hours.

      Together with the polygraphy, questionnaires will be given to the patient regarding general
      sleep quality

      Polygraphic data will be scored in centralized manner. Results of the polygraphy will be sent
      to the cardiology department with advice for treatment and follow-up. If necessary, the
      core-lab will provide tele-counseling regarding SDB management to centers.

      Follow-up will be performed through the national administrative databases, as in the
      &quot;FRENCHIE&quot; registry.

    <description>The polygraphy consists of recording during sleep, respiratory flow by mean of a nasal cannula, respiratory movement by mean of a thoracic belt with inductance plethysmography, blood oxygenation and heartbeats by a fingertip transcutaneous oxymetry.
Starting and ending of the recording will be programmed based on patient interview regarding usual sleep hours.
Polygraphy data are anonymized before being sent to the Cloud and therefore to the core lab.
Polygraphic data will be scored in centralized manner.
Results of the polygraphy will be sent to the cardiology department with advice for treatment and follow-up.
If necessary, the core-lab will provide tele-counseling regarding SDB management.</description>
