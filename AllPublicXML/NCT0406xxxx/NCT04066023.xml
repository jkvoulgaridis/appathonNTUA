    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects who meet the entry criteria will
      be randomized o receive one of three blinded treatments [C213 1.9 mg patch and placebo patch;
      C213 3.8 mg (1.9 mg x 2 patches), two placebo patches] on Day 1 and will have up to 48 weeks
      to confirm and treat a cluster headache. Subjects will self-administer the patches and
      respond to questions in the electronic diary (eDiary) until 1-hour post treatment
      administration.

      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Approximately 120 subjects
      who meet the entry criteria will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive one of three blinded
      treatments [C213 1.9 mg patch and placebo patch; C213 3.8 mg (1.9 mg x 2 patches), two
      placebo patches].

      Qualified subjects will randomize to the double-blind treatment period at Day 1 and will have
      up to 48 weeks to confirm and treat a cluster headache. Using the eDiary to confirm they are
      experiencing a cluster headache, subjects will self-administer the patches and continue to
      respond to questions in the eDiary until 1-hour post treatment administration.
