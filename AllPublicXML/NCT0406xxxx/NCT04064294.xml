      a convenience sample Parkinson's disease patients in the Veterans Administration Health Care
      System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term treatment with levodopa, the gold standard treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD),
      can lead to the development of abnormal involuntary movements called levodopa induced
      dyskinesia (LID). The severity of LID can range from mild to severely debilitating. A
      majority of PD patients will develop LID in their treatment life-time. In a recent study of
      the MPTP monkey model of PD, statin use was found to reduce LID (45%) without a worsening of
      Parkinsonism symptoms1. Another study showed rats treated with lovastatin prior to and with
      initiation of levodopa after substantia nigra lesioning showed dramatically less LID
      evolution compared to animals without lovastatin exposure2. In this study, the investigators
      will examine the association of statin use and dyskinesia in a convenience sample Parkinson's
      disease patients in the Veterans Administration Health Care System. This study is a
      retrospective three cohort design and will compare statin exposure BEFORE beginning LD,
      versus statin exposure AFTER LD is begun, versus NO statin exposure in PD subjects
      controlling for disease characteristics (severity), gender, and total LD exposure The primary
      endpoint is the severity of LID between the groups after years of opportunity to develop LID.
      Levodopa-Induced dyskinesia is a major cause of reduced quality of life for Veterans with PD
      and, in some cases, leads to costly surgical interventions. This project examines the impact
      of statin use on the presence of LID, and could lead to a future intervention trial. The
      reduction, delayed onset, or elimination of LID could improve the quality of life of many
      Veterans nationwide.

    <description>The Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) combines patient, caregiver, and treating physician perspectives on both historical (Parts 1 &amp; 2) and objective (Part 3 &amp; 4) assessments of dyskinesia and dystonia. The historical portion and the objective ratings are added together to form total score ranging from 0 to 104 with higher scores indicating more severe dyskinesia.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parkinson's Disease

          -  Age diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease greater than or equal to 50 years

          -  Treatment with levodopa greater than or equal to 5 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Deep Brain stimulation

          -  Unable to stand for 1 minute intervals, or sensory deficits in the feet

          -  Significant cognitive impairment as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
             score of &lt; 18

          -  Subjects with unstable medical or psychiatric conditions (including hallucinations).

          -  History of unstable medical conditions (i.e. active cardiac disease, recent
             unwellness, surgery etc.)

          -  Current use of drugs that may affect parkinsonism or dyskinesia:

               -  dopamine receptor blocking medications

               -  depakote

               -  lithium

               -  amiodarone

               -  tetrabenazine

               -  metoclopramide

               -  dronabinol

               -  and illicit drugs such as marijuana (THC)

               -  cocaine

               -  methamphetamine

          -  Statins other than simvastatin or lovastatin ie atorvastatin, fluvastatin

               -  rationale is that while all other statins are thought to not cross the blood
                  brain barrier well, the central nervous system penetrating nature of others is
                  not perfectly clear and could confound results
