      Patient's with diagnosis of probable mild to moderate AD will be enrolled in this study.
      Patient will undergo neurological examination including MOCA. Examiner will also fill out
      Form A at the time of initial evaluation.

      Patient will then undergo series of acupuncture treatments 2 per week for 6 weeks(12
      acupuncture treatment). At end of this intervention patients will be reassessed using same
      testing(MOCA and form A) Data collected will be assessed via statistical analysis to see if
      there is any statistically significant improvement.

      Acupuncture points used in this trial will stay the same for all subjects and throughout the
      course. The points will be Si Shen Chong, ST36, 37, LV 2,3,6, GB 34, 39, Xia San Huang, LI
      11, LI 4.

    <description>Subject will complete 3 MOCA assessment prior to study over 1 week time. Best score of three is used.
After study is complete subject will also undergo 3 MOCA assessment over 1 week immediately after study. Again best score is used.</description>
