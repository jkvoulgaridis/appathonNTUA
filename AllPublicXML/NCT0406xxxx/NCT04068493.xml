  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will examine the feasibility and acceptability of Enhanced Project Health, a
      dissonance-based obesity intervention, and whether this intervention results in significantly
      greater reductions in weight and improvements in lifestyle behaviors than an assessment only
      condition. Participants will be young adults enrolled in college.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 34% of college students are overweight/obese. However, few behavioral weight
      loss (BWL) interventions have been developed for young adults in college. Research suggests
      that standard BWL interventions are not addressing the needs of young adults as they have
      shown poorer retention rates and weight loss compared to older adults in BWL trials. Standard
      BWL interventions are also time-intensive and are not conducive to inexpensive dissemination.

      The primary aim of this project is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of Enhanced
      Project Health, a dissonance-based obesity intervention for young adults enrolled in college.
      Enhanced Project Health is based on Project Health, a dissonance-based obesity prevention
      program, which has been shown to significantly decrease weight gain and future
      overweight/obesity onset compared to a matched intervention and minimal intervention control
      condition in young adults. The current intervention was expanded to consist of eight weekly
      group sessions and to address sleep, in addition to diet and physical activity. The secondary
      aim is to test the hypothesis that Enhanced Project Health will result in significantly
      greater reductions in weight and improvements in lifestyle behaviors compared to an
      assessment only condition.

    <measure>Program Evaluation Questionnaire - Each Group Session</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from week 1 to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire was developed for this study. It will assess the acceptability of the intervention and will be administered at the end of each group session. Participants will be asked to rate the usefulness of the session on one item with a scale ranging from 1 to 5. Total scores range from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate more usefulness.
Participants will also be asked to respond to open-ended questions about each group session. These questions will assess the most favorable aspects, least favorable aspects, and areas of improvements. Responses will be coded using a variation of the long table approach emphasizing frequency, specificity, emotion, and extensiveness. Codes will be examined to identify themes.</description>

    <measure>Program Evaluation Questionnaire - Overall Program</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 8</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire was developed for this study. It will assess the program with regard to effectiveness and satisfaction as well as characteristics of the group leaders (clarity, knowledge, experience, respect) using a scale ranging from 1 to 5. Total scores range from 8 to 40. Higher scores indicate more favorable responses. This questionnaire will be administered at the end of the last group session.</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form will assess walking, moderate-intensity activity, and vigorous-intensity activity. The scores for each type of physical activity are converted to MET-minutes/week as defined by the following: Walking MET-minutes/week = 3.3 * walking minutes * walking days; Moderate MET-minutes/week = 4.0 * moderate-intensity activity minutes * moderate days; Vigorous MET-minutes/week = 8.0 * vigorous-intensity activity minutes * vigorous-intensity days; Total physical activity MET-minutes/week = sum of Walking + Moderate + Vigorous MET-minutes/week scores. The total score will be computed by summing the duration (in minutes) and frequency (days) of each activity. Higher duration and frequency indicate more engagement in physical activity. The pattern of physical activity can also be classified as low, moderate, or high based on the total score.</description>
