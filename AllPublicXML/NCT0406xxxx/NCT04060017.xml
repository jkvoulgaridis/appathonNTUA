    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the cognitive and behavioral effects of
      liquid leucovorin calcium on young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and determine
      whether it improves language as well as the core and associated symptoms of ASD. The
      investigators will enroll 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years,
      with confirmed ASD and known language delays or impairments. Participation will last
      approximately 26 weeks from screening to end of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with life-long
      consequences that affects young children during critical times in their development. ASD is
      defined by impairments in social-communication as well as the presence of restricted
      interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD is frequently associated with co-occurring language
      delays. Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy
      such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no
      US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or
      the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin
      calcium on language impairments in very young children with ASD. Participants entered into
      the trial will have delayed social and communication abilities known to be associated with
      ASD. The investigators hypothesize that leucovorin calcium will significantly improve
      language as well as core and associated behavioral symptoms of ASD, and be well-tolerated
      with no significant adverse effects, in young children with ASD. The investigators further
      hypothesize that a combination of baseline cellular and genetic biomarkers will predict
      cognitive and behavioral response to the intervention.

      To assess whether the liquid form of leucovorin calcium is superior to placebo, the
      investigators will study 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years,
      with confirmed ASD and known language delays at baseline. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions.
      At the end of 12 weeks, all participants will receive active treatment for 12 weeks. Language
      skills, as well as specimen biomarkers, will be measured at screening and after each
      treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences language ability.

    <description>Mullen Scales of Early Learning: a scale of cognitive abilities across the following domains: gross motor (not a core subscale), visual reception, fine motor, expressive language, and receptive language. Total change in expressive language ability will be measured by the change in the expressive language t score. The expressive language domain is a 28-item scale with a raw score range of 0-50 and a t score range of 20-80. T scores are calculated from the raw score and based on age norms. Changes in expressive language t scores will be reported. A higher t score indicates a higher level of language ability.</description>

    <description>Modified Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptoms: treating clinician will perform a review of medical and behavioral history at each visit to assess incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. The treating clinician will use the scale to record presence and intensity of adverse effects. Intensity is rated on a scale of 0 (Not present) to 3 (Severe). The treating clinician will also judge the adverse effects' relatedness to treatment. Relatedness is rated on a scale of 1 (None) to 4 (Defined). The treating clinician will denote action taken. Action taken is rated on a scale of 0 (None) to 5 (Discontinue Treatment). No total score is calculated. However, higher ratings on any individual item indicate greater severity of adverse effects.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the change in adaptive functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-II Domain LevelI: a scale to assess adaptive behavior in children with developmental/intellectual disabilities. This is a 135-item parent-reported measure with ratings in the following domains: communication, daily living skills, and socialization. The frequency of each item is scaled from 0 (Never) to 2 (Usually). For each domain, there are 45 items with a maximum score of 90. Change in each domain will be measured by the change in standard score. Standard scores are calculated from the raw scores and based on age norms. A higher standard score in any domain indicates a higher level of adaptive behavior in that domain. Domain standard scores will be used to get a standard composite score. Change in adaptive behavior will be measured by the change in the standard score. A higher composite score indicates higher overall adaptive behavior ability.</description>
