  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial examines the effects of filter ventilation on sensory response, smoking
      topography, and inhalation in current every day cigarette smokers. The physical design
      features of cigarettes directly impact their appeal by influencing cognitive and sensory
      perceptions. The introduction of a now common design feature, filter ventilation, has led to
      greater public harm than benefit because of the potential for greater toxicity while
      enhancing product appeal among smokers. Ventilated cigarettes dilute smoke, which promotes
      perceptions of ?smoothness? and therefore lower health risk, contributing to the overall
      appeal of these products. The purpose of this study is to assess whether removing ventilation
      from cigarette filters lowers cigarette product appeal among smokers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the link between marketing proxies for filter ventilation (product descriptors,
      packaging) and risk beliefs.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients smoke 5 cigarettes separated by 30 minute washout periods. Between 48 hours and 1
      week later, patients smoke another 5 cigarettes separated by 30 minute washout period with
      CReSSMicro topography measurement device and BioRadio device for recording inhalation
      patterns.
