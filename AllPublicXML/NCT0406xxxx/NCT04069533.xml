  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a hematopoietic
      cell-based gene therapy for pediatric patients with Fanconi Anemia, subtype A (FA-A).

      Hematopoietic stem cells from mobilized peripheral blood of patients with FA-A will be
      transduced ex vivo (outside the body) with a lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene. After
      transduction, the corrected stem cells will be infused intravenously back to the patient with
      the goal of preventing bone marrow failure.

      This is a pediatric open-label Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a
      hematopoietic gene therapy consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a
      lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene in pediatric subjects with FA-A.

      Enriched CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells will be transduced ex vivo with the therapeutic
      lentiviral vector and infused via intravenous infusion following transduction without any
      prior conditioning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Fanconi anemia as diagnosed by chromosomal fragility assay of cultured lymphocytes in
             the presence of DEB or a similar DNA-crosslinking agent

          2. Patients of the complementation group FA-A

          3. Minimum age: 1 year and a minimum weight of 8 kg

          4. Maximum age: 17 years

          5. At least 30 CD34+ cells/μL are determined in one bone marrow (BM) aspiration within 3
             months prior to CD34+ cell collection OR (see subsequent criterion)

          6. If the number of CD34+ cells/ μL in BM is in the range of 10-29, peripheral blood (PB)
             parameters should meet two of the three following criteria:
