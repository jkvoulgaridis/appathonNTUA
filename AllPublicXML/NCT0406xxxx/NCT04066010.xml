  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using a custom-designed
      mobile application to improve blood pressure (BP) and promote adherence to antihypertensive
      medication regimens. This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.
      Patients were randomized to an intervention or control group for three months.
      Antihypertensive medication refill history was assessed three months before, during and three
      months after the study period. Continuous outcome measures investigated were
      systolic/diastolic BP and medication refill history, using the cumulative medication gap
      (CMG) score.

    <description>The mobile app consisted of a series of features including (1) calendar reminders of when to take medications and the patient's antihypertensive medication regimen (2) a &quot;Call your Pharmacist&quot; button specific to patient's pharmacy, (3) a BP log in which the patient could enter blood pressure values that were automatically compared to goal values, (4) counseling points for lifestyle and adherence factors individually tailored to each patient and (5) lifestyle and medication adherence surveys.</description>
