  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first time-in-human (FTiH) study is to evaluate the safety,
      reactogenicity and immunogenicity of three different dose levels of an experimental rabies
      glycoprotein G (RG) vaccine (RG-SAM [CNE] vaccine), made using a new technology, when
      administered intramuscularly (IM) on a 0, 2, 6-month schedule to healthy adults.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be conducted in two parts with oversight from Internal Safety Review Committee (iSRC) and Safety Review Team (SRT).
Part 1 is a 3-step sequential design. About 60 healthy adults will be randomized in a 2:2:2:3:3 to low dose, medium dose and high dose groups of the investigational vaccine, and saline and RabAvert groups.
Step 1: Approximately 20 participants are randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to low dose investigational vaccine, saline and RabAvert groups.
Step 2: Approximately 20 participants are randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to medium dose investigational vaccine, saline and RabAvert groups
Step 3: Approximately 20 participants are randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to high dose investigational vaccine, saline and RabAvert groups
Part 2 will be a 1-step parallel design. About 65 healthy adults are randomized in a 3:3:3:2:2 ratio to low dose, medium dose and high dose groups of the investigational vaccine and saline and RabAvert groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Observer-blind Data during the primary vaccination phase will be collected in an observer-blind manner. By observer-blind, it is meant that during the course of the study, the vaccines recipient and those responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint will all be unaware of which vaccine was administered.
For both Part 1 and Part 2, the study will be observer-blind until Day 91 when the Day 91 analysis will result in unblinding of all the subjects to the sponsor. Therefore, the study cannot be considered observer-blind beyond Day 91 and will be conducted in a single-blind manner thereafter (booster vaccination phase and follow-up phase); with all subjects remaining blinded up to study conclusion (Month 18).</masking_description>
