  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of
      paricalcitol oral solution in pediatric participants of ages 0 to 9 years with SHPT
      associated with stage 5 CKD receiving Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) or Hemodialysis (HD). The
      24-week study is divided into two 12-week dosing periods (Dosing Period 1 followed by Dosing
      Period 2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is currently diagnosed with and/or being treated for secondary
             hyperparathyroidism (SHPT).

          -  Participant must be diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 receiving
             peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) for at least 30 days prior to initial
             Screening.

          -  For entry into the Washout Period (for vitamin D receptor activator [VDRA] non-naive
             participants), the participant must meet the appropriate laboratory criteria based
             upon the participant's age as described in the protocol.

          -  For entry into the Dosing Period (for VDRA-naive participants or VDRA non-naive
             participants who have completed the Washout Period), the participant must meet the
             appropriate laboratory criteria based upon the participant's age as described in the
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is expected or scheduled to receive a kidney transplant within 6 months of
             Screening or is a kidney transplant recipient.

          -  Participant is expected to discontinue peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD)
             within 6 months of the initial Screening visit.

          -  Participant has had a parathyroidectomy within 12 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Participant is taking maintenance calcitonin, bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids (in a
             dose equivalent to more than &gt; 0.16 mg/kg/day or 5 mg prednisone/day, whichever is
             lower), 4 weeks prior to Dosing.

          -  Participant is receiving calcimimetics at the time of Screening or is expected to
             initiate calcimimetics at any time throughout the study.

          -  Participant is unable to take oral medications.
