    <textblock>
      Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is a proven treatment for heart failure.

      CRT consists of a special pacemaker with two/three leads (insulated wires which take the
      electrical impulses from the device to the heart), one in the right ventricle, one in a vein
      on the outer surface of the left ventricle (in a vessel called coronary sinus or CS) and
      sometimes one in the right atrium (right top chamber of the heart). Tiny electrical impulses
      are simultaneously sent to the ventricles to make them beating together again in a more
      synchronised pattern. This leads to a coordinated, synchronous pumping action that, in most
      patients, translates into improved heart failure symptoms and improved quality and quantity
      of life, reducing the chance of being admitted to hospital with worsening heart failure.
      Unfortunately up to one third of the patients do not benefit from CRT therapy and to date
      there are no useful criteria to predict the response to CRT.

      In an effort to improve the response rate to CRT, alternative methods have been developed. In
      particular, a new technology called MultiPoint Pacing (MPP) (St. Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA)
      has recently become available. It allows simultaneous stimulation of 2 different points in
      the left ventricle by using a single lead with four electrodes. This strategy should improve
      the pumping function of the heart by recruiting a larger mass of muscle. Although MPP is as
      safe and as effective as standard CRT pacing, the improvements to date in the heart pump
      function it gives over standard CRT pacing are variable and small.

      Recent evidence suggests that MPP pacing could be particularly beneficial in some subgroups
      of patients, in particular patients with a previous history of heart attack resulting in scar
      formation in the left ventricle.

      The investigators hypothesize that MPP works better when the lead is closer to the scar
      because this allows recruitment of areas with slow conduction, thus increasing
      synchronization further.

      To this aim, they plan to compare, in each patient, the acute response produced by MPP on the
      cardiac function when the CS lead is placed close to myocardial scar and when it is placed
      far from scar respectively.

    <textblock>
      A prospective single-centre pilot study will be conducted to investigate this topic. Fifteen
      patients, with a history of previous ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) resulting in
      myocardial scar and elected to CRT implant at the OUH, will be enrolled in this study.

      Compared to standard practice, additional research investigations will be a baseline visit
      for eligibility assessment, informed consent and pre-CRT implant cardiac MRI, a
      three-dimensional electroanatomical map reconstruction of the CS venous system during the
      standard CRT implant and the evaluation of the acute haemodynamic response (AHR, percentage
      increase of LV-dP/dT max) of MPP over conventional single-site LV pacing during the CRT
      implant.

      The cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be performed in each patient 1-2 weeks
      before the CRT implant during the baseline visit. It will provide information regarding
      presence and location of myocardial scar and anatomy of the CS venous system.

      A de-novo CRT implant will be performed under fluoroscopic guidance as per standard care. All
      subjects will be implanted with a regulatory approved St. Jude Medical CRT device compatible
      with MPP feature (models nÂ° CD3271-40(Q), CD3371-40(Q), CD3371-40C(QC) or newer) and St. Jude
      Medical quadripolar left ventricular lead (Quartet 1458Q or newer). The choice of the right
      ventricular and right atrial leads will be left to the operator. After implant of the right
      ventricular and right atrial leads, a CS venogram will be then performed as per standard
      practice (see intervention section for more details).

      A three-dimensional electroanatomical map of the CS venous system will be constructed with
      Precision mapping system and a Biotronik Vision wire (Biotronik Se &amp; Co. KG, Berlin, Germany)
      by using the CS venogram as a guide. The map will be merged with the correspondent cardiac
      MRI images in order to locate the myocardial scar in respect to the CS branches. This will
      allow the identification of two target CS branches for the study measurements, one located in
      the peri-infarct region and one located in the remote myocardium.

      A Certus PressureWire will be then introduced into the LV. A PhysioMon software (Radi Medical
      Systems, Uppsala, Sweden) will be used for electronic calculation of the LV-dP/dTmax from
      every heartbeat for a period of at least thirty seconds to ensure steady-state conditions.
      The baseline LV-dP/dTmax will be measured during ventricular spontaneous rhythm.

      A St. Jude Medical quadripolar left ventricular lead will be sequentially placed in the
      &quot;peri-infarct&quot; CS branch and in the &quot;remote myocardium&quot; CS branch. In each site the
      percentage increase in LV-dP/dTmax (Acute Haemodynamic Response, AHR) produced by both
      conventional single-site and MPP LV pacing to will be measured. All 4 poles of the
      quadripolar lead will be used in turn for conventional single-site LV pacing, 3 different
      configurations will be used in turn for MPP. The LV-dP/dTmax will be recorded for each pacing
      configuration in order to identify the MPP and the single-site LV pacing configurations
      producing the best AHR (best percentage increase of LV-dP/dTmax).

      The AHR produced by the best MPP configuration in peri-infarct region will be compared with
      the AHR produced by the best MPP configuration in the remote myocardium. Moreover, the
      percentage increase of LV-dP/dTmax produced by the best MPP configuration over the best
      conventional single-site LV pacing in the peri-infarct region will be compared with the same
      measurement obtained in the remote myocardium.

      The decision about the final position of the LV lead and the activation of MPP feature after
      the CRT implant will be left to operator preference.
