  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to determine how long it takes for the strains of a probiotic
      formulation to be detected in feces after the start of an intervention, how long they persist
      after the end of the intervention, and the associations between detection and persistence
      with total gut transit time.

      This is a 10-week interventional, open-label pilot study designed to evaluate the detection
      and persistence of L. helveticus R-0052, L. casei NI319, B. breve NI337, and B. longum R-0175
      strains in feces of healthy adults following the start and the end of IP intervention,
      respectively. This study will have an initial baseline period (4 weeks), a probiotic
      intervention (2 weeks) and a washout period (4 weeks). Participants will complete daily
      questionnaires regarding stool frequency, time of stool collections, and IP intake. A weekly
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire will be administered. Transit time
      will be assessed using radiopaque markers.
