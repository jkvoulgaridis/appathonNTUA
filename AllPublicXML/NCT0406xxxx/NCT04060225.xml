    <description>Participants will be asked to participate in a single arm study with three phases (washout phase, abstinence phase, and exposure phase). These participants will first be asked to abstain from drinking any caffeinated food or beverages for 72 hours (known as the washout phase). Following the first phase, participants will then wear a blood pressure cuff to collect diastolic and systolic blood pressure for 24 hours (abstinence phase) wherein they will be asked to refrain from caffeinated products. Participants will then drink the coffee intervention and collect blood pressure measurements for 24 hours (exposure phase).</description>
