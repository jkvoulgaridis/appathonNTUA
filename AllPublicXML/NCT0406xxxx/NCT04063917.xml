  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the PLUTO study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the
      ZENS transcutaneous nerve stimulator device in primary snorers and those with mild
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study will assess the impact of ZENS on snoring frequency,
      duration, and other relevant sleep parameters as well as the effectiveness of instructional
      materials and the usability of the ZENS device. The study will be a single-center, open-label
      randomized cross-over sleep study of the ZENS in the &quot;ON&quot; versus &quot;OFF&quot; setting during a
      single overnight sleep study. Subjects utilizing the ZENS device will experience a reduction
      in snoring during the &quot;ON&quot; versus &quot;OFF&quot; phase, as quantified by a 25% or greater reduction in
      the percentage of time per hour of snoring (≥ 40 dB) with the active ZENS device (&quot;ON&quot;
      phase).
