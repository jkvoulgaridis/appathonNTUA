  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter open-label mode of action study. Twenty patients with moderate to
      severe hidradenitis suppurativa will be treated with guselkumab 200 mg Q4W subcutaneously.
      Main objectie is to investigate changes in inflammatory pathways induced by IL-23p19 blockade
      with guselkumab, in HS lesional skin.

      The total duration of the treatment period per subject is 16 weeks.

    <time_frame>Week 0 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>Pangenomic gene expression profiling at week 0 and week 16 will be performed on skin biopsies to investigate changes in levels of cytokines in the skin.</description>

    <measure>Clinical efficacy - Inflammatory lesion count and Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 4, 12, 16.</time_frame>
    <description>All inflammatory lesions on all affected body areas will be counted. Additionally, the HiSCR will be calculated from these counted lesions.</description>

    <measure>Clinical efficacy - International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4).</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 4, 12, 16.</time_frame>
    <description>The IHS4 score will be calculated by multiplying the number of nodules by 1, the number of abscesses by 2 and the number of draining fistulas by 4 and adding up these three outcomes into a total score.</description>

    <measure>Patient reported outcomes - Pain Numeric Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>Patient will be asked to score his or her pain on numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported outcomes - Patient treatment satisfaction score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>Patient will be asked to score his or her satisfaction about the treatment at baseline and at week 16 on a numeric rating scale from 0 (completely unsatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied).</description>

    <measure>Patient reported outcomes - Dermatology Life Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>A survey containing 10 questions regarding multiple aspects of the quality of life. Each question has 4 answer possibilities: 'not at all', 'a little', 'a lot' and 'very much'. These answers correspond with 0,1,2 or 3 points respectively. The total score can range from 0 to 30 points.</description>
