  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal (MSD) conditions often develop chronic pain
      and are at high risk for substance misuse. The Investigators propose to test the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to
      Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance
      use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve
      clinicians at a single site contacting Veterans throughout New England by phone to deliver
      SBIRT-PM counseling in a pragmatic, randomized, clinical trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries
      related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being
      compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation
      of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often
      develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed
      to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for
      whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their
      overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The
      service-connection application is an ideal point-of contact for initiating early intervention
      treatments for these at-risk Veterans. The Investigators propose to test the effectiveness
      and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain
      Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the
      counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the
      best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans,
      explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional
      SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans
      applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for
      people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in
      non-pharmacological pain care.

      During a two-years pilot study, the study team prepared SBIRT-PM for implementation by
      establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical framework) between the
      &quot;hub&quot; where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the &quot;spoke&quot; sites, establishing study related
      procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New
      England.

      In this full clinical trial, investigators will randomize 1100 Veterans applying for
      compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical
      centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups,
      and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the electronic health record
      and toxicology testing of nail clippings. Investigators hypothesize that, compared to Usual
      Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and
      substance use. Investigators further hypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will
      be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from structured data
      fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative natural language
      processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connection examinations
      can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health promoting encounter.

    <measure>change in Pain Severity subscale of Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Severity subscale of Brief Pain Inventory uses a 0-10 numeric rating scale (0=no pain to 10=pain as bad as you can imagine) to measure four pain severity items: &quot;worst&quot; pain in the last 24 hours, &quot;least&quot; pain in the last 24 hours, &quot;average&quot; pain, and pain right &quot;now&quot;. The pain severity subscale is scored as a composite of the four pain items (mean severity score).</description>

    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was developed to detect and manage substance use and related problems. Substance use will be measured over the last 3 months using Version 3.1.After a screening question focusing on substances ever used, the ASSIST consists of 7 questions about use of and consequences of use of each of 11 classes of substances over the preceding three months (including nicotine, THC and medical THC). Scores are generated for each substance that are mapped to a three-point ordinal score of severity: &quot;no need for treatment&quot;, &quot;need for a brief intervention&quot; and &quot;need for an intensive intervention&quot;. When a positive toxicology result disagrees with a self-report of no use, the middle value on the ordinal scale (brief intervention) will be derived and used as the primary substance use outcome. The number of problem substances are defined as the number of substances above the &quot;no intervention&quot; threshold</description>

    <description>Number of modalities of non-opioid pain services used will be assessed using a modified version of the Pain Management Collaboratory's &quot;non-pharmacological and self-care approaches&quot; questionnaire. This questionnaire asks about use of a list of 3 pharmacological and 23 non-pharmacological pain treatment modalities. For each modality, respondents indicate if the treatment was used in the past three months, if the treatment was delivered in an individual or group setting or if done on own (self-care), and the number of sessions/visits attended in the past 3 months. Number of non-pharmacological modalities will be summed.</description>

    <description>Pain interference subscale of Brief Pain Inventory uses a 0-10 numeric rating scale (0=no interference to 10=interferes completely) to measure seven daily activities: general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, sleep. The pain interference subscale is scored as the mean of the seven interference items. This mean can be used if more than 50% (4/7 items) have been completed on a given administration.</description>

    <measure>Overall Health measured by EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Eq-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status designed to provide a single index value of health utility for clinical and economic appraisals. It consists of 5 dimensions in the domains of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each domain has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. A 6th question asks respondent to rate his health today on a scale from 0-100. The 5 dimensions are combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state. A total of 3125 possible health states are defined and can be used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) used to inform the economic evaluation.</description>

    <description>Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM) was developed to promote engagement in multi-modal non-pharmacological pain management among compensation-seeking Veterans with chronic pain. In SBIRT-PM, a clinician meets with the Veteran after the compensation examination to address the presenting MSD complaint. The clinician addresses Veterans' motivation for multi-modal pain care, and explains how pain can be managed using a variety of non-pharmacological pain management services. The clinician spells out how those services can be accessed at VA. Using permissive language about how pain is commonly self-medicated with substances, the clinician transitions to inquiries about use of prescription and non-prescription substances. The clinician then attempts to motivate Veterans to change their behavior if they are misusing substances. Thus, SBIRT-PM addresses the Veteran's presenting pain complaint first and nascent substance use subsequently.</description>
