    <textblock>
      Data on the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) for other vulnerable groups in Madrid, such
      as homeless persons and migrants, are scarce, and it is now necessary to implement
      intervention and elimination plans.

      Vulnerable groups have poor access to healthcare and are therefore not systematically
      screened for HCV. On the occasions they are shown to be positive, subsequent follow-up in the
      health system and the possibility of cure are poor.

      The use of a mobile unit to approach vulnerable populations is essential for better
      characterization of risk behaviors and of the magnitude of HCV. The integration of healthcare
      personnel in mobile units enables counseling on prevention and intervention when needed.

      Primary objective Evaluate the impact of the HCV care cascade on vulnerable populations who
      gather at hot spots in Madrid (shantytowns, homeless shelters and places were street
      prostitution is practiced) by means of a multilevel outreach project.

      SURVEILLANCE:

      Active screening for HCV among vulnerable individuals in populations with a high prevalence
      of HCV will be carried out in hot spots in Madrid, namely, Cañada Real shanty town, mobile
      harm reduction units, institutions providing social assistance, public areas, homeless
      shelters and places where street prostitution is practiced. An agreement with the Madrid
      Council (MCC) is under way to provide social centers for HCV screening.

      A mobile unit will approach the hot spots following a predefined schedule. The mobile unit
      consists of a van adapted for the project and a car. HCV screening of vulnerable individuals
      will be performed by a nurse and an educator hired specifically for that purpose.

      Active HCV screening and prevention in vulnerable individuals should be a priority and a
      responsibility shared by both the MCC and the SERMAS (Servicio Madridleño de Salud). The
      investigators plan to establish an agreement with public health authorities to give
      continuity to this project and to carry out proactive HCV screening through integration with
      various centers and networks dependent on the MCC and SERMAS.

      The project will establish the foundations of integrated cooperation between an HCV clinic in
      a hospital setting and harm reduction units and other resources and networks dependent on the
      institutions mentioned above. As has been observed with other interventions, the functional
      objective of this project is to provide continuity of care from the institutions.

      Study Duration (in months) 12 months.

        Persons who inject drugs (PWID), homeless people, migrants and sex workers are vulnerable
        populations that have a high prevalence of active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
        According to local data, the prevalence of HCV in drug users ranges from 20% to 60%,
        depending on whether they inject drugs or not. Data on the HCV prevalence for the other
        vulnerable groups (homeless, migrants…) in Madrid is scarce and necessary to implement
        intervention and elimination plans.
