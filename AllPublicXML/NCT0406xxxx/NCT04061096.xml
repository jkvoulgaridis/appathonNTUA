  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare responses to electrical pulp test (EPT) and cold test among molar incisor
      hypomineralization (MIH)-effected and not MIH-effected carious teeth before and after
      administration of local anesthesia for caries removal.

      Fifty carious permanent first molar teeth (25 MIH-effected, 25 not MIH-effected) were
      included. Firstly, radiographic caries depth, International Caries Detection and Assessment
      System (ICDAS) codes and MIH levels of teeth were recorded. Then, during the treatment, EPT
      and cold test were performed before and after the administration of local anesthesia. Visual
      Analog Scale for Pain was used to evaluate cold test and pain during treatment. When
      interpreting results, significancy level was stated for the values of p&lt;0.05.
