  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve the development of a novel approach to lower extremity residual limb
      surgical revision that offers the promise of augmenting volitional motor control, restore
      proprioception and reverse atrophy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this research protocol is that we will be able to modify the residual limbs
      of patients who have already undergone lower extremity amputations so as to include
      biological actuators that will enable the successful employment of next generation lower
      extremity prostheses, diminish/eliminate phantom limb pain, restore proprioception and
      regenerate lost muscle mass. The specific aims of the project are as follows:

        1. To develop a standardized operative technique for both above knee (AK) and below knee
           (BK) amputation revision procedures that includes AMIs to restore musculotendinous
           proprioceptive capabilities

        2. To assess the capacity for these actuators to provide enhanced motor control and sensory
           feedback, as well as ablate phantom limb symptomatology and augment residual limb muscle
           mass

        3. To determine the reinnervation time course and longevity of these biological constructs

        4. To validate the functional and somatosensory superiority of the proposed revision
           technique over standard approaches to BKA and AKA

        5. To develop a modified acute postoperative rehabilitation strategy suited to this new
           surgical approach

    <time_frame>Years 1-3</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical examination and images from CT/MRI will be combined to construct a holistic view of the morphology of the residual limb. Imaging studies and limb measurements taken in clinic will also be used to measure muscle atrophy/hypertrophy over time.</description>

    <measure>Degree of Motor Activation of AMI Muscles and Volitional Control of Phantom Limb</measure>
    <time_frame>Years 1-3</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical examination will confirm the sliding motion of the AMI constructs with radiologic evaluation measuring the length of muscle excursion through each construct. Functional testing and testing using a prosthesis will determine how well a patient is able to volitionally control the AMI muscles.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence of Proprioception</measure>
    <time_frame>Years 1-3</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective reporting combined with tests run using a prosthesis will indicate if proprioception is still intact after surgery. Results will be confirmed by monitoring brain activity during limb movement activities via fMRI.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence of Sensory Perception</measure>
    <time_frame>Years 1-3</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective reporting and clinical tests of Semmes-Weinstein and two-point discrimination will determine if the patient has sensory perception on the residual limb.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>General Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Years 1-3</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported outcomes metrics from five validated tests (SIP136, EQ-5D, SF-36, LEFS, PROMIS) will be combined to create an overall picture of patients' general health during and after their recovery.</description>
