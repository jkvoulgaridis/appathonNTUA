    <textblock>
      TEAM-Br is a randomized, prospective, cost-utility study comparing transcatheter aortic valve
      implantation (TAVI) versus surgical aortic vale replacement in Brazil.

      The study is sponsored by the national Minister of Health, through PROADI-SUS (Programa de
      Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Institucional do SUS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation has been shown to be non-inferior to surgical aortic
      valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis at high, intermediate and low
      surgical risk. In recent years, a concept of a simplified and optimized TAVR procedure (known
      as minimalist approach) has led experienced centers to perform the majority of these
      procedures using conscious sedation and local anesthesia only. From a clinical perspective,
      this approach is associated with better and faster recovery and mobilization, reduced need
      for a prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay and faster hospital discharge, as compared to
      general anesthesia.

      The cost-effectiveness of minimalist TAVR strategy - as compared to surgery - in Brazil is
      uncertain. Our objective is to conduct a cost-utility analysis comparing minimalist
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation with surgical aortic valve replacement in patients
      with severe aortic stenosis.
