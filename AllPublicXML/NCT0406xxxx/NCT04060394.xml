  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination treatment of protein kinase B (AKT) inhibitor, afuresertib, with androgen
      synthesis enzyme inhibitor, LAE001, may provide an effective treatment for metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer (m-CRPC) patients who have progressed/drug resistant
      following prior standard care treatments of any anti-androgen. This study intends to identify
      the most appropriate combined doses of LAE001/prednisone and afuresertib in m-CRPC patients
      who have progressive disease or are intolerant of 2 prior standard treatments of any
      anti-androgen or anti-androgen treatment plus chemotherapy.

      The Phase I part of this study will perform a dose-escalation to identify the recommended
      Phase II dose of LAE001/prednisone plus afuresertib in m-CRPC patients.

      In the Phase II part of this study, the anti-tumor efficacy of LAE001/prednisone plus
      afuresertib and of afuresertib alone will be assessed in m-CRPC patients with Phosphatase and
      tensin homolog (PTEN) loss who have progressed on, or who are intolerant of, 2 prior standard
      treatments of any anti-androgen or one anti-androgen treatment plus one of the chemotherapy
      from docetaxel or cabazitaxel. These study results will provide preliminary efficacy and
      safety information of the combination of LAE001/prednisone plus afuresertib and afuresertib
      alone.
