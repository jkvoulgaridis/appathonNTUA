  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of PROTAHERE Absorbable
      Adhesion Barrier to prevent pelvic postoperative adhesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a random, evaluator-blinded, controlled, single center clinical trial.
      Recruiting patients who are premenopausal and scheduled for pelvic surgery including
      myomectomy, pelvic adhenolysis, endometriosis surgery, salpingostomy, dermoid cyst removal,
      ovarian cystectomy or any pelvic surgery other than total metrectomy. Patients recruited are
      randomly divided into five groups, PROTAHERE, Hyalobarrier, Seprafilm, Interceed or no
      treatment when the inclusion criteria are met and the inform consents are obtained. They are
      followed for 24 months including visits at 14 days, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months post-operation
      for the safety and effectiveness evaluation. The primary endpoints are the incidence of
      adhesions at 3-month as well as the incidence of any adverse events during the study.
