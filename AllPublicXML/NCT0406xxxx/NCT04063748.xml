  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is believed that persons with hearing impairment benefit from auditory rehabilitation
      (AR), i.e. regular assessment and training of their listening skills. However, the efficacy
      of auditory rehabilitation has not been investigated before. In Leuven (Belgium) an e-health
      app has been developed that enables performance assessment, listening skills training, and
      counselling for persons with hearing impairment. Currently, a RCT is prepared to evaluated
      the different modules in persons with hearing impairment. The experimental group will
      received auditory rehabilitation training modules, a control group will receive training
      tasks that are NOT believed to transfer to improved listening skills.

        1. Do participants improve on the trained tasks in the LUISTER AR scheme and does this
           improvement transfer to an improvement in speech perception in noise (primary outcome),
           executive functioning and/or quality of life (secondary outcomes)?

        2. Does training with the LUISTER AR scheme provide more benefit on primary and secondary
           outcomes than a placebo program (active control group)?

        3. Can improvement in speech in noise perception, obtained with the LUISTER AR scheme, be
           consolidated until 6 months after training has stopped?

        4. Are certain user-specific or training-specific aspects correlated to improvement on
           task-specific learning as well as near- and far transfer

      Goals of the study:

      To determine an optimal, personalized AR scheme (considering age, degree of HI) and possible
      interacting factors (e.g., training time, type of errors)

      To investigate transfer of auditory and auditory-cognitive training to listening skills in
      everyday life

      To develop evidence-based guidelines for clinical AR

      The study will start with baseline assessment (speech in noise understanding, LIST sentences
      and cognitive tests (executive functioning, important for listening skills). This will be
      followed by 8 weeks of training, an intermediate assessment moment, again 8 weeks of
      training, and final evaluation moment. After 6 month follow-up evaluation to investigate
      retention.

    <description>LIST sentences presented in speech-weighted noise. Participants are required to repeat sentences in noise. The Leuven Intelligibility Sentences Test (LIST, (van Wieringen &amp; Wouters, 2008)) was specifically designed for speech perception in noise assessment in CI users. The test has a high test-retest reliability and a steep slope making it very sensitive to small improvements in performance.
An improvement of 2dB results in a clinically relevant improvement in speech. discrimination in noise. Therefore, the primary endpoint to validate the LUISTER AR scheme will be an improvement of 2dB on speech discrimination in noise.</description>

There are 6 subdomains, ranging from 0 (low) to 100 (high). Subdomains are evaluated by adding together the scores of each questions per subdomain and dividing this by the number of completed items per subdomain. A total score is reported.</description>
