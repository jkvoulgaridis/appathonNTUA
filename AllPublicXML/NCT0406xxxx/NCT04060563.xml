      Determine if frequency specific microcurrent therapy improves pain management of DRA by 30%
      or greater.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Females aged 18 years or older who are postpartum from a singleton gestation status post
      vaginal and with diastasis recti will be recruited. The aim of this study is to determine if
      frequency specific microcurrent therapy improves pain management of DRA by 30% or greater

      Improving DRA after microcurrent therapy in post-partum females may allow a faster, more
      effective return to activity thereby improving the return-to-duty transition and establishing
      personal readiness by meeting military fitness standards.

    <measure>Body Image States Scale (BISS)</measure>
    <time_frame>visit 3/ week 4-12 (will occurr only once in this specified time frame)</time_frame>
    <description>The Body Image States Scale (BISS) is a six-item measure of individuals' evaluation and affect about their physical appearance at a particular moment in time. The BISS is acceptably internally consistent. BISS is appropriately correlated with various trait measures of body image. It is sensitive to reactions in positive versus negative situational contexts. Sex differences reflect those expected from the literature. Construct validity has been confirmed by an experiment on differential reactivity to appearance-related information as a function of level of dysfunctional body-image investment.
Responses to each item were based on 9-point, bipolar, Likert-type scales, semantically anchored at each point. The scale was presented in a negative-to-positive direction for half of the items and a positive-to-negative direction for the other half.

    <measure>Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire- short form 7 (PFIQ-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>visit 3/ week 4-12 (will occurr only once in this specified time frame)</time_frame>
    <description>The PFIQ-7 is a shortened version of the PFIQ and is used to assess life impact in women with pelvic floor disorders. It includes all of the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-7 as well as items related to other pelvic floor disorders. It is intended for women with disorders of the pelvic floor including urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and fecal incontinence.
The PFIQ-7 consists of 3 scales of 7 questions each taken from the Urinary Impact Questionnaire, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire, and the Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire. The 3 scales are scored from 0 (least impact) to 100 (greatest impact) and an overall summary score (0 to 300).
The PFIQ-7 demonstrates construct validity as it demonstrates a significant association with appropriate measures of symptom severity and pelvic floor diagnoses.</description>

    <measure>Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale for lumbar pain and pelvic pain (DVPRS).</measure>
    <time_frame>visit 3/ week 4-12 (will occurr only once in this specified time frame)</time_frame>
    <description>The DVPRS consists of an 11-point numerical rating scale with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating severe pain. It has been confirmed for reliability and validity in measuring both acute and chronic pain, and is currently the standard for pain measurement throughout DoD and VHA health systems. The DVPRS has demonstrated linear scale qualities allowing parametric methods to be used.</description>
