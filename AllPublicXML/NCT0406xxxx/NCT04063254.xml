  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, we will prospectively evaluate the pain response and treatment failure
      rate to determine the most favorable radiation dose in single fraction stereotactic
      radiotherapy using the modern highly conformal technique for bone metastases. Our findings
      should be able to provide evidence-based recommendation to support the utilization of single
      fraction radiotherapy for value-based oncology practice.

      Primary objective To evaluate dose regimen for pain control in terms of rate of treatment
      failure, defined as the first occurrence of any of the following events, at 3 months

        1. Worsening in the worst pain score by at least 3 by brief pain inventory survey

        2. ≥ 50% increase in dose of opioid/narcotic medication

        3. Development of pathologic fracture or cord/nerve compression indicative of surgical
           intervention

        4. Unequivocal radiographic disease progression

      Secondary objectives

        1. Compare pain response/control at the treated site(s) between the two treatment regimens
           by brief pain inventory survey

        2. Assess health-related quality of life for palliative cancer care patients (EORTC
           QLQ-C15-PAL &amp; EORTC-BM22 Mandarin Taiwan)

        3. Evaluate the analgescis use after irradiation

        4. Evaluate acute and late adverse events associated with irradiation according to CTCAE
           criteria

        5. To evaluate the local control of the treated index site(s)

        6. To evaluate the patterns of failure

        7. To evlaute overall survival

        8. To evaluate the rate of re-irradiation, salvage surgery, interventional procedure, and
           MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound at the treated site(s)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a histologic diagnosis of non-hematopoietic malignancy

          2. Radiographic evidence of bone metastases

          3. Patient with pain or dysathesia on a pain score of at least 2 by brief pain inventory
             survey

          4. Multiple osseous sites are eligible with a maximum of three separate sites irradiated
             concurrently

          5. Patients do not have prior radiotherapy or radiosurgery to the index site(s)

          6. Age ≥ 20 years

          7. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 50%.

          8. Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months

          9. Women of childbearing potential and male participants must practice adequate
             contraception

         10. Patients must be able to comply with the study protocol, pain assessment, quality of
             life survey, and follow-up schedules and provide study-specific informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with radiographic impending or pathological fracture, or malignant epidural
             cord compression at the index site(s) indicative of upfront surgery

          2. Prior radiotherapy or radiosurgery to the index site(s)

          5. Severe, active comorbidities which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with
             the proper assessment of safety and adverse events of the protocol, or limit
             compliance with study requirements, defined as follows:

               1. Uncontrolled active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of
