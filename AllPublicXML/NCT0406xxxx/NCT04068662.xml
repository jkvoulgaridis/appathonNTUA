  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the proposed project is to evaluate a randomized clinical trial of
      the Pregnant Moms' Empowerment Program aimed at detecting its effects on maternal mental
      health, re-victimization, parenting sensitivity, and infant development. The project also
      seeks to examine theoretically-grounded mechanisms of change, including social support and
      empowerment. Women participating in the study will receive either the PMEP or participate in
      a contact-equivalent active control group during pregnancy, and will be interviewed at
      baseline, post-intervention and with their infants at 3 months and 1 year old. The study will
      occur at two sites - the University of Notre Dame and the University of Memphis. Participants
      will be recruited from the local community at both locations, with an equal number of women
      drawn from each site - Memphis, Tennessee (n=115) and South Bend, Indiana (n=115). Enrollment
      will continue for approximately 2.5 years, with an expected rate of 8 eligible women per
      month, based on a pilot study of the Pregnant Moms' Empowerment Program. The expected
      duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 1.5 years, with some
      variation due to women enrolling at different points in their pregnancy.

      The primary objective of the proposed project is to determine if the Pregnant Moms'
      Empowerment Program has positive effects on maternal mental health, re-victimization rates,
      parenting sensitivity, and infant development compared to women's participation in a
      contact-equivalent active control group. This objective will be evaluated using a multi-site
      randomized clinical trial design. Participants (N = 230) will be equally randomized into
      study arms. Eligible women will include those who are: 1) currently pregnant (primi or
      multiparous) and between 10 and 30 weeks gestation, 2) experienced IPV within the past year,
      3) English speaking and 4) age 16 or older.

      The study will include 9 total visits: 4 assessments and 5 sessions for both study arms.
      In-person assessment visits will be completed by a trained research assistant; each visit
      will take approximately 2-3 hours, with post-partum assessments somewhat longer than prenatal
      assessments given the addition of the infant developmental assessment and parent-child
      observation task. Women will be compensated $30 for the first two assessments and $50 for the
      second two assessments. Treatment sessions will be 2 hours in duration. Women in the PMEP
      will complete a structured set of sessions: (1) supporting each other, support in the
      community, (2) identifying and understanding sources of distress, (3) cognitive and
      behavioral strategies to build resilience and resolve conflict, (4) perinatal health and
      infant care, and (5) positive parenting. Women in the active control condition will
      participate in facilitated discussions on a topic identified by the group. All sessions will
      be audio recorded so that treatment fidelity can be evaluated (for the Pregnant Moms'
      Empowerment Program) and so that content overlap can be assessed (for the active control
      condition).

    <description>Mothers will report on symptoms of posttraumatic stress using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (Weathers, Litz, Keane, Palmieri, Marx, &amp; Schnurr, 2013). We hypothesize that compared to women in the active control condition, that beginning at the post-treatment assessment women in the treatment condition will have lower levels of posttraumatic stress. Further, we hypothesize that this will be mediated by the effect of treatment on women's empowerment and social support. Items are summed to create a total score, which can range from 0 to 80.

    <measure>Maternal Sensitivity at infant age 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal sensitivity will be assessed using observational paradigms coded by trained research assistants for sensitive parenting behaviors. At the 3 month and 12 month postpartum assessments, mother-infant dyads will participate in a fixed-order observational assessment, constituted of the Still-Face Paradigm (Tronick et al., 1978) and a 10-minute free play period. Parent sensitivity will be rated on a 5 point Likert scale from the play and reunion episodes. Coded ratings on sensitivity and intrusiveness will be combined across intervals to create a composite maternal sensitivity score. We hypothesize that compared to women in the active control condition, women in the treatment condition will show higher levels of maternal sensitivity at the 3-month postpartum assessment. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <description>The Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus, et al, 1996) will be used to assess the severity of psychological, physical, and sexual violence experienced by women in a dating, cohabiting, or marital relationship. We hypothesize that compared to women in the active control condition that women in the treatment condition will have lower frequency of intimate partner re-victimization over time. Further, we hypothesize that this will be mediated by the effect of treatment on women's empowerment and social support. Items cluster into five scales: physical assaults, psychological aggression, sexual coercion, injury, and negotiation techniques. Respondents report frequency on a scale of 1 = once [since the last interview] to 6 = more than 20 times [since the last interview]. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes. The current study used the frequency scoring method for the CTS2, which recodes the scale to represent the midpoints of each range with a possible total range of 0 to 825 events.</description>

    <description>Infant development (cognitive, language, socioemotional) will be evaluated using The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development and The Ages and Stages Questionnaire - 3, which are a standardized measures. We hypothesize that compared to infants born to women in the active control condition, infants born to mothers in the treatment condition will show better developmental outcomes. Further, we hypothesize that infant development at 12 months will be indirectly predicted by mothers' improvement as a result of treatment at 3 months. The Bayley is a standardized measure and within each domain an average score is 100. Higher scores indicate better outcomes. On the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, scores for each subdomain (Communication, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Problem Solving, and Personal-Social) range from 0 to 60.</description>

    <description>At the 3 month and 12 month postpartum assessments, mother-infant dyads will participate in the Still-Face Paradigm (Tronick et al., 1978). Infant affect, which includes a combination of vocal and facial reactions, will be rated on a second-by-second basis across all three episodes of the SFP and free play. A 7 point Likert scale ranging from a -3 (screaming) to +3 (laughing intensely) will be used. Affect data are reduced to the proportion of time infants spend in negative and positive affect states (Braungart-Rieker et al., 2014). We hypothesize that compared to infants born to women in the active control condition, infants born to mothers in the treatment condition will show more positive affect over time, at 3 and 12 months of age. Further, we hypothesize that infant affect at 12 months will be indirectly predicted by mothers' improvement as a result of treatment at 3 months.

    <description>The Pregnant Moms' Empowerment Program is a five session group therapy program designed for pregnant women with a recent history of exposure to intimate partner violence. One session is administered each week with a duration of 2 hours each, for a total of ten contact hours across the course of the intervention. Intervention topics includes safety planning, social support, resilience, psychoeducation about intimate partner violence, cognitive and behavioral strategies for remediating distress, infant sleep and breastfeeding, responsive parenting, and co-parenting.</description>
