  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder is a debilitating condition that develops in the aftermath of a
      traumatic experience, leading to hyperarousal, heightened anxiety, and uncontrolled fear that
      can be driven by intrusive memories or trauma reminders. The Texas Biomedical Device Center
      has developed a novel technique, termed targeted plasticity therapy (TPT), to boost
      neuroplasticity in conjunction with various forms of rehabilitation, including prolonged
      exposure therapy. The technique involves stimulation of the vagus nerve. The purpose of this
      open-label pilot study is to assess the safety of using a new device to deliver vagus nerve
      stimulation to reduce symptom severity in participants with PTSD when paired with prolonged
      exposure therapy. Additionally, the study will assess the prospective benefit of the system
      and garner an initial estimate of efficacy for a subsequent trial.

    <time_frame>From Week 5 [Implantation] through study follow-up, approximately two years from the date of implant</time_frame>
    <description>Review of adverse events reported throughout the trial will be used to inform the potential risks associated with the ReStore system and provide a better understanding of risk/benefit analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Symptom Scale for DSM-5 (PSSI-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 9, 15, 19, 36, 62</time_frame>
    <description>The PSSI-5 is a 24-item, psychometrically validated, semi-structured interview that assesses PTSD symptoms in the past two weeks, and makes a diagnostic determination based on the DSM-5 criteria (Foa et al., 2016b). The PSSI-5 screens for the presence of a Criterion A traumatic event, the &quot;index trauma,&quot; which functions as the focus of the interview, meaning that all other items refer to that event. Questions assess for PTSD symptoms corresponding to the 4 DSM-5 clusters of re-experiencing, avoidance, changes in mood and cognition, and arousal and hyperactivity, in addition to interference, distress, and duration of symptoms. The interviewer rates participant responses to symptom questions on a 5-point scale of frequency and severity, from 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;6 or more times a week/severe&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale for DSM-5 (PDS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 9-15, 19, 36, 62</time_frame>
    <description>The PDS-5 is a 20-item psychometrically validated measure designed to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD and measure the severity of PTSD symptoms (Foa et al., 2016a). Severity is measured on a scale from 0 to 51. The measure is based on the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 9-15, 19, 36, 62</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief self-report measure of major depressive disorder (Kroenke et al, 2001). The PHQ-9 is considered to be a valid measure of depression for population-based studies and clinical populations (Corson, Gerrity, &amp; Dobscha, 2004) with a cut off score of equal or greater than 10 as the diagnostic for current depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 9-15, 19, 36, 62</time_frame>
    <description>The PTCI is a 36-item instrument that assesses dysfunctional post-trauma cognitions across self, world, and self-blame to yield a total score (Foa et al., 1999). The scale has high internal consistencies (.97, .88, .86, .97, respectively) and correlates well with PTSD severity, anxiety, and depression (.44 to .79).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 9, 15, 19, 36, 62</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD7 is a 7-item questionnaire that measures severity of anxiety (Spitzer et al, 2006). Response options are &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day,&quot; scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Therefore, GAD-7 scores range from 0 to 21, with scores of 5, 10, and 15 representing mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptom levels, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 9, 15, 19, 36, 62</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured PTSD diagnostic interview that measures PTSD symptoms. (Weathers, Bovin, Lee, et al. 2018).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 9, 62</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20 item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. (Weathers, Litz, Keane, et al. 2013).</description>
