  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to investigate (1) the efficacy of emotional association bias modification
      (EABM) training on internet gaming disorder (IGD); (2) the underlying neural mechanisms of
      such efficacy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As with the efficacy, the experiment aims to test whether EABM training will reduce positive
      emotional association bias towards gaming, compulsive choice of gaming pictures, cue-induced
      craving for gaming, the severity of gaming behaviors in individuals with IGD.

      As with the underlying neural mechanisms, the experiment aims to test whether EABM training
      will alter the activation of reward circuits in response to gaming pictures, the activation
      of executive control network (mainly refering to the prefrontal cortex) regarding regulation
      ability for craving and response inhibition ability.

    <description>In the ROC (regulation of craving) task, participants will report gaming-related craving during look condtion, and during regulation condition using cognitive reappraisal，respectively.

    <description>In the ROC task, in the regulation condition, participants will downregulate gaming-related craving and upregulate craving for non-gaming activities, respectively, using cognitive reappraisal during fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Brain responses relating to these regulation processes will be assessed</description>

    <description>Scores on Young's internet addiction test will be assessed before training, and one month after training. This scale tests severity of internet addiction, with higher total scores representing more severe addictive tendencies. The scale range is 20-100, with 50-60 corresponding to mild severity, 60-80 corresponding to moderate severity, with 80-100 corresponding to high severity.</description>

    <description>The training aims at associating gaming pictures with negative words and pictures of healthy activities with positive words. Gaming pictures are always presented with a pair of negative words. Pictures of healthy activities are always presented with a pair of positive words. Each picture is presented with a fixed pair of words. Participants will be instructed to select one word to get the most monetary reward. Specifically, in response to each gaming picture, selecting one word will have a 70% chance to get a monetary reward and the other word will have a 30% chance to get a monetary reward. A similar rationale applies to the pictures of healthy activities. The reward setting will help consolidate target associations.
Each training session includes 300 times/trials of each type of association, presented in pseudorandom way. The whole training includes 6 training sessions. Participants will receive one training session every days.</description>
