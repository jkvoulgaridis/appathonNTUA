  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term myofascial pain refers to the existence of myofascial trigger points (MTP), which
      are defined as hypersensitive points in a tense band of skeletal muscle, which can cause
      referred pain or autonomous phenomena.

      To address the treatment of myofascial trigger points, conservative and invasive techniques
      have been proposed. Dry needling is one of the invasive techniques that have been shown to be
      effective in improving pain and function in patients with myofascial trigger points.

      This trial aims to analyse the effectiveness of dry needling in patients with myofascial neck
      pain.

      The main objective of the study is to analyze the effects of dry needling on the superficial
      neck musculature in patients with chronic myofascial neck pain in terms of pain, functional
      capacity, mobility, psychosocial variables and motor control compared with both sham dry
      needling group and control group.

      In addition, a secondary objective is to analyze the relationships between the psychosocial
      variables and the results obtained in the variables analyzed in the patients belonging to the
      three groups.

      For this purpose the investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial double-blind.
      Patients included are randomized into 3 groups. One receives dry needling, another one
      receives sham dry needling, and the last one is a control group.

      The hypothesis of this study is that patients in the real dry needling group will improve
      more compared to patients in the sham dry needling group and the control group.
