    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, single-armed, phase II study will evaluate efficacy and safety
      of Sintilimab in combination with Xelox (Oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 iv d1 Q3w and Capecitabine
      1000mg/m2 po Bid d1-14 Q3W) as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with resectable locally
      advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma(G/GEJ AC). Newly diagnosed, treatment
      naïve patients with resectable locally advanced gastric or G/GEJ AC will be eligible to
      receive up to 3 cycles of sintilimab plus Xelox regimen as neoadjuvant therapy. Following
      radical gastrectomy will be performed within one to four weeks since last dosing for patients
      with resectable cancer after radiological evaluation.
