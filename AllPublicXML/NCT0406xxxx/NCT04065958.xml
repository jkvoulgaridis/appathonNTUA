  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the potential effects on pain, pain-related symptoms and quality of life
      of a yoga-mindfulness program, compared to patient education and physiotherapy, for patients
      with rheumatic joint disease and persistent pain problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Earlier studies has indicated that body-mind therapies such as yoga and tai chi might be
      beneficial in the management of chronic pain syndromes. Chronic pain affects a large number
      of patients with rheumatic joint diseases. Effective treatments are lacking for this patient
      group, so new treatment strategies are warranted.

      The study is designed as randomized controlled trial where participants are allocated on a
      1:1 ratio to either a 15 week intervention program of yoga-mindfulness or 15 weeks of patient
      education and mild physiotherapy.

      Study outcomes include pain levels and other pain-related features such as fatigue, sleep
      problems, mood disturbances and functional disability as well as measurements of
      health-related quality of life.

    <measure>Symptom Impact Questionnaire- Revised (SIQR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 5, 10 and 15 weeks of intervention as well as 12 weeks after the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>SIQR is a questionnaire that captures the spectrum of symptoms usually associated to fibromyalgia. It consists of three domains (function, overall impact and symptoms) and includes questions about functional disability, level of disease burden and symptoms such as pain and pain-related features, e.g. fatigue, sleep problems, depression/anxiety etc. It is calculated into a score ranging from 0-100, where 0 means no symptoms. The score will be evaluated as change from baseline to study completion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 5, 10 and 15 weeks of intervention as well as 12 weeks after the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall impression of change in symptoms during the study period. PGIC consists of a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (Very Much Improved) to 7 (Very Much Worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 5, 10 and 15 weeks of intervention as well as 12 weeks after the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of coping strategies and level of acceptance in relation to chronic pain. CPAQ contains 20 items, divided in two categories: Activity engagement and Pain willingness. The items are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (never true) to 6 (always true). For Activity engagement the scores are summed and for Pain willingness the scores are reversed and then summed. To obtain the total score, the scores for each category are summed. The total score ranges from 0-120, where a higher score indicates higher level of acceptance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 5, 10 and 15 weeks of intervention as well as 12 weeks after the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of negative thoughts (&quot;catastrophizing&quot;) in relation to pain. PCS is a 13-item instrument, where each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The PCS yields a total score and three subscale scores assessing rumination, magnification and helplessness. The PCS total score is computed by summing responses to all 13 items. Total score ranges from 0-52, where a higher number indicates more catastrophizing. The rumination subscale ranges from 0-16, the magnification subscale ranges from 0-12 and the helplessness subscale ranges from 0-24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 5, 10 and 15 weeks of intervention as well as 12 weeks after the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of sleep quality during the past month. The total score of PSQI is based on nine questions. From these nine questions, seven components are derived. Each component is scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0-21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 5, 10 and 15 weeks of intervention as well as 12 weeks after the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36 evaluates HRQoL in eight components, each component is scored on a scale ranging from 0-100, where higher scores indicate a more favorable health state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Individual domains of SIQR</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 5, 10 and 15 weeks of intervention as well as 12 weeks after the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Each of the three domains of SIQR will be assessed separately. The &quot;function&quot; domain ranges from 0-30, with higher scores indicating more functional disability. The &quot;overall impact&quot; domain ranges from 0-20 with higher scores indicating a larger overall impact. The &quot;symptom&quot; domain ranges from 0-50 with higher scores indicating more symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of pain, fatigue and general health</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 5, 10 and 15 weeks of intervention as well as 12 weeks after the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Commonly assessed features in rheumatic joint diseases, depicted on VAS-scales. The scales range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain distribution</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 5, 10 and 15 weeks of intervention as well as 12 weeks after the intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain distribution, depicted on a pain mannequin.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Activity Score, 28 joints (DAS28)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 15 weeks of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Disease activity measure used in rheumatic joint diseases. Constitutes a composite score based on an assessment of number of swollen and tender joints as well as inflammatory markers in blood samples and both patients and physicians ratings of disease activity. The score ranges from 0-9.4 with higher scores indicating worse symptoms.</description>
