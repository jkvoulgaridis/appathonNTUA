  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-frequency brain rhythms in the alpha (8-14Hz) and beta (15-29Hz) bands are strong
      predictors of perception and functional performance in a range of tasks, and are disrupted in
      several disease states. The purpose of this study is to investigate a direct causal
      relationship between low-frequency brain rhythms and sensory perception, and to optimize
      commonly used TMS paradigms to impact sensory processing and perception in a similar manner
      as endogenous rhythms. To do so, this study combines human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
      electroencephalography (EEG), non-invasive brain stimulation (transcranial magnetic
      stimulation; TMS), and biophysically principled computational neural modeling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies have shown that high power low-frequency brain rhythms in the alpha (8-14) and
      beta (15-29 Hz) bands in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) are associated with a decreased
      probability of perceiving tactile stimuli at perceptual threshold, and can be modulated with
      attention. Furthermore, high power beta activity in SI emerges as brief &quot;events&quot; (&lt;150ms) in
      un-averaged data, the rate and timing of which underlie the attentional and perceptual
      effects associated with high beta power.

      In this study, human electroencephalography (EEG) and a non-painful tactile detection task
      are used to assess if and how the rate and timing of ongoing rhythmic events in the
      alpha/beta bands prior to a tactile stimulus causally impact touch perception, and how this
      relates to attention. A custom TMS protocol that is hypothesized to mimic endogenous
      beta-frequency event patterns is used to test whether TMS can impact perception in a similar
      manner. Finally, computational neural modeling designed to simulate macro-scale EEG signals
      is used to aid in the interpretation of potential neural circuit mechanisms underlying
      features of acquired EEG data.

      The TMS-EEG components of this study will use a within-subjects crossover design. In initial
      study sessions, participants will have an MRI, and then complete a tactile detection task
      while EEG data is recorded. In subsequent study sessions, participants will complete the
      tactile detection task while EEG data is recorded concurrent with online active or sham TMS.
      Analyses will focus on comparing detection probabilities of tactile stimuli presented at
      perceptual threshold and tactile evoked response potential waveforms between trials in which
      TMS pulses or endogenous beta events occur with similar timing and intensity.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will complete initial MRI and EEG sessions without TMS. MRIs are subsequently used for TMS neuronavigation (region of interest targeting). There is no intervention applied during the MRI and EEG-only sessions.
In two subsequent concurrent TMS-EEG sessions, all participants will receive both sham and active TMS while carrying out a tactile detection task. During one of the two TMS-EEG sessions, TMS will be applied over somatosensory cortex. During the other TMS-EEG session, TMS will be applied over a control brain region unrelated to somatosensory cortex.
The order of sham vs. active TMS conditions within sessions will be counterbalanced across participants, but will be kept consistent for each participant across sessions. The order of somatosensory vs. non-somatosensory TMS targeting will also be counterbalanced across participants.</intervention_model_description>

EEG is recorded and TMS is applied over a control brain region unrelated to our primary target of interest (somatosensory cortex) during the tactile detection task. This control condition is intended to mimic the peripheral (e.g. cranial/facial muscle and/or nerve activation, auditory evoked response), but not biological effects of TMS specifically related to somatosensory perception.</description>
