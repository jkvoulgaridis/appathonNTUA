  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to develop a web-based system that uses distance education methods and
      provides manuals and protocols to train, certify, and monitor the performance of
      interventionists to deliver the Savvy Caregiver program (Savvy), an evidence-based dementia
      family caregiver psychoeducation program. The system has a potential to increase the
      scalability of Savvy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of People Living With Disability (PLWD) in the U.S. will rise from 5.7 million to
      14 million by 2050, and the number of family caregivers who maintain these persons in the
      community will rise proportionately from 15 million at present. Several psychoeducation
      programs, including Savvy, have successfully ameliorated the adverse effects of caregiving,
      but these programs are only minimally available and accessible.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D scale is a brief self-report scale designed to measure self-reported symptoms associated with depression experienced in the past week. It includes 20 items comprising six scales reflecting major facets of depression: depressed mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scale - 20-item 4-point Likert scale is sensitive to changes in transitory anxiety. State anxiety items include: &quot;I am tense; I am worried&quot; and &quot;I feel calm; I feel secure.&quot; Trait anxiety items include: &quot;I worry too much over something that really doesn't matter&quot; and &quot;I am content; I am a steady person.&quot; All items are rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., from &quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI) score is a 22-item Likert scale. Each item is a statement which the caregiver is asked to endorse using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always). Total score is obtained by summing all items endorsed. Higher scores indicate greater perceived burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Pearlin Mastery score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pearlin Mastery (PM) scale measures the extent to which an individual regards their life chances as being under their personal control rather than fatalistically ruled. Response options: 4-point Likert scale, 1,&quot;Strongly disagree&quot; and 4,&quot;Strongly agree&quot;. Items are summed, yielding a range from 7 to 28. Higher scores indicate greater levels of mastery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Assessment of Behavioral Skill score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver Assessment of Behavioral Skill scale is 17-item self-report assessment of behavioral management skills</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist is a 22-item Likert scale that assesses patient behaviors and caregiver responses to them. The caregivers' reaction to each behavior, or the extent of distress experienced, are scored. Reactions are assessed by asking how &quot;upsetting&quot; the behavior was on a Likert scale of 0 to 4 (0 = Not at all, 1= a little, 2 = moderately, 3 = very much, and 4 =extremely). Frequency of behaviors are assessed based on a Likert-scale of 0 to4 (0 = never occurs, 1 = occurs infrequently and not in the last week, 2 = occurred 1-2 times in the last week, 3 = occurred 3-6 times in the last week, and 4 = occurs daily or more often). It yields a summary score - higher scores indicate greater levels of distress.</description>

    <description>Using an on-line survey method, each caregiver will be asked to complete the post-program fidelity monitoring survey that seeks responses to the program (feel more knowledgeable, more competent, better equipped, etc.) and asks them to assess the interventionist's performance and verify that certain key elements of the program were covered.</description>

    <description>Three recorded semi-structured video interviews will be conducted with each interventionist. One will occur immediately after training; this will focus on their sense of the completeness and adequacy of the training program, including the training methods, videos, and materials, and their perceived readiness to lead the program. Another interview will be done immediately after the conduct of each of the two Savvy programs they lead, asking them to report on their own performance as interventionists, including any adaptation processes in which they might have engaged, and to reflect on ways the training might be improved to strengthen their skills, including for adaptation. In total: 18 interviews.</description>

    <description>Recorded semi-structured video interviews with sponsoring organizations' key contact persons will be conducted immediately after the interventionist training and then after each of two Savvy offerings. The conversation will focus on identifying ways to strengthen and improve the training, certification, and fidelity monitoring system. Information about time and resource costs of the program, caregiver demand, and caregiver recruitment and feedback (3 interviews per organization) will be also collected.</description>

    <description>Caregiver program (Savvy) is an evidence-based dementia family caregiver psychoeducation program. Provided to groups of 8-12 (typically) individuals caring for family members living with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (PLWD), Savvy employs a mechanism of action based in Social Cognitive theory to promote caregivers' solution-focused coping behaviors through the acquisition of appropriate knowledge, skills, and outlook and the enhancement of caregiving mastery.</description>
