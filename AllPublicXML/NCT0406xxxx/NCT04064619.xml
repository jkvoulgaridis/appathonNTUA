    <textblock>
      Our study included 60 patients with idiopathic OAB and treated with solifenacin 5mg twice
      daily for one month. After improvement of their condition, we divided the responders into 2
      groups, group I stopped the drug suddenly, while group II underwent gradual weaning of the
      drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We started an open-label, prospective, two-arm, randomized controlled trial at Beni-Suef
      University, from January 2018 to January 2019, including 60 patients suffering from OAB
      symptoms. Patients were recently diagnosed with idiopathic OAB which was not treated prior to
      enrollment. All participants signed written informed consents. The study protocol was
      approved by the ethics committee of our faculty. Patients were allocated into 2 equal groups
      (30 patients in each group) according to a computer-generated random numeric table after
      exclusion of those who are not eligible or refused to be included in the study
