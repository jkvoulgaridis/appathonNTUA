          -  Biopsy proven pulmonary sarcoidosis diagnosed &gt; 1 year prior to screening

          -  Scadding stage II, III or IV as determined by the most recent chest x-ray obtained

             (Note: hydroxychloroquine is allowed as background therapy but not required)

          -  A known diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis

          -  Forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;50% of predicted at screening (central read)

          -  Modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale ≥ 3 at screening

             investigator immunocompromises the patient and/or places the patient at unacceptable
             risk for immunomodulatory therapy

          -  Contraindication to FDG-PET scan investigations such as severe claustrophobia or
             uncontrolled diabetes

          -  History or current diagnosis of ECG abnormalities indicating significant risk of
             safety for patients participating in the study
