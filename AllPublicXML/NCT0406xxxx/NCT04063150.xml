  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase IV randomized clinical trial that will compare immune responses
      among infants who receive different dose schedules of either fractional dose or full dose
      inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), delivered either intramuscularly or intradermally.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation is essential to achieve eradication of polio as OPV
      contains live poliovirus, which can mutate and become neurovirulent. After OPV cessation,
      inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) will be the only polio vaccine used for routine
      immunization. This clinical trial will provide poliovirus type-specific immunogenicity data
      on an IPV or fractional-dose IPV (fIPV)-only schedule for routine immunization, which will be
      important for post OPV cessation era. For fIPV, it will provide immunogenicity data on fIPV
      administered either intradermally (ID) or intramuscularly (IM) and allow a direct comparison
      of the two methods.

      Healthy infants 6 weeks of age will be enrolled at two study clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh,
      and randomized to one of seven study arms. Infants will be followed-up until 10 months of age
      through clinic visits. Blood specimens will be collected to test for immunological response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy infants 6 weeks of age

          -  Parents that consent for participation in the full length of the study.

          -  Parents that are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents and infants who are unable to participate in the full length of the study.

          -  A diagnosis or suspicion of immunodeficiency disorder either in the infant or in an
             immediate family member.

          -  A diagnosis or suspicion of bleeding disorder that would contraindicate parenteral
             administration of IPV or collection of blood by venipuncture.

          -  Acute diarrhoea, infection or illness at the time of enrolment (6 weeks of age) that
             would require infant's admission to a hospital.

          -  Acute vomiting and intolerance to liquids within 24 hours before the enrolment visit
             (6 weeks of age).

          -  Evidence of a chronic medical condition identified by a study medical officer during
             physical exam.

          -  Receipt of any polio vaccine (OPV or IPV) before enrolment based upon documentation or
             parental recall.

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity or reaction to polio vaccine, or its contents.

          -  Infants from multiple births. Infants from multiple births will be excluded because
             the infant(s) who is/are not enrolled would likely receive OPV through routine
             immunization and transmit vaccine poliovirus to the enrolled infant. Even if all
             births from a multiple birth could be enrolled in the study, we will exclude multiple
             births as discontinuation of one may lead to discontinuation of multiple participants.

          -  Infants from premature births (&lt;37 weeks of gestation).
