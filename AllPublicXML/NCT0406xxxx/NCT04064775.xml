  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2 interventions aimed to examine whether peer-led nudging on social media may be a way of
      influencing young adults and adolescents to reduce their self-reported ideal portion sizes of
      high energy-dense snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages.

    <textblock>
      Two pilot interventions were conducted which examined the influence of peer-led nudging on
      social media as a way of influencing self-reported ideal portions of high energy-dense snacks
      and sugar-sweetened beverages. In both interventions the peers posted images of 'their'
      snacks and beverages, which constituted the recommended portion, onto an Instagram account.
      The peers also posted images relating to portion sizes, calories and other information
      related to health but not specifically portion size. It was hypothesised that viewing images
      of peers' snacks would influence the participants to reduce their own snack and beverage
      ideal portion sizes.

      Intervention 1 lasted for 2 weeks and recruited young adults and used a within-subjects
      design. Intervention 2 lasted for 4 weeks and recruited adolescents and used a
      between-subjects design. In intervention 2, participants were randomly assigned to either the
      intervention or the control condition. This protocol focusses on intervention 2.

      In both interventions, participants in the intervention condition were added to an Instagram
      account and were required to visit Instagram daily and to like all posts. All participants
      (intervention and control) completed a survey at baseline and at the end of the intervention,
      and completed quizzes at the end of each week.

    <description>Questionnaire measuring participants' self-reported ideal portion size. The aim of the intervention was to reduce the ideal portion size. Participants were provided with different images of food. For each image, judgements were made on whether the portion was 'too little', 'slightly less than I would eat', 'just right', 'slightly more than I would eat', or 'too much'.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline at the beginning of week 1 and intervention end at the end of week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring participants' liking and frequency of consumption. Participants' reported frequency of consumption for and liking of each item were assessed based on questions used by Stok, De Ridder, De Vet, &amp; De Wit (2014). Mean frequency and liking scores were calculated for HED snacks and SSBs. A low score for frequency indicated that the item was not eaten frequently, a low score for liking indicated that the item was not liked.</description>

    <description>Questionnaire measuring participants' intentions. Participants' reported intentions which were assessed based on questions used by Stok, De Ridder, De Vet, &amp; De Wit (2014). Mean intention scores were calculated for HED snacks and SSBs. A low score for intention score indicated that participants did not intend to change their behaviour.</description>

    <description>In intervention 2 participants took part in a 4-week intervention on Instagram. Participants saw images of fictitious peers' snacks or beverages three times per week, and saw snack information images three times per week. Peer snack images were posted on days 2,4 and 6 of each week, and snack information images were posted on days 1,3 and 5 of each week. Images were posted between 10-11am each day. Participants also completed quizzes related to snacking at the end of weeks 1-3. Participants completed a survey at baseline and intervention end to assess their ideal portion sizes to allow for examination of the effectiveness of the intervention.</description>
