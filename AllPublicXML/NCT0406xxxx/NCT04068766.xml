  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It remains controversial whether paracervical block should be performed as a powerful
      strategy for pain relief in laparoscopic myomectomy (LM), because convincing conclusions are
      difficult to draw because of the heterogeneous and contradictory nature of the literature.
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of paracervical blocks using
      with 0.5% bupivacaine prior to LM for benign gynecologic conditions on postoperative pain
      relief.

      However, no study investigating the efficacy of paracervical block in laparoscopic myomectomy
      on postoperative pain was conducted, to date. Therefore, the goal of this study is to
      evaluate whether patients who receive a paracervical block of 5% bupivacaine with epinephrine
      at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy would have lower postoperative pain, with less
      consumption of rescue analgesics than patients who receive a paracervical block of normal
      saline.
