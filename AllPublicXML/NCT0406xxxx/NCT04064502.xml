      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of chronic ankle instability using
      the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) and investigate the independent associated
      factors. The data was collected from adult volunteers by questionnaire including
      sociodemographic information, general medical condition, history of orthopedic surgery, pain
      intensity, and the number of painful areas of the foot.

      Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a common condition encountered with persistent symptoms of
      giving way, pain, and weakness and recurrent risk, which may lead to functional
      insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of chronic ankle
      instability using the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) and investigate the
      independent associated factors.

      The data was collected from adult volunteers by questionnaire including sociodemographic
      information, general medical condition, history of orthopedic surgery, pain intensity, and
      the number of painful areas of the foot. 273 adult volunteers participated in the study,
      through face to face or online. Subjects are classified as having CAI with a CAIT score ≤27.

    <description>Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool
(CAIT) is a 9-item questionnaire generating a score from 0 to 30 for each ankle, in which 0 is the worst possible score, meaning severe instability, and 30 is the best possible score, meaning stability. The CAIT is considered a reliable instrument to distinguish between stable and unstable ankles, meanwhile, measuring the severity of functional ankle instability.</description>
