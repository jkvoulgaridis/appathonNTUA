  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supraglottic airway devices (SGADs) are frequently preferred in surgical surgery for
      pediatric patients. i-gel LMA (laryngeal mask airway) and Ambu Aura-i LMA are the new
      generation supraglottic airway devices. The aim of this study was to compare airway trauma
      and postoperative complications due to i-gel and Ambu Aura in infants. In the study patients
      were divided into two groups performed on minor surgery ASA I (American Society of
      Anesthesiologists score) and 40 infants. After standard anesthesia i-Gel was placed into a
      group and Ambu Aura-i was placed to the other. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed at the end
      of surgery. Mucosal damage and postoperative complications in laryngopharyngeal structures
      were compared.

      This study was conducted as prospective, randomized and double-blind study. After
      confirmation the approval from the Interventional Ethics Committee of the Bezmialem Vakif
      University, dated…. Number…., the study was started. Forty ASA I patients under the age of 1,
      with a body weight of more than 10 kg, without anatomical pathology in the upper airway with
      no general anesthesia within the last 2 weeks who underwent minor surgery (circumcision,
      inguinal hernia, undescended testis, hypospadias, etc.) by the Pediatric Surgery Clinic at
      Bezmialem Vakif University Medical School Hospital were included in the study. Patients who
      are older than 1 year of age and have a body weight of more than 10 kg, who have symptoms of
      upper or lower respiratory tract infection, who have more than one trial performed during the
      SADs placement, who are known and expected to be difficult airway, who has undergone surgery
      for more than 2 hours and patients who underwent emergency surgery were not included in the
      study.
