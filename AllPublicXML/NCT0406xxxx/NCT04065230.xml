      This study is a single-group, multi-center and prospective clinical study designed to assess
      the efficacy and safety of TAF in blocking mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B
      virus.Pregnant women whose HBsAg and HBeAg are positive are included in the study.Eligible
      hepatitis B pregnant women are given TAF antiviral therapy at 24-28 weeks of gestation to
      block mother-to-child transmission and followed up during pregnancy and after delivery.The
      study will be initiated with approval by the central ethics committee.Subjects will start
      screening after signing the informed consent form. Those who meet the criteria will start
      taking TAF (25mg, oral, 1/day) at 24-28 weeks of gestation until one month after delivery.At
      that time, chronic hepatitis B carrier will stop taking antiviral therapy, and patients with
      chronic hepatitis B decide whether to continue the therapy according to the patient's
      condition.The babies born are immunized according to the national standard immunization
      program,, that is, 100 IU of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and 10 Î¼g/0.5 ml of hepatitis
      B vaccine are given within 12 hours after birth. And the same dose of hepatitis B vaccine is
      given at 1 month and 6 months of age.

        Pregnant women in the Affiliated Nanjing Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine
        (The Second Hospital of Nanjing) whose HBsAg and HBeAg are positive are enrolled in the
        study. TAF is used as antiviral therapy during 24-28 week of gestation.The safety and
