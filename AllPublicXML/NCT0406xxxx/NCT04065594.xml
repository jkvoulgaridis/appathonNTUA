      Background

      Chronic non-healing ulcer is a common problem met in clinical practice and represents a
      burden to the patients. Chronic ulcer lacks growth factors (GFs) to promote the healing
      process and is frequently followed by superadded infections. Ordinary technique such as wound
      debridement and regular dressings cannot provide adequate results as these techniques cannot
      provide the necessary GFs. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) helps wound healing by releasing
      various types of GFs.

      The aim: to evaluate and compare the efficacy of PRP dressing versus traditional dressings in
      the treatment of chronic non-healing leg and foot ulcers of different etiology as regard cost
      of overall treatment and effectiveness (reduction of the size of the ulcer and safety of the
      technique).

      Methods

      This prospective study was performed on inpatients and outpatients in general surgery
      department, Zagazig university hospital from June 2017 to January 2019. Patients were divided
      randomly into two groups: group A received PRP dressing (N=22, 50%) and group B received
      conventional ordinary dressing (N=22, 50%).The mean follow-up period was 3 months after the
      last dressing. Patients treated with PRP at once-weekly interval for a maximum of 12
      dressings while patients with ordinary dressings may need one dressing every other day for a
      maximum of 12 weeks. The reduction in the size of the ulcers (area and volume) in both groups
      was assessed using centimeter scale and Digital photographs before and after each session and
      during follow up period.
