  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the brain activity associated with motor and
      non-motor symptoms of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential
      tremor. These movement disorders commonly have significant non-motor features, such as
      depression, cognitive and memory impairment, decreased attention, speech and language
      disturbances, and slower processing speeds. The investigators are interested in the brain
      activity associated with these motor and non-motor symptoms, and propose to investigate
      changes in brain activity while the investigators perform recordings of the surface and deep
      structures of the brain, in addition to the typical recordings the investigators perform,
      during routine deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Movement disorders are a prominent cause of disability worldwide. In the United States, it is
      estimated that more than 4 million people suffer from Parkinson's disease (PD), essential
      tremor (ET), and dystonia, making them some of the most prevalent of neurologic disorders. Of
      these, PD is the most common, and is primarily characterized by tremor, rigidity, and
      bradykinesia. However, though primarily characterized by motor symptoms, many patients also
      have prominent non-motor features, including depression and cognitive impairment, with
      deficiencies in processing speed, memory, attention, and learning. Some of the most
      debilitating cognitive deficiencies include deficits in goal-directed response selection and
      response inhibition, language, and/or speech difficulties, all of which substantially
      contribute to reduced quality of life.

      Unfortunately, these features of movement disorders are less well-studied and lack effective
      treatment options, necessitating that new treatments be investigated. Deep brain stimulation
      (DBS), while a highly effective treatment for the cardinal features of PD, is essentially
      ineffective for, and can even worsen other cognitive domains, and there are few studies
      currently investigating how different parameters of DBS may improve these symptoms. In
      addition, speech abnormalities are common with Parkinson's disease and DBS can sometimes
      worsen speech problems. These impairments consists primarily of hypophonia, but cognitive
      deficits can result in actual language disturbance. It is often difficult to know whether the
      speech problems are related to language processing or articulation (related to the movement
      disorder). In an effort to begin addressing these questions, we propose to study motor and
      non-motor symptoms in patients with movement disorders, and to correlate movement and
      cognition with underlying neural electrophysiology.

    <description>After creation of the burr hole and prior to DBS electrode placement, 1-2 subdural strip electrodes will be placed anteriorly or posteriorly from the cranial opening. These electrodes are routinely placed using this technique for seizure mapping, with arrays of electrodes (up to 6) being placed around the perimeter of the opening.14 Subdural strips vary in length and contact size (e.g., the 6-contact Ad-Tech strip), and are currently placed predominantly for studies of sensorimotor function,13 including at our institution (IRB-140327003). Placement over prefrontal areas is performed at other institutions.11-13 The DBS surgery will then proceed according to routine practice, and following lead placement in the optimal desired location, the research task paradigm will begin.</description>
