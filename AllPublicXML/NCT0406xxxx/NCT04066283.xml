  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine markers of vascular endothelial function (vascular health) and
      metabolic profiles in younger versus older transgender women (people who were assigned male
      at birth but whose gender identity is female). Data will also be compared to those from
      cisgender women and men.
