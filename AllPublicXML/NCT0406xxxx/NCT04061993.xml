  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective multicentre randomised clinical trial to be conducted in
      orthopaedic departments of two Slovenian hospitals. In each hospital 125 patients aged 60 or
      older with unilateral osteoarthritis, ASA score 1-3, signed informed consent, access to
      watching USB videos and without terminal illnesses disabling rehabilitation participation,
      will be randomly assigned to intervention (IG) or control group (CG). Total hip arthroplasty
      with anterior approach will be performed. All patients will get current standard
      physiotherapy during hospitalisation. Patients in IG will additionally learn strength and
      sensory-motor training exercises. Patients in both groups will get USB drives with exercise
      videos, written exercise instructions and training diary. Physiotherapists will perform
      measurements (physical tests and maximal voluntary isometric contractions) and patients will
      fill in outcome assessment questionnaires (Harris Hip Score and 36-Item Short Form Health
      Survey) at baseline and 1, 3 and 12 months after surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in isometric hip and trunk muscles strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before surgery), 1, 3 and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal voluntary isometric contractions. We will use specially prepared measuring device with dynamometer attached to stiff bands metal chains. For the assessment of maximal isometric strength, a maximal voluntary isometric contraction for 6 seconds is asked. The same procedure to obtain a maximal voluntary contraction is used for every strength measure. 3 movement planes are assessed for trunk (extension, left and right abduction) and operated hip (flexion, extension and abduction) and 2 for opposite hip (extension, abduction).</description>

    <measure>Change in 8UG</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before surgery), 1, 3 and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>8-Feet Up and Go Test. The 8UG is a timed test that requires one to stand up from a chair with armrests, walk to a cone 8 feet away, turn around, return to the chair and sit down.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 10MW</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before surgery), 1, 3 and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Timed 10-meter walk test. Individual walks without assistance 10 meters and the time is measured for the intermediate 6 meters to allow for acceleration and deceleration. The test is first performed at preferred walking speed and second at fastest speed possible.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HHS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before surgery), 1, 3 and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Harris Hip Score. The HHS is a widely used disease-specific measure of hip disabilities after THA. The physiotherapist administers the test in the form of a structured interview with the patients. The domains include pain, functions of daily living and gait. The rating scale is from 0 (worse) to 100 points (best). The HHS is considered to have good validity and reliability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36_v2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before surgery), 3 and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>36-item short form health survey. The SF-36v2 is a multipurpose, short-form 36-item health survey yielding a profile of two health component summary measures: psychometrically-based physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. It consists of eight health domain scales: Physical functioning (PF), Role-Physical (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health (GH), Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role-Emotional (RE) and Mental Health (MH). The interpretation of results in simplified with the norm-based scoring (Mean = 50, SD = 10) of its health domain scales and component summary measures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Training compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>First 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Training dairy. All participants in both groups will keep a training dairy concerning all training activities - they will make marks by every exercise they will perform on exact day, write notes if they will have any other sport activities (walking, stationary bicycling and other) and if there will be any adverse effects, reasons why they skipped training if they did. They will also measure pain on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) during day before and after training and during night.</description>
