  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational retrospective cohort study of all patients consecutively submitted
      to elective abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery repair at a tertiary referral centre between
      2009 and 2015. Patients were excluded if they were non-elective cases or had complex aortic
      aneurysms (juxta-renal, thoraco-abdominal or thoracic). Differences between both groups of
      repair were assessed, as well as short- and long-term complications including medical
      complications, duration of hospital stay, major cardiovascular events, mortality and vascular
      reintervention.

    <description>In open surgery repair group, aneurysm repair was performed by open surgery including aortobifemoral bypass, aorto-bi-iliac bypass and tubular aortic bypass. In endovascular repair (EVAR group), aneurysm correction was performed by percutaneous approach, femoral cutdowns and aorto-uni-iliac EVARs with femorofemoral bypass.</description>
