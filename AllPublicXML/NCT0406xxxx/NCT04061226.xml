  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparison of the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), measured by polysomnography in
      normal weight patients with central obesity by body mass index (BMI) and waist hip ratio
      (WHR), with normal weight patients without central obesity by BMI and WHR.

      Evaluation of arterial stiffness and vascular age in normal weight patients with central
      obesity and in normal weight patients without central obesity.

      Determination of the exercise response characteristics in OSA patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body composition (the distribution of adipose tissue) appears to be a risk factor for the
      prevalence of obstructive form of sleep apnea. The investigators expect a higher prevalence
      of this serious sleep pathology in normal weight patients with central obesity than in normal
      weight patient without central obesity. In normal weight patients with central obesity also
      endothelial dysfunctions, abnormal exercise response to dynamic load and abnormal circadian
      patterns of blood pressure and heart rate can be expected. There are theoretical assumptions
      for this hypothesis but relevant studies on sufficiently large samples of patients have not
      been done. The investigators will also compare the lipid profile in normal weight patients
      with central obesity with those of normal weight patients without central obesity.
