  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will test the efficacy of a multi-component behavioral intervention to improve
      metabolic control among older adolescents and emerging adults (16-21) with T1D, a group with
      chronic poor metabolic control. This intervention is grounded in self-determination theory
      which states that a youth who believes their diabetes management is self-directed, competent,
      and supported by others is more likely to consistently complete their diabetes self-care.
      This theory-driven intervention will be scalable to a variety of chronic illness contexts and
      the knowledge gained from this research will inform self-determination theory and different
      interventions targeting this population (currently there are no interventions that directly
      target emerging adults).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will use the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) approach to test the
      efficacy of an autonomy supportive behavioral intervention to improve metabolic control among
      older adolescents and emerging adults (16-25) with T1D. Youth this age demonstrate chronic
      poor metabolic control that persists into adulthood leading to the premature emergence of
      short- and long-term diabetes complications. Developmentally, adolescence and emerging
      adulthood is a time when the need for independence and autonomy are particularly salient.
      This new intervention will leverage youths' desire for autonomy by designing an intervention
      to support diabetes self-management autonomy. This intervention is guided by
      self-determination theory (SDT) which suggests that autonomous (i.e., self-initiated, driven
      by intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation) diabetes management depends upon three conditions:
      1) the perception that one's behavior is self-directed, 2) feelings of competence, or
      self-efficacy, and 3) the existence of caring relationships supportive of the behavior. The
      investigators have identified three intervention components that target the SDT constructs. A
      question prompt list (QPL) is a simple, inexpensive tool comprised of a list of questions
      that patients might consider asking their health care provider during a clinic visit. QPLs
      empower patients to assume a more active role (asking questions and stating concerns) during
      clinic visits. The Motivation Enhancing System (MES) is an eHealth intervention to increase
      intrinsic motivation for health behavior change. MES content is based on the Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) framework and the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of
      health behavior change which posits that behavior change results from the joint function of
      three critical components: accurate information about risk behaviors or their replacement
      health behaviors, motivation to change behavior, and behavioral skills necessary to perform
      the behavior (self-efficacy). Text message reminders (TXT) are a strategy to encourage youth
      to complete their diabetes self-care that also lead to gains in self-efficacy and a stronger
      relationship with diabetes care providers through greater communication and satisfaction. The
      investigators will test the efficacy of these intervention components toward improving
      metabolic control in a component selection experiment (N=320). The experiment will use a full
      factorial research design with random assignment to determine which intervention components
      contribute to a clinically significant improvement (≥0.5%) in HbA1c. The result of this
      research will be an optimized, multi-component intervention with effect size estimates that
      will be used to inform a large scale, fully powered effectiveness trial. This theory-driven
      intervention will be scalable to a variety of chronic illness contexts and the knowledge
      gained from this research will inform self-determination theory and behavioral interventions
      targeting this population (for which there currently are none).

    <intervention_model_description>The study will use an 8-arm full factorial design. In arms 1-3 participants will receive 1 of the 3 intervention components, arms 4-6 receive a combination of 2 components, arm 7 receives all 3 components, and arm 8 is the standard care control. The study will use the mixed effects linear model for the ANOVA of a factorial design powered on the main effects to identify the intervention components that significantly contribute to a clinically significant improvement in HbA1c. Each model will include a random intercept and slope and fixed effects for treatment combinations and time, as well as the stratification variable. The component selection experiment will result in empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of an autonomy support intervention composed of one or more components to improve metabolic control.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Diabetes Management Scale (DMS) is a self-report measure of daily diabetes care that assesses a broad range of management behaviors, including insulin management, dietary management, blood glucose monitoring, and symptom response with good internal consistency (α=.74 to .84). Each item asks &quot;What percent of the time do you (take your insulin)?&quot; The response scale is 0-100%. A total score is obtained by summing the items to reflect overall management behavior.</description>

    <description>MES is a brief, 2-session computer-delivered intervention to enhance intrinsic motivation for behavior change. MES is grounded in the Motivational Interviewing framework and the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model of health behavior change. Session 1 begins with psychoeducation describing optimal diabetes self-management, then youth motivation for diabetes self-management is assessed and followed by exercises designed to increase or reinforce his/her current motivational state (e.g., decisional balance) and build self-efficacy, (e.g., building on strengths and past success). Session 1 concludes with goal setting to promote autonomous diabetes self-management. Session 2 begins with an assessment of progress toward the behavioral goal and proceeds to build motivation and self-efficacy with exercises consistent with the youth's current motivational state. Session 2 concludes with goal setting to promote autonomous diabetes self-management.</description>

    <description>A QPL is a list of questions related to the physical and psychosocial aspects of diabetes and treatment that youth may want to ask their physicians during a clinic visit. The theoretical foundation for the QPL resides in social-cognitive theory which posits that behavioral performance is a function of self-efficacy and behavioral expectations. Thus, the goal of a QPL is to increase self-efficacy and active participation in clinical care. QPL is completed within 14-days of a diabetes clinic visit and results in a personalized set of questions for youth to bring to their clinic visit.</description>
