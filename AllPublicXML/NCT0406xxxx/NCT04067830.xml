      This phase II trial studies how well respiratory muscle training before surgery works in
      preventing lung complications after surgery in patients with stage I-IIIB lung cancer.
      Patients with lung cancer who choose to undergo surgical resection often have complications
      after surgery such as pneumonia, unplanned intubations, difficulty breathing and reduced
      physical functioning, and increased medical costs and a reduced quality of life. Improving
      pre-surgical pulmonary health through respiratory muscle training may improve respiratory
      muscle strength, response to surgery, and quality of life after surgery in patients with lung
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the impact of a short-duration respiratory muscle training (RMT) program on
      respiratory muscle strength in patients undergoing resection for lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the extent of diaphragm atrophy and catabolic/anabolic pathway activation between
      RMT responders and non-responders evaluated for gene expression and candidate and candidate
      causative protein levels.

      II. Determine the effect of the short-duration RMT program on health related quality-of-life
      measures.

      III. Assess the impact of the short-duration RMT program on postoperative outcomes.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the financial sustainability of a transitional home-based prehabilitation
      program targeting respiratory muscle weakness prior to lung resection.

      II. Analysis of molecular markers to correlate with patient outcome and potentially
      differentiate responders from non-responders.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (USUAL CARE): Patients receive usual care consisting of physical therapy once weekly,
      receiving pre-surgical information, instruction on the use of a spirometer device, and
      wearing a Fitbit to track activity. Patients then undergo video-assisted thoracic surgery or
      laparoscopic surgery. Patients continue to track activity using the Fitbit for 3 months
      post-surgery.

      ARM II (RMT + USUAL CARE): Patients use a power lung device to complete 3 sets of 15 RMT
      exercises over 30 minutes 6 days per week over 2-4 weeks for a minimum of 12 sessions prior
      to surgery. Patients also receive usual care consisting of physical therapy once weekly,
      receiving pre-surgical information, instruction on the use of a spirometer device, and
      wearing a Fitbit to track activity. Patients then undergo video-assisted thoracic surgery or
      laparoscopic surgery. Patients continue to track activity using the Fitbit for 3 months
      post-surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

    <measure>Change in inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be treated as a continuous variable and will be summarized by treatment group and time-point using the mean, median, standard deviation, and the appropriate percentiles. The effectiveness of the respiratory muscle training (RMT) program on each respiratory outcome will be assessed by comparing the preoperative change between groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, with an adjustment for the pretreatment levels. For each outcome, the preoperative change (T1-T0) will be modeled as a function of treatment group (RMT versus usual care) and pre-treatment levels. A one-sided Wald type-test about coefficient for treatment group will evaluate whether the RMT program had a beneficial impact on the given respiratory outcome. All model assumptions will be verified graphically using quantile-quantile and residual plots. Transformations will be applied as appropriate.</description>

    <description>Assays of muscle biopsies will be performed for metabolic and muscle physiology markers. The correlative markers will be compared between RMT responders, RMT non-responders, and usual care (control) in a pairwise fashion using Holm-Bonferroni adjusted t-tests. Responders will be those who present with a &gt; 15% increase in inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength. The gene-level raw count values of micro ribonucleic acid (mRNA)s will be analyzed with the edgeR Bioconductor package in R, first for normalization with the trimmed mean of M-values method, and then for comparison of expression between treatments using generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution and a likelihood ratio test to generate p values. False discovery rates (FDR) will be estimated from p-values with the Benjamini-Hochberg method, and mRNAs/genes with FDR &lt; 0.05 and fold-change values of &gt;= 1 log2 unit will be considered as differentially expressed.</description>
