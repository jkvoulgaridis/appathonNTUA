    <textblock>
      This study is a validation study to confirm the ability of Telomescan OBP-401 to identify
      CTCs in patients with HPV 16 / 18 associated cervical cancer. CTCs identified will be tested
      for the presence of the HPV 16 / 18 E6 protein, confirming a cervical cancer origin.

        Two groups will be recruited: the case group will consist of 16 participants with advanced
        or recurrent cervical cancer; the control arm will consist of 16 participants without a
        history of cervical cancer or high grade pre-cancer of the cervix.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to safely provide 15 ml of blood

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Pathologically confirmed invasive cervical cancer

          -  Proof of serotype HPV 16 or HPV 18 positive within 3 years of the study

          -  Patients with stages IIA2 to IVB OR recurrent cervical cancer

          -  For patients with newly diagnosed cervical cancer, they must be enrolled (blood drawn)
             prior to initiating anti-cancer therapy

          -  For patients with recurrent cervical cancer, they must be enrolled (blood drawn) prior
             to initiating a new anti-cancer therapy for progression of disease (based on RECIST
             1.1 criteria). Patients who have progressed and are moving to best supportive care are
             eligible.

          -  If patients meet criteria 5.1A 5 above, the following criteria must be met:

          -  At least 21 days have elapsed following treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy

          -  At least 14 days have elapsed following treatment with biologic therapy

          -  At least 14 days have elapsed following radiation therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any cancer other than cervix cancer within the past five years.

          -  History of any known germ-line pathogenic mutation (ie BRCA 1 / 2 or Lynch syndrome,
             but genetic testing is not required)

          -  Current use of systemic corticosteroids at doses exceeding 10 mg per day of prednisone
             or its equivalent.

          -  Active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV.

          -  Any patient unable to comply with the study criteria.

          -  Patients taking any anti-inflammatory agents (aspirin, NSAIDs, steroids), within 24
             hrs prior to blood draw.
