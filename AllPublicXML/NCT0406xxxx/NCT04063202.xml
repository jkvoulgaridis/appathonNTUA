  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to develop a new predictive index to predict future depression of
      adolescents by using factors including individual, interpersonal and environmental. The index
      can be used to predict likelihood of students who are non-probable depression cases convert
      into probable depression cases. In addition, the investigators also test the factors of
      depression remission. It can hence be used in school setting to identify high-risk students,
      and provide them with secondary interventions that are designed by considering modifiable
      significant variables identified in this unique, large-scale, longitudinal study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 12-month longitudinal study will be conducted in secondary school settings.

      The investigators will investigate incidence of probable depression (i.e., from
      non-depression, CESD&lt;16, at baseline to probable depression, CESDâ‰¥16, at month 12) and
      remission of probable depression.

      The investigators will investigate factors that can prospectively predict new cases/remission
      of probable depression, including both well-documented risk/protective factors and some
      under-examined but potentially important local factors (e.g. school/academic stress,
      psychological resilience). The relative importance of the risk/protective factors at
      different socio-ecological levels will be compared and their combined effect will be
      identified.

      Based on the selected factors, the investigators will derive a new prediction index called
      the Adolescent Depression Prediction Index (ADPI) in a model building sample and test its
      performance in predicting incidence of depression in a validation sample among secondary
      school students in Hong Kong.

        Out of the 18 districts in Hong Kong, nine randomly selected districts will select randomly
        two schools and while the rest nine will randomly select one school. Replacements of
        schools will be made upon refusals. Within the selected schools, all Secondary 1-4 students
        will be invited to join the study. Students will be asked to fill in baseline
        questionnaires in the absence of teachers in classroom settings.
