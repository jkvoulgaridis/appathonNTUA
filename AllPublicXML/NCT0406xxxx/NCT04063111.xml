      - Evaluate the role of VAC in decreasing the time needed for soft tissue coverage and

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Open fractures are injuries in which the skin and soft-tissue integument are disrupted
           and the underlying bone is exposed to the external environment. This communication
           results in contamination by microorganisms that can cause deep or superficial infection.
           Impaired vascularity, devitalized tissue, and loss of skeletal stability are all factors
           leading to increased susceptibility to infection after open fracture [1, 2].

        -  Current protocols for treating open fractures include early administration of
           antibiotics, timely surgical debridement, skeletal stabilization, sterile dressing,
           systemic support, and establishment of soft-tissue coverage in a wound environment that
           is clean [3, 4-8].

        -  VAC is being used to obviate the need for, or enhance the success of, free-flap coverage
           in open fractures that are significant enough to preclude primary closure, delayed
           primary closure, or healing by secondary intention. VAC device and its components, which
           in a closed system expose the open wound bed to negative pressure. This pressure removes
           edema or hemorrhage, mechanically pulls on the wound edges, decreases in wound surface
           area, improves circulation, and enhances proliferation of granulation tissue that filled
           the soft tissue defect, enhance debridement of wound debris, reducing the need for
           costly free-flap transfers. VAC devices have been used in many surgical disciplines but
           only recently have become popular in orthopedics [7, 9,].
