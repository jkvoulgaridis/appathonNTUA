  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mind Up (MindUP) is a mindfulness-based social-emotional learning program for children that
      has shown promising evidence of effectiveness across several domains (including executive
      functioning and behavioral symptoms). MindUP has exploded in popularity in recent years, but
      much of the existing research is limited by sample size, lack of accounting for clustering,
      or has been conducted by the program developers. In this study we are evaluating MindUP with
      grade three students (~age 8) in three conditions; students who receive MindUP for the first
      time (n=~150 in 8-10 classrooms), students have been receiving MindUP since kindergarten
      (~150 in 8-10 classrooms), and students in comparison classrooms (i.e., no intervention; ~150
      students in 8-10 classrooms). Regular classrooms teachers will receive training in
      trauma-informed approaches and the MindUP program prior to implementing. Students will be
      assessed in the fall and at the end of the school year using structured rating scales; they
      will also provide self-report data. In November 2020, students' grade 4 teachers will provide
      another set of ratings to be used as 6-month follow-up data. The primary outcome is
      social-emotional learning. Secondary outcomes include executive functioning, academic skills,
      classroom climate, and self-concept.

      Study Design and Overview:

      Social-emotional learning programs have a strong evidence base documenting their
      effectiveness. More recently, there has been increasing interest in social-emotional learning
      programs that include mindfulness; however, there is much less research on these programs,
      and much of the existing work has been hampered by small sample sizes. In this project, the
      investigators will examine the association between participation in the MindUP program and
      social-emotional outcomes in grade three students. The investigators are using a
      quasi-experimental design with pre-post data collection from students and educators. Students
      are nested in classrooms, and the clustered nature of the data will be accounted for in
      analyses. The study will identify changes in social-emotional behaviour, executive
      functioning, classroom climate, academic skills, and self-concept through a combination of
      teacher and self-report data using standardized scales.

      Participants:

      The investigators plan to recruit approximately 24 educators and 450 grade three students in
      approximately 24 classrooms. More or fewer classrooms will be recruited as needed to reach
      the intended sample size of 150 students in each of the three conditions.

      Procedures:

      The school district partnering on this project will identify 24 classrooms to participate.
      The first condition (~150 children in 8-10 classrooms) will participate in MindUP during the
      school year. The second condition (~150 children in 8-10 classrooms) includes children who
      have been participating in MindUP since kindergarten receiving the program in grade 3. The
      third group is a comparison condition where teachers will not implement the program. All
      implementing teachers will receive a half-day training on trauma-informed practice and a
      full-day training in MindUP before beginning the intervention.

      Classroom teachers will send home consent forms for guardians to complete. Children will
      provide their own assent when the researchers come to classrooms to collect data. Surveys
      will be completed in October 2019 and again in May 2020. In November 2020, the students'
      grade 4 teachers will provide ratings for a 6-month follow-up.

      To understand program implementation, educators will be asked to complete a brief online
      survey at the end of each week to report on their weekly engagement with MindUP lesson plans
      generally, and breathing breaks specifically. They will also be asked to report additional
      SEL activities. Educators in comparison classrooms will complete a weekly summary of their
      SEL learning activities as well.

      Planned Analyses The primary comparisons will be between the group receiving MindUP for the
      first time versus the comparison groups (both immediately after intervention, and at 6-month
      follow-up). A secondary set of analyses will compare the group who have received MindUP for
      three years previously to the comparison group to see if they continue to make gains relative
      to the comparison group. Finally, we will also conduct moderator analyses using
      parent-reported adversity to test our hypothesis that students who have experienced more
      adversity will show greater gains.

    <intervention_model_description>Children within grade 3 classrooms will be evaluated in one of three conditions. One condition includes classrooms that will implement MindUP with students for the first time. A second condition includes classrooms that will implement MindUP, but has students who have largely been exposed to MindUP every year since kindergarten. The third condition is the comparison group wherein classroom teachers will deliver their usual curriculum and teaching strategies.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>None (Open Label)</masking>
    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the intervention (i.e., classroom teachers both implement the program (or not) and provide ratings of students' behaviour, it is not feasible to have blinded conditions. Most school-based prevention programs of this type are not blinded.</masking_description>

    <description>Child's view of themselves as assessed by the Feelings, Attitudes, and Behaviors Scale for Children (FAB-C). Higher scores are indicative of poorer functioning (i.e., feeling negative about oneself or feeling socially unaccepted). T scores are used to interpret the level of concerns as reported by children on the FAB-C. These scores are linear transformations of the raw scale scores (M = 50, SD = 10). T scores provide information about an individual's scores relative to the scores of respondents in the standardization sample. Percentiles represent the percentage of children in the standardization sample with scores at or below the same value. For all FAB-C subscales, T scores over 60 are considered somewhat elevated and T scores over 65 are considered significantly elevated.</description>

Both cohesion and satisfaction are measured with six yes/no items, such that children can score between 0 and 6 on each subscale. If the two scales are moderately correlated (as expected give the age of the children), then we will sum them for one class climate scale (ranging from 0-12; higher scores indicate higher cohesion and satisfaction in the classroom).</description>

T scores provide information about an individual's scores relative to the scores of respondents in the standardization sample. Percentiles represent the percentage of children in the standardization sample with scores at or below the same value. For all BRIEF-2 clinical scales and indexes, T scores from 60 to 64 are considered mildly elevated, and T scores from 65 to 69 are considered potentially clinically elevated.

    <description>Grade 3 teachers implement MindUP in their classrooms over the academic year. MindUP is a manualized program informed by cognitive-developmental neuroscience, contemplative science, positive psychology, and social-emotional learning. The curriculum consists of 15 sequential lessons taught in 10-15 minute chunks and cross-curricular extension activities. There are four lesson units: Getting Focused (introduction to brain structure and function, the core practice, and how focused awareness affects brains and feelings), Sharpening Your Senses (focus on internal experiences such as mindful smelling and tasting), It's All About Attitude (focus on cognitive experiences such as positive mindset, perspective-taking, and practicing gratitude), and Taking Action Mindfully (performing acts of kindness to others and building positive relationships). An essential component is the core practice, a focused breathing exercise and mindfulness practice that is implemented three times daily.</description>
