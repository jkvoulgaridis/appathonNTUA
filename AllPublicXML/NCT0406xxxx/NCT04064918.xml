      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effect of Netarsudil and Timolol on eye
      pressure and blood vessels of the back of the eye.

      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to compare the difference in change
      in retinal blood vessel density (peripapillary and macular) between netarsudil ophthalmic
      solution 0.02% dosed once daily (QD) and timolol maleate 0.5% dosed twice daily (BID) in
      subjects with Open Angle Glaucoma (OAG) or Ocular Hypertension (OHT) and in normal subjects.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the change in
      retinal blood vessel density (peripapillary and macular) between treatment groups after 4
      weeks of treatment (Visit 4 [Week 5] and Visit 6 [Week 13]).

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy endpoint for this study is change in
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).

      Safety Endpoints The safety endpoint for this study is the incidence of ocular and systemic
      adverse events (AEs).
