  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of pre-operative counseling in a
      group setting on patient reported anxiety for patients scheduled to undergo surgery for a
      known or suspected gynecologic malignancy. Patient reported anxiety will be evaluated using a
      validated Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) survey. We
      hypothesize that the group counseling session will reduce patient reported anxiety by a
      clinical meaningful level. Secondary objectives will evaluate the effect of the intervention
      on patient reported depression levels and compare adherence to Enhanced Recovery After
      Surgery (ERAS) instructions, utilization of unscheduled health care resources, and
      anxiety/depression levels to historical controls.

      Comprehensive pre-operative counseling and education has been shown to play an important role
      in quality of life, anxiety and depression among cancer patients. Traditionally, patients are
      counseled in the office at the time of informed surgical consent. However there are several
      problems to this model including patient anxiety, confusion, information overload, and time
      constraints that may lead to sub-optimal counseling. Additionally, multiple studies have
      reported that patients forget half of what they have been told within 5 minutes of a health
      consultation and remember only 20% of the information passed on to them. Centering patient
      counseling has been used in other fields of medicine and has been shown to improve outcome in
      Obstetrics, Psychiatry, Gastroenterology, and Medical Oncology. In Obstetrics, centering
      pre-natal care with group counseling sessions has shown to be an effective model for
      improving perinatal outcomes and patient satisfaction. Pregnancy, not unlike cancer, is a
      medical condition that rapidly change's one life, is marred by anxiety, nervousness and
      innumerable potential symptoms. The rationale behind centering care is that providers can
      spend more time counseling and educating a larger audience at once, and it allows the whole
      group to benefit from individual questions, concerns, and complaints. Additionally, it
      establishes a network for patients to connect with other women going through similar
      stressors.

      Prior to initiating this study, we conducted an Institutional Review Board exempt survey
      (STU00209351) of patients scheduled to undergo surgery with one of our Gynecologic
      Oncologists. Over 68% of patients expressed an interest in participating in a study to
      receive additional counseling. However, re-occurring themes that were mentioned were the time
      constraints and commuting issues in which patients experience in coming to our clinic in
      downtown Chicago. Given this feedback and the strong interest that our patient population has
      for this type of intervention, we have modified the traditional in-person centering model to
      an internet base, video conference group counseling session.

    <measure>Changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety survey scores</measure>
    <time_frame>It will take no more than 8 weeks to complete all survey related activities.</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Anxiety survey is a validated survey tool used to measure the severity of patient reported anxiety. Responses from the survey are converted to a T-score (scale: minimum score = 37.1, maximum score = 83.1) which have been standardized to the US general population with a mean 50 and standard deviation of 10. A score of less than 50 correlates to &quot;normal&quot; levels of anxiety, where as a score of 50-60 represents mild anxiety, 60-70 represents moderate anxiety, and &gt;70 represents severe anxiety. PROMIS Anxiety scores will be evaluated at time of enrollment, after receiving the intervention, and four (4) weeks after surgery to evaluate for changes in anxiety scores.</description>

    <description>Enrolled patients will participate in a group pre-operative counseling session on the online conferencing platform BlueJeansÂ® prior to their surgery. The sessions will not replace any portion of the pre-operative standard counseling and is designed to review and re-enforce the counseling already provided. The sessions will not review or discuss the specifics of any one individual's cancer or surgery. Rather the counseling session will focus on the universal instructions provided to all patients undergoing major surgery for a known or suspected gynecologic malignancy. The sessions will be led by a physician on a weekly basis with a minimal of three (3) enrolled patients per session and last approximately one (1) hour.</description>
