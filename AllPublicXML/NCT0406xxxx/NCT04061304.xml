  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to test the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) in treating individuals with Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa. The main objective
      of this study is to determine the short and long-term efficacy of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in reducing eating disorder symptoms (i.e. binging, purging,
      restricting, intense fear of gaining wait, etc;) in Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa.

      The investigators will also be comparing the brain activity patterns of individuals with
      Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa to healthy controls using electroencephalography (EEG).
      Further, the investigators would like to examine if the activation patterns in these patients
      change after receiving rTMS.

    <description>Outcome measured by change of binge/purge episodes from baseline to the end of treatment. If the participant has a final score of 0 binges and 0 purges they will be considered in remission. A 50% improvement will be defined as a response to the rTMS.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm will receive 40 sessions of active rTMS. Every day, the first session of rTMS for both groups will be applied to the left DLPFC using intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS).
For the second session each day the patients in the anorexia group will receive low-frequency treatment (1 Hz, 60 second cycles, 30 second inter-train interval, 20 trains, 1200 total pulses) at 120% of the resting motor threshold to the orbitofrontal cortex</description>
