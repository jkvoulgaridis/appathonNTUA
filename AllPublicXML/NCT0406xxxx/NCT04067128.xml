  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tested a low-resource, brief telephonic health coaching intervention to improve
      adherence to positive airway pressure therapy for treatment of sleep apnea.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We conducted post hoc analysis of a quality improvement initiative in which patients were
      randomly assigned to receive health coaching or usual care. Participants were English- and
      Spanish-speaking patients from a county-based public health system who had previously
      received a positive airway pressure device for the treatment of sleep apnea. An unlicensed,
      trained health coach called patients three times to resolve barriers to adherence. Adherence
      measures collected by device modem at baseline and 4 weeks were the primary outcome measures.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were randomly assigned to receive health coaching or usual care. For the health coaching arm, an unlicensed, trained health coach called patients three times to identify and resolve barriers to adherence, including lack of understanding of their condition or the treatment, discomfort in acclimating to treatment, technical difficulties in mask fit or device settings, and challenges in navigating durable medical equipment providers. Patients assigned to usual care had access to all other available resources, including technical support from durable medical equipment providers, respiratory therapist visits with the Sleep Clinic, group visits, or visits with their primary care provider.</intervention_model_description>
