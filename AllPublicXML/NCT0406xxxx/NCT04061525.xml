  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of the &quot;ischemic cascade&quot; is generally accepted hypothesis, according to which
      whenever ischemia of the myocardium occurs there is a consequence of events, that always
      occur in a given order - diastolic dysfunction first, followed by systolic dysfunction, then
      changes on electrocardiogram (ECG) and finally chest pain sensation. The occurrence of every
      next stage of cascade means more severe ischemia and respectively - more severe myocardial
      damage. We propose that mechanical and electrical changes in the myocardium during ischemia
      appear simultaneously.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of an ischemic event, whether silent or painful, represents the cumulative
      impact of a sequence of pathophysiologic events. Each ischemic episode is initiated by an
      imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand that may ultimately be manifested as
      angina pectoris. The ischaemic cascade is the concept that progressive myocardial oxygen
      supply-demand mismatch causes a consistent sequence of events, starting with metabolic
      alterations and followed sequentially by myocardial perfusion abnormalities, wall motion
      abnormalities, ECG changes, and angina. This concept would suggest that investigations that
      detect expressions of ischaemia earlier in the cascade should be more sensitive tests of
      ischaemia than those that detect expressions appearing later in the cascade.Visualization of
      a regional decrease in the systolic movement of the endocardium and a decrease in myocardial
      thickening are the main principles for the diagnosis of myocardial damage. However, the
      concept of ischaemic cascade is entirely based on clinical observations. It is not clear,
      which changes (mechanical or electrical) appear first during an episode of ischemia and which
      are prognostically more important. The objective of this study is to compare ischemic cascade
      towards ischemic constellation regarding beginning, duration and sequence of the electric,
      kinetic and haemodynamic signs of ischemia by FFR, icECG and wall motion abnormalities sign
      (M-sign - deformation and shortening of the wire tip) in patients with coronary bifurcation
      stenosis
