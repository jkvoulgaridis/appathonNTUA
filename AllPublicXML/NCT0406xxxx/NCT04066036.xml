  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study enrolling participants in South Africa and
      Uganda who are prescribed an HIV treatment regimen containing lamivudine, tenofovir, and
      dolutegravir, which is known as TLD. We hope to better understand how effective TLD will be
      in sub-Saharan Africa. If treatment failure occurs, we seek to understand the possible
      reasons, including drug resistance and adherence challenges.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational cohort study at three government-supported HIV
      clinics in rural South Africa and Uganda. We will enroll 1,000 adults living with HIV who are
      switched from first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) to TLD. We will follow participants for one year with study
      visits at enrollment, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks. Study procedures include interviews, body
      measurements, chart review, and collection of blood and urine specimens for retrospective
      testing, including viral load, drug resistance testing, antiretroviral drug level testing,
      and tests to evaluate the effects of TLD on renal, liver, metabolic, and other organ
      function.

      Aim 1: To determine the contributions of resistance prior to switch to TLD from a NNRTI-based
      regimen to risk of treatment failure after six and twelve months on TLD. Hypothesis: People
      living with HIV who experience virologic failure on TLD will have increased odds of NRTI
      mutations prior to TLD exposure, compared to controls with virologic suppression.

      Aim 2: Explore pharmacologic measures of adherence to distinguish virologic failure on TLD
      due to suboptimal adherence versus resistance using 2a) urine tenofovir (TFV) levels and 2b)
      tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in dried blood spots (DBS). Hypothesis: Absence of TFV in
      urine and TFV-DP concentrations in DBS will distinguish ART failure with versus without
      resistance.

        This study will enroll a total of 1,000 individuals from Uganda and South Africa, who are
        currently enrolled in care at one of the study clinics who have been taking NNRTI-based ART
        for a minimum of six months, and who are switching to TLD. 500 participants will be
        recruited from Uganda, and 500 will be recruited from South Africa.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥18 years

          -  HIV-positive and in care at one of the study clinics

          -  Current use of NNRTI-based, first-line ART for a minimum of 6 months

          -  Prescribed change to TLD by clinic staff

          -  Residing within 100 kilometers of the treatment clinic without plans to change
             permanent residence in the next 48 weeks

          -  Consents to participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

        There are no specific exclusion criteria. Both men and women will be theoretically
        eligible. We note that decision to use TLD in patients at the recruitment clinic will be
        made by clinic staff, and referral for study procedures will not be made until after this
        decision is made. We also note that, as of the time of this protocol draft, TLD use might
        be limited to men, women of non-child bearing ages, and women confirmed to be on
        contraception. This study will follow both national guidelines and clinician discretion
        about use of TLD in the clinic population.
