  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective randomised study was to shed more light on the issue by comparing
      the capacity of long plaster casts (above-elbow, LC) and short plaster casts (below-elbow,
      SC) to maintain the reduction of extra-articular distal radius fractures with dorsal
      displacement (2R3A2.2, according to the AO/OTA classification). The initial hypothesis was
      that the short cast would be equally as effective as the long cast in treating this type of
      fracture. The secondary objective of the study was to determine whether or not there is a
      direct correlation between radiological parameters and functional outcomes in such patients.

      Distal radial fractures are common traumatic injuries, but their management remains
      controversial, Hence, we conducted a two-arm, parallel-group, prospective randomised trial to
      compare the capacity of long casts (above-elbow) and short casts (below-elbow) to maintain
      the reduction of extra-articular distal radius fractures with dorsal displacement (AO/OTA
      classification: 2R3A2.2). Eligible patients with AO/OTA 2R3A2.2 fractures treated with closed
      reduction and cast immobilization were randomized to the long cast group or to the short cast
      group. Baseline radiological parameters, radial inclination (RI), radial height (RH), ulnar
      variance (UV) and palmar tilt (PT) were taken, and compared with clinical (DASH, Mayo Wrist
      and Mayo Elbow) and radiological scores taken at 7-10 days, 4 weeks and 12 weeks.
      Furthermore, to evaluate correlations between radiological parameters and functional
      outcomes, patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not their
      radiological parameters at Follow-ups 2 and 3 were acceptable, i.e. within the range 11-12 mm
      for RH, 16°-28° for IR, -4-+2 mm for UV, and 0°-22° for PT.
