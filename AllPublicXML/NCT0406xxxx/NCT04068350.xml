      Chronic pain, defined as continuous or intermittent pain for 3 months or more, postoperative
      because in the territory of the surgical procedure and does not exist before the operation,
      is common in adults. Its prevalence varies according to the surgeries between 10 and 50% of
      the operated adults. The factors potentially responsible for their occurrence are gradually
      being highlighted in the recent literature, which has made it possible to develop an
      appropriate analgesic management strategy.

      In pediatric surgery, acute pain has long been known and treated as early as possible using
      multimodal analgesic techniques. On the other hand, there are very few studies evaluating
      postoperative chronic pain 3 months after infant surgery, as was the case a few years ago in
      adults.

      This study aims to estimate prevalence and determine risk factors for chronic pain at 3
      months post-operative in pediatric surgery.
