    <textblock>
      this is a prospective, double-blinded and single-center study. this study is based on the
      Stroke volume variation fluid guided therapy, to compare the effects of norepinephrine and
      phenylephrine in treating perioperative hypotension, and to find the safest and most
      effective vasopressor for elderly.

    <description>Blood pressure is generally maintained at value not less than 80% of baseline during intraoperative period. If the blood pressure is within normal range and SVV is less than 9, patient will be given a continuous infusion of crystalloid solution. However, when blood pressure drops and SVV is greater than 13, a bolus of 200mL colloid will then be quickly administered. If the blood pressure doesn't recover back to normal range within 5 minutes after bolus, norepinephrine will be given through the central venous catheter. If SVV is between 9 and 13, a bolus of crystalloid at 8mL/kg/h will be administered</description>
