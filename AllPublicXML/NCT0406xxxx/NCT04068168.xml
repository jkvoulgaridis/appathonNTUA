      Primary objective : To assess safety of Imfinzi for patients with NSCLC or SCLC treated with
      Imfinzi under the approved indication in Korea

      Outcome Measure:

        -  Safety (adverse event (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), adverse drug reaction (ADR),
           serious adverse drug reaction (SADR), adverse events of special interest (AESI), adverse
           events leading to discontinuation (DAE), and adverse events leading to deaths (fatal
           AE))

        -  Dose interruptions

        -  Duration of treatment

        -  Reason for treatment discontinuation Secondary objective: To assess efficacy of Imfinzi
           for patients with NSCLC or SCLC treated with Imfinzi under the approved indication in
           Korea

      Outcome Measure:

        -  Progression free survival (PFS)

        -  Objective response rate (ORR)

        -  Duration of response (DoR)
