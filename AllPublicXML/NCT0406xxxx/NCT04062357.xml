  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to appraise effectiveness and tolerability of lidocaine 5% spray in
      treatment of patients with premature ejaculation (PE). The current study has been designed as
      a randomized single-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. It was done on 150 lifelong PE
      patients with normal erection. They were randomized evenly categorized into two treatment
      groups. Group 1 (n₌75); was given on demand lidocaine 5% spray for 8 weeks. Group 2 (n₌75);
      was given placebo in form on demand alcohol spray for 8 weeks.

      was given placebo in form on demand alcohol spray for 8 weeks. All medications were applied
      on the glans penis for 10-20 minutes and then cleaned before planed sexual intercourse.
      Patients were evaluated with Arabic Index of Premature Ejaculation (AIPE) scores,
      intravaginal ejaculatory latency times (IELTs), and frequency of sexual intercourse before
      and after treatments.
