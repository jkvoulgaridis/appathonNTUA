    <description>The study will be reporting the final Oxford Hip score, which is a summary over 12 items. Each of these items is 5-level Likert scale such as from 'not at all' to 'totally'.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-3L data will be summarized over 5 domains, namely, mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each domain has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has undergone a revision for nonunion and/or hardware removal (i.e. all conditions
             resulting in poor quality proximal bone).

          2. Subject is implanted with the PROFEMUR® Z Revision Femoral Stem at the time of their
             revision THA.

          3. Subject is willing and able to complete required study visits or assessments.

          4. Plans to be available through the 10 year postoperative follow‐up visit.

        Previously implanted bilateral subjects can have both THAs enrolled in the study provided:

          1. the PROFEMUR Z Revision Femoral Stem was implanted in both,

          2. all other aspects of the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria are satisfied,

          3. enrollment does not exceed the subject count specified in the Clinical Trial
             Agreement, and

          4. the subject agrees to a second Informed Consent document specific to the second THA.
             Prospective enrollment of a previously unimplanted hip is not permitted in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects currently enrolled in another clinical study which could affect the endpoints
             of this protocol.

          2. Subject has a PROFEMUR Neck Varus/Valgus CoCr 8 Degree, Part number PHAC 1254
             implanted in the enrolled THA.

          3. Has or had an overt infection at the time of implantation.

          4. Has or had a distant foci of infections (which may cause hematogenous spread to the
             implant site) at the time of implantation.

          5. Has or had a rapid disease progression as manifested by joint destruction or bone
             absorption apparent on roentgenogram at the time of implantation.

          6. Has or had inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, fusion, and/or
             inadequate abductor strength), poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around the joint
             which would make the procedure unjustifiable.

          7. Subjects unwilling to sign the Informed Consent document.

          8. Subjects with substance abuse issues.

          9. Subjects with an emotional or neurological condition that would pre‐empt their ability
             or willingness to participate in the study.

         10. Subjects who are incarcerated or have pending incarceration.
