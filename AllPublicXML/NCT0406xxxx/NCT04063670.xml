  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of expanded
      patient education and coping skills on pain management following multilevel pediatric spinal
      surgery. The intervention will include a smartphone- based platform and a comprehensive
      library of peri-operative educational and coping skills videos as a means for better
      addressing the psychosocial elements of a child's individual pain experience. The study
      evaluated whether this novel intervention will reduce pain, improve outcomes and accelerate
      functional recovery up to 6 weeks after surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Operative Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome #1 will evaluate the intervention's impact on post-operative pain via completion of the computer-adaptive NIH PROMIS measures on pain intensity and pain behavior.
For each of the PROMIS measures, a score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10. All scores are converted to T-scores. The T-score and standard error are automatically reported after completion of the computer-adaptive test. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. As each patient will have a pre-operative baseline score, the difference between pre- and post-operative scores will be utilized for all further analysis, with a difference of 10 points (1-standard deviation) scored as the minimal clinically significant difference.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Operative Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome #2 will evaluate the intervention's impact on a proxy for post-operative pain via completion of a 1-question survey on recent opioid consumption. The question is formatted as a 5-point Likert scale, scored 1-5, with higher scores indicating more frequent opioid consumption.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes - Global Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome #3 will measure patient reported outcomes via administration of the computer adaptive NIH PROMIS measures for global health.
For each of the PROMIS measures, a score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10. All scores for this measure will be converted to T-scores via the NIH's published guidelines. As each patient will have a pre-operative baseline score, the difference between pre- and post-operative scores will be utilized for all further analysis, with a difference of 10 points (1-standard deviation) scored as the minimal clinically significant difference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes - Mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome #4 will measure patient reported outcomes and functional status via completion of the computer-adaptive NIH PROMIS measure for mobility
For each of the PROMIS measures, a score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10. All scores are converted to T-scores. The T-score and standard error are automatically reported after completion of the computer-adaptive test. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. As each patient will have a pre-operative baseline score, the difference between pre- and post-operative scores will be utilized for all further analysis, with a difference of 10 points (1-standard deviation) scored as the minimal clinically significant difference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes - Positive Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome #5 will measure patient reported outcomes via completion of the computer-adaptive NIH PROMIS measure for positive affect.
For each of the PROMIS measures, a score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10. All scores are converted to T-scores. The T-score and standard error are automatically reported after completion of the computer-adaptive test. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. As each patient will have a pre-operative baseline score, the difference between pre- and post-operative scores will be utilized for all further analysis, with a difference of 10 points (1-standard deviation) scored as the minimal clinically significant difference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes - Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome #6 will measure patient reported outcomes and functional status via completion of the computer-adaptive NIH PROMIS measure for physical activity.
For each of the PROMIS measures, a score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10. All scores are converted to T-scores. The T-score and standard error are automatically reported after completion of the computer-adaptive test. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. As each patient will have a pre-operative baseline score, the difference between pre- and post-operative scores will be utilized for all further analysis, with a difference of 10 points (1-standard deviation) scored as the minimal clinically significant difference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes - Strength Impact</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome #7 will measure patient reported outcomes and functional status via completion of the computer-adaptive NIH PROMIS measure for strength impact.
For each of the PROMIS measures, a score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10. All scores are converted to T-scores. The T-score and standard error are automatically reported after completion of the computer-adaptive test. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. As each patient will have a pre-operative baseline score, the difference between pre- and post-operative scores will be utilized for all further analysis, with a difference of 10 points (1-standard deviation) scored as the minimal clinically significant difference.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain-Related Disability and Post-Operative Functional Status.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome #8 will measure post-operative functional status via a 5-question survey on the following activities: sleeping through the night without awaking for pain medication, walking outside the house, showering and dressing independently, patient return to school and parent return to work. Each of these questions was selected as a proxy for improved functional status. Each question is answered 'Yes' or 'No&quot;, and graded '1' or '0', respectively. A higher score represents improved functional status. Each of these questionnaires will be administered on a weekly basis.</description>
