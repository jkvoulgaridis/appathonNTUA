  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to explore the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of BIIB104
      on brain circuitry associated with emotional processing in healthy participants.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB104
      in healthy participants; To further explore the PD effects of BIIB104 on brain circuitry
      associated with emotional processing in healthy participants; To explore the PD effects of
      BIIB104 on brain circuitry associated with working memory in healthy participants using the
      N-Back; To explore the PD effects of BIIB104 on regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in healthy
      participants; To explore the PD effects of BIIB104 on brain circuitry during resting state in
      healthy participants.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event), however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>
