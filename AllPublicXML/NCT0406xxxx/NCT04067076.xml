  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to make a massive suicide risk and social behavior assessment
      in 24 pre-graduate education centers in Mexico City (approximately 30,000 students aged
      between 15 and 22 years), taking also into account other outcomes such as depression,
      anxiety, alcohol and drugs. For this, an app for Smartphone (MeMind) or a web platform
      (www.MeMind.net) will be used in which the participants will take a self-administered
      questionnaire, composed of several psychometric instruments.

      Our main hypothesis is that identification of suicide risk in the Mexico City's student
      community is feasible using their own smartphones and can serve as both a population
      screening tool for early specialist referral, as well as a tool for evaluating social
      behavior strategies and their relation to suicide behavior.

    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is encompassed into MeMind for this purpose.
In C-SSRS, four constructs are measured. The first is the severity of ideation, which is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale from 1=&quot;wish to be dead&quot; to 5=&quot;suicidal intent with plan&quot;.
The second is the intensity of ideation, which comprises 5 items, each rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason for ideation.
The third is the behavior, which is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior.
And the fourth is the lethality, which assesses actual attempts; actual lethality is rated on a 6-point ordinal scale.
Results are coded in the instrument itself with colored labels that indicates definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior, quantify both of them and gauge their severity.
Definitions are available elsewhere (http://cssrs.columbia.edu).</description>
