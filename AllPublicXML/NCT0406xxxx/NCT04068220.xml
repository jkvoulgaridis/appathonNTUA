    <textblock>
      Skull base surgeries performed in areas involving the visual pathway are associated with
      varying levels of postoperative visual dysfunction. The goal of intraoperative FVEP
      monitoring is to detect and prevent intraoperative visual pathway injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skull base surgeries performed in areas involving the visual pathway are associated with
      varying levels of postoperative visual dysfunction. For instance, surgical resection of
      suprasellar meningiomas has been shown to worsen visual function in 14 - 28% of patients and
      surgical resection of craniopharyngiomas worsen visual function in 3 - 11.5% of patients.
      Manipulation of the optic nerve and interference with the microvasculature during surgical
      dissection is thought to be responsible for the visual loss.

      Through intraoperative monitoring and prompt identification of flash visual evoked potentials
      (FVEPs) deterioration, corrective surgical measures could be undertaken to improve or
      stabilize postoperative visual dysfunction. Furthermore, intraoperative FVEPs monitoring may
      influence surgical decision-making thus contributing to predict and prevent postoperative
      visual dysfunction as well as allowing more total resection of a tumour when the monitoring
      is stable.

      This study's aim is to determine if intraoperative continuous FVEPs monitoring can predict
      and prevent or minimize possible visual pathway injury that may appear during minimally
      invasive endoscopic skull base surgery.

    <description>This pilot study will evaluate the number of enrolled patients with stable and reliable FVEPs with ERGs, the number of enrolled patients with more than 50% decrease in intraoperative FVEPs N1-P1 amplitude (compared to baseline value) and the number of patients with permanent postoperative visual deficit. In addition, we will use demographic data for descriptive analysis, and obtain preliminary data for power analysis and information on subject recruitment before starting the large clinical trial.</description>

    <description>During the surgery, a pair of goggles (similar to the swimming goggles) will be placed on patient's closed eyes. The goggles equipped with red LEDs will apply no pressure or minimal pressure on patient's closed eyes. Patient's left eye then right eye will be stimulated with flashing red light emitted by the goggles. Two subdermal needle electrodes will be placed under the skin behind patient's ears, and one subdermal needle electrode will be placed under the skin above the bridge of patient's nose. The two electrodes placed behind patient's ears, will record intraoperative flash visual evoked potentials (FVEPs) resulted from red light stimulation of patient's visual pathway through the eyes and the electrode above the bridge of the nose will record, at the same time, the activity of each eye's retina.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult population (18 years and older), admitted to The Ottawa Hospital (TOH)-Civic
             Campus for a chiasmal or pre-chiasmal lesion, undergoing first time minimally invasive
             endoscopic skull base surgery

          -  Patient able to personally sign and date the informed consent document

          -  Patients will be selected based on the surgeon's determination that:

               1. The visual system will be at risk of iatrogenic injury

               2. The intraoperative FVEPs monitoring could rapidly detect this injury AND

               3. Corrective measures could be taken during surgery to reverse it.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients having a pre-existent retinal disease, cardiac pacemaker

          -  contraindication for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA)

          -  unable to complete required pre and post-operative visual assessment or unable to
             complete their post-operative follow-up visits at TOH-Civic Campus

          -  anticipated goggle movement related to reflection of the frontal skin flap

          -  preoperative visual deficits (e.g., profound deficits in visual acuity or dense visual
             field loss)
