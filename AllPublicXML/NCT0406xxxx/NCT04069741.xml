  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a Decision Aid to help patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis decide
      how to treat their condition.

      For patients with symptoms of depression, half the participants will receive a psychological
      intervention (Toolkit) to improve depression and pain from de Quervain's tenosynovitis.

      The investigators hypothesize that both the Decision Aid and the Toolkit will be feasible,
      and that the Toolkit will improve pain and function compared to usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research to see if they can improve the management of
      patients with de Quervain's tendinopathy. In the first part of this study, a Decision Aid
      (DA) has been developed to help participants make choices about their treatment.

      Decision aids are designed to provide patients with balanced, complete, and understandable
      information about their options for management of their condition, as well as risks and
      benefits, in order to help them determine their preferences according to their values.
      Research has shown that patients felt more knowledgeable and better informed with a more
      active role in decision making after using DAs.

      Additionally, research has shown that depression affects pain and disability experienced by
      patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis. In the second part of our study, the investigators
      want to see whether a web based skills intervention (Toolkit) is more effective than usual
      medical care in improving pain and disability in patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis
      and symptoms of depression.

      The Toolkit is delivered online and can be accessed at home. Similar skills interventions in
      patients with musculoskeletal injury have been shown to improve pain and function.

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire 9</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is used for screening and measuring the severity of depression. The scale ranges from 0 to 27 overall. A score between the range of 5-9 indicates minimal symptoms of depression. A score between 10-14 suggests minimal depression or mild, major depression. A range of 15-19 indicates moderately severe, major depression, and a score of greater than 20 suggests severe, major depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the individual's level of catastrophic thinking related to pain. They are asked about the thoughts and feelings they have when experiencing pain. The responses range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The total score ranges from O-52. There are three subscale scores that assess rumination, magnification, and helplessness. The helplessness score ranges from 0 (not helpless) to 24 (severe helplessness). The rumination score ranges from 0 (don't think about the pain) to 16 (constantly think about how much it hurts). The magnification score ranges from 0 (does not feel like the pain is or will be more serious) to 12 (thinks the pain will get more serious).</description>
