  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain injuries are a significant cause of loss of movement. It has been shown that physical
      therapy can help patients to regain movements. The purpose of this study is to see if it is
      possible to perform a new exercise program that will help patients regain movement. This new
      exercise program will involve practicing walking, stairs, jumping and running. Participation
      in this study will involve physical therapy 1 to 2 times a week for 12 visits over 6 to 8
      weeks.

    <description>The program will consist of interventions at the impairments level with an emphasis on core strengthening, functional lower extremity strengthening, balance and endurance training, and at the skill acquisition level. Participants will learn pre-running skills (walking, stairs with handrail, walking backward, walking over obstacles, walking on toes, stairs without handrail, bounding), running skills (force generation in vertical plane: hopping, alternate hopping, running in place in gravity minimized position and against gravity; force generation in horizontal plane: bounding, alternate bounding, open chain movement for swing phase, running) and post running skills (running forward, backward, sideways, skipping, hopping).</description>
