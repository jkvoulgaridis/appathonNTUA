  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a greater effect to patients with
      advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by using a combination of two drugs,
      Treprostinil and Riociquat versus Treprostinil alone

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combined effect of parenteral treprostinil (TRE)
      and riociguat (RIO) versus parenteral TRE alone on right ventricular (RV)-pulmonary artery
      (PA) interaction (RVPA coupling) and global RV function in patients with advanced pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH).

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will receive Treprostinil 2-3 times per day as tolerated.
Subsequently, participants will receive Riociguat at 0.5 mg taken orally three times a day.
Participants will receive the first dose inpatient prior to discharge.
Participants will continue on a 2 ng/kg/min increase every other day for one week.
Riociguat will subsequently be increased by 0.5 mg taken orally three times a day the following week as tolerated.
Increases in Treprostinil and Riociguat will then alternate weeks such that only one medication is changed per week.</intervention_model_description>
