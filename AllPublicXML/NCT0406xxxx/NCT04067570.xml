  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical prostatectomy is a common treatment for localized prostate cancer. More than 30% of
      men who undergo surgery will subsequently develop recurrence, particularly in patients with
      adverse features where the risk may be even higher. Recurrence typically manifests as a rise
      in serum-level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), referred to as biochemical recurrence.
      Post-operative radiotherapy is a potentially curative option for many patients, as shown in
      multiple prior randomized studies. A standard course of post-operative radiation requires 6
      to 6 and half weeks of treatment, 5 days a week; however, new high-precision radiation
      techniques with image guidance, termed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), can deliver an
      equivalent or higher dose of treatment in 5 visits. Our group, amongst others, have
      demonstrated in previous studies, that the new 5-treatment technique was safe, convenient and
      effective in patients with intact prostates. Currently, limited data exists on this approach
      after prostatectomy. This study will be one of the first to assess the side effect profile
      and efficacy of SBRT in patients with localized prostate cancer who are considered candidates
      for post-prostatectomy radiation.
