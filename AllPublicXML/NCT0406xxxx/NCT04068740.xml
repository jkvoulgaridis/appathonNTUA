  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Valvular Heart Disease currently affects 2.5% of the population, but is overwhelmingly a
      disease of the elderly and consequently on the rise. It is dominated by two conditions,
      Aortic Stenosis and Mitral Regurgitation, both of which are associated with significant
      morbidity and mortality, yet which pose a truly demanding challenge for treatment
      optimisation. By combining multiple complex modelling components, a comprehensive,
      clinically-compliant decision-support system will be developed to meet this challenge, by
      quantifying individualised disease severity and patient impairment, predicting disease
      progression, ranking the effectiveness of alternative candidate procedures, and optimising
      the patient-specific intervention plan.

      In addition the DSS will improve knowledge of disease mechanisms by applying a holistic
      assessment of cardiovascular function that includes hemodynamic data at all cardiovascular
      compartments (ventricle, valve, vessels) and multiscale components that couple organ with
      cell function.

      DSS may have major impact on patients with borderline indications for treatment (valve
      replacement/repair), complex hemodynamic conditions such as combined aortic-mitral valve
      disease and valve geometries that are subject to valve repair.

      The target user of this Decision Support System is the healthcare professional, in this case
      the surgeon or cardiologist, who will make the decision on the nature and timing of the
      intervention. The major advance of this system over current practice is that it integrates
      and interprets all heterogeneous data available about the patient, integrates population data
      where needed, and provides a consistent, repeatable, quantitative and auditable record of the
      information that contributes to the decision process.

      Study design:

      In the study a Decision Support System for aortic and mitral valve replacement/repair will be
      implemented and tested. Not all of the assessments listed will be performed on every patient,
      but sufficient to support the analysis processes.

      The patients are enrolled in two subgroups:

        -  Group 1: patients with aortic valve disease

        -  Group 2: patients with mitral valve disease

      The study has the following visits at all clinical centers:

        1. Visit 1: Patients will be investigated before valve intervention by imaging (MRI,
           Echocardiography, CT), ECG, laboratory tests, anthropometrics (blood pressure, body
           weight, clinical status). A subset of patients will wear a fitness tracker for at least
           one day and perform a 6-minute walk test.

        2. Operation (valve replacement/repair): All patients will be treated according to current
           clinical guidelines.

        3. Virtual treatment: Patients will receive a virtual treatment

        4. Visit 2: After treatment patients will be followed-up undergoing the study protocol
           again. This allows comparing the modeled (predicted) against measured outcome data.
