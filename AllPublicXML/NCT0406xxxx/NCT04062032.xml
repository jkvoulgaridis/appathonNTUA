  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase II pilot study assessing the metabolomic and inflammatory effects
      of oral aspirin (ASA) in human subjects at risk for melanoma.

    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives

      I. Open label trial in 60 patients to assess the capacity of either of one daily dose (81,
      325 mg) of sub-chronic ASA administration to increase the plasma and nevus ASA metabolites
      such as: salicylate, salicylurate, gentisic acid, and salicyl acyl glucuronide.

      II. Open label trial in 60 patients to assess the capacity of sub-chronic daily ASA (81, 325
      mg) administration to reduce levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in plasma and nevi.

      Secondary Objectives

      I. Determine whether ASA increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in nevi.

      II. Determine whether ASA affects whole blood leukocytes or leukocyte subsets in plasma.

      III. Determine whether ASA affects inflammatory cytokines in plasma.
