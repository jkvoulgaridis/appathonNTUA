  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are often offered walking aids and compensatory
      strategies rather than restorative rehabilitation. We have developed a cool room treadmill
      training method that uses body-weight support that people with MS fatigue and heat
      sensitivity can tolerate. Our previous research shows that people with advanced MS use three
      times more energy for essential tasks such as walking. This project will test whether 10
      weeks of body-weight supported treadmill training in a room cooled to 16°C improves walking,
      fitness and fatigue in people with advanced MS.

    <description>A total of 30 training sessions will be conducted in 10 weeks for 30 minutes per session and 3 times per week in a cool room (16⁰ C) on a treadmill that is equipped with safety straps to prevent falls. A pneumatic harness system will be used to provide 10% body-weight support during training sessions. The participants will start exercising on the treadmill at 80% of their self-selected walking speed with 1% incline and will increase as per their tolerance (will progress weekly based on 40-65% heart rate reserve). Heart rate, perceived fatigue and rating of perceived exertion will be monitored continuously during exercise sessions. Initial training will commence with intermittent rest periods [1 to 5 minutes] as requested by the participants and will be progressed to a maximum of 30-minute continuous treadmill walking.</description>
