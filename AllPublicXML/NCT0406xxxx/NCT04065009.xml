      Surgery presents opportunities not only for eradicating tumours but, paradoxically, also for
      proliferation and invasion of residual cancer cells. It increases the shedding of malignant
      cells into the blood and lymphatic circulations, inhibits their apoptosis and potentiates
      their invasion capacity. Additionally, the immune system, the inflammatory system and the
      neuroendocrine system react to surgery with important changes, which have been proven to
      promote progression of cancer. Several anaesthesia-related factors play an important role in
      perioperative tumorigenesis such as inhalational anaesthetics, opiate analgesics, local
      anaesthetics and regional anaesthesia, all of which may impact short-term morbidity and
      long-term mortality. A recent retrospective study in patients undergoing cancer surgery found
      a 10% decrease in mortality in patients receiving propofol compared to inhalational
      anaesthesia.

      In Sweden, a total of 694 new cases of ovarian and fallopian tube cancers were reported in
      2012. During the period 2005-2009, the relative 1-year survival for all ovarian cancers was
      81.8% but 5-year survival was only 44%. Specifically, patients with late-stage ovarian cancer
      continue to have a poor outcome despite major advances in surgery and chemotherapy over the
      last 20 years. Can the choice of anaesthesia and analgesia provide a microenvironment for
      tumour metastases during the vulnerable perioperative period? In the upcoming epidemiological
      study, we aim to assess risk factors for negative outcome, specifically the role of fluid
      management on postoperative morbidity. In a large, prospective, randomised, multi-centre
      study, we plan to further assess if intraperitoneal local anaesthetics administered
      perioperatively during 72 h leads to early start of chemotherapy compared to placebo in
      patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for stage III-IV ovarian cancer, and if early
      chemotherapy improves long-term survival (3 and 5 years).

      Introduction:

      Ovarian cancer accounts for 2.5 percent of cancers in women. In Sweden, a total of 694 new
      cases of ovarian and fallopian tube cancers were reported in 2012. During the period
      2005-2009, the relative 1-year survival for all ovarian cancers was 81.8% but 5-year survival
      was only 44% (1). The low survival can be due to the aggressiveness of epithelial ovarian
      cancer and because it is often diagnosed late. Today, patients with widespread malignant
      intra-abdominal ovarian cancers (Stage III-IV) are operated by cyto-reductive surgery (CRS)
      followed by early chemotherapy, which has been shown to improve patient survival (2).
      However, CRS is often accompanied by a severe inflammatory and immuno-compromised
      perioperative course associated with early morbidity, delayed rehabilitation and, sometimes,
      prolonged start of chemotherapy. Early start of chemotherapy has been a major factor in
      improving long-term outcomes (3), and therefore perioperative factors such as choice of
      anaesthesia and analgesia and fluid replacement may be important. Tumorigenesis and the
      perioperative environment: Surgery, perioperative stress and anaesthesia may all modulate the
      immuno-surveillance mechanisms and compromise host defences that normally maintain a balance
      between immunity &amp; tumorigenesis (4,5). There is increasing evidence that surgery itself may
      promote the recurrence and metastases of cancer, which depends largely on the tumour's
      ability to metastasise, combined with the host immunity and inflammatory response (6).
      Natural killer (NK) cells act as a primary defence against perioperative cancer metastases
      (6). Negative effects of anaesthetics and analgesics on NK-cell activity may promote
      pro-inflammatory effects and may also activate cancer cell survival pathways. Additionally,
      concentrations of tumour-related anti-angiogenic factors are decreased while angiogenic
      factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are increased (7). Hypoxia inducing
      factor (HIF-1) is a transcriptional factor that has also been shown to play an important role
      for tumour survival (8). Hypoxia in solid tumours leads to activation of HIF-1, which in turn
      increases cancer cell survival (9). Similarly, hyperoxia may, paradoxically, lead to
      activation of HIF-1 and potentially worsen long-term survival. Inhalational anaesthetics but
      not propofol have been shown to affect VEGF as well as transforming growth factor-beta
      (TGF-β) in patients undergoing breast surgery that may affect long-term survival (7). VEGF
      and TGF-β play a significant role in establishing tumour blood supply and cell proliferation.
      Other factors such as surgical stress, blood transfusions, hypothermia, hyperglycaemia, and
      postoperative pain may also affect immunity and the tumour microenvironment. Even after
      complete excision of the tumour, circulating tumour cells released during the surgical
      procedure may eventually lead to recurrence or metastases as they escape the immune
      surveillance (10). Role of anaesthetics and analgesics in cancer metastases: Preventing a
      major systemic inflammatory response and preserving immuno-surveillance in the perioperative
      period are fundamental in promoting improved postoperative outcome in cancer surgery. The
      severity of injury correlates with the magnitude of inflammation. In vitro studies have shown
      that amide local anaesthetics have cytotoxic activity, which could prove to be beneficial in
      preventing cancer recurrence (11). These potential cytotoxic effects of LA may effectively
      reduce postoperative morbidity and promote early start of chemotherapy (manuscript).
      Anaesthetic drugs, specifically inhalation anaesthetics, impair numerous immune functions,
      including those of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cell, and natural killer (NK)
      cells. Upregulation of hypoxia-inducible-factors (HIF) in tumour cells by volatile
      anaesthetics may contribute to a tumour's recurrence by stimulating cytoprotective or
      pro-tumorigenic behaviour in residual cells. However, propofol may not depress the immune
      function (12) and does not upregulate synthesis of HIF (13). Opioid analgesics inhibit both
      cellular and humoral immune function, increase angiogenesis, and promote breast tumour growth
      in rodents. Opioids interfere with immune function by depressing NK cell activity (14). The
      use of epidural anaesthesia and analgesia thus prevents the stress response to surgery,
      reduces the need for opiates and may prolong survival (15). Fluid dynamics and early
      recovery: Fluid optimization remains a challenge because of several factors: preoperative
      fluid shifts and accumulation of ascitic fluid, low preoperative albumin from malnutrition,
      as well as perioperative fluid and blood loss. Both hypo- and hypervolemia have been shown to
      have adverse effects and may delay recovery and start of chemotherapy and a large
      prospective, randomised study concluded that hypovolemia may even lead to renal insufficiency
      (16).

      The main objectives of the prospective, randomised, double-blind study is to assess:

        1. Time to start of chemotherapy postoperatively

        2. Overall survival at 3 and 5-years in patients undergoing CRS for ovarian cancer. We will
           also record postoperative complications as defined by the Clavien-Dindo classification
           (CDC) and postoperative morbidity score (POMS) during the hospital stay in patients
           randomised to intraperitoneal local anaesthetics or placebo during 72 h postoperatively.
           We will measure plasma levels of certain biomarkers such as VEGF, TGF-β and HIF1a, pre-
           and post-operatively to assess the effect of local anaesthetics. We will also assess
           patient-assessed quality of recovery and quality of life at fixed time points during the
           study.
