      Based on a new mass spectrometry system, body fluid samples were analyzed to verify the role
      of metabolite analysis in the diagnosis of pediatric medulloblastoma.

    <textblock>
      Screening specific molecular metabolic markers for medulloblastoma after radiotherapy can
      improve the prediction of clinical diagnosis and prognosis of patients.The purpose of this
      study is to validate the role of metabolite analysis in the diagnosis of pediatric
      medulloblastoma based on the analysis of body fluid samples by a new mass spectrometry
      system.Based on the metabolic markers found by screening, the pathogenic mechanism of
      metabolic pathway blockade was explained, and the scientific basis for later treatment was
      put forward.
