  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective observational study where participants will be recruited from the
      Ophthalmology department (Outpatient department, Eye Casualty). Only one research visit will
      be required. Participants will be asked to fill in a set of questionnaires (Visual
      Functioning Questionnaire-15(61), Low Luminance Questionnaire(62)) assessing their quality of
      life and vision and their full medical history will be collected. Then they will have their
      contrast sensitivity tested under various light conditions. If a recent visual field test is
      not available, that might be performed as part of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our, real world study is to explore contrast sensitivity differences after
      changes in ambient light setting in patients with glaucoma compared with controls (patients
      with ocular hypertension). Participants will be asked to read a Pelli- Robson chart under
      photopic (bright light conditions) and mesopic (intermediate light conditions); followed by
      scotopic conditions (dim light conditions). This chart is a fast, easy, and effective way to
      measure spatial contrast sensitivity with reliable and reproducible results(60). This study
      will therefore help clinicians gain more insight into glaucoma related disability and provide
      a possible additional tool to visual field testing in patients with advanced glaucoma where
      VF testing may be hampered by floor effects.
