  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is a commonly performed procedure but is known to cause
      significant postoperative pain. Effective analgesia after rotator cuff repair is crucial in
      improving the well-being of the patient but also to ensure long-term rehabilitation. The most
      commonly used analgesic for acute postoperative pain is opioids. However, the use of opioids
      is accompanied by several side effects which include but are not limited to nausea/vomiting,
      urinary retention, itching sensation and sometimes dizziness, respiratory depression and
      hypotension in higher doses. As of late, many efforts are aimed toward decreasing the use of
      opioids by using multimodal analgesia. Among such methods, intravenous lidocaine has been
      reported to be effective, safe and economic in various procedures. However, the existing
      evidence is mostly focused on laparoscopic procedures. The present study aims to find whether
      perioperative infusion of lidocaine is able to decrease opioid requirements after surgery and
      also improve postoperative pain compared to placebo in patients undergoing arthroscopic
      rotator cuff repair.
