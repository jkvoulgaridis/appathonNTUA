  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly an important tool for diagnosis and
      management of cardiac diseases in children.

      One of the uses of MRI is tissue characterisation, in which the signal characteristics of the
      cardiac muscle (myocardium) can be determined with special techniques, known as parametric
      mapping.

      There is increasing evidence that parametric mapping may be able to identify regions of
      scarring in the myocardium, or detection of oedema/inflammation in the setting. This in turn
      can help predict disease course and add value to the management of patients.

      There is also evidence that other structures that are visualised in parametric mapping aside
      from the heart (e.g. liver and spleen) can also help improve diagnostic accuracy and guide
      management.

      Currently the majority of studies describing the use of parametric mapping is focused on
      adults, with limited data on its use in children.

      The parametric mapping values can also differ amongst different machines, so calibration with
      normal subjects are also required.

      Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide tissue characterisation without radiation and
      need for invasive biopsy.

      Parametric mapping techniques (T1 mapping, extracellular volume fraction, T2 mapping, T2*
      mapping) are methods of quantitative analysis of tissue properties, and are currently
      commercially available.

      T1 mapping, extracellular volume fraction (ECV) and T2* mapping provides knowledge about the
      tissue properties of the myocardium, interstitium and adjacent structures,and can provide
      information for diagnosis of fibrosis, inflammatory and infiltrative diseases.

      T2 mapping is useful for assessing oedema, which may be useful in monitoring disease activity
      such as myocarditis.

      Parametric mapping has proven clinical utility in iron deposition, amyloid disease,
      Anderson-Fabry disease and myocarditis.

      In addition to assessment of cardiac muscle, tissue characterisation can also be performed in
      adjacent organs that are included in the field of view of parametric mapping (e.g. liver and
      spleen).

      Parametric mapping may provide important diagnostic information for decision making, patient
      monitoring and management planning.

      The investigators aim to

        1. recruit healthy volunteers as controls to establish normal local reference ranges for
           parametric mapping values

        2. recruit patients undergoing clinically indicated cardiac MRI to perform parametric
           mapping, and compare the parametric mapping values between normal controls and patients.
