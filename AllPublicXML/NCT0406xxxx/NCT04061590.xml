    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy works when
      given before surgery in treating patients with stage I-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.
      Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab, may induce changes in body?s immune system and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as cisplatin and pemetrexed, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy may shrink the cancer prior to
      surgery and decrease the likelihood of the cancer returning following surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based combination therapy on the
      composition, phenotype, and function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) in patients
      with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab alone and in
      combination with chemotherapy as measured by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0.

      II. To determine the clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab alone and in combination
      with chemotherapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the relationship between changes in TIICs and clinical efficacy in patients
      with early stage NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based combination therapy.

      II. To characterize changes in the frequency and number of circulating immune cells induced
      by neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based combination therapy in patients with early stage NSCLC.

      III. To determine the impact of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based combination therapy on the
      composition and phenotype of the tumor microenvironment (including tumor and stromal cells)
      in patients with NSCLC.

      III. To determine the change in T cell repertoire within the tumor and blood induced by
      neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based combination therapy in patients with early stage NSCLC.

      IV. To explore molecular profiles to identify potentially predictive biomarkers for patients
      with early stage NSCLC treated with immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery within 4 weeks following study
      treatment.

      COHORT B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes and chemotherapy
      (cisplatin/pemetrexed) IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery within
      4 weeks following study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.

          -  Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

               -  Note: No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority

          -  Has a known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (HCV) (defined as HCV ribonucleic acid

               -  Note: No testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by
                  local health authority

          -  Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB; Mycobacterium tuberculosis)

          -  Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of trial treatment. Patients
             must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted
             for palliative radiation (=&lt; 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous system
             (CNS) disease

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Gurin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed

          -  Has evidence of clinically significant interstitial lung disease

          -  Has an active second malignancy, i.e. patient known to have potentially fatal cancer
             present for which he/she may be (but not necessarily) currently receiving treatment.
             Patients with a history of malignancy that has been completely treated, with no
             evidence of that cancer currently, are permitted to enroll in the trial if curative
             therapy has been completed, such as basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ
             cervical cancer

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy (in
             dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient?s
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator, including
             dialysis

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of trial treatment

          -  Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant

        ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA For Arm B

          -  Has squamous cell carcinoma. Adenosquamous and adenocarcinoma with squamous features
             disease allowed

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt; 45 ml/min as calculated by institutional standard

          -  Is taking any herbal/complementary oral or IV medicine within 4 weeks of first dose of
