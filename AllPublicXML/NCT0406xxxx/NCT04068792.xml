  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this two-part designed study is to assess in the setting of a planned early
      interception of pediatric RSV disease, early viral and disease kinetics (observational stage)
      and the antiviral effects of an Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) fusion inhibitor,
      JNJ-53718678 (interventional stage). In the observational stage the infant is closely
      monitored for early symptoms by the parent(s)/caregiver(s) and thus may be brought in for
      diagnosis earlier than in the typical setting.
