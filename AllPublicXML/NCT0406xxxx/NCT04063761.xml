  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left atrial catheter ablation including pulmonary vein isolation is a standard therapy in the
      management of symptomatic atrial fibrillation; however thermal esophageal injury is a known
      potential consequence of this procedure. Delivery of radiofrequency (RF) energy necessary to
      perform left atrial ablation has the potential to cause injury to the nearby esophagus
      including ulceration, hematoma, spasm, esophageal motility disorders, and, in the most
      extreme case, atrial-esophageal fistula (AEF). Esophageal mucosal lesions are the likely
      precursor to AEF, and esophageal mucosal lesions have been detected on post-ablation
      endoscopy after pulmonary vein isolation with an incidence ranging from 3% to 60%.

      Active esophageal cooling during RF ablation as a means of esophageal injury prevention has
      been investigated through mathematical models, pre-clinical studies, and in clinical trials.
      Existing data support the efficacy of this approach, but the practice has not been widely
      adopted due to lack of a commercially available device.

      The aim or purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact on procedural efficiency of
      ablation procedures performed using esophageal heat transfer to cool the esophagus during
      left atrial RF ablation.

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, pilot study using the Attune Medical esophageal heat transfer
      device to actively cool the esophagus during RF ablation procedures. This design is
      appropriate to gather the data needed regarding overall procedural time, compare this to
      historical controls, and estimate a sample size for a larger study powered for statistical
      significance.

      The subjects will undergo preparation and anesthesia procedures following standard practice.
      Once the patient is intubated, the esophageal heat transfer device will be placed into the
      esophagus according to the Instructions for Use (IFU). The device will remain in place until
      the ablation procedure is completed and will be removed before extubation. Posterior left
      atrial wall ablation using standard parameters will only be performed when the esophageal
      heat transfer device has reached a temperature of 4-6 degrees C for at least 2 minutes. The
      device will be set to neutral or warming temperature (37-42 degrees C) during other aspects
      of the procedure (such as mapping and anterior wall ablations).

      All patients will be followed up in total for 6 weeks (Long Term Follow-up visit) after the
      procedure to document any clinical complication related to thermal esophageal injuries if
      applicable.
