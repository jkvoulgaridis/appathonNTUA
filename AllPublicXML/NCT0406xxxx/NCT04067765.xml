  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses techniques from an area of research known as neuroeconomics, which integrates
      concepts and methods from psychology, neuroscience, and economics to better understand how
      people make decisions and how these decisions are supported by the brain. One neuroeconomic
      concept that is especially relevant in the area of addictions is substance demand, or how
      consumption of a commodity (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, or drugs) is influenced by price and
      other factors. Previous studies have shown that alcohol demand is related to severity of
      alcohol misuse, drinking quantity/frequency, and treatment outcomes. In addition, we know
      that alcohol demand can also fluctuate in response to environmental cues such as
      alcohol-related stimuli or external contingencies such as important responsibilities the
      following day. These increase and decreases in consumption and value are clinically
      significant because they help us understand how people with alcohol use disorders are able to
      successfully or unsuccessfully modulate their drinking behaviors. This study is examining how
      the brain responds in these situations and whether these responses differ as a function of
      severity of alcohol misuse. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      to understand brain activity patterns associated with changes in the value of alcohol in the
      presence of alcohol-related beverage cues relative to neutral-related beverage cue or the
      presence of a significant next-day-responsibility (i.e., a work related obligation).
      Participants will be non-treatment-seeking adult heavy drinkers who are recruited from the
      community to participate in an fMRI scan. During the scan, participants will make decisions
      about how many alcohol beverages they would consume (hypothetically) at various prices while
      their brain activity during those decisions is measured. The first experimental manipulation
      involves an in-scanner alcohol cue exposure task in which the drinking decisions will be made
      after viewing high-quality images of alcoholic (beer/wine/liquor) beverages or neutral
      (water/juice/soft drinks) beverages. A second participant sample will make these decisions
      either in the presence of a significant next-day-responsibility or in the absence of any
      explicit responsibilities.

    <textblock>
      Neuroeconomics integrates concepts and methods from psychology, economics, and cognitive
      neuroscience to understand the neurobiological foundations of decision making, and has been
      increasingly applied to understanding alcohol use disorder (AUD). A novel application of
      neuroeconomics is the study of alcohol demand, or the value of alcohol as measured by
      cost-benefit preferences. Alcohol demand paradigms have considerable ecological validity by
      measuring the impact of internal and external influences on alcohol decision-making, such as
      price, environmental cues, affective states, or external contingencies. Behaviorally, alcohol
      demand is elevated among individuals with higher levels of alcohol misuse and predicts
      treatment response. Alcohol demand also exhibits state-like properties, including increases
      following exposure to alcohol-related cues and decreases in the presence of significant
      next-day responsibilities. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to characterize the
      neural activity that subserves these established behavioral findings using a novel functional
      MRI paradigm.

      The first aim is to examine the patterns of neural activation underlying increases in the
      value of alcohol in response to alcohol cues. To do so, the first study will use a
      within-subjects design to identify differences in neural activity associated with demand
      decisions following a validated in-scanner cue exposure protocol consisting of exposure to
      neutral beverage cues and exposure to alcohol beverage cues in a sample of adult heavy
      drinkers.

      The second aim is to investigate the changes in neural activity associated with decreases in
      the value of alcohol in response to next day responsibilities. To do so, a second study will
      use a within-subjects design, comparing demand-related neural activity following a standard
      instructional set and an instructional set that imposes a significant work-related
      responsibility the next day.

      Using a novel neuroeconomics approach, these studies combine a highly ecologically-valid
      alcohol demand paradigm with two experimental manipulations that model clinically-relevant
      influences on drinking decisions. Studying these contextual influences may help clarify the
      neural signatures that underlie drinking moderation vs. unconstrained drinking, and how these
      processes are impacted by AUD. If successful, these studies will provide a foundation for
      examining neural predictors of successful recovery or response to treatment vs. relapse. More
      broadly, findings from these studies have high potential to significantly enhance the
      clinical relevance of alcohol neuroscience.

    <description>Participants will report how many standard drinks they would consume at varying prices using a hypothetical Alcohol Purchase Task (APT) procedure. The APT is a validated self-report measure of alcohol consumption (in standard drink units) at escalating prices (18 price intervals, ranging from $0 to $80/drink). Responses on APT are analyzed to generate observed and derived indices of alcohol demand, including: intensity (consumption at free price); breakpoint (maximum price for spent for a single drink); Omax (maximum expenditure on alcohol); and Elasticity (proportionate slope of the alcohol demand curve)</description>
