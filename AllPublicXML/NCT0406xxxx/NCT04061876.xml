      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of combined Ruxolitinib
      With Corticosteroids as First Line Therapy for the Treatment of High risk aGVHD(acute
      graft-versus-host disease )
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is treated with systemic corticosteroid
      immunosuppression as first line therapy. Many patients with high risk aGVHD do not respond to
      primary therapy, high-dose systemic corticosteroids; therefore, survival for those patients
      remains particularly poor. Here we determine the efficacy and safety of combined Ruxolitinib
      With Corticosteroids as First Line Therapy for the Treatment of High risk aGVHD.
