      The purpose of this study is to perform a first in man study with VCR stimulation of the
      belly and back for patients with chronic pain conditions including pelvic pain, functional
      abdominal pain, or low back pain. This study will also examine VCR stimulation of the
      temporal region for patients with migraine with or without aura. Additional goals of the
      study will be to determine the safety, tolerability, and acceptability of VCR stimulation for
      the treatment of these pain conditions.
