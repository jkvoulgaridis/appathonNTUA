  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to identify the risk factors of community-acquired
      bacteremia to resistant bacteria.

      As the secondary objectives, the study aims

        -  to describe the episodes of epidemiology of bacteremia (community-acquired and
           nosocomial) with inpatient patients in APHP.

        -  to research a potential correlation between the incidence of community-acquired
           bacteremia of studied germs and the evolution of antibiotics consumption in general
           population in Île de France region.

        -  to distinguish three categories of community-acquired bacteremia: real
           community-acquired infections, infections beginning in community (patients discharged a
           community care center within 3 months), the nosocomial infections (patients discharged a
           health center within 7 jours). Describe the epidemiology of resistance and the
           differential impact of individual exposure to antibiotics in these three categories.

        -  to identify, according to pathogens, a temporal threshold from which a prior stay in a
           health center or HAD would impact on the occurrence of a community-acquired bacteremia
           with a resistant bacterium.

        -  to describe prospectively for follow-up of 1 year for hospitalized patients for a
           community-acquired or nosocomial bacteremia: mortality at one month and 3 months,
           re-hospitalization for an infectious episode and isolated bacteria during this later
           episode.

      The investigators will study in particularly individual exposure to antibiotics: exposure in
      3 months ou in 12 months, cumulative exposure, hospital- and community-acquired exposure,
      etc.
