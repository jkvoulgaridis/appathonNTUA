  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) children and adults with asthma have an increased rate of
      vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome episodes, and premature mortality when compared
      to those without asthma. We hypothesised that either asthma diagnosis and/or bronchodilator
      treatment may aggravate SCD via their modulating effect on autonomic nervous system.

      Heart rate variability during pulmonary function tests (spirometry, static volumes,
      DLCO/DLNO, exhaled NO at multiple flow rates) including salbutamol administration will be
      evaluated in patients with SCD (n=60) receiving asthma treatment or not, as compared to
      asthmatic children without SCD (n=30) matched for ethnicity

          -  child with sickle cell disease referred for monitoring of respiratory function in the
             framework of its sickle cell disease and whether or not it presents a possible disease
