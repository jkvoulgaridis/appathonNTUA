  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study that evaluates the postoperative pain findings of a
      consecutive series of laparoscopic surgeries for deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was carried out in university hospitals (Istanbul, Turkey). Patients diagnosed
      through bimanual gynecologic examination, gynecologic ultrasound or magnetic resonance
      imaging-confirmed endometrioma and DIE together; who underwent a laparoscopic surgery by a
      team of gynecologists, colorectal surgeons, and a urologist were retrospectively evaluated.
      The data were collected in a specific database and analyzed for postoperative pain outcomes
      through a comparison with preoperative symptoms scored using a visual analogue score (VAS),
      and the British Society of Gynecologic Endoscopy (BSGE) pelvic pain questionnaire.

    <description>Patients were evaluated using the BSGE pelvic pain questionnaire in terms of pre-operative and post-operative pain assessment in order to determine the effects of endometriosis surgery on the quality of life. The patients were asked to indicate their levels of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and chronic pelvic pain on a VAS on the pelvic pain questionnaire.</description>
