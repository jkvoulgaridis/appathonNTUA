    <textblock>
      Concussion incidence in high school and collegiate sports is high, especially in football.
      Once diagnosed, return to play is dependent on recovery from symptoms followed by a specific
      protocol for clearance; the sooner the symptoms subside the sooner the protocol is initiated.
      Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT) is a low risk procedure that has minimal side effects
      and has been used to decrease both headache intensity and frequency. With the main subjective
      symptom tracked for concussion being headache, OMT may be used to decrease the severity and
      the duration of this symptom.

      Concussion incidence in high school and collegiate sports is high, especially in football.
      These injuries have become the focus of the sports world, as coaches, trainers, and medical
      personnel are more vigilant than ever in screening for concussions. Once diagnosed, return to
      play is dependent on recovery from symptoms followed by a specific protocol for clearance;
      the sooner the symptoms subside the sooner the protocol is initiated. Osteopathic
      Manipulative Therapy (OMT) is a low risk procedure that has minimal side effects and has been
      used to decrease both headache intensity and frequency. With the main subjective symptom
      tracked for concussion being headache, OMT can be used to decrease the severity and the
      duration of this symptom. In a prospective superiority comparison between standard of care
      for concussion (rest and return to play protocol) and a single OMT treatment in combination
      with standard therapy, we hypothesize that OMT decreases symptom duration and severity of
      headache in concussion management.

    <description>Patient will score him or herself on a scale from 0-6 for each of 22 concussion related symptoms. A score of &quot;0&quot; is equal to no symptoms, a score of 1-2 is mild, a score of 3-4 is moderate, a score of 5-6 is severe. Total score is calculated by adding each individual item score. Higher scores are worse than lower scores.</description>

    <description>Initial concussion treatment will involve OMT in addition to standard of care treatment. The OMT practitioner, using a strong anatomic knowledge base, applies specific genital forces in the dysfunctional area, thus providing aid to the body's innate mechanisms of healing. During OMT, a patient's muscles and joints are moved using techniques that include stretching, gentle pressure, and resistance.</description>

    <description>Standard of care for concussion management is cognitive rest, meaning no stimulation (or as little as possible). This mean no TV/phones/music/school/homework generally for 24 hours. After that a return to academic work is typically started. Once patient is symptom free for 24 hours, then the return to play protocol is initiated (this takes 7 total days to complete at a minimum).</description>
