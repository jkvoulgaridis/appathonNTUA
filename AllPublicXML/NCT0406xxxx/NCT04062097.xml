  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, observational, non-interventional study investigates patients
      with intracranial hemorrhage under effective anticoagulation with dabigatran or vitamin-K
      antagonist (VKA). Routine data will be collected during hospitalization. Patients aged 18
      years or older under effective therapy with dabigatran and symptomatic intracranial bleeding
      confirmed by cerebral imaging and treated with idarucizumab will be compared to patients
      under effective treatment with VKA at the time of onset of the intracranial bleeding.
      Ninety-five dabigatran patients who provided written informed consent for data transmission
      will be included. As control group retrospective and anonymized data of 285 VKA patients
      patients under VKA treatment and admitted to RIC-ICH study centers will be used. For each
      patient receiving idarucizumab, three patients with intracranial hemorrhage under effective
      treatment with VKA, will be included (retrospective) in the study. In addition, data of VKA
      patients will be transferred from the RASUNOA-PRIME and the &quot;Erlanger Hirnblutungs-Register&quot;.

    <description>Change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of ≥4 pts compared to initial NIHSS or worsening of NIHSS level of consciousness ≥1 point or increase of the volume of the intracranial bleeding or new intraventricular bleeding or death. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>

        Patients with the anticoagulating therapy dabigatran admitted with a clinically symptomatic
        intracranial bleeding will be included in the study, if they have been treated with
        idarucizumab (dabigatran-group). It is assumed that some of these patients will have been
        given an antiplatelet drug as co-medication.

        As reference population, patients with intracranial hemorrhage under effective treatment
        with VKA (INR ≥ 1,7) treated in the same center will be used (VKA-group). These patients
        usually have been treated with some antagonist to VKA (or no reversal therapy at all).
