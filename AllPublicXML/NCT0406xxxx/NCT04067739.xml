  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment for end stage liver disease. Being a
      major abdominal surgery, may have postoperative complications that require readmission, which
      may be serious and life threatening. In general, patients who required ICU readmission showed
      higher morbidity, mortality and prolonged hospital stay compared to those who did not require
      readmission. We will conduct this retrospective observational study to identify incidence,
      causes and outcomes of ICU readmission after LDLT

      -  This retrospective observational study will be conducted in Ain Shams University
           Specialized Hospital on 335 adult (age ≥18 years) Egyptian patients undergoing living
           donor liver transplant (LDLT) between 2008 to 2018. Patients' demographic data,
           preoperative variables, intraoperative variables, postoperative stay and complications,
           causes for ICU readmission, and outcomes after ICU readmission will be studied.
           Intraoperatively, Both standard anesthetic and piggyback LT for hepatic transplantation
           were performed by the same anesthesia and surgical team . Intraoperative patients were
           monitored with ECG, invasive arterial blood pressure (left radial artery), noninvasive
           blood pressure, continuous central venous pressure (CVP), body temperature, oxygen
           saturation (SaO2), capnometry (EtCO2) and urine output (mL). Intraoperative hemodynamics
           (MAP and HR), graft weight to recipient weight ratio (GWRWR), blood products transfused
           and intraoperative adverse events were recorded. At the end of surgery patients were
           transferred to the ICU where they were monitored and received the standard protocol for
           postoperative management after liver transplantation.

        -  The postoperative immunosuppressive protocols includes calcinurine inhibitors( FK or
           cyclosporine), and steroids with or without mycophynolate. Piperacillin/ tazobactam was
           used as early prophylaxis for bacterial infections and metronidazole as prophylaxis for
           anaerobic infection. Patients with an uncomplicated postoperative course and good liver
           function will be transferred from the ICU within 3 - 5 days to a designated
           transplantation inpatient unit where they will be closely followed up by surgical and
           medical team, as well as by pharmacists, nutritionists, and physical therapists.
