  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single arm, open-label, multi-agent, localized pharmacodynamic
      biomarker Phase 0 trial designed to study the biological effects within the tumor
      microenvironment of TAK-981 and TAK-981 combined with cetuximab or avelumab when administered
      intratumorally in microdose quantities via the CIVO device. CIVO stands for comparative in
      vivo oncology.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CIVO is a research tool composed of a hand-held single-use sterile injector coupled with
      fluorescent tracking microspheres called CIVO GLO that mark the sites of drug microdose
      injection, enabling rapid assessment of multiple oncology drugs or drug combinations
      simultaneously within a patient's tumor. In this Phase 0 intratumoral microdosing study in
      human patients with localized or metastatic primary tumors of the head and neck (who will be
      undergoing previously planned tumor and regional nodes dissection), we will evaluate
      TAK-981's ability to activate innate immune effector cells within the local tumor
      microenvironment. Additionally, this study will examine TAK-981 in combination with cetuximab
      or avelumab to study whether TAK-981 enhances the localized immune responses compared to
      those of either immunotherapy alone. TAK-981 singly and in combination with cetuximab or
      avelumab will be delivered intratumorally in subtherapeutic microdose quantities via CIVO.

      The CIVO device percutaneously penetrates solid tumors and delivers subtherapeutic microdoses
      of up to eight anti-cancer agents or combinations of anti-cancer agents co-injected with CIVO
      GLO into discrete regions of the tumor. At the time of the planned surgical intervention (one
      or three days after the CIVO microdose injection), the injected tumor tissue is then excised
      and tumor responses are assessed via histological staining of tumor cross-sections sampled
      perpendicular to each injection column. Co-injection with CIVO GLO enables identification of
      each injection site during resection as well as in tissues stained for analysis. Because the
      platform delivers microdose amounts of each test agent or combination directly into the
      patient's tumor tissue, hypotheses can be tested earlier in the drug development process,
      consistent with the goals of the 2006 FDA Exploratory IND Guidance for Industry.

    <description>Patients who are scheduled for surgical biopsy or tumor resection surgery will be injected one day (Cohort 1) or three days (Cohort 2) prior to surgery using the CIVO device. Each needle of the CIVO device will deliver up to 8.3 microliters of solution, including a vehicle control (sterile saline) or subtherapeutic microdoses of TAK-981, cetuximab, avelumab, TAK-981 combined with cetuximab, or TAK-981 combined with avelumab. Each microdose is simultaneously and percutaneously injected in a columnar fashion through each of 8, 5, or 3 needles (in a device configuration determined by tumor dimensions) into a single solid tumor or effaced metastatic lymph node. Approximately six patients will be assigned to each time point cohort. Cohort assignment is not sequential and will be selected by the Investigator based on clinic logistics and patient scheduling. Should one cohort fill in advance of the other, sites will be directed by Presage to enroll patients into the second cohort only.</description>

             volume of viable tumor tissue (based on available pre-operative imaging, pre-injection
             ultrasound imaging, or pathology reports) for CIVO injection due to size, location,
             necrosis, cysts, excessive stroma, fibrosis, or treatment-induced tissue changes.
