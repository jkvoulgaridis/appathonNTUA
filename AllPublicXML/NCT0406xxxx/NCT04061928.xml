      In this study, patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of gastroesophageal junction
      will be enrolled to explore the safety and efficacy of preoperative radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy combined with Toripalimab (PD-1). Around 45 patients will be recruited in this
      one-arm cohort. All patients in this cohort will be treated with preoperative radiotherapy
      and chemotherapy plus PD-1 for two times, then another two times of PD-1 before operation.
      After surgery, postoperative chemotherapy plus PD-1 will be carried out for four times. This
      study focuses on the safety of chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy, and whether the
      TRG grade, LC, DFS have been improved.
