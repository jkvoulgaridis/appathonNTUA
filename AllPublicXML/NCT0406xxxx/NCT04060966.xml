  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central aim of this study is to characterize how the costs of acute and lifetime stress
      affect the neural architecture for decision-making in healthy humans. Investigators will use
      behavioral choice paradigms to measure how the costs of stress influence decisions about
      rewards (e.g., foods, money) as well as decisions about the use of self-control strategies.
      They will further examine associations between these stress measures and other decision
      variables commonly studied in our lab which have well-understood mechanisms, such as risk
      preferences. This behavioral work lays the foundation for an fMRI experiment that combines
      our measures of the behavioral costs of stress with neural measures of brain changes. Acute
      stress will be measured using a physiological stressor (cold-pressor task) coupled with
      saliva sample collection for cortisol analysis. Lifetime stress will be measured using a
      computerized life stress survey. We will study three cohorts: One purely behavioral cohort
      will be examined on-site (n=60). In a smaller subset of participants (n=40), investigators
      will measure neural activity changes in relevant brain areas as measured with MRI during
      decisions to use self-control in the presence of rewards. In a larger sample (n=500) the
      correlation between participants' risk preferences and lifetime stress exposure at scale
      using Amazon Mechanical Turk subjects will be measured.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English as a native language

          -  Corrected-to-normal vision

          -  Individuals on diets to maintain or lose weight, or those not on a diet

          -  All races, ethnicities, and cultures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For all fMRI studies we will exclude participants who meet one of the standard CBI MRI
             exclusion criteria (see attached exclusion questionnaire) prior to participation. This
             screening questionnaire will be administered prior to scheduling the study, and once
             again before the scanner session during the second consenting procedure.

          -  History of and/or medication for neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  High blood pressure, heart condition or related medical conditions

          -  Diabetes, metabolic disorders, history of eating disorders, or food allergies

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Handedness (this has been shown be indicative of variations in brain circuitry)

          -  Since we will measure stress hormones, subjects currently taking corticosteroids or
             beta-blockers will be ineligible to participate, as these medications have been found
             to dramatically alter stress hormone levels.

          -  Furthermore, evidence suggests that fluctuations in bodily hormones (such as that
             induced through hormonal contraceptives or different stages of menstrual cycle phase)
             can affect stress hormone levels (Tersman, Collins, &amp; Eneroth, 1991; Kirschbaum et al,
             1999; Andreano, Arjomanid, Cahill, 2008). In order to account for hormonal
             differences, we will ask female participants if they are taking oral contraceptives.
             Likewise, we propose to use a simple, non-invasive questionnaire to determine cycle
             phase, as in McCormick &amp; Teillon, 2001. We may need to exclude on the basis of whether
             or not female participants use hormone-based contraceptives, which, for the reason
             stated above, could be a potential confound.

          -  In some cases, we will pre-screen subjects to ensure they are on a diet to maintain or
             lose weight in order to examine how dietary and health goals influence decisions about
             self-control and rewards.
