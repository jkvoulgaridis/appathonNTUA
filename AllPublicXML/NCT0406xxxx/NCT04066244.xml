  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an open label study to evaluate safety, tolerability and brain microglia response in
      ALS patients following multiple doses of BLZ945.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to identify a dose (or doses) of BLZ945, that measurably
      decrease(s) TSPO binding in the brain of ALS subjects, and to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of BLZ945 in ALS subjects at these doses and dosing regimen. PET imaging with a
      ligand selective for TSPO is widely used as a marker for microglial activation. Following
      microglia reduction, the repopulation of microglia in ALS subjects will be assessed at
      different times post dosing.
