      This is a pilot study designed to to provide data and experience comparing two different
      techniques of breath hold SBRT treatments. The first technique will include SGRT, but with
      the assistance of implanted fiducials. Subjects will be treated with a breath hold technique
      utilizing SGRT, but will also be imaged during treatment with fiducial match. The second
      technique will utilize SGRT for breath hold treatments without the assistance of implanted
      fiducials/continuous imaging.

      The study's primary objective is estimate the incidence of SBRT and fiducial-related
      pulmonary toxicities for subjects treated with SBRT who have tumors that move ≥ 1 cm in 3
      different cohorts: 1) free breathing with SGRT 2) breath hold utilizing SGRT only; 3) breath
      hold utilizing SGRT in combination with implanted fiducials. Secondary objectives also
      include Estimate reliability of gated SBRT treatments utilizing SGRT vs. SGRT with fiducials
      estimating local control for SBRT in subjects treated in the three different cohorts,
      estimating overall survival, and evaluating quality of life. A safety objective of estimating
      acute and long-term grade 2 or higher non-hematologic toxicities attributed to SBRT/fiducial
      implantation in subjects treated in the three different cohorts will also be explored.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subject must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in this
        study:

          1. Written informed consent with HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information.

          2. Age ≥18 years at the time of consent. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of fiducials in combination with SBRT in subjects &lt;18
             years of age, children are excluded from this study.

          3. ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 2.

          4. Stage IA-IIB (T1a-T3bN0) presumed non-small cell lung cancer or lung metastasis that
             have ≥ 1 cm of respiratory associated motion measured on 4DCT at time of simulation
             for SBRT with or without respiratory motion suppression techniques. Histologic
             confirmation of malignancy is encouraged but not required. Primary or metastatic tumor
             ≤ 7 cm.

          5. Subjects may be receiving systemic chemotherapy or other systemic agents prior to
             enrollment, but these agents must be stopped during SBRT treatments.

          6. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 14 days prior to day 1 of treatment. NOTE: Females are considered of child
             bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (at least
             12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause).

          7. The effects of radiation on the developing human fetus are not well described. For
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and non-sterilized men who are sexually
             active with a woman of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. FCBP must be willing to use a highly
             effective contraceptive method (i.e., achieves a failure rate of &lt;1% per year when
             used consistently and correctly) from the time of informed consent until 5 days after
             last dose of SBRT. Contraceptive methods with low user dependency are preferable but
             not required.

          8. As determined by the enrolling physician, ability of the subject to understand and
             comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:

          1. Prior radiation to the chest that would overlap with the current radiation fields and
             determined by the treating physician to impede the treatment of the study malignancy.

          2. Active ongoing pulmonary infection or pneumonitis that is requiring active treatment
             with antibiotics or steroids. Prior pneumonitis from drug or other therapies that has
             been treated within 15 days of first day of treatment.
