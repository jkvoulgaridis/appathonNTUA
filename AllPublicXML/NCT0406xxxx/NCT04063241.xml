      The overarching goal of this work is to identify strategies to reduce preventable pediatric
      post-hospitalization morbidity. In this study, investigators seek to address gaps in the
      knowledge base related to pediatric post-hospitalization morbidity by examining the
      understanding and execution of post-hospitalization discharge instructions in the context of
      low health literacy (HL).

    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators seek to address gaps in the knowledge base related to pediatric
      post-hospitalization morbidity in 3 phases: first (Phase A) by examining the understanding
      and execution of post-hospitalization discharge instructions in the context of low HL, second
      (Phase B) by beginning to develop a low literacy discharge plan template to enhance and
      standardize provider counseling, and third (Phase C) by examining the effects of the
      intervention. The focus will be on those at greatest risk for low HL and poor outcomes,
      families from low SES backgrounds. Investigators therefore propose a prospective study (Phase
      A) to:

      AIM 1. Examine associations between HL and parent execution of inpatient discharge
      instructions (overall and 4 key domains: medication management, follow-up, diet/activity
      restrictions, and concerning symptoms to act on;.

      Hypothesis: Low HL will be adversely associated with execution (overall/individual domains).

      AIM 2. Examine the role of understanding in the relationship between HL and parent execution
      of inpatient discharge instructions. a) Examine associations between HL and understanding
      (overall and 4 key domains). b) Examine the degree to which understanding mediates the
      relationship between HL and execution (overall and individual domains).

      Hypothesis: Low HL will be adversely associated with understanding and its individual
      domains. The relationship between HL and execution will be partially mediated by
      understanding.

      AIM 3 (Exploratory). Explore the role and mechanism through which low HL is related to
      post-hospitalization morbidity (as defined by readmissions, ED use, or unplanned doctor
      visits) by examining a) the association between HL and post-hospitalization morbidity, and b)
      the degree to which the relationship between HL and post-hospitalization morbidity occurs
      through overall understanding and execution.

      Preliminary data from Phase A showed that &gt;80% of parents make â‰¥1 error related to hospital
      discharge instructions. Notably, 30% of parents made medication errors, 20% missed &gt;1
      follow-up appointment, and 70% were not aware of concerning symptoms that should prompt
      medical attention. Findings from Phase A will be used to inform development of (Phase B) and
      to examine the efficacy of (Phase C) interventions to reduce post-hospitalization morbidity
      through a HL-informed approach as recommended by the Institute of Medicine. This work will
      build on a longstanding program of research and intervention development in this area by the
      study team.

      The specific aims for Phases B and C are to:

      AIM 4. Design a health literacy-informed discharge plan template tool to address domains of
      medication management, follow-up appointments, concerning symptoms to act on, and
      diet/activity restrictions.

      AIM 5. Explore the efficacy of the tool in improving parent understanding and execution of
      discharge instructions (e.g. medication errors, appointment attendance, actions related to
      concerning symptoms, diet/activity restrictions).

      Hypothesis: Parents will demonstrate improved understanding/execution of discharge
      instructions.

      AIM 6. Explore the feasibility and utility of the tool with providers and parents.

      Hypothesis: Providers/parents will find the tool to be easy to use and helpful.

    <intervention_model_description>Parents:
Phase A (Pre-implementation): Parents in the pre-implementation group will receive standard care: verbal counseling by the doctor/nurse using text-based instructions they have prepared (not standardized). Phase A was completed as an observational study.
Phase B (Implementation): Provider training (see below) Phase C (Post-implementation): Doctors and nurses will customize the web-based disease-specific instructions with the research team's help. They will reference these instructions as they perform discharge counseling and will give parents a copy of the instructions.
Providers:
Pediatric residents knowledge, attitudes, and practices will be assessed at baseline. They will then take part in a 20-minute training session, including information about health literacy, advanced counseling strategies, results of prior studies, and pre-implementation data. Assessments will be performed for those who use the health literacy-informed tool at least once during the study period.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Execution will be assessed at three time points. The first assessment (T2) will take place in person, within the first two weeks of discharge, to coincide with a follow-up appointment if possible or at another convenient time for the parent. At this time point, execution will be assessed via structured survey and b) observed dosing assessment. Surveys will include information about execution of instructions related to medications (dose and adherence), follow up appointments (attendance), concerning symptoms, and restrictions. The electronic health record will also be reviewed to determine if appointments were attended</description>

    <time_frame>1 day (within 12 hours of hospital discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>Understanding will be measured in person or by phone after discharge education by the inpatient team but before parents begin administering scheduled home medications (T1b). Parents will be administered a structured survey. Actual understanding of medications, follow-up appointments, diet and activity restrictions, and concerning symptoms to monitor will be assessed. Questions will also include parent self-perceived understanding (including self-perceived understanding of medications, follow-up appointments, time of, diet and activity restrictions, and concerning symptoms). Subjects will rate their agreement with these statements on a 5 Point Likert Scale (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree). The adult version of this questionnaire has been validated and was later adapted for pediatric parents; we further modified this tool to include additional topics and to make it more easily understandable for parents with low literacy.</description>
