  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) have been proven to lower risk of
      cardiovascular diseases. But the DASH diet is inconsistent with Chinese dietary pattern. In
      this study, based on the typical Cantonese diet, the healthy Cantonese diet is developed
      according to the DASH diet and the balanced dietary pattern of the Chinese Dietary Guidelines
      2016. The randomized control trial is designed to investigate whether the healthy Cantonese
      diet has benefit to blood pressure, blood lipid, blood glucose and other cardiometabolic
      biomarkers among adults with cardiometabolic syndrome in Guangdong, China.

    <intervention_model_description>All subjects will enter 1-week run-in feeding period during which they will eat the control diet. After a 1-week run-in period, subjects will be randomly divided into the intervention group and the control group, stratified by gender. The two groups will eat their assigned diet for 4 consecutive weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Due to the particularity of dietary intervention studies, it is hard to blind researchers and kitchen staff. Therefore, this trial only blinds subjects. In order to ensure blinding, they will be not told which group they have been assigned and the two groups will eat their assigned diet in different rooms. And outcomes assessors will also be blinded to the two diet groups.</masking_description>

    <description>Based on the typical Cantonese diet, the healthy Cantonese diet is developed according to the DASH diet and the balanced dietary pattern of the Chinese Dietary Guidelines 2016. In this diet, the main nutrients, dietary fiber, sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium are set to achieve the healthy goal. Compared with the typical Cantonese diet, the healthy Cantonese diet is increased in fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and reduced in salt, oil and sweets.</description>
