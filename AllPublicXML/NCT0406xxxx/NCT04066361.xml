      This two-part randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the impact of pre-test video
      education as compared to pre-test Chatbot education.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are introducing the option of two alternatives to
      genetic counseling before genetic testing: Chatbot and video education.

      The first part of this research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first-time investigators
      are examining the use of a Chatbot to deliver pre-genetic test education. The Chatbot will
      converse with you about germline genetic testing by text message.

      The Pilot study will enroll 200 participants with a metastatic breast or ovarian cancer
      diagnosis and will assess the uptake of genetic testing among the two possible groups of
      pre-genetic test counseling.

      The second part of this research study will utilize findings from the Pilot Study for 1000
      participants with a diagnosis of breast, ovarian, pancreatic or prostate cancer.

      In both parts of this research study, participants will be randomized to either the video
      education or Chatbot. Participants may request in-person genetic counseling after their
      respective education prior to testing.

      Other studies at both DFCI and outside institutions have started to investigate alternative
      methods of educating patients about genetic testing. These studies have suggested that
      alternatives to standard genetic counseling may increase access to genetic testing with
      similar satisfaction to standard of care.

      The investigators are hoping to get a sense of participants' preferences for pre genetic test
      education, understanding, and reactions to the alternative methods of genetic counseling. The
      investigators are also hoping to understand preferences for communication of their result and
      whether any treatment changes have been made after they receive their result.

    <description>A validated survey of participants' satisfaction with the genetic counseling and testing process will be used. For the survey at the time of post-counseling, the survey for the video education arm consists of 8 questions and the genetic counseling arm contains an additional question about perceived length of the visit. The parameters for measurement are &quot;disagree strongly&quot;, &quot;disagree&quot;, &quot;neither agree or disagree&quot;, &quot;agree&quot;, and &quot;agree strongly&quot;.</description>
