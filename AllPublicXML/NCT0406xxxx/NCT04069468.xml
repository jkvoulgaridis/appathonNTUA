  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry study is to gather effectiveness, QoL, safety and procedural
      information on TheraSphere® for the treatment of participants with HCC in real world clinical
      practice settings in France.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TheraSphere® is a radioembolic therapeutic device used in the treatment of liver cancers. The
      goal of the registry study is to collect prospectively: participant description, treatment
      goal, treatment description, treatment results, safety, quality of life and survival data to
      ultimately demonstrate that TheraSphere® treatment meets the claims that led to the
      reimbursement in France. The registry study is also an opportunity to improve the proper use
      of the device by team training especially for the personalized dosimetry treatment approach.

      Clinical data will be collected and held in a secured, validated system and can be downloaded
      by BTG Data Management on an ongoing basis. Data verification will be performed by BTG Data
      Management and data validation checks will be created by the validated data system (with the
      BTG team performing User Acceptance Testing on them before they go live). Adverse Events and
      concomitant diseases will be coded according to the version of Medical Dictionary for
      Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) agreed with Biocompatibles UK Ltd. Concomitant medications
      will be coded using the version of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Drug dictionary agreed
      with the validated data system.

    <time_frame>Treatment (Day 1) up to participant's death, opposition to data collection, or study termination (up to Year 6)</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be calculated as the interval between treatment administration and the date of death for any cause, opposition to data collection, or study termination, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <measure>QoL Measurements Using FACT-HEP Questionnaire Before and After Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment (Day 1), every 2 to 4 months Post Treatment (maximum treatment time = up to Day 28), and SOC visits after Month 12 until up to participant's death, opposition to data collection, study withdraw for any cause, or study termination (up to Year 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life (QoL) will be assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-HEP) questionnaire prior to treatment on Day 1, every 2 to 4 months post treatment (follow up visits), and every standard of care (SOC) visit after Month 12 until the participant's death, opposition to data collection, study withdraw for any cause, or study termination. The FACT-Hep Questionnaire uses participant-reported outcome (PRO) scores. QoL scores of each domain at each time-point and their differences from baseline will be summarised. A deterioration in QoL is defined as a 7-point decline in the total score or death, whichever comes first. The time to deterioration in QoL will be calculated as the interval between first date of TheraSphere® treatment and deterioration in QoL. The higher the score, the better the QoL, with a range 0-180.</description>

    <measure>Number of Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events (AEs) Related to Study Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment (Day 1) up to 90 Days Post Treatment (maximum treatment time = up to Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence or undesirable event experienced in a participant that begins or worsens following TheraSphere® administration. An undesirable event can be, but is not limited to, objective findings or symptoms experienced by a participant, such as significant clinical laboratory abnormalities. AEs will be classified using National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v 5.0 (Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, Grade 4=life-threatening consequences, and Grade 5=death related to AE). Grade 3 or higher AEs related or possibly related to the device, or the device administration procedure that occur up to the second follow-up visit (or within a minimum of 90 days) after last TheraSphere® administration will be reported. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs (SAEs), regardless of causality will be located in the 'Reported AE section'.</description>

    <description>At Baseline and follow-up post treatment, participants' treatment expectation will be measured by a qualitative assessment according to Investigator's opinion, whether the goal is met or not. Before treatment the treatment goal will be documented (the proposals are: improvement of tumour symptoms, obtain a Complete Response, obtain a Partial Tumour Response, obtain a Disease Control response, improve portal vein thrombosis [PVT] extension, control tumour symptoms, improve survival, improve QoL, downsize to surgery, bridge to liver transplantation, and contralateral lobe hypertrophy).

    <measure>Number of Participants with Tumour Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment (Day 1) up to Month 12 Post Treatment (maximum treatment time = up to Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumour Response will be based on the radiological tumour assessment and will be categorized as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) or Progressive Disease (PD). Tumour response will be assessed using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (mRECIST) criteria: CR=disappearance of any intratumoural arterial enhancement in all target lesions; PR=≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable target lesions; SD=neither CR, PR, PD; and PD=≥20% increase in the sum of the diameter of viable of target lesion and/or appearance of new lesion intra or extra hepatic.</description>

    <description>The Baseline computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be compared against 99mTc-MAA imaging (Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography [SPECT] or SPECT/CT) to evaluate the agreement in the lesion locations identified with 2 imaging methods. The 3 categories to report agreement between Baseline CT/MRI and 99mTc-MAA are: Optimal (images match), Sub optimal (less than 50% of tumour coverage), and Non optimal (images do not match at all).</description>

    <description>TheraSphere® will be administered through the hepatic artery. Activity of administered TheraSphere® is tailored in order to deliver an absorbed dose of 80 to150 gray (Gy) to the liver without exceeding 50 Gy cumulatively in the lungs. Lung dose (D) will be calculated from the following formula: D=A*(1-S)*50/1. D=Planned dose absorbed by treated volume(Gy), A=Activity injected with microspheres (gigabequerel [GBq]), S=Percentage of pulmonary shunt, &quot;1&quot; assuming that the lung mass=1 kilograms [kg]). Number of treatments is up to Investigator's discretion. If 2 treatments are required to complete treatment, the lobe with the highest tumour burden should be scheduled for 1st treatment. Before the 2nd treatment session, a 2nd angiogram with 99mTc-MAA scan should be performed. A 2nd treatment would typically take place 30-45 days after 1st treatment, provided participant has tolerated 1st treatment. Treatment will be performed according to the Instructions for Use (IFU).</description>
