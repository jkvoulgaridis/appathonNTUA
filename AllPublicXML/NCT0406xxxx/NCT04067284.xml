  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stunting contributes substantially to child mortality and disease burden in low-income
      countries. In Bangladesh the prevalence of stunting among children &lt;5-years of age is high
      (36%) reaching 50% in slum areas. The pathogenesis of stunting is multifaceted, yet
      nutritional inadequacy and repeated infections are established risk factors of stunting.

      A three-arm randomized controlled trial in Dhaka's slum area is proposed. The children will
      be recruited from vaccination clinics. Infants at risk of stunting (-1 SD length-for-age
      z-score, LAZ) aged around 5 months are eligible for the study. Eligible children will be
      randomized to receive: 1) nutrition education on dietary diversity; 2) a combination of
      similar education plus daily supplementation of homemade yogurt; 3) a 'usual care' (control)
      group. The investigators will recruit 120 children (40 per arm). Intervention will be
      initiated a month before starting of complementary feeding with an educational session and
      will last 7 months during which a monthly educational session will be delivered at
      participant's household. The homemade yogurt supplementation will start a week after
      beginning of 6 months of age once the child is introduced to solid foods of the mother's
      choice. The yogurt will be supplied to the mothers every day at time of feeding. Feeding
      behaviors will be self-monitored using a pictorial calendar. Primary outcome (LAZ) and
      secondary outcomes (fecal bio-markers, WAZ, head circumference, and food diversity scores),
      will be measured at baseline (6 months), 9 months and 12 months of child age. Supplementation
      with homemade yogurt is a novel approach with the potential to improve infant gut
      environment, improve food absorption and thus potentially prevent stunting.

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that, continued breastfeeding, adequate complimentary feeding
      and supplementation with homemade yogurt have the potential to reduce stunting.

      Primary objective:

      The present study is aimed to assess the impact of low-cost nutritional strategies to prevent
      childhood malnutrition in Bangladesh.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To compare differences in growth pattern (length-for-age z-score, weight-for age
           z-score, head circumference) of children at risk of stunting age 6-months between
           infants receiving educational program only, infants receiving education plus homemade
           yogurt supplementation and those receiving the &quot;usual-care&quot; (control).

        2. To evaluate whether amount of gut microbiota necessary to improve gut health was
           associated with weight gain and growth in these children to support the casual mechanism
           behind this approach.

    <description>Minimum dietary diversity (MDD): the proportion of children who received foods from 4 or more food categories on the previous day. This is a binary variable; children will be grouped into two - met MDD (score 1), did not meet MDD (score 0)
Minimum meal frequency (MMF): the proportion of children who received solid, semi-solid, or soft foods the minimum numbers of time or more on the previous day. The minimum acceptable number is 2 or more times until the age of 8 months and 3 or more times thereafter. This is a binary variable; children will be grouped into two - met MMF (score 1), did not meet MMF (score 0)
Minimum acceptable diet (MAD): the proportion of children who met both the MDD and MMF scores. This is a binary variable; children will be grouped into two - met MAD (score 1), did not meet MAD (score 0)</description>
