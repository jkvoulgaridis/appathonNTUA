      This study aims to explore the clinical and immunological efficacy of low-dose Interleukin-2
      (IL-2) on idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a single center, open-label, prospective study. Adults with active
      IIM will be enrolled. IIM is defined as Dermatomyositis (DM) or Polymyositis (PM), meeting
      the Bohan &amp; Peter (1975) diagnostic criteria for definite or probable DM or PM. One million
      units of Recombinant Human Interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) was administered subcutaneously every other
      day for 3 months. All patients were followed up for 3 months after withdraw of IL-2.

    <description>The CDASI is a clinician-scored single page instrument that separately measures activity and damage in the skin of DM patients for use in clinical practice or clinical/therapeutic studies. Disease involvement in 15 different anatomical locations is rated using three activity (erythema, scale, erosion/ulceration) and two damage (poikiloderma, calcinosis) measures. The presence and severity of Gottron's papules, periungual changes and alopecia are also captured. Disease activity is scored from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate greater disease severity.</description>

             hormones), DMARDs (eg methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, morphine, Ester,
             leflunomide, cyclosporine, etc.) must be stable for 4 weeks and do not increase
             hormone doses or other immunosuppressive agents throughout the study. If the enrolled
