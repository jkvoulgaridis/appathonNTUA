      The WEstlake precision BIRTH cohort（WEBIRTH) is a prospective cohort study among women with
      hyperglycemia during pregnancy and their offspring living in Hangzhou, China. The primary aim
      of this cohort is to characterize the continuous blood glucose response to dietary intake and
      physical activity among pregnant women with hyperglycemia over 2 weeks, and to facilitate the
      development of personalized nutritional/lifestyle recommendation among these patients.
      Another aim of WEBIRTH is to investigate the association of dietary and physical activity
      together with continuous glucose change during pregnancy on the adverse birth outcomes
      including preterm birth, low birth weight and small-for-gestational age birth. The secondary
      aim is to investigate the prospective associations of diet, physical activity and continuous
      glucose change over 2 week among the patients with the long-term metabolic health of the
      women and their offspring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China, an alarming increase in the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)/
      diabetes in pregnancy (DIP) patients has been observed in the past decade. GDM and DIP are of
      concern because they are associated with several maternal and fetal medical disorders.
      Lifestyle changes such as diet and physical activity modifications are key for the prevention
      and treatment of GDM/DIP. However, the associations between dietary intake and physical
      activity and health outcomes for GDM/DIP women and their children remain unclear due to
      subjective measurements of diet and physical activity. Recently, the development of objective
      measurement such as food image identification and wearable activity trackers give an
      opportunity to gain more precise insight into these associations. In addition, for the same
      food and physical activity exposure, GDM/DIP women may have different blood glucose
      responses, but the nature of variation is currently poorly characterized. Therefore, the
      present WEBIRTH design incorporates three unique components, 1) objective measurement of
      physical activity during pregnancy using accelerometer; 2) measurement of dietary intake
      using both FFQ and food photos; 3) measurement of blood glucose levels over 2 weeks using
      continuous glucose monitors, with a standardized test meal during the 2 weeks. We will then
      follow up these women participants during and after this pregnancy, and also follow up their
      offspring.
