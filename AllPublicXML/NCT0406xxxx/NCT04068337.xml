  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Freestyle速 prosthesis (Medtronic plc, Dublin, Ireland) is a biological, porcine aortic
      root implanted in various combinations and techniques since the 1990s. The main indication
      for the choice of this prosthesis is a combined pathology with degenerated aortic valve and
      additional dilatation of the root often involving the ascending aorta.

      The Freestyle速 prosthesis is also used in cases of dissection of the ascending aorta with the
      involvement of the aortic valve, which opens the debate on how far the ascending aorta should
      be replaced for a sustainable solution with calculable low periprocedural risk. Considering a
      lower intraoperative risk in the life-threatening situation, an extended resection of the
      aorta can be avoided and only the aortic root replaced with a piece of ascending aorta. On
      the contrary, focusing on improved long-term outcome, the technique of total arch replacement
      in aortic dissection was developed in emergency situations with acceptable results, which,
      however, were often reproducible only in large, experienced centers.

      Apart from the abovementioned options, the technique of proximal arch replacement can provide
      a tension-free anastomosis. The intention of hemiarch replacement is the attachment of the
      prosthesis to an aneurysm-free portion of the aortic arch helping to protect against further
      anastomotic aneurysms and spare the patient complex reoperation or interventional procedures
      in the future. As a possible drawback of the technique, especially in emergency situations,
      the potentially prolonged duration of surgery and the need of selective brain perfusion via
      axillary or carotid artery are discussed increasing the risk of stroke and further major
      events, which could not be reflected in current literature. However, there is still no
      convincing evidence of a long-term benefit in terms of re-operation and survival after
      hemiarch replacement.

      The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess the mid-term outcome of the biological
      Freestyle速 prosthesis in combination with operations on the ascending aorta and the aortic
      arch with regard to prosthetic performance, reoperations, stroke and death.

        From September 2007 till March 2017, we performed 278 aortic root replacements with the
        Freestyle prosthesis at a single centre in Switzerland. Two groups were identified based on
        the additional replacement of the hemiarch resulting in 119 patients (HA) and 159 patients
        without an additional hemiarch replacement (non-HA). Patients with additional valve and
        coronary artery procedures were included as well. Out of the non-HA group, 7 patients were
        cannulated through the femoral artery and excluded for further analysis.
