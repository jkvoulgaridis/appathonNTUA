  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well nTMS works in planning for stereotactic radiosurgery in patients
      with brain metastases in the motor cortex. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of radiation
      therapy that delivers high doses of radiation, which can sometimes lead to damage occurring
      to the brain and surrounding areas. The motor cortex (the part of the nervous system that
      controls muscle movement), however, currently has no radiation dose limit. nTMS is a
      non-invasive tool that uses sensors on a patient's muscle to trace the location in their
      brain that controls that muscle and is currently used by doctors to decide where to operate
      so as not to damage the motor nerves. nTMS may effectively help plan radiation treatment
      using SRS and help doctors decide on how much radiation can be used on motor nerves.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the use of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) in the
      radiation oncology clinic is feasible.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the relationship of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dosimetry and lesion
      involvement in the motor tracts identified using nTMS and the presence or absence of motor
      deficits evaluated by objective and subjective measures (Manual Ability Measure [MAM]-20,
      Euroqol [EQ]-5 Dimensional [D]-5 Level [L], and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]-Brain
      Tumor [BT] questionnaires).

      II. To determine if nTMS of contralateral motor tracts provides a viable internal control,
      considering handedness.

      III. To aid in the design of a prospective, randomized clinical trial that will limit
      radiation dose to brain metastases located in close proximity to the motor cortex with the
      goal of improving functional and quality of life outcomes measured by occupational therapy
      tasks and the MAM-20, EQ-5D-5L, and MDASI-BT questionnaires.

      IV. To explore the utility of electroencephalography (EEG) in correlation with nTMS and
      reported functional outcomes measured by occupational therapy tasks and the MAM-20, EQ-5D-5L,
      and MDASI-BT questionnaires.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo nTMS over 1 hour. Patients also perform 4 tasks that test grip and pinch
      strength and the ability to use and feel with their hands for 1 hour.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Will be determined to be operationally feasible on a patient if the images and data obtained from nTMS for the patient provide useful information to the radiation oncologist and if the radiation oncologist determines that this additional information would improve patient care. Will deem the use of nTMS to be operationally feasible overall if it is deemed operationally feasible on an underlying proportion of at least 90% potentially consented patients. Will calculate the proportions of operational and technical feasibility of the use of nTMS and their 80% confidence intervals (CIs). If the observed proportions are greater than or equal to 82%, the use of nTMS to be operationally and technically will be deemed feasible.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Will be determined to be technically feasible on a patient if the procedure of nTMS is able to be performed on the patient, resulting in mapped motor cortex data. If the patient is not able to complete the procedure for any reason, that patient's nTMS treatment will not be technically feasible. Will deem the use of nTMS to be technically feasible overall if it is deemed technically feasible on an underlying proportion of at least 90% potentially consented patients. Will calculate the proportions of operational and technical feasibility of the use of nTMS and their 80% CIs.
