  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a telephone interview form as a simple questionnaire with the
      original combination of Barthel Index and modified Rankin Scale. The main purpose of this
      study is to evaluate validity and reliability of the telephone interview form when compared
      with face-to-face assessment in clinically stable patients with stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Barthel Index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) have been widely used in stroke
      outcome assessment. The dimensionality of mRS is wider than BI while BI detailedly reveals
      the activity of daily living of patients. The content of these two scales are partly repeated
      as a result of intra-logical order.

      Besides, the information of patients could be obtained by means of application of telephone
      follow-up in clinical trials. It also could guarantee the blinding and agreement of rater.

      Therefore, the investigators developed a telephone interview form as a simple questionnaire
      with the original combination of BI and mRS. What's more, the investigators conduct this
      diagnostic test to evaluate validity and reliability of the telephone interview form when
      compared with face-to-face assessment in clinically stable patients with stroke.
