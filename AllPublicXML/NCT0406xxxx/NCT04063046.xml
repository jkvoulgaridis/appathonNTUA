    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare

        1. early prognosis (mortality, morbidity)

        2. changes in concentrations of serum syndecan-1,partial pressure of oxygen(on arterial
           blood gas analysis), perioperative transfusion, intraoperative vasopressor use between
           general anesthesia and nerve block in diabetic patients undergoing limb amputation
           surgery as a prospective randomized trial.
