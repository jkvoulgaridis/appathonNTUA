  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate an educational self-management
      intervention in 450 African American women and weight management. It will be the first to use
      a culturally tailored in-person and telephone approach to address all aspects of wellness and
      social determinants for African American women to achieve optimal long term wellness for both
      self and family.
