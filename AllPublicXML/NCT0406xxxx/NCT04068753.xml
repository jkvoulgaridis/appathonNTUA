    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of Niraparib and dostarlimab as a
      combination treatment and see what effects (good and bad) this combination treatment has on
      patients with recurrent or progressive cervix cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will have tests and exams to see if they are eligible for the clinical trial. If
      found eligible, the patient will receive treatment with Niraparib daily and dostarlimab by
      vein every three weeks for 4 cycles then every six weeks.

      Patients will receive the study treatment as long as there is evidence that the tumor is not
      growing or spreading and they are not having any unacceptable, bad side effects.

      Patients will be monitored during treatment with tests and exams and after treatment
      completion for up to 5 years.

             are stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, and have
             not been using steroids for at least 7 days prior to study treatment.
