      Protocol Summary

      Population - Target population is 10 adults (18 to 75 years of age) with a diagnosis of
      treatment-resistant epilepsy with at least 20 seizures per year, and whose seizure onset
      recorded from scalp EEG is localized to a brain region accessible by the subcutaneous EEG
      electrodes

      Number of sites - Three sites; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, University
      College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, St George's University Hospital NHS Foundation
      Trust

      Study design - This study is an observational, non-randomised, non-interventional study. It
      is not intended as a device trial. It is not intended to assess the device performance,
      rather the usefulness of bio-signals in seizure prediction and in detecting
      seizure-associated phenomena. There will be no change to usual care as a result of taking
      part.

      A subcutaneous EEG device will be implanted under local anaesthesia to record continuous EEG
      and a non-invasive wrist-worn sensor will be used to acquire non-EEG bio-signals (eg. heart
      activity and rate, movements, muscle activity, electrodermal activity, body temperature)

      Objectives - The association will be investigated between non-invasive measurable variables
      related to stress and sleep, semi-invasive subcutaneous EEG phenomena, and the occurrence of
      seizures. The predictive value of change in non-invasive variables semi-invasive subcutaneous
      EEG phenomena for the occurrence of seizures will be assessed.

      Study Duration - Up to one year for each patient. Participants may be approached during or
      after this study to participate in related studies.

      Funding - This study receives funding from the Epilepsy Foundation of America, Innovative
      Medicines Institute (IMI) and UNEEG medical A/S.

        We will recruit 10 suitable people with epilepsy referred, as part of their routine
        conventional care, to the Epilepsy Clinics at King's College Hospital (KCH), University
        College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (National Hospital for Neurology and
        Neurosurgery - NHNN), or St George's University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (SGH).
