  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is a prospective, single-center, dose-escalation safety, tolerability,
      feasibility and potential efficacy study of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in
      acute stroke patients with substantial salvageable penumbra due to a large vessel occlusion
      before and after endovascular therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, sham-controlled, dose-escalation study where cathodal tDCS is
      delivered to threatened but not yet irreversibly damaged (penumbral) tissue in patients with
      large vessel occlusion who are undergoing recanalization procedure. Patients will be
      randomized in a 3:1 design, to cathodal versus sham (control) stimulation, at each six
      designed dose tiers. The dose tiers will be increasing in both intensity and duration of the
      stimulation. All patients will be receiving the first dose (stimulation cycle) before the
      recanalization procedure and patients at dose tiers 3-6 will also be receiving stimulation
      cycles after the recanalization procedure ends.

      The occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage will determine the pace of the
      escalation through the dose tiers.

    <measure>Primary safety outcome- rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24-hour post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) is defined as an increase of 4 or more points on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) total score within 24 hours of stimulation associated with parenchymal hematoma type 1 (PH1), parenchymal hematoma type 2 (PH2), remote intraparenchymal hemorrhage (RIH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).
The NIHSS is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute stroke on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. A trained observer rates the patent's ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored with 3 to 5 grades with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items. Accordingly, 0 is the lowest and 42 is the highest total score possible. In the NIHSS, the higher the score, the more impaired a stroke patient is.</description>
