      This subject-masked, randomized, bilateral crossover study will compare the clinical
      performance and subjective acceptance of the somofilcon A 1 day soft contact lens with the
      nelfilcon A daily disposable lens when used on a daily wear, daily disposable basis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, subject-masked, crossover, bilateral study, controlled by
      cross-comparison. This will compare the clinical performance and subjective acceptance of the
      somofilcon A 1 day soft contact lens with the nelfilcon A daily disposable lens when used on
      a daily wear, daily disposable basis.

      Subjects will use each lens type for a week in random sequence. Follow-up visits for each
      lens will be performed after one week of wear. Lenses will be worn on a daily wear, daily
      disposable wear schedule.

             Statement of Informed Consent.

          -  They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

          -  They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of this
             study.

          -  They have a contact lens spherical prescription between -1.00 to - 6.00D (inclusive)

          -  They have a maximum of -1.00DC ocular astigmatism in each eye.

          -  They can be satisfactorily fitted with the study lens types.

          -  At dispensing, they can attain at least 0.20 logMAR distance high contrast visual
             acuity in each eye with the study lenses within the available power range.

          -  They currently use soft contact lenses or have done so in the previous six months.

          -  They are willing to comply with the wear schedule (at least five days per week and for
             at least eight hours per day).

          -  They own a wearable pair of spectacles.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          -  They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          -  They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.

          -  They have had cataract surgery.

          -  They have had corneal refractive surgery.

          -  They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or
             have keratoconus.

          -  They are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel, or they have any
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic
             reaction.

          -  They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or
             research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.

          -  They currently wear either the clariti 1day or the DAILIES AquaComfort Plus lens.
