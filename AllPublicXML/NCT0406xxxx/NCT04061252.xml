    <measure>Change from baseline in Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) total score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PPPASI is composed of subscores of erythema (E), pustules/vesicles (P), desquamation/scales (D) on the left (L) and right (R) palm (P) and sole (S) respectively. PPPASI is calculated by the following calculation formula.
PPPASI=(E+P+D) Area*0.2 (RP)+(E+P+D) Area*0.2 (LP)+ (E+P+D) Area*0.3 (RS)+(E+P+D) Area*0.3 (LS).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Palmoplantar Pustulosis Severity Index (PPP-SI) total score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>(PPP-SI) total score at Week 16. PPP-SI assesses the severity of palmoplantar pustulosis skin lesions and response to therapy. Scores can range from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of participants who achieved at least 50% improvement in PPPASI score from Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of participants who achieved at least 75% improvement in PPPASI score from Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of participants who achieved a Physician's Global Assessment(PGA) score of 0 or 1 at Week 16</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in PPPASI total score at each assessment time point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68</time_frame>

    <measure>Change from baseline in PPP-SI total score at each assessment time point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score at each evaluation point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, 16, 24, 32, 44, 56, 68</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a skin disease-specific scale that assesses the impact of skin symptoms on QOL during the past 7 days and consists of 10 questions relating to &quot;symptoms and feelings&quot;, &quot;daily activities&quot;, &quot;leisure&quot;, &quot;work and employment&quot;, &quot;personal relationship&quot;, and &quot;treatment&quot;. The DLQI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 30. Higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>
