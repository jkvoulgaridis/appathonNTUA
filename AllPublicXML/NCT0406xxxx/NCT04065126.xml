    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of a 10-session physical activity intervention for trauma
      afflicted refugees. Half of participants will receive this 10-session physical activity
      intervention and half of the participants will be allocated to the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity, particularly when performed in social settings, has been found to
      constitute an effective stress reliever and has been associated with improved physical and
      mental well-being, functional capacity and overall life satisfaction, as well as decreased
      risk of lifestyle diseases in various populations. Physical activity can also revert symptoms
      of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, social isolation and dissociation,
      which is common among trauma afflicted refugees. Many refugees also suffer from PTSD, and so
      the investigator's aim is to evaluate what effect a 10-session physical activity intervention
      will have on the mental and physical health of trauma afflicted refugees in a northern
      European country. The sessions will include physical exercise as well as psychoeducational
      components, and will be held by a physiotherapist over a period of ten weeks. The physical
      activity intervention group will be compared to a control-group, who receives two brief
      lectures on psycho-education in connection to baseline-assessment and follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in symptoms of PTSD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, three months, and six months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in symptoms of PTSD assessed by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). In HTQ, the first 16 symptoms from section IV are used to identify individuals with PTSD. The items, which refer to how specific symptoms have bothered or distressed the individual during the last week, have four response alternatives ranging from 'not at all' (1) to 'very much' (4). Mean item scores are calculated and the mean item score of 2.06 are used to distinguish cases of PTSD from non-cases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, three months, and six months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in emotional distress (depression and anxiety) assessed by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25, 25 items). HSCL-25 consists of 10 anxiety and 15 depression items. The items, which refer to how specific symptoms have bothered or distressed the individual during the last week, have four response alternatives ranging from 'not at all' (1) to 'very much' (4). Individual mean item scores will be calculated separately for the anxiety and depression subscales. Respondents with a mean item score above 1.80 and 1.75 classifies as having depression or anxiety, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, three months, and six months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in subjective well-being (SWB) assessed by WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5) (5 items). WHO-5 contains five statements of the type 'I have felt happy and in a good mood' and the response alternatives range from 'all the time' (5) to 'never' (0) in relation to the last 2 weeks. The highest possible value of that scale is 100, as the total score is multiplied by a factor of four. Those with values below 50 are classified as having low SWB.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, three months, and six months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in general health, health-related quality of life, assessed by the EuroQol 5 dimenstions, 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) (5 items). This instrument consists of a descriptive system including the following five dimensions: mobility, self‐care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, and each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The respondent's answer on each of the five dimensions results in a one-digit number indicating the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions are combined in a five-digit number describing the respondent's health state. The health states may be converted into a single index value between zero and one, where zero being equal to death and one being equal to a state of perfect health.</description>
