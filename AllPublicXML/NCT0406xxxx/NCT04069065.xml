      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of conversion to TacroBell

      This study is a multi-center, non-comparative, and phase IV clinical trial that evaluates the
      efficacy and safety of conversion to TacroBell slow-release cap.(Once-daily Tacrolimus) in
      patients who have undergone at least one year after liver transplantation and receive
      maintenance therapy with Twice-Daily Tacrolimus.

      Enrolled subjects will take TacroBell slow-release cap.(Once-daily Tacrolimus) for 24 weeks
      and will conduct scheduled tests with four additional visits.

The first dose is converted to approximately 100% of the existing daily dose, taking into account the subject's blood concentration, after which the investigator check the blood concentration of tacrolimus at each visit and adjust the dose to achieve the blood concentration maintaining at 3~10ng/ml.</description>
