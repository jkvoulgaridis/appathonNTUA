  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to demonstrate the
      efficacy and safety of lixivaptan in subjects with ADPKD. Approximately 2000 subjects with
      ADPKD meeting the entry criteria will be screened in order to randomize 1200 subjects to
      lixivaptan or placebo in a 2:1 ratio in this study. After meeting entry criteria during a 2-4
      week screening period (that may extend up to 8 weeks), subjects will enter a 1-week
      single-blind placebo run-in period to obtain certain baseline measurements followed by a 3-6
      week single-blind dose titration period during which lixivaptan administered twice daily will
      be titrated to a dose that is tolerated and results in a reduced trough urine osmolality (or
      the maximum dose level). The minimum dose to enter the Double-blind, Randomized Treatment
      Period is 100 mg twice a day (BID). Those subjects successfully titrated and tolerating the
      drug will then be randomized (2:1) to either continue lixivaptan or switch immediately to
      matching placebo in a double-blind manner. Randomization will be stratified for Chronic
      Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage, hypertension status, age, and region. Double-blind treatment will
      continue for 52 weeks after which study drug will be held, and final assessments obtained
      during 3 visits starting on the 8th day after the last dose of double-blind study drug and
      lasting up to the 21st day.
