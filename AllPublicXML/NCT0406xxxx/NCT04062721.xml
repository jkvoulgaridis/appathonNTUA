    <textblock>
      The LICoRN-01 trial is a single-arm phase Ib/II study that will assess the efficacy and
      safety of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) plus in situ immunomodulation by hydrogel combining a
      TLR agonist and GM-CSF in patients with unresectable colorectal (CRC) liver metastases.

      Primary objective: progression free survival (PFS) rate at 12 months (RECISTv1.1 criteria,
      thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT-scan Q8W).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  to assess the safety profile;

        -  to assess the median PFS;

        -  to assess the response rate;

        -  to assess PFS and response according to iRECIST vs. RECIST v1.1 criteria;

        -  to assess overall survival (OS);

        -  to assess predictive markers of response (imaging, tumor, blood).

    <textblock>
      Early clinical trials of immunotherapy in CRC have provided first evidence of activity of
      adoptive cell vaccines combining inactivated autologous tumor cells and BCG, a Toll Like
      Receptor (TLR) agonist. RFA induces tumor cell necrosis and apoptosis, leading to the
      activation of anti-tumoral immunity through the release, exposure or denaturation of tumor
      antigens, which are captured by dendritic cells. Associated pro-inflammatory effects increase
      the anti-tumoral immune response but remain insufficient to avoid recurrence. In a
      preclinical study in an aggressive rectal cancer model, complete and long-lasting tumor
      responses were achieved after RFA combined with in situ injection of an immunomodulatory
      hydrogel combining a TLR agonist and GM-CSF. These results were obtained without further
      adjuvant therapy after complete clearance of macroscopic liver lesions by RFA. BCG, Purified
      Protein Derivatives (PPD), Polysaccharide Typhoid (Typhim Vi®) can be used as TLR agonists.
      The hypothesis of the study is that local immunotherapy may reduce recurrence rates after RFA
      in patients with unresectable liver metastases from CRC.

      Thermal ablation by RFA may be used as an inducer of anti-tumor immune response and the
      combination with immunomodulators such as a TLR agonist (BCG, PPD, Typhim Vi) and GM-CSF may
      improve its efficacy. In the recent preclinical study, the efficacy has been demonstrated on
      distant lesions (so called abscopal effect) of two immunomodulators combined in a
      muco-adherent hydrogel, injected in a RFA-treated tumor. The treatment was safe, without
      complication observed in the 50 treated mice. Complete macroscopic ablation by RFA combined
      with in situ immunomodulators may be able to prime an effective immune response capable of
      eradicating the microscopic residual disease.

      The LICoRN-01 study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of RFA with in
      situ immunomodulation in patients with unresectable CRC liver metastases.
