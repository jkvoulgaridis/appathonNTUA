  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) refers to a particular type of attention focused on
      the present moment, non-judgmental awareness, and acceptance of that experience with openness
      and curiosity. Mindfulness training was designed to enhance the range and use of coping
      skills, decrease levels of stress, improve mood, and reduce tendencies to react in
      maladaptive ways 1-3. Investigators are evaluating a new program, called the Mindfulness
      Based Dementia-Care (MBDC) in caregivers (CG) for dementia, which combines the traditional
      approaches with education. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the program and
      explore the potential benefits of the Mindfulness Based Dementia-Care (MBDC) program.
      Investigators are conducting a prospective, pre-post, observational study with members
      participating in the MBDC program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pre-post scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores on a total score. The range of the PSS is 0-40 points. A lower score is indicative of lower stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in pre-post scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D scores on a total score. The range of the CES-D is 0-60 points. A higher score is indicative of the presence of more depression symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pre-post scores on the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SCS scores on a mean score. The range of the SCS is 1-5 points. A higher score is indicative higher self-compassion.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pre-post scores on the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS Sleep Scale scores on a total score. The range of the scale is 0-100 points. A higher score is indicative higher sleep disturbance.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pre-post scores on the Resilience Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Resilience Scale scores on a total score. The range of The Resilience Scale is 14-98 points. A higher score is indicative of higher resilience.</description>

    <measure>Change in pre-post scores on the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale scores on a total score. The range of the Zarit range is 0-88 points. A higher score is indicative of the presence of a higher level of caregiver burden.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pre-post scores on the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief COPE scores on fourteen subscale mean scores. The range of the Brief COPE range is 0-7 points for each subscale. Higher scores indicate increased utilization of that specific coping strategy.</description>
