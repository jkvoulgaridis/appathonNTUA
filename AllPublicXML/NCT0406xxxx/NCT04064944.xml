  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is one common demyelinating disease of the
      central nervous system in young adults, with high rate of disability and recurrence, and poor
      natural course, which can cause a serious burden on families and society. To today, there is
      still a lack of prospective, multi-center, large sample clinical trial evidence for the
      treatment and prognosis of acute attack of NMOSD patients. This study will conduct a
      prospective, multi-center, single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial of acute
      attacked NMOSD patients in China. The researchers plan to collect 144 NMOSD patients with
      acute attack in three research centers of Guangzhou (the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun
      Yat-sen University, the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center of Sun Yat-sen University, and the
      Guangdong 999 Brain hospital), to study the safety and efficacy of immunoadsorption therapy.

      The subjects will be randomized into immunoadsorption group and plasma exchange group, and
      the following indicators will be evaluated: (1) changes in EDSS scores and visual acuity
      before and after treatment; (2) changes in AQP4-IgG levels; (3) the safety of
      immunoadsorption treatment.

      This study is aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of immunoadsorption therapy for
      acute attack of refractory NMOSD patients, and to provide more sufficient clinical evidence
      for the therapy selection for acute phase of NMOSD patients.
