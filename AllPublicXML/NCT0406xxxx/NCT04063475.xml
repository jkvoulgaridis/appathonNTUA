      fixation of FGG with sutures alone is not sufficient,we use cyanoacrylate beside sutures for
      fixation

      Inadequate zone of attached mucosa around implants, gingival recession, inadequate ridge
      width or height despite there is enouph bone for implant placement are problems that face
      periodontists and can be treated by soft tissue graft Studies have demonstrated the
      importance of the tissues stability for the first hours when support is provided by
      underlying osseous or dental structures.

      Movement of the graft during mastication and phonation will disturb healing procedures. Most
      of the clinicians prefer a protective device during the healing phase.

      Transitional dentures are not stable themselves, and hence are not suitable for stabilizing.

      Circummandibular wiring and impact posts are seemingly very aggressive for patients and need
      extra clinical practices, skills, and equipment.

      Studies proved that the maximum tissue shrinkage (approximately 20%-40%) occurs during the
      first 3 months post operation and will proceed until 12 postsurgical months with a
      persistent, significantly lower rate.

      In this study we give more stabilization for free gingival grafts by using cyanoacrylate
      tissue adhesive beside sutures Its autogenous character, maintenance of keratinization,
      predictability, ease of technique tlead CTG to be accepted as the golden standard to increase
      attached gingival dimensions Cyanoacrylate is a simple, inexpensive haemostatic and
      biocompatible material It is used as tissue adhesives in paediatric surgery general surgery
      and also dentistry.

      it has been applied intraorally with different purposes such as periodontal dressing,for
      sealing sinus membrane perforations for stabilizing bone fragments during fracture fixation,
      and in closing peripheral nerve anastomosis it seems promising in the intraoral field due to
      their strong sealing, bacteriostatic, and hemostatic properties. Multiple studies examined
      the use of cyanoacrylate glues as an alternative to suturing intraoral and extraoral wounds
      concluding that cyanoacrylates are faster, more reliable ,and less painful and cause better
      hemostasis .
