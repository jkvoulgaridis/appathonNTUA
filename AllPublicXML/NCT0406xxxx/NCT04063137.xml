  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diabetes epidemic is a pertinent concern globally. The prevalence of this metabolic
      disease among adults had been disclosed by the World health Organisation (WHO), reporting a
      total of 422 million diabetic adults and 3.7 million diabetic deaths in 2016, with Asian
      countries contributing more than 60% of the world's diabetic population. Due to its economic
      and social repercussions, preventive strategies are implemented at a population level. The
      implementation of a diet low in glycaemic index (GI) has been widely adopted as part of
      diabetes management strategies to prevent and control Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) as the
      consumption of food with low GI has shown to improve glycaemic control, lipid profile, and
      reduce systemic inflammation. Other strategies include adopting an active lifestyle and the
      consumption of functional foods. In lieu of this, the composition of food products may be
      altered by incorporating edible plant-based functional components with
      carbohydrase-inhibiting properties. Black rice has been proposed as a viable source of
      functional ingredients, namely anthocyanins, not only because of its potential benefits to
      health that has been established by numerous in-vitro studies, but also it is easily sourced
      for in Asia as it is widely cultivated.

      In this study, black rice anthocyanin-fortified bread serves as a replacement to white bread
      as the staple to the subject's diet, in a mixed meal setting. The fortified bread is
      hypothesised to improve glycemic responses over white bread, offering a lower GI food
      alternative to the conventional staple.

      Black rice anthocyanin-fortified bread, compared to white bread as a control, is hypothesised
      to improve glycaemic control and serum lipid profiles in a mixed meal setting. The aim of
      this research is to to assess the influence of black rice anthocyanin on postprandial blood
      glucose and insulinemic responses, and lipid profiles.

      The aim of the research is to contribute to the prevention of diabetes by investigating how
      the incorporation of functional ingredients in carbohydrate-based foods will influence
      glycaemic and lipid panel profiles in a mixed meal setting. A human in-vivo intervention
      study will be conducted to assess the glycaemic and lipid responses of anthocyanin-fortified
      bread as compared to white bread, served with a ground beef patty to simulate the mixed meal.
      The approximate time to complete study recruitment will be 4 weeks.

      Healthy, non-smoking subjects aged 21 to 65 will be recruited in this study. There will be a
      total of 2 visits (excluding 1 screening session), with the duration of each visit
      approximately 4-5 h. The study procedures will be conducted in Investigational Medicine Unit
      (IMU). During the each visit, subjects will undergo a mixed meal tolerance test. Test foods
      will be freshly prepared on the day of the visit in Food Science amp; Technology Programme
      food preparation area situated at Block S14 level 5, Science Drive 2, using food-grade
      ingredients. Only small quantities of bread will be prepared each day (3 to 4). The subject's
      glycemic response to the control meal (white bread) will be compared to their response after
      consumption of anthocyanin-fortified bread in a mixed meal setting. An improvement in
      postprandial blood glucose response and lipid panel profiles in response to the mixed meals
      will show that the anthocyanin-fortification is effective in offering better control over
      glycaemic and lipid profiles.
