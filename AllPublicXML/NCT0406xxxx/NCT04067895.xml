  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is to document the application of human bone graft in the surgical
      treatment (epiphysiodesis) of leg length discrepancy or primordial gigantism and its
      subsequent healing process.

    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a vertical line, 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extremes (0mm = very satisfied - 100mm = not satisfied at all). A higher score indicates less satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Knee Outcome Survey - Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The KOS ADL score includes 14 questions and is divided in 2 subscales, symptoms (6 items, max. score 30) and functional restrictions (8 items, max. score 40). The scores of the answers range from 0 to 5 points. 0 points mean no impairment of everyday activities, while 5 points represent the greatest possible impairment. All points are summed up.
From this, the KOS-ADL score is calculated as the proportion of the total response points from the possible maximum score (70) in percent. KOS ADL Score [%] = ( symptoms pts. + functional restrictions pts.)*100/70. The percentage ranges from 0-100%. 0% means no impairment, while 100% represents the greatest possible impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC Score contains 19 questions (7 questions for symptomatology, 10 concerning function, 2 about sport activity). The lowest function level or the highest symptom level receives the score value 1. The highest function level or the lowest symptom level is given the number n according to the number n of possible answers. With the exception of question 10 &quot;Functioning before knee injury&quot;, the remaining 18 response points are summed up. This gives the &quot;raw sum&quot;. The lowest possible score is 18 and the maximum possible score is 87. The raw sum is converted into a scale of 0 to 100 using the following formula: ((raw score - lowest possible score)/score range)*100. 0 points mean the greatest possible impairment, while 100 points mean complete freedom from symptoms and functioning. The IKDC score can only be calculated if at least 16 of the 18 questions have been answered.</description>

    <measure>Revised questionnaire to assess Health-Related Quality of Life in children and adolescents (KINDL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The KINDL is a generic instrument for assessing Health-Related Quality of Life in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older. There are 3 versions available for different age groups: Kiddy-KINDL 4-6 years, Kid-KINDL 7-13 years, Kiddo-KINDL 14-17 years. The questionnaires used in this study (Kid-KINDL and Kiddo-KINDL) provide 24 Likert-scaled items associated with 6 dimensions: physical well-being ,emotional well-being, self-esteem, family, friends, and school. All versions also contain an additional section 'disease' with 6 items. They can be completed in case of illness or hospitalization. The items and sub-scales are calculated according to the KINDL manual and a higher score corresponds to a higher health-related quality of life.</description>
