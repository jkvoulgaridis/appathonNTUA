    <textblock>
      The presence of lymph node metastases has a large impact on prognosis and treatment in
      head‐and neck cancer (HNC) patients and necessitates treatment intensification. However,
      despite increased spatial resolution of current imaging techniques, around 20% of patients
      with a pre‐operative clinically negative neck will have occult metastases in the neck
      dissection specimen. It is therefore that, when patients are treated with radiotherapy, the
      neck is almost always included in the target volume, also when the tumor is clinically staged
      N0 (elective neck treatment). As a consequence, large tissue volumes must be treated
      resulting in significant morbidity such as mucositis, dysphagia, xerostomia and on the long
      term also hypothyroidism and vascular damage.

      If the detection of small lymph node metastases can be improved elective neck treatment may
      be avoided in at least part of the patients resulting in less toxicity and improved quality
      of life. One promising approach is the sentinel node procedure. Thus far, the sentinel node
      procedure is not employed in patients with larynx and pharynx cancers that are treated with
      primary radiotherapy. One reason is that these tumors are not easily accessible for tracer
      injection and this needs to be done under general anesthesia. However, in the past few years
      there has been progress with instrumentation via flexible endoscopy. The ENT-department of
      Radboudumc has developed expertise with endoscopic biopsy taking and even laser surgery of
      pharynx and larynx cancers.

      The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of sentinel lymph node identification
      in pharynx and larynx cancers using flexible endoscopy-guided tracer injection.

    <measure>Generation of SPECT-images of sufficient quality for localization of the sentinel node(s) after peritumoral Tc-99m-nanocolloid injection guided by flexible endoscopy.</measure>
    <time_frame>The data of each patient will be assessed within 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>All SPECT images will be assessed qualitatively by concerted consensus between a nuclear medicine physician, head and neck surgeons and a radiation oncologist. Aspects that will be evaluated include:
Is there sufficient uptake of tracer for identification and localization of lymph nodes?
Does tracer uptake in primary tumor interfere with lymph node identification?
Is sentinel lymph node localization consistent with what can be expected with normal, undisturbed lymph node drainage and what is known from the literature?</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of administering at least 2 peritumoral Tc-99m-nanocolloid injections during one procedure of flexible endoscopy.</measure>
    <time_frame>The data of each patient will be assesses within 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The procedure will be documented on video and will be reviewed by the investigational team for accuracy of tracer injections and learning purposes.</description>

    <measure>Comparison between sentinel nodes identified by SPECT and sentinel nodes identified by routine CT or MRI.</measure>
    <time_frame>The data of each patient will be assesses within 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>All SPECT and CT or MR images will be assessed qualitatively by concerted consensus between a nuclear medicine physician, head and neck surgeons and a radiation oncologist. For this outcome measure the following aspect is visually evaluated: can the lymph nodes identified as sentinel nodes by SPECT also be localized on routine diagnostic imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound)?</description>

    <description>Flexible endoscopy will be performed by one of two experienced head and neck surgeons. Inspection of larynx and pharynx will be performed to determine the extensions of the tumor in all directions. After local anesthesia, 2-4 peritumoral injections of Tc-99m-nanocolloïd will be given. Ten minutes after injection of Tc-99m-nanocolloïd a SPECT scan will be performed.</description>
