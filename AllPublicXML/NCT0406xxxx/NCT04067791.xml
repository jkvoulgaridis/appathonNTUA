  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study comparing the pharmacokinetics of prolonged-release melatonin versus standard,
      immediate-release melatonin. Multiple blood draws over a 10-hour period will be analysed to
      determine the area under the curve, time to peak concentration, peak concentration,
      absorption rate constant, elimination rate constant, absorption half-life, and elimination
      half-life. Vital signs, hematology parameters, clinical chemistry parameters, and incidence
      of adverse events are also analysed.
