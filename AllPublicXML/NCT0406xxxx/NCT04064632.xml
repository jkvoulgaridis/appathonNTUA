  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates efficacy and safety of rilpivirine as substitutive agent for the
      nucleosidic backbone of HAART in virologic suppressed patients when combined with
      cobicistat-boosted darunavir.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HAART is generally based on the combination of three active drugs. Two of them, usually
      defined the backbone, belong to the nucleosidic analogues class (NRTI). In the last years,
      drugs of this class have been associated to several long-term adverse events of HAART such as
      lipoatrophy, cardiovascular diseases, bone and kidney toxicity. Furthermore the need of a
      triple drug regimen has recently been questioned as maintenance therapy in well controlled
      chronically treated subjects. In this setting, less drug regimens (LDR) have been proposed.
      LDR would allow a reduced exposure to drugs and eventually limit drug-drug interactions,
      drug-related toxicities and would allow treatment simplification so to enhance HAART
      acceptability, tolerability and persistence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written signed and dated informed consent to participate in the study must be given by
             the subject, in accordance with the International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH)
             Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline E627 and applicable regulations, before
