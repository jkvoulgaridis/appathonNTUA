  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether concomitant treatment with Lokelma can improve the efficacy of
      standard blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with type 2 diabetes, diabetic
      nephropathy and hyperkalemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy, especially patients with impaired kidney
      function, frequently encounter hyperkalemia as an adverse effect of RAAS blocking treatment.
      Consequently, RAAS blocking treatment is reduced or discontinued, which in turn impairs
      prognosis in terms of long-term renal and cardiovascular outcome. Not only can hyperkalemia
      as an adverse event lead to changes in RAAS blocking treatment, the presence of persistent
      potassium levels in the upper part of the normal range can impair the efficacy of the RAAS
      blocking treatment, another reason to expect a beneficial effect of Lokelma treatment.

      The study is a multicentre (3 sites in Sweden (TBD), 2 sites in Denmark (Steno Diabetes
      Center Copenhagen and Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde), double-blind, randomized
      placebo-controlled, parallel study. The study drug is compared to matching placebo that
      cannot be distinguished from active drug. The treatment period is 12 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

          2. Female and/or male patients with type 2 diabetes aged 18-85 years

          3. Persistent macroalbuminuria (UACR ≥ 200 mg/g in at least two out of the three latest
             UACR measurements in subject history).

          4. Chronic (at least 1 month) stable RAAS blocking treatment, i.e maximum tolerated
             (individually defined by investigator) dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB at time of
             inclusion.

          5. Documented hyperkalemia (plasma potassium ≥ 5.0 mmol/l) at least once in the 90 days
             prior to inclusion in the study.

          6. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) for female subjects of childbearing
             potential.

          7. Female subjects must be 1 year post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using an

             (from the time they sign consent) and for 3 months after the last dose of
             Lokelma/matching placebo to prevent pregnancy. In addition, oral contraceptives,
             approved contraceptive implant, long-term injectable contraception, intrauterine
             device, or tubal ligation are allowed. Oral contraception alone is not acceptable;
