  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well encorafenib and binimetinib given with or without
      nivolumab works in treating patients with BRAF V600 mutation positive thyroid cancer that has
      spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and does not respond to radioiodine treatment
      (refractory). Encorafenib and binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      nivolumab, may help the body?s immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The trial aims to find out if the combination of
      encorafenib and binimetinib, with and without study nivolumab, is a safe and effective way to
      treat metastatic radioiodine refractory thyroid cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall rate of response among study participants treated with the
      combination of encorafenib and binimetinib, with or without nivolumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) among study participants treated with the
      combination of encorafenib and binimetinib with or without nivolumab.

      II. To assess the overall survival (OS) among study participants treated with the combination
      of encorafenib and binimetinib with or without nivolumab.

      III. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR). IV. To evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of study participants treated with the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib with or
      without nivolumab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive encorafenib PO QD and binimetinib PO BID as in arm I. Patients also
      receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles with nivolumab repeat
      every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for up to 12 months.

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of randomization up to 6 months from first dose of study drugs</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 criteria. ORR at 6 months will be assessed using the efficacy evaluable analysis set. A point and 90% exact binomial confidence interval will be provided for each arm.</description>

    <time_frame>From date of randomization until either tumor progression (per RECIST v1.1) or death, assessed for up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate PFS and the summary statistics (e.g., 12-month survival, median survival, 95% confidence intervals) will be provided for each arm.</description>

    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first documented CR or PR up to first documented progression or death due to any cause, assessed for up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate DOR, and the summary statistics (e.g., 12-month survival, median survival, 95% confidence intervals) will be provided for each arm. DOR will be estimated only among responders (i.e. participants achieving at least once CR or PR). Data visualization tools such as waterfall plots (% change in tumor size) or swimmer plot (DOR) will be used to display the data.</description>

    <description>Will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. Using the safety evaluable analysis set, the incidence of having grade &gt;= 3 adverse events will be determined for study participants that received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. The point estimate and 95% confidence interval will be reported for each arm.</description>
