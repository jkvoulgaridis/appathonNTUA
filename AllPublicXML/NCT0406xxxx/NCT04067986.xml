      To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab combined with Apatinib in the
      treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer and colorectal cancer.

      The 62 patients were enrolled in a 2-week regimen with 200mg Camrelizumab given intravenously
      every two weeks and 250mg apatinib mesylate every 4 weeks for a treatment cycle until
      progressive or intolerable，then the objective remission rate(ORR) was calculated.
