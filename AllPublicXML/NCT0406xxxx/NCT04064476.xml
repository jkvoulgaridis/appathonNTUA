      This is a 49 weeks prospective, non-interventional cohort study. To observe the effect of
      long-acting injection antipsychotic(LAI), paliperidone palmitate on prevention of recurrence

      This is a 49 weeks prospective, observational cohort study. Wuhan initiated a project to
      improve the LAI treatment in schizophrenia patient with violence risk. This observational
      study will build the cohort of schizophrenia patient with violence risk and treated with LAI
      paliperidone palmitate. The effect of long-acting antipsychotic, paliperidone palmitate, will
      be observed on prevention of recurrence and symptom control in these patients. safety
      information and laboratory tests result will also be collected. This study can be extended
      according to the implementation of the project and extended follow-up time.

Each face is displayed for 200ms and then immediately covered up to prevent residual processing of the image. The participant must select which emotion the face displayed from 6 options (sadness, happiness, fear, anger, disgust or surprise). The outcome measures for ERT cover percentages and numbers correct or incorrect and overall response latencies, which can be looked at either across individual emotions or across all emotions at once.</description>

    <measure>Toronto Alexithymia Scale(TAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>49 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the TAS is a 20-item instrument that commonly used measures of alexithymia. It is a self-report scale that is comprised of 20 items. Items are rated using a 5-point Likert scale whereby 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. There are 5 items that are negatively keyed (items 4, 5, 10, 18 and 19). The total alexithymia score is the sum of responses to all 20 items, while the score for each subscale factor is the sum of the responses to that subscale. The TAS-20 uses cutoff scoring: equal to or less than 51 = non-alexithymia, equal to or greater than 61 = alexithymia. Scores of 52 to 60 = possible alexithymia.</description>
