  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM) is a rare type of slow growing lymphoma. It develops
      when white blood cells grow abnormally.

      Typically a disease of the elderly, the median age of presentation is &gt;70 years and the
      current treatment for WM is unsatisfactory, with incomplete responses and inevitable
      recurrence. Therefore there is a need to find alternative treatments that are more effective,
      leading to lasting responses and improved quality of life.

      The RAINBOW study is a phase 2-3 trial assessing 'chemotherapy free' treatment as primary
      therapy for WM which can potentially improve response outcome, durability and importantly,
      reduce toxicity for WM patients. This approach will be done using the drug Ibrutinib, which
      in combination with rituximab (RI) will be the experimental arm. As there is no agreed
      standard on first-line therapy for WM, the control arm is the current treatment based on the
      most recently published clinical trial results. The control arm consists of rituximab,
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (DCR), and is widely recommended by international
      consensus as appropriate treatment for first-line therapy for WM.

      In this study, 148 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with treatment naïve WM will be randomised on a
      1:1 ratio to either the treatment or control arm.

      Randomised treatment lasts for a maximum of 6 cycles and response will be assessed following
      3 cycles of treatment and completion of randomised treatment at approximately 24 weeks after
      commencing treatment. RI patients may then have up to 5 years of Ibrutinib monotherapy.

      Patients will be seen regularly during treatment and then every 3 months for 5 years after
      treatment discontinuation. Patients will enter annual follow up for survival until the end of
      trial (including progressed patients).

      The study will be conducted at NHS hospitals and is expected to last 9 years and 6 months.
