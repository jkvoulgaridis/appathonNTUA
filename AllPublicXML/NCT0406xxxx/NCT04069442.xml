  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The response rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors remains relatively low and the
      identification of the new predictive biomarkers is necessary. The rare population of cDC1 is
      very interesting, as its mouse counterparts is essential for the cross presentation of
      tumor-associated antigens, tumor immunity and response to immunotherapies. Their role in
      humans has not been studied. This proposal aims to study the prognostic role of cDC1 in a
      cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC, possibly demonstrating their positive predictive
      value of immune checkpoint inhibitors response.

      Multicenter study aiming to collect patient's clinical data retrospectively and their
      histological samples prospectively.

      The cohort will include:

        -  30 patients PD-L1 &gt; 50% treated with pembrolizumab in first line and having a
           progression free survival ≥ 3 months

        -  30 patients PD-L1 &gt; 50% treated with pembrolizumab in first line and having a
           progression free survival &lt; 3 months

        -  30 patients PD-L1 &lt; 50% treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy in first line
