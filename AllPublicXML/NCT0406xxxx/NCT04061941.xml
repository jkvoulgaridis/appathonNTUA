  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Hong Kong, methamphetamine use is common and cocaine use has increased steadily over the
      past few years. While the use of ketamine decreased from 35.8% in 2015 to 13.9% in 2017,
      methamphetamine and cocaine have become the most commonly used psychotropic substances and
      account for more than 50% of drug abuses cases in 2017. Among all stimulants, methamphetamine
      is most commonly used because it releases three times more dopamine than cocaine and the
      effects can last from eight to twelve hours, compared to two hours for cocaine. On top of its
      extreme effects, methamphetamine is relatively inexpensive, making it even more accessible to
      the young population.

      Misuse of methamphetamine has long been associated with profound psychological and cognitive
      disturbance. In reviewing the cognitive data from reasonably well-matched groups of chronic
      methamphetamine users and healthy controls, the majority of studies have found that chronic
      methamphetamine users had lower scores on at least some cognitive tests, although some
      studies are exceptions with entirely nonsignificant differences. A meta-analysis of 17
      cross-sectional studies found that chronic methamphetamine users demonstrated significantly
      lower cognitive scores than healthy controls. The effects were largest for measures of
      learning, executive functions, memory, and processing speed, although the majority of
      cognitive domains significantly differed between the groups.

      Concerns has been emerging regarding the methodology of the aforementioned results. In
      particular, the appropriateness of using healthy controls to examine the cognitive effects of
      stimulant use has been questioned. Much of the published research has fallen victim to using
      controls with significant baseline differences from the chronic stimulant users, such as
      years of education. In addition, none of the studies available provided scatter plots of
      their cognitive data to evaluate the overlap in performance between chronic stimulant users
      and healthy controls. In fact, many chronic stimulant users have normal cognitive function
      when compared with normative data. Therefore, the use of the term 'impairment' or 'deficit'
      in many studies is not fully justified. Another limitation is that it cannot differentiate
      cognitive weaknesses that may predate stimulant use from those that result from it. Notably,
      longitudinal studies have shown that childhood deficits in executive function can predict
      drug abuse in adolescence, suggesting that at least some of the cognitive weaknesses
      pre-exist in chronic stimulant user. These and other limitations provoked a conclusion that
      the evidence for cognitive deficits in chronic stimulant users is weak.

      In order to overcome the methodological issues observed in previous cross-sectional studies,
      we propose to conduct a prospective studies to determine the change in cognitive function
      among stimulant users over time.
