  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is widely used in men with prostate cancer (PCa) to delay
      disease progression and enhance survival. The use of ADT is often associated with a vast
      spectrum of side effects that considerably reduce quality of life. Exercise has been proposed
      as a non-pharmacological strategy to counter some adverse effects of ADT among patients with
      PCa. Particularly, recreational football-based interventions have been suggested as an
      enjoyment approach to involve patients with PCa in regular exercise practice. Given its
      intermittent nature and vigorous efforts, adverse events associated with recreational
      football practice have been reported. To handle this issue and to involve patients with PCa
      in recreational football practice, walking football has emerged as a more suitable exercise
      modality

      This study was design as a randomized controlled trial, with two study arms, which aims to
      analyse the feasibility, safety of a supervised walking football program in patients with
      PCa. Moreover, the effects on health-related quality of life; bone mineral density; body
      composition; physical fitness; physical activity levels; inflammatory and metabolic profile;
      cognitive function; and cost-effectiveness will be complementarily analysed.

      Recruitment will be conducted by invitation of Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho
      (CHVNG/E; Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal, E.P.E) oncologists and urologists. Patients who agree
      to participate in this study will be referred to a study coordinator (medical oncologist) and
      will be randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to one of the two study-arms.

      In addition to standard PCa care, patients in the interventional group (IG) will perform 3
      times per week a supervised Walking Football Program over 16 weeks and plus 16 additional
      weeks.

      Patients allocated to control group (CG) will receive standard PCa medical care and will be
      instructed to maintain daily-life routines. After the first 16 weeks, the control group
      patients' will be invited to join and preform the exercise intervention (additional 16
      weeks).

      Walking football exercise sessions will be conducted on an indoor sports hall, supervised by
      one exercise physiologist and a football coach. Exercise intensity will be monitored through
      heart rate and rated perceived exertion.

    <description>Intervention will involve 3 sessions per week of a structured and supervised walking football program over 16 weeks. Each session will include a warm-up, followed by the practice of specific exercises where specific technical skills (pass, dribble, shot), motor skills (agility, coordination, balance) and physical fitness (cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal capacity) will be enhanced, ending with a structured game (7x7) of walking football and a cooldown.</description>
