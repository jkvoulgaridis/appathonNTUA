      This study is to assess the clinical efficacy of epidural injections with Tumor Necrosis
      Factor-Alpha(TNF-α) Inhibitor in patients with chronic radicular pain caused by lumbar spinal
      stenosis.Ninety patients were diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and were randomly
      assigned to 3 groups, for each group 30 cases. Patients in Group A received epidural
      injection of spinal nerve with 2.0 ml of lidocaine and 10 mg of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha
      Inhibitor (etanercept) onto the affected spinal nerve, Group B patients received epidural
      injection with lidocaine 2ml mixed with 2ml of steroid(Diprospan), and group C patients
      received epidural injections with 4.0 ml of lidocaine only. All the 3 groups were evaluated
      by VAS and ODI, and received 6 months' follow-up.
