      This study is a dose verification, pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment of products derived from
      two manufacturing processes and scales (500L-FMP and 2000L-FMP; FMP: Final Manufacturing
      Process) and indication expansion clinical study of monoclonal antibody conducted in Chinese
      subjects with advanced solid tumors, with a purpose of exploring the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy. This study is carried out on the basis of a Phase
      IA multi-dose and dose-escalation study in Australia. All subjects will receive tislelizumab
      until they have no evidence of continued clinical benefits, unacceptable toxicity, or
      withdrawal of informed consent in the discretion of the investigator. Paraffin-embedded tumor
      tissue will be collected for purpose of biomarker analysis.
