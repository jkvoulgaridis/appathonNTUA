      This is a non-randomized, phase II, open-label study. The goal of this clinical research

      this study is a non-randomized, phase II, open-label study. Phase II clinical trials test the
      safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug or combination of drugs to learn whether
      it works in preventing or treating a disease.

      the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of sintilimab in preventing the
      onset of oral cancer in patients with high-risk oral premalignant lesions, who had oral
      cancer at least once before.
