    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the bioequivalence (i.e. similar pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics characteristics) between acarbose/metformin FDC (50 mg/500 mg) and loose
      combination of acarbose (50 mg) and metformin (500 mg)

             dysfunction, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, malignant neoplasm), of
