    <textblock>
      A single arm trial consisting of 98 adult volunteers to assess the safety and efficacy of the
      ivWatch SmartTouch sensor in comparison to the ivWatch fiber optic sensor when observing
      infiltrated tissues at common sites for peripheral IV therapy.

    <description>The ivWatch Model 400 SmartTouch and fiber optic sensors monitored an IV site during the infiltration of 10 mL of isotonic saline solution. IV sites were placed in the forearm and the dorsal aspect of the hand. The rate of the infiltration ranged between 5 mL/hr to 150 mL/hr.</description>
