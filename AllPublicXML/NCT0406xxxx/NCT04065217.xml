  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an academic, government clinic, uni-center, randomized within patients trial study of the
      effects of 980-nm diode laser treatment included 15 cases of facial hemangiomas in patients
      with a history of discomfort due to lesions that were not suitable for removal using
      traditional methods. The study was carried out at the University of Baghdad/Institute of
      Laser for Postgraduate Studies/Laser Medicine Research Clinics from 15 October 2018 to 15
      April 2019. Primary end-point is improvement of conditions at 6 months. Secondary end-points
      are quality of life, disappear lesions and safety administration of diode laser. Each patient
      received 12 sessions at two-week intervals. Lesions were photographed before and after laser
      treatment and digital image histograms were generated as a graphical representation of the
      tonal distribution.

      Following treatment, the lesions were less elevated, smoother in texture, and the color
      changed from dark red to light pink.

      There is a need to improve the treatment of face hemangiomas. Results from this randomized
      within patient trial will serve as preliminary evidence of the future role of diode laser in
      hemangioma treatment and a basis for design and power estimations of future studies. Based on
      the skin texture, color and elevation of the hemangioma as well as patient satisfaction, this
      type of laser is a safe and effective modality for the treatment of facial hemangioma in
      Iraqi patients.

    <description>Diode laser 980-nm in the diseased group only while we no need the comparator group because we compared between lesion before and after. The administration of laser is scheduled to start treatment. Patients will take laser therapy as a 12 session at two week-interval. In case of intolerance, session number reduction by 10, 8, 6, 4 allowed. Adherence to treatment will be assessed at each interval for undesired side effects or complications. The intervention should continue also after complete session, or during temporary interval withdrawal due to reached maximal cumulative response or side effects from laser therapy.</description>

    <description>Before starting the laser session, cosmetics or makeup were removed and the skin was cleaned. The area was anesthetized by the application of as EMLA lotion (lidocaine 2.5% + prilocaine 2.5%) [ONLY MEDICAL; CAT No. R331/72394/P001] 20 minutes before the session. During the procedure, the laser probe was held perpendicular to the lesion and a guide beam was used to direct the application. The patient wore protective eye goggles [CE; DIR 8001100L4]. After the session, cool air was applied to the whole region. Each patient received a maximum of six sessions, delivered at two-week intervals. Patients reported itchiness and erythema during the session.</description>
