  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, multicenter trial shall patients with chronic subdural
      hematoma (cSDH) recruited, who were surgically treated. Initially, we would divide the
      patients randomized into two groups: Patients with supervised blow-maneuver and without.
      After surgical treatment of cSDH with insertion of a subdural drain, one group would perform
      a supervised blow maneuver (&quot;Valsalva maneuver&quot;) every hour for five minutes from 10:00 to
      20:00. In the other group, the standard care would be performed. The subdural drain would be
      explanted 2days after operation and a postoperative CT scan would routinely be performed.
      After hospital discharge, the patient would be rechecked in an ambulant setting and would
      receive CT scan as clinical standard. Recurrence of hematoma is defined as recurrent hematoma
      which should be reoperated. After 3 and 6 months we would evaluate the outcome of patients.
