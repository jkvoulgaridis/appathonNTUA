    <textblock>
      Despite the progress made in the organization of care and neonatal care, prematurity remains
      the main cause of morbidity and perinatal mortality.

      This study aims to estimate the prognostic value of new biomarkers (proteomic markers) on the
      occurrence of preterm birth.

    <textblock>
      Despite the progress made in the organization of care and neonatal care, prematurity remains
      the main cause of morbidity and perinatal mortality. With 7.2% of premature deliveries in
      France, threat of premature labor remains the leading cause of maternal transfer and
      hospitalization. In terms of mortality, morbidity and cost, the fight against prematurity
      remains a national priority in terms of public health.

      The diagnosis of threat of premature labor at high risk of preterm labor is difficult and
      clinical and laboratory criteria often remain insufficient. Measurement of the cervix by
      endovaginal ultrasound lacks sensitivity and specificity. Among the biological criteria, only
      fibronectin, which has a good negative predictive value, is used in current practice. Despite
      the use of these two prognostic criteria, only 40% of hospitalized patients will give birth
      prematurely.

      Recent advances in proteomics allow us to study complex proteomes and compare them.
      Preliminary studies already carried out have revealed families of proteins expressed
      differently in situations of work or premature delivery. We therefore hypothesize that the
      study of a woman's vaginal proteome with threat of premature labor may reveal new markers of
      preterm labor. These markers could help the clinician in its therapeutic management and thus
      reduce hospitalizations, better target patients requiring tocolytic treatment and optimize
      the use of corticosteroids. In addition, variations in the proteome may help to understand
      the physiopathological mechanisms of premature delivery, which are necessary for the
      development of effective therapeutics.
