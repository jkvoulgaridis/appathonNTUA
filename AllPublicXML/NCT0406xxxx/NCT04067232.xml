  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop a 4D-CT (4 Dimensional Computed Tomography) -scan
      acquisition method for estimating the cause of posttraumatic impairment of the forearm. Both
      forearms of patients with posttraumatic impairment of one of the forearm will be scanned
      using a 4D-CT-scan, during forearm rotation. Rotation of impaired and healthy forearms will
      be analysed and compared to each other. This method is intended to allow differentiation of
      motion patterns reflecting an osseous impairment from those caused by soft tissue pathology
      in order to improve treatment choice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forearm and wrist fractures are the most common of all fractures and mostly occur at the
      distal end of the radius. Distal radius fractures are associated with posttraumatic sequelae,
      which typically involve restricted forearm rotation. Diagnostics of dynamic traumatic
      pathologies are conventionally based on static (2D or 3D) imaging protocols using MRI
      (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT. However, interpretation of indirect suggestive findings -
      such as edema or abnormal bone positions - limits accuracy and inter-observer reliability.
      Dynamic 4D imaging (adding the fourth dimension of time) has the potential to discriminate
      whether forearm rotation deficit is due to an osseous deformity causing bony impingement or
      whether it is due to non-osseous pathology. Hence it may reduce unnecessary corrective
      osteotomies and guide the patient and surgeon towards the most effective surgical or
      conservative treatment choice - expectedly resulting in better outcomes and patient
      satisfaction. In addition, we aim to develop a classification based on the estimated motion
      patterns and assess its reliability. Furthermore we aim at acquiring knowledge of
      physiological mechanics of the radioulnar joint and to assess symmetry in radioulnar joint
      motions between two healthy forearms on 4D-CT-scans.
