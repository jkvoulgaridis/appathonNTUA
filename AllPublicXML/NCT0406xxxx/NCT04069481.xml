  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke can drastically impact the ability to walk and keep your balance. In addition people
      with chronic stroke feel social isolated, become less satisfied with their walking and lose
      confidence in their ability to move without falling.

      Ned new treatments are needed for walking and balance. Dancing is a fun, social activity that
      has similar benefits to traditional exercise. Another benefit of dancing is the use of music,
      which improves mood, increases motivation and can even improve motor performance. Finally,
      moving in synchrony with other people during dancing can make people feel connected. We
      believe that dance classes can benefit people with stroke, but few studies have been done.

      The objective of our project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test whether
      dance can improve balance and walking for people with chronic stroke. The investigators are
      also interested in whether dancing improves people's confidence in their ability to do
      activities without losing their balance (i.e. balance confidence), decreases their feelings
      of isolation and increases their quality of life.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of an adapted dance
      program for people with chronic stroke. Participants with stroke living in the community will
      be randomly assigned to either the dance group or the control group. Participants will attend
      classes 2 times a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes are change in balance balance
      (measured with the Mini BESTest) and change in gait speed. Participants will be assessed
      before and after the 12 week program.

    <description>Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest)
The Mini-BESTest is a 14-item performance-based clinical scale that will be used to measure balance during standing and walking activities. There are 4 subscales in the miniBESTest and the scores on the subscales are summed to create the total score. The miniBESTest total score can range form 0-56 and higher scores indicate better balance. The Mini-BESTest shows good inter- (ICC 0.96) and intra-rater (ICC=0.97) and test-retest reliability (ICC=0.98) in the stroke population.</description>

    <description>Friendship scale
The Friendship scale is a short (6-item) and user-friendly measure of perceived social isolation developed for older adults. It has a maximum score of 24 and lower scores indicate higher levels of social isolation. It has internal structure (RMSEA=0.02) and reliability (Chronbach α=0.83)</description>

    <description>Stroke Specific Quality Of Life scale (SS-QOL)
The SS-QOL is a self-report scale containing 49 items in 12 domains ranging from mobility and energy to mood and language. The SS-QOL has both domain scores and an overall SS-QOL summary score. The domain scores are unweighted averages of the associated items while the summary score is an unweighted average of all twelve domain scores. The scores can range from 0 to 5 and higher scores indicate better quality of life.
The SS-QOL had good internal consistency (range Chronbach α=0.75-0.89), test-retest reliability (r=0.92) and inter-rater reliability (r=0.92).</description>

    <description>Activity Balance Confidence Scale (ABC)
The ABC is a 16-item self-report scale that requires individuals indicate their confidence in performing various activities without losing their balance or becoming unsteady. The ABC total score is calculated as an average of the ratings for the 16 items. The score ranges from 0-100 and higher scores indicate greater confidence. The ABC scale has good internal consistency (α=0.94) and test-retest reliability (ICC =0.85) in individuals with chronic stroke living in the community</description>
