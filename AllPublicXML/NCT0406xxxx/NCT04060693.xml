  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study has been launched to collect spectral raman data paired with validated
      glucose reference values in private homes of subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects enrolled in this protocol will dedicate 30 days of home-based measurement,
      scheduled within a 40 days' time frame. For reference measurements, subjects will be equipped
      with a blood glucose meter (Contour Next One, Ascenia). Optical measurements are collected
      with the investigational medical device. Each day of measurements consists of four sessions
      each comprising two capillary blood glucose measurement with a blood glucose meter and two
      investigational medical device measurements.

    <description>The subjects enrolled in this protocol will dedicate 30 days of home-based measurement, scheduled within a 40 days' time frame. For reference measurements, subjects will be equipped with a BG-meter (Contour Next One, Ascenia). Optical measurements are collected with the IMD. Each day of measurements consists of four sessions each comprising two capillary blood glucose measurement with a BG-meter and two IMD measurements. IMD measurements will be performed within 3 minutes after the BG measurement using the thenar of the right hand of the subject.</description>
