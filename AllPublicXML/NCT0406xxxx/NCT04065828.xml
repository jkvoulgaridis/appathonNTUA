      This study will help describe the state of oral health of very old people (over 90).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2011, according to the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Research,
      people aged 85 and over accounted for about 3% of the total population. This proportion will
      increase sharply due to longer life expectancy on the baby boom generation and is expected to
      reach 7.5% of the total population in 2050.

      This very old population has specific health, related to the presence of co-morbidities and
      co-medications, but also to a frequent state of dependence.

      These general health problems and their treatment can create or accentuate oral problems or
      complicate their management. Thus, very old people are more likely to have some oral diseases
      although there is no epidemiological data in France. Conversely, oral problems can have
      repercussions in terms of quality of life, social relations and nutrition, and are factors of
      risk or aggravating actual or potential systemic disorders.

      This very elderly population is therefore likely to present new challenges of dental care
      that it is important to document.

    <description>Root caries index (RCI) - RCI is based on the requirement that gingival recession must occur before root caries surface lesion begin, therefore only teeth with gum recession are examined.
4 surfaces of root are examined (mesial, distal, lingual, and buccal or labial)
A judgment of no gum recession is made if CEJ (cement enamel junction) cannot be visualized.
The root caries index is calculated for an individual using the formula
• RCI= (R-D) +(R-F) x 100 (R-D) +(R-F) +(R-N) R-N =Recession present surface normal or sound R-D =Recession present with decay root surface R-F= Recession present with a filled root surface.</description>
