  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive brain stimulations techniques have recently shown promising results in patients
      with disorders of consciousness. Notably, a case reported improvement of level of
      consciousness using transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation in a patient in
      unresponsive wakefulness syndrome.

      Here we aim to assess the effects of transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation on
      post-coma patients with disorders of consciousness in a first randomised controlled crossover
      study.To measure these effects, neuro-electrophysiological, (i.e., electroencephalography -
      EEG - primary outcome and electrocardiography - EKG - secondary outcome) and behavioral (Coma
      recovery scale revised - CRS-R and pupillary diameter - secondary outcomes) will be recorded
      in severely brain-injured patients with DOC.

    <textblock>
      Currently, therapeutic options for severely brain-injured patients with disorders of
      consciousness (DOC), including patients in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and
      minimally conscious state (MCS), are limited and still need to be improved to influence
      long-term outcomes. Non-invasive brain stimulations (NIBS) techniques have recently shown
      promising results in DOC.

      Transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS - NEMOS, Cerbomed, Germany) seems to
      be a promising approache. In a recent case report, a patient in UWS improved to MCS using
      this therapeutic technique.

      To confirm this positive result, we propose a first randomized double-blind controlled
      crossover trial. One active stimulation at the cymba conchea to the side of the most injured
      hemisphere and one sham stimulation to the ear lobe (same side) will be delivered during 45
      minutes in a randomized order in subacute (less than 21 days post-onset) severely
      brain-damaged patients. The stimulation will start at 3 mA and will be decreased if signs of
      pain were observed (more than 4/9 according to the Nociceptive Coma Scale-Revised - NCS-R)
      until stimulation stays under pain threshold.

      Ten to fifteen minutes of high-density EEG will be recorded using a 256-channel saline
      electrode net (Electrical Geodesics, USA) directly before and will be continue until ten to
      fifteen minutes after each session. During this same period of time, electrocardiography
      (EKG) and pupillary measurement (Eye tracking, Phasya, Belgium) will be recorded to measure
      parasympathetic indirect signs of vagal stimulation. Behavioral assessments will be performed
      using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised before and after each session by an investigator
      blinded to the treatment allocation.
