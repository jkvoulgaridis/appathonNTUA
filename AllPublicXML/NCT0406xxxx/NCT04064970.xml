  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify self-reported wellness following nonsurgical
      treatment of stress urinary incontinence. This will be done by correlating the response of
      &quot;yes&quot; on the patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) question to responses from other
      questionnaires regarding urinary symptoms.

    <measure>number of participants whose Urinary Distress Inventory-6 (UDI-6) score predict their Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) answer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will be asked to complete the Urinary Distress Inventory 6 (UDI-6) after enrollment and again after 6 weeks. This is a short validated disease-specific patient reported outcome measuring urinary incontinence severity. The UDI-6 is a likert scale based questionnaire that calculates the mean of the scores and multiplies that mean by 25 to scale the instrument to an &quot;actual score&quot; with a range of 0 - 100. The higher the score the greater perceived negative impact on an individual's quality of life. The question &quot;Considering all of the different ways that urinary leakage is affecting you, do you consider your current state to be satisfactory?&quot; and provide a yes/no answer. Statistical analysis will then be performed to determine the threshold score at which one is likely to consider their symptoms to be acceptable, PASS &quot;yes&quot;. Participants whose UDI score matches their PASS answer will be considered predicted and counted for this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Mean Minimal important difference (MID) of the Urinary Distress Inventory 6 (UDI 6 ) as determined by the anchor-based method of analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The UDI-6 is a likert scale based questionnaire that calculates the mean of the scores and multiplies that mean by 25 to scale the instrument to an &quot;actual score&quot; with a range of 0 - 100 with a questions specifically related to stress urinary incontinence. The higher the score the greater perceived negative impact on an individual's quality of life The MID represents a clinically significant improvement in self-reported symptomatology. Anchor-based methods assess responsiveness in relation to an external event or rating to quantify the meaning of the particular degree of change. This is traditionally assessed by a moderate relationship noted using correlations between the negative score change and the external anchor. Participants will complete the UDI-6 at baseline and after 6 weeks. The MID will be defined by the mean score change reported by women who indicate improvement on the Patient Global Impression of severity (PGI-S) and Improvement (PGI-I).</description>

    <measure>Mean Minimal important difference (MID) of the Urinary Distress Inventory 6 (UDI 6 ) as determined by the distribution-bases method of analysis</measure>

    <description>The UDI-6 is a likert scale based questionnaire that calculates the mean of the scores and multiplies that mean by 25 to scale the instrument to an &quot;actual score&quot; with a range of 0 - 100 with a questions specifically related to stress urinary incontinence. The higher the score the greater perceived negative impact on an individual's quality of life The MID represents a clinically significant improvement in self-reported symptomatology. Distribution-based methods rely on the distribution of scores within a population and relate clinical significance to a change in magnitude at least equal to a statistical parameter of group data such as standard deviation (SD). This is traditionally assessed by including the effect size and standard error of measurement (SEM). A medium effect (0.5 SD) and a small effect size (0.2SD). The MID is estimated as 1 SEM.</description>
