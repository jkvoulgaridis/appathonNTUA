    <textblock>
      Patients in addiction treatment have exceptionally higher rate of cigarette smoking and very
      low quit rates compared to the general population. The purpose of this study is to examine
      the feasibility of using e-cigarettes as a method for harm reduction and the effects of
      providing e-cigarettes (or placebo e-cigarettes) on smoking outcomes among patients in
      addiction treatment.

    <textblock>
      Electronic nicotine delivery devices often referred to as e-cigarettes, are battery-powered
      devices that deliver vaporized nicotine when inhaled. Corresponding with the growth in media
      attention, marketing and promotion, awareness and use of e-cigarettes has increased
      dramatically. A large proportion of those using e-cigarettes use them to reduce the number of
      cigarettes they are smoking or to help them quit. Use of an e-cigarette by smokers unwilling
      or unable to stop smoking completely might be a good approach to reducing cigarette
      consumption as the e-cigarette imitates some behavioral aspects of cigarette smoking and
      contains nicotine. Moreover, the few existing studies on the effect of e-cigarettes on
      tobacco withdrawal and craving suggest promising potential to assist smokers in coping with
      smoking urges and decreasing cigarette use.
