      The aim of this work is to investigate the clinical performance and subjective acceptance of
      the comfilcon A asphere contact lens when compared to single-vision spectacles in subjects
      who have never worn contact lenses and who use digital devices (such as phones, tablets,
      laptops, desktop computers) for at least 4 hours per day on at least 5 days per week.

      The aim of this clinical work is to compare the clinical performance and subjective
      acceptance of comfilcon A asphere contact lens when compared to single-vision spectacles in
      subjects who use digital devices (phones, tablets, laptops, desktop computers) for at least 4
      hours per day on at least 5 days per week. Subjects will be randomized to use either their
      habitual spectacles or the study contact lenses for two months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  They are between 18 and 35 years of age (inclusive).

          -  They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing and able to sign a
             Statement of Informed Consent.

          -  They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

          -  They are a 'neophyte' (i.e. someone who has not worn contact lenses previously, with
             the exception for the purposes of a trial fitting, lasting up to one week).

          -  They have a contact lens spherical prescription between -1.00 to -6.25D (inclusive)
             based on the ocular refraction.

          -  They have a cylindrical correction of -0.875DC or less in each eye based on the ocular
             refraction

          -  They own and habitually wear single vision spectacles used for both distance and near
             vision, including computer and digital device use.

          -  Their single vision spectacles have a mean sphere equivalent within ±0.50D of that of
             the refraction found in the study for each eye (after having taken lens effectivity
             into account).

          -  They are willing to be fitted with contact lenses and understand they may be
             randomized to either group.

          -  They are willing to wear the contact lenses (if relevant) or spectacles for at least 8
             hours per day, 5 days per week.

          -  They typically use digital devices for a minimum of 4 hours per day, 5 days per week.

          -  They agree not to change the spectacles they will wear for digital device use for the
             duration of the study.

          -  They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          -  They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          -  They are using any topical medication such as eye drops (including comfort drops) or
             ointment on a regular basis.

          -  The spectacles they use for digital device viewing on the study have been made with
             specialist features for computer use, digital eye fatigue or are multifocal/bifocal.

          -  They are aphakic.

          -  They have had corneal refractive surgery.

          -  They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or
             have keratoconus.

          -  They are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel; or they have any
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic
             reaction.

          -  They have evidence of a heterotropia or decompensating heterotropia on cover test.

          -  They have a history of having been prescribed prism in their spectacles (by self
             report).

          -  They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or
             research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.
