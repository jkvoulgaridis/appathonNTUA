  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate a new social prescribing service delivered by Mind Cymru in four
      communities in Wales. Mind Cymru have made a new social prescribing service, where a link
      worker works with a patient who has mild/moderate mental or emotional health problems, to
      understand their needs and set them goals for the future. The link worker will then help them
      find a service in their local community that might help them achieve their goals.

      The study uses a waitlist trial, which means that some participants will get to meet the link
      worker and have the intervention straight away, while others will have to wait for 20 working
      days. From this, the researchers can compare the people who had the intervention straight
      away with the people who had to wait. Scores on well-being, quality of life and loneliness
      questionnaires will be used to see the effects of the intervention on patients, whilst
      information like patient attendance at the General Practioner surgery will be used to see if
      there is a difference in the patient's use of health services.

      This trial will employ a randomised wait-list control design. The study has been co-designed
      with the research team at University of South Wales, Mind Cymru, the link workers and General
      Practioners working within the study sites.

      The study will assess the effectiveness of services provided through making three sets of
      comparisons (based on a set of individual- and service-level outcomes over time - comparing
      between: - The four Local Mind sites (Merthyr and Valleys, Vale of Clwyd, Brecon and
      District, Ystradgynlais);

        -  Those who complete the intervention immediately, with those who are in the waitlist
           group;

        -  Those who fully complete the social prescribing intervention with those who do not
           complete or partially the full social prescription but receive care as usual (either
           because they do not attend or only partially attend); and Participants will be randomly
           allocated to receive the social prescribing link worker intervention either immediately,
           or after a waiting period of 20 working days. Participants will be recruited through
           consultations with healthcare professionals, either their General Practioner, a practice
           nurse or the Total Nurse Triage system within the doctors surgery. If the healthcare
           professional identifies that the prospective participant meets the eligibility criteria
           of the study (experiencing mild/moderate mental health and/or emotional wellbeing
           disorders, aged 18+ and registered with a General Practioners in Wales), they will
           provide the prospective participant with an information pack, and ask for permission to
           contact. If this permission is given they will be subsequently contacted by the link
           worker at least 2 working days later, to gain verbal consent and for baseline data
           collection and randomisation.

      The study recruitment target is 1,000 participants, randomized into two groups (a control
      group, n = 500 and an intervention group n = 500). The sample collected across the 3 General
      Practice clusters over the 24-month period that the study is open. An attrition rate of 5% is
      expected. Recruitment will end after 18-months, allowing for 6 months to complete the study
      and follow-up on participants. The service may continue independently of the study.

      Data will be collected at a maximum of five time points:

        -  Prior to randomisation to either the immediate or wait-list arm

        -  For wait-list controls: in a reminder telephone call at the end of the 20 day wait

        -  At the end of their intervention with the link worker

        -  Four weeks after the end of their intervention with the link worker

        -  Three months after the end of the previous data collection point Data will be collected
           either over the telephone or during the intervention with the link workers. All link
           workers who are collecting data will have study specific training for receiving consent
           and data collection.

      The study will take place over a 24-month period, with participant recruitment lasting a
      total of 18-months. Data analysis will take place at the end of the 24-month period, although
      transfer of data from the link workers to the research team at University of South Wales will
      be continuous over the 24-month period. A final report will be produced at the end of the
      study for the Welsh Government.

    <measure>Change from Baseline. The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, 4 weeks and 3 months after randomisation.</time_frame>
    <description>SWEMWBS is completed by the participants and allows self reflection on mental well-being before and during involvement in health enhancing activities. Each of the 7 statements can be scored 1 to 5, from &quot;none of the time&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot;. A total score is calculated by summing the 7 individual statement scores. The minimum score is 7 and the maximum is 35. The higher score signifies better mental well-being.</description>

    <time_frame>At Baseline, 4 weeks and 3 months after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The Recovering Quality of Life questionaire is completed by the participants and allows self-reporting on their journey to recovery. There are twenty statements with five answers, and can be scored 0-4. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum is 80, where 0 indicates poorest quality of life and 80 indicates highest quality of life.</description>

    <description>The UCLA 3-Item Loneliness Scale is completed by the participants and allows self-reporting of subjective feelings of loneliness and social isolation. There are three statements, with three answers, with &quot;hardly ever&quot;, scoring 1 and &quot;often&quot; scoring 3. The minimum score is 3 and the maximum 9. A score of 3-5 is considered &quot;not lonely&quot; and 6-9 &quot;lonely&quot;.</description>
