  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the feasibility of initiating a ketamine pain
      control protocol in the emergency department for the treatment of acute pain in patients with
      long bone fractures and to compare the efficacy of the ketamine pain protocol to bolus
      morphine for pain control in the first 6 hours of patient stay in the emergency department.
