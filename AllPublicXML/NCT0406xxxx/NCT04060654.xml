      To provide ongoing treatment with SUBLOCADE for up to 5 additional injections in subjects who
      initiated SUBLOCADE following a single dose of transmucosal (TM) buprenorphine in study
      INDV-6000-403

    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the longer-term safety of an abbreviated initiation
      protocol of SUBLOCADE in subjects who have completed the INDV-6000-403 study. It is also to
      provide treatment to these individuals while they seek longer-term treatment arrangements, as
      on average it can take an individual with opioid use disorder (OUD) 6 months between seeking
      treatment and achieving an appointment at a provider in the United States (US).

      Subjects who have completed the end of treatment (EOT) procedures for the INDV-6000-403 study
      may be eligible for participation. It is planned that the EOT visit for INDV-6000-403, which
      will occur approximately 28 days after the subject's first dose of SUBLOCADE, and Day 1 for
      INDV-6000-404 will occur within 2 days of the EOT visit, and that EOT assessments will serve
      as the screening assessments for this study.

      On Day 1, eligible subjects will receive a subcutaneous (SC) injection of 300 mg SUBLOCADE.
      Subjects will return to the clinic for subsequent injections approximately every 4 weeks for
      a total of up to 5 injections. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be captured
      throughout the study, female subjects of childbearing potential will receive urine pregnancy
      tests and all subjects will have urine drug screening (UDS) and evaluation of the previous
      injection site performed. Subjects will otherwise be treated in accordance with local
      standard of care, and SUBLOCADE doses will be based on the medical judgment of the
      Investigator.
