  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies showed that clinical pilates exercises has positive effects on static and
      dynamic balance of different populations. It was suggested that this type of exercise reduce
      the risk of falls and physical damage. It also helps prevention of kyphotic posture.
      Parkinson's patients have both balance and postural problems but no study investigated the
      effect of clinical pilates exercises for this population. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the effects of clinical pilates exercise program on postural control and balance
      in individuals with Parkinson's disease.

      The patients will be randomly assigned into two groups: Clinical Pilates (CP) Group and
      Classic Physiotherapy (CF) Group. Both groups will be treated for 8 weeks. The evaluation of
      the patients will be done before the beginning of exercise program and will be repeated at
      the end. Static balance of patients will be evaluated with Single Leg Stance Test and Tandem
      Stance Test, dynamic balance with Functional Reach Test (FRT) and 30 second Chair Stand Test.
      Postural control and balance will also be evaluated with Berg Balance Scale and functional
      capacity by Timed Up and Go Test. Symptom severity and treatment complications of the
      patients will be evaluated with United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>One leg stance test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This test is used to measure balance and standing ability and gives an idea about the individual's ability to balance and the risk of falling. Test measures how many seconds the patient can stand on one leg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tandem stance test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a test that evaluates the static balance by narrowing the ground contact area. The heel of one foot is adjusted to the end of the other foot. Patient is asked to try to stand without loss of balance and the time is recorded in seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional reach test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A balance test designed to measure stability limits. The patient is asked to raise the dominant arm 90 ° and place it at the shoulder level and extend as far as it can go forward, without loss of movement or balance in the feet. Reduced ability to reach indicates an increased risk of falling in the future.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sit-to-stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This test evaluates the patient's sit-up activity, lower extremity strength and dynamic balance. The patient's number of sitting and getting up within 30 seconds gives the test score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed-up and Go test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>When the command is given, the patient gets up from a normal chair, walks 3 meters, turns and walks back to the chair and sits down. The time starts when the command is given and ends when the person sits back in the chair.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This test is used to measure a person's static and dynamic balance performance. It is effective in assessing postural control and predicting the risk of falling. It is a 14-item test that uses 0 to 4 sequential scoring for each item. The total score range is from 0 to 56 and a higher score indicates a better balance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This scale shows the disease severity. Consists of four parts including; Non-motor problems (total 16 points), motor problems (total 92 points), motor examination (total 52 points) and motor complications (total 23 points). The scoring system is between 0 and 4 (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = mild to moderate, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe). The increase in the total score indicates that the symptoms of Parkinson Disease increase</description>

    <description>This exercise model focus on the awareness of the neutral position of the spine and strengthen the deep postural muscles of the spine. Training of trunk muscles is emphasized and trunk stabilization is achieved and more difficult activities are initiated and thus, body awareness is improved. There are general principles to be followed during exercises. These; The principle of concentration is respiration, central focus, control, stability and isolation. These principles are achieved by simultaneous muscle activation of muscles responsible for trunk stabilization (multifidus, diaphragm, transversus abdominis and pelvic floor muscles). In order for an exercise to become a clinical pilates exercise, trunk stabilization must be ensured and breath control should be established in each exercise.</description>
