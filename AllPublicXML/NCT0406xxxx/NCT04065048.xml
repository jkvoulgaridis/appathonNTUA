      This protocol is designed to compare the effectiveness of a dietary intervention for 7 days,
      given to patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in remission: a soy-based diet, which has been
      demonstrated to have numerous health benefits. The diet will be compared to participant
      'baseline' (pre-diet) in terms of its ability to change the composition of gut bacteria and
      their production of butyrate, an important short chain fatty acid (SCFA) that limits bowel
      inflammation, a characteristic of this debilitating disease.

      The Central Hypothesis The central hypothesis of this study is that amino acids sourced from
      soy protein, a lysine rich, non-animal dietary substrate can serve as a major nutrient source
      for bacterial phyla capable of butyrate synthesis in the gut, and that soy protein has a
      protective effect for epithelial integrity in periods of low-grade inflammation in Crohn's
      disease.

      To answer our central hypothesis, the human diet intervention study represents the one of two
      specific aims of a study that integrates both a human and experimental research design.
      Samples collected in the dietary study involving patients with CD (Specific Aim 1, see below)
      will be used to complete the objectives described under Specific Aim 2 (see below) in
      experimental mice. Case Western Reserve University's (CWRU) Institutional Animal Care and Use
      Committee (IACUC) has reviewed and approved the Animal Experimentation 2014-0158 described
      under Specific Aim 2.

      Study Objectives This single center open label study is designed to address the following
      objectives.

      Specific Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of a soy-based diet dietary intervention given
      for 7 days to change the gut microbiota composition to that of baseline (pre-diet) in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and in remission.

      Primary Objectives of Specific Aim 1

        1. To monitor patients for clinical symptoms related to maintenance of clinical remission
           during study period. Clinical symptoms will be assessed using the short Crohn's Disease
           Activity Index (sCDAI), a reliable and valid tool for assessment of Crohn's disease
           activity.

           • Hypothesis: Patients will not experience any clinical symptoms indicative of loss of
           clinical remission or adverse events as both diet interventions include normal, healthy
           food.

        2. To assess the feasibility of the study diets.

      Secondary Objectives of Specific Aim 1

        1. To quantify change gut bacteria taxonomic profiles in stool samples collected from CD
           patients after a soy-based dietary intervention, for 7 days each;.

           • Hypothesis: Patients will have differences in their fecal bacterial composition after
           consuming a soy-based diet, compared their 'baseline' diet.

        2. To quantify gut bacterial butyrate in stool samples collected from CD patients after a
           soy-based dietary intervention, for 7 days.

           • Hypothesis: Dietary substrates sourced from a soy-based diet promote butyrate
           synthesis through different bacterial community members.

        3. To assess the proportion of patients who intend to continue the study diets when
           prepared food is no longer provided without cost, and the reasons for discontinuation of
           either diet (compared to resuming usual food habits).

      Dose Rationale of Specific Aim 1 Participants will be asked to exclusively eat for 7 days, a
      soy-based diet immediately followed by participants resume their usual dietary habits. The
      primary outcome (self-reported sCDAI) will be assessed during the 7 day period of the diet.
      The 7-day diet time period was chosen for two reasons. First, dietary interventions in
      humans, specifically those plant and animal protein based, have been shown to alter gut
      microbial communities, including microbial gene expression in a rapid, diet-specific manner
      in as little as days(Wu, et al.Science, 2011; David, et al. Nature, 2014). Therefore 7 days
      is sufficient to meet the purpose of specific aim 1. Second, we felt that patients would be
      more likely to adhere to a diet exclusively focused on one specific food type over a shorter,
      period (7 days) if they did not perceive a direct benefit and to this end, would be more
      willing to collect stool samples.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the functional significance of Soy-based diet altered microbiota in
      germ-free SAMP1/YitFC (SAMP) mice.

      The purpose of Aim 2 is to perform fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments in
      germ-free (GF) SAMP mice to test directly that the soy-based diet altered microbiota
      (Specific Aim 1) has increased butyrate producing capacity and to determine whether this
      could protect epithelial integrity against mild inflammation.

      Fecal microbiota obtained from CD patients treated with soy diet (Aim 1) will be transplanted
      into germ-free SAMP mice to test dietary substrates (amino acids sourced from non-animal
      food) potential for maintaining epithelial integrity via butyrate as a surrogate treatment
      for maintaining clinical remission in CD patients with, or at risk for residual active
      disease. We expect to identify potential short-term diet based therapeutic modalities, in
      context to baseline microbiota, designed for enhancing the anti-inflammatory effects of
      commensal microbiota on epithelial integrity.

      Primary Objectives for Specific Aim 2

        1. To determine whether the diet-altered fecal microbiota from CD patients (Specific Aim 1)
           has increased butyrate producing capacity following in recipient GF SAMP mice after FMT.

           • Hypothesis: Microbial alterations induced by a soy protein based diet has increased
           butyrate producing capacity and a soy protein can be a surrogate for butyrate production
           in the gut.

        2. To determine the gut microbial metabolite profiles in recipient GF SAMP mice after FMT.

           • Hypothesis: Transplanted mice will exhibit a mirrored pattern of metabolite profiles
           found in respective human CD patient donors.

        3. To determine whether FMT (as above) in recipient germ-free SAMP mice administered a low
           concentration of DSS could protect epithelial integrity against mild inflammation.

             -  Hypothesis: Microbial alterations induced by a soy protein based diet has a
                protective effect for epithelial integrity in periods of low-grade inflammation.

      The overall objective of the study (Specific Aim 1 &amp; 2) is to develop a strong foundation of
      preliminary evidence on functional understanding of how dietary substrates obtained from
      different food sources alter microbial communities and butyrate synthesis. Collected data
      will be or further characterization in future mechanistic studies, as well as prospective
      studies of the proposed diet therapy in patients with CD. The ultimate goal is to develop
      novel therapeutic, anti-inflammatory diet-based modality or microbial modulation, clinically
      relevant to CD subjects with residual active disease, in context to baseline microbial
      communities.

      RECRUITMENT METHODS Source of participants Research participants will be sourced from the
      gastroenterology outpatient clinic services of the Digestive Health Institute (DHI) at
      University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland Ohio. Specifically this will include
      patients seen during their normally scheduled appointments by their treating
      gastroenterologist.

      Methods to identify Potential participants will be identified via review of clinical
      appointment schedules (day/morning before patient appointment) by the treating
      gastroenterologist. Alternatively, the treating gastroenterologist will ask suitable patients
      whether they are interested in participating in the described dietary intervention study
      during the patient appointment. The gastroenterologist will pre-screen for nominal
      eligibility based on current disease activity status using the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI,
      see below for more information). In addition, the gastroenterologist will evaluate whether
      the patient has been on a stable medication therapy regime for at least 2 months (see
      inclusion criteria for more information).

      Harvey Brashaw Index (HBI):

      The HBI is a valid tool for assessment of disease activity in CD patients. The HBI will be
      used to determine remission status and eligibility. Initial verbal consent will be obtained
      by the treating gastroenterologist. The HBI consists of only of clinical parameters, with the
      first three items scored for the previous day. The HBI is computed to include; general
      well-being (0-4), abdominal pain (0-3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass
      (requires physical exam by gastroenterologist), and complications (e.g., arthralgia) Patients
      who score 4 or less on the HBI are very likely to be in remission according to the Crohn's
      Disease activity Index, another clinical tool to measure disease activity. Patients with a
      score of 9 or higher are considered to have severe disease. Because the clinical parameters
      of the HBI inherently overlap with those assessed in all patients by a treating
      gastroenterologist during any routine visit, the HBI will be used in this study to determine
      eligibility and identify suitable participants (i.e. CD patients in remission).

      Feasibility The Digestive Disease Institute at Case Medical University Hospitals has a very
      large patient volume with more than 49,000 annual patient visits registered, of which include
      986 annual CD outpatient visits per year. The majority of CD outpatients are seen at the two
      flagship sites of the Digestive Health Institute (DHI), Case Medical Center (530 CD
      outpatients per year) and Ahuja Medical Center (260 CD outpatients per year), both free
      standing hospitals located in Cleveland Ohio. The remaining sites include Bedford medical
      center (6 cases annually), Conneaut Medical Center (22 cases annually), Geauga Medical Center
      (52 cases annually), Geneva Medical Center (68 cases annually) and Richmond Medical Center
      (48 cases annually). Participant screening and enrollment will occur only at one site, Case
      Medical Center. The Department of Gastroenterology has 44 full time gastroenterologists, all
      of whom the participating gastroenterologists in this study will be recruiting suitable
      participants for this study. On average, each doctor sees 40 outpatients per week,
      approximately 50% of which have CD. An estimated accrual rate of 1-2 eligible patients per
      month generates a conservative study accrual period of up to six months.

      Screening and Informed Consent Participants will be pre-screened for nominal eligibility
      during their appointment with their treating gastroenterologist. Once identified as
      potentially eligible based on the HBI and medication use, the investigator will be able to
      contact these patients to assess their interest in the study and set up initial appointment
      to undergo screening (visit 1) and enrollment in this study. All participants will be
      outpatients when entering the study.

      No data collection or other study procedures will take place until the potential participant
      provides written informed consent to participate in the research study. The informed consent,
      screening, enrollment and baseline data collection which make up visit 1 can occur on the
      same day or be completed across several days. The following screening and baseline data will
      be collected: participants' height, weight and vital signs, their medical history, surgical
      history (related to the disease), diet history, their symptoms and any medication they may be
      taking, including over-the-counter supplements/vitamin use. Their blood will be drawn to
      measure hematocrit levels (to obtain CDAI score). An additional tube of blood can be drawn
      for plasma evaluation and quantification of plasma metabolites. If visit 1 is &gt;30 days since
      the appointment with the treating gastroenterologist a repeat physical exam will be performed
      by a gastroenterologist. Participants will collect a fresh stool sample no more than 7 days
      prior to start of the study diet and no more than 21 days after the baseline screening visit
      1 is complete. Female participants will be asked to take a urine pregnancy test. One 24-hour
      dietary recall will be completed after the screening visit prior to start of the study diet.
      The primary investigator, a registered dietitian will complete this. The participant will
      complete daily online surveys regarding their Crohn's disease symptoms in order to calculate
      a sCDAI score. Participants will also be instructed about these online surveys they will
      receive throughout the study and when to collect stool samples.

      To enhance feasibility of stool sample collection, a Medical Courier Service (American
      Expediting®) will be available to participants for home collection of stool specimens
      (participants telephone for pick-up of sample; 24/7 service). The Medical Courier Service is
      compliant with OSHA, HIPAA DOT, and US DOT 49CFR 173.6 criteria for handling of medical
      specimens and ensuring a HIPAA secure chain-of-custody procedure for patient information (see
      section 4.9 Medical Courier Service for more details). All collected stool samples will be
      received and processed by the principal investigator (see section 5.0 Stool sample
      preparation, processing, and storage for more details).

      The participant must complete 5 to 7 days of sCDAI symptom recording (the daily online
      surveys) before the start of study diet. They should not complete the 5-7 days of sCDAI
      symptom recording more than 14 days prior to start of study diet. Also, the participant must
      complete 5-7 consecutive days of sCDAI symptom recording no more than 14 days after nominal
      eligibility is determined.

      Adherence to the diet and additional food items consumed (from allowed food lists provided to
      participants) will be recorded using photo food log (uploaded online) and food diary.
