  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this study consists of the study of markers of skin, muscular, neurocognitive and bone aging
      in HIV infected adults and to compare the frequency of these signs to the general population
      of same gender and age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the elevated frequency of cancers as well as cardiovascular, neurocognitive and
      bone diseases seems to denote a process of accelerated aging in the treated HIV-infected
      population of western countries, who are 40 to 50 years old in median. Markers of age-related
      alterations should be compared to the distribution among the general population whenever
      possible, to disentangle the effect of HIV and &quot;normal&quot; ageing or ageing due to other
      conditions. Common mechanisms should be better understood, more specifically those related to
      the impact of tobacco, antiretroviral treatments, and nutritional components. For markers of
      skin, muscle, neurocognitive function and bone ageing, the distribution of the general
      population is available and, in addition, alteration of these markers might have common
      mechanisms, such as insufficiency in 25 hydroxy vitamin D or nutritional parameters.
      Therefore, a joint study of these three organs seems particularly relevant.

      This aim is to study markers of skin, muscular, neurocognitive and bone aging in HIV infected
      adults and to compare the frequency of these signs to the general population of same gender
      and age.
