  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data supporting a role for RANKL signaling in mammographic density and breast cancer
      development has begun to emerge, but clinical trial data providing definitive evidence that
      would allow the adoption of RANKL inhibition in primary breast cancer prevention are not yet
      available. The hypothesis is that RANKL inhibition with denosumab will decrease mammographic
      density in high-risk premenopausal women with dense breasts. To address this, the
      investigators have developed this clinical trial to quantify the impact of RANKL inhibition
      on mammographic density in high-risk premenopausal women with dense breasts and to determine
      the effect of RANKL inhibition on markers of proliferation and biomarkers of breast cancer
      risk. Successful demonstration that RANKL inhibition reduces mammographic density could open
      up additional approaches to primary breast cancer prevention in high-risk premenopausal
      women, who do not have dominant genetic predisposition.
