  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase II study we investigate the benefit of cabozantinib treatment for patients with
      locally advanced or metastasized urothelial cell carcinoma who have been pre-treated with
      checkpoint inhibitors only (cohort 1) or who have been pre-treated with cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors (cohort 2). We are lacking adequate response and
      outcome data in patients after immunotherapy and consider that this study will improve future
      treatment modalities for this important patient cohort.

         19. Sexually active male subjects, unless they agree to use contraception (condom,
             contraception for non-pregnant WOCBP partner) with their partners throughout the study
