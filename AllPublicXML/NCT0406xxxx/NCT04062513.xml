  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repeated and untreated pain can lead to long-term consequences in preterm infants, such as
      pain hypersensitivity and impaired motor and intellectual development. Studies on the
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for pain management in preterm infants
      are limited. Thus, we investigated an intervention based on olfactive stimulation with
      mothers' milk. The aims of this study are: a) Evaluate the effectiveness of an olfactive
      stimulation intervention with mothers' milk odor on preterm procedural pain; b) Evaluate the
      effectiveness of adding a period of familiarization previous to the olfactive stimulation
      intervention with mothers' milk odor on preterm procedural pain. Preterm infants will be
      recruited and randomly assigned to three groups 1) mothers' milk odor during the nine hours
      before and during heel-prick, 2) mothers' milk odor during heel-prick, 3) standard care. Pain
      will be measured using a scale of pain adapted for preterm infants. This procedure with
      mothers'milk odor is inexpensive and easily performed.This study will significantly
      contribute to the advancement of knowledge on preterm infants pain management.

    <description>Scores range from 0 to 21 where a higher score means more pain, a score less than 6 signifies an absence of pain, and a score greater than 12 indicates moderate to severe pain. The PIPP-R contains four parts: gestational age, state of sleep-awake, physiological parameters, and behavioural parameters.</description>
