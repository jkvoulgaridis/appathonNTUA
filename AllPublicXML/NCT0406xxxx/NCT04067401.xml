  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study evaluating a training program to decrease risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors
      among early career trainees in the United States Air Force.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relationship disruptions and social isolation are major precipitants for military suicides
      and a range of problems that impair functioning and reduce mission readiness. However, nearly
      all current military suicide prevention programming focuses on a narrow range of approaches
      for individuals already at high-risk (e.g., training to detect warning signs and refer for
      treatment services). This project addresses the need for universal prevention approaches to
      proactively strengthen protective factors across military populations, including
      strengthening social connectedness and skills to grow and sustain relationships across
      service.

      The aims of this project are to (a) develop an intervention for early-career, enlisted United
      States Air Force personnel using an active training approach to strengthening social bonds,
      and (b) test the intervention (i.e., Wingman-Connect) using a randomized controlled trial
      design.

      Wingman-Connect focuses on Airman-in-Training to build protective factors in: Kinship
      (healthy bonds); Guidance (support from mentors and mental health); Purpose (goals, sense of
      being valued and valuable); and Balance (self-care and support). Half of the training is
      focused on the class as a group to build belonging and shared purpose.

    <intervention_model_description>The study design will involve randomizing approximately 1440 Airman-in-Training (AiT) within 160 Technical Training classes to one of two conditions: Wingman-Connect or a brief Stress Management training. Randomization will occur at the class level, since Wingman-Connect is designed to train AiTs within a class together as a group (those who voluntarily enroll).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Wingman-Connect combines group and individual skill training. Group exercises build cohesion, belonging and shared purpose, and promote value of healthy unit, giving and receiving support. Individual skills promote the ability to thrive during transitions, manage stressors and meet career goals, and decrease barriers to utilizing organizational resources (family, health). The training has a total of 22 modules comprised of specific learning objectives and activities. Six months of text messages (1-2 per week) to reinforce and extend program concepts and skills.</description>

Wingman Connect: Wingman-Connect combines group and individual skill training. Group exercises build cohesion, belonging and shared purpose, and promote value of healthy unit, giving and receiving support. Individual skills promote the ability to thrive during transitions, manage stressors and meet career goals, and decrease barriers to utilizing organizational resources (family, health). The training has a total of 22 modules comprised of specific learning objectives and activities. Six months of text messages (1-2 per week) to reinforce and extend program concepts and skills.</description>

Stress Management: Stress management training reviews the basics of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress-response system; common experiences of stress (physiological, cognitive, emotional); the impact of chronic stress on the brain and other domains of health; how exercise reduces harmful effects of stress; and relaxation techniques that have been shown to reduce stress and adverse effects of stress on health.

Wingman Connect: Wingman-Connect combines group and individual skill training.
