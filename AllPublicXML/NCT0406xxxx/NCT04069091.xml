  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IMPRINT strengthens maternal and child health by screening, treating and preventing maternal
      perinatal depression, the most common complication of pregnancy and the child's first 1000
      days. It is associated with poor pregnancy outcome and perinatal mortality and has adverse
      consequences on physical and mental development of the child. Yet, only 7-28% of women with
      perinatal depression worldwide receive appropriate evidence-based care. This is astounding
      given that the need of investing on mental health is widely recognized and low-intensity
      interventions not requiring costly mental health professionals have been shown to be
      effective.

      IMPRINT improves the effectiveness, reliability, safety, appropriateness, equity and
      efficiency of routine health care provided for the mother and the child during the child's
      first 1000 days of life. The investigators 1) adapt into the gender-, country-, and
      cultural-context an existing evidence-based, low-intensity pregnancy intervention targeting
      maternal perinatal depression (online CBT-based therapy) 2) test in cluster-randomised trial
      the short- and long-term efficacy of the intervention in women who report clinically
      relevant, subthreshold or more severe symptoms in early pregnancy depression screen; 3) study
      biological, psychological and social determinants of depressive symptom severity,
      comorbidities and response to interventions.

    <description>The primary outcome in the women is depressive symptoms measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The EPDS is a self-report questionnaire consisting of a single scale of 10 items, each rated 0-3. Higher total scores (range 0-30) indicate more depressive symptomatology, and scores of at least 10 indicate clinically relevant depressive symptoms, i.e. probable depression.</description>

    <measure>Child developmental milestones</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 8-10 weeks after pregnancy</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome in the children is child developmental milestones measured using the Ages and Stages-3 questionnaires (ASQ-3). The ASQ-3 comprises 30 age-appropriate items measuring communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving and personal/social skills. Each domain comprises six questions with response 'yes' (scored 10) indicating the child can master the skill, 'sometimes' (scored 5) if the skill is emerging or occasional, and 'not yet' (scored 0) if the child is not able perform the skill. Highest domain scores (range 0-60) indicate mastery of the skill. On each domain, scores over 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for the age indicate developmental delay, scores between 1-2 SDs below the mean indicate mild developmental delay, and scores higher than one SD below the mean indicate typical development.</description>
