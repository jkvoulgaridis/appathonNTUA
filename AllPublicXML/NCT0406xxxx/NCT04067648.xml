    <textblock>
      To study the effect of different doses of sufentanil on anesthesia induction and analgesia
      after tonsillectomy in children. According to the different doses of sufentanil used in
      anesthesia induction, the children were divided into 3groups. The vital signs during
      anesthesia, the recovery period of anesthesia and the complications after anesthesia were
      compared among the groups. The anesthetic effects and safety of sufentanil at different doses
      were discussed, which provided theoretical basis for clinical selection of the best drug
      dosage.

      Fifteen minutes before operation, midazolam 0.1 mg/kg was slowly intravenously injected. Five
      minutes later, the child entered the operating room. Pi, Narcotrend, blood pressure, ECG,
      SpO2 and body temperature were monitored. Penehyclidine hydrochloride 0.01 mg/kg,
      dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg, propofol 3 mg/kg, sufentanil (0.3μg/kg, 0.4 μg/kg, 0.5 μg/kg) were
      given during anesthesia induction. cis-atracurium 0.15 mg/kg, using the required type of tube
      for tracheal intubation. Sevoflurane 1.0 MAC + remifentanil 0.15 ug/kg/min 50% oxygen was
      given during anesthesia maintenance. Effective analgesia was achieved by adjusting the dosage
      of remifentanil during operation.

      The changes of vital signs including perfusion index, Narcotrend, Bp, HR, oxygen saturation
      were observed before anesthesia induction, immediately after tracheal intubation, during
      tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy during operation, after extubation and in the recovery room.
      Then record the recovery time, restlessness and pain score during recovery period,
      postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting and other complications.
