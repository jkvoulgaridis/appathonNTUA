  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, retrospective, national observational study aiming to describe
      clinical outcomes of advanced NSCLC patients that performed an ICP re-challenge during their
      history of disease. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ICP re-challenge efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICP), including nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, are
      currently approved by EMA (European Medicines Agency) and ANSM (National Agency for the
      Safety of Medicines and Health Products) for the treatment of advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung
      Cancer (NSCLC) in first or second line with different strategies according to the expression
      of PD-L1. Moreover, durvalumab recently entered the treatment strategy for locally advanced
      disease in PD-L1 expressing (&gt;1%) patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for
      patients with advanced NSCLC is approximately 3 to 4 months with this kind of drugs and
      chemotherapy is currently the reference treatment after progression. However, the scientific
      community is now evaluating the re-challenge strategy. Notably, in patients with metastatic
      melanoma, different trials have shown the efficacy and the good safety of re-challenge with
      ipilimumab or a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab after an initial period of disease
      control with ipilimumab.

      To date, no studies have reported the clinical benefit of ICP re-challenge in patients with
      advanced NSCLC. The effectiveness and tolerance of the re-challenge strategy with the same or
      another ICP remains therefore a major issue.
