  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of fresh metabolically active
      allogeneic umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) for the treatment of
      new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) and to understand the mechanisms of protection. If proven
      effective, such a strategy can be used as a therapeutic option for T1D patients and
      potentially other autoimmune disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to find and enroll participants with new onset Type 1 diabetes (T1D) within
      3 months of the first dose of insulin. T1D is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack
      and destroy insulin-secreting pancreatic β cells leading to insulin deficiency and
      hyperglycemia in patients. Life-long insulin therapy is the major treatment option. However,
      insulin therapy is not a cure and a safer and more effective therapy is needed.

      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have emerged as a novel biopharmaceutical approach for many
      disorders. MSCs are a cellular product that can be derived from a patient's own body
      (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic). This study will obtain MSCs from umbilical cords
      at the time of delivery from normal women who have been extensively screened for infectious
      diseases. These cells produced at the MUSC Center for Cellular therapy will be used within 3
      passages after collection.

      Evidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that MSC infusion suppresses
      autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as T1D. One clear message from these trials is that
      MSCs are effective at suppressing autoimmunity and seem generally safe. This study will
      measure safety and efficacy of MSCs over the course of 1 year.
