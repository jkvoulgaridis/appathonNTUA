  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic syndromes are a major although largely under-recognized health care problem and
      represent the first cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICU). While it has long been
      known that sepsis deeply perturbs immune homeostasis by inducing a tremendous systemic
      inflammatory response, novel findings indicate that sepsis indeed initiates a more complex
      immune response that varies over time, with the concomitant occurrence of both pro- and
      anti-inflammatory mechanisms. As a resultant, after a short pro-inflammatory phase, septic
      patients enter a stage of protracted immunosuppression. This is illustrated in those patients
      by reactivation of dormant viruses (cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)) or
      infections due to pathogens, including fungi, which are normally pathogenic solely in
      immunocompromised hosts. These alterations might be directly responsible for worsening
      outcome in patients who survived initial resuscitation as nearly all immune functions are
      deeply compromised. New promising therapeutic strategies are currently emerging from those
      recent findings such as adjunctive immunostimulation for the most immunosuppressed patients.
      The prerequisite for immunostimulation administration (Interferon gama (IFNg), Granulocyte
      Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 7 (IL-7)) however relies on
      clinicians' capacity to identify patients who could benefit the most from these
      immunoadjuvant therapies, as there is no clinical sign of immune dysfunctions.

      In this context, the main objectives of IMMUNOSEPSIS 4 study are:

        1. to identify the best biomarkers for sepsis-induced immunosuppression

        2. to evaluate ex vivo candidate treatments which could rejuvenate immune functions after
           septic shock
