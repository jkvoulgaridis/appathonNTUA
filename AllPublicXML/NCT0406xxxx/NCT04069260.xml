  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of
      multiple dose levels of SC administered ELX-02 in patients with cystinosis with nonsense
      mutation in at least one allele.

      Six patients will be enrolled in the trial.

      The study will comprise of the following periods for each patient:

        -  A screening period of up to 6 weeks

        -  A total treatment period of 4 weeks

        -  A safety follow-up period of 4 weeks after the last treatment

      Each patient will receive three escalating doses as follows:

        -  Treatment period 1: ELX-02 0.5 mg/kg SC daily for 7 days (total dose not to exceed 3.5
           mg/kg for this week; the daily dose will be individualized to achieve the target weekly
           exposure of about 47.5 µg*h/mL)

        -  Treatment period 2: ELX-02 1.0 mg/kg SC daily for 7 days (total dose not to exceed 7.0
           mg/kg for this week; the daily dose will be individualized to achieve the target weekly
           exposure of about 95 µg*h/mL)

        -  Treatment period 3: ELX-02 2.0 mg/kg SC daily for 14 days (total dose not to exceed 14
           mg/kg for these two weeks; the daily dose will be individualized to achieve the target
           weekly exposure of about 190 µg*h/mL)
