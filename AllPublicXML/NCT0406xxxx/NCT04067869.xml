    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the level of CD4 and CD8 T cell activation in an
      observational cohort study of HIV-1 patients, virosuppressed on combined antiretroviral
      therapy (&lt; 50 copies/ml) for at least 2 years and to focus on two factors that could
      participate in this activation: cytomegalovirus infection and auto-immune disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T cell activation plays a central role in HIV pathogenesis and is highly correlated to
      disease progression even in HIV patients virosuppressed on combined antiretroviral therapy
      since years. The mechanisms underlying this activation in virosuppressed patients are poorly
      understood. Identifying some factors involved in immune activation that can be targeted by
      therapies could optimize the treatment of HIV patients. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the level of CD4 and CD8 T cell activation in an observational cohort study of HIV-1
      patients, virosuppressed on combined antiretroviral therapy (&lt; 50 copies/ml) for at least 2
      years and to focus on two factors that could participate in this activation: cytom√©galovirus
      infection and auto-immune disorders.
