  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study seeks to evaluate the safety, acceptability and feasibility of a shortened
      outpatient procedure for medical abortion at 13-18 weeks gestation. It also seeks to document
      the roles of health workers in providing services related to later abortion care.
      Participants will take a single dose of 200 mg mifepristone orally, followed 24-48 hours
      later with 400 mcg misoprostol sublingually prior to arriving at the study clinic. Repeat
      doses of 400 mcg misoprostol will be administered sublingually every three hours at the
      clinic until the abortion is achieved. If expulsion does not occur by a certain time prior to
      the clinic closing that day, D&amp;E will be performed to complete the abortion.
