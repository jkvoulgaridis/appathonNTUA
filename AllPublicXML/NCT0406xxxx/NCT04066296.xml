      Evaluate the benefit of using liposomal bupivicaine in lumbar laminectomies in terms of
      length of stay, IV narcotic use, 30-day narcotic use, visual analog score (VAS) and 30-day
      readmissions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests the use of liposomal bupivicaine (LB) in lumbar spine surgery
      shortens length of hospital stay and overall post-operative narcotic use. Studies have shown
      its utility in single level microdiscectomies and lumbar fusions, but there have been no
      publications regarding lumbar laminectomies and associated outcomes with LB. The
      investigators' hypothesis is that LB will significantly shorten inpatient stays as well as
      overall narcotic usage in single, double or multi-level lumbar laminectomies.

    <description>The scale is called the Visual Analog Pain scale. This scale provides a measure of the patient's reported level of pain . Patients will be asked to rate their pain level using the Visual Analog Pain scale. This scale uses numbers, 1-10, with 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain. It also uses faces depicting no pain up to the worst pain. Lower reported scores indicate the patient has little to no pain, which is desirable.</description>
