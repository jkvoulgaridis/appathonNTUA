  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cilostazol is a PDE 3 inhibitor, which showed as decrease in HAM-D scores in post-stroke
      depression through inhibition of neurodegeneration in the primary lesion and secondary
      extrafocal sites and through promotion of neurogenesis. These beneficial effects on
      post-stroke depression may be involved in activation of CREB/BDNF signaling.The aim of the
      current study is to evaluate the potential adjunct antidepressant effect of cilostazol in
      adult patients with MDD. Furthermore, we will assess the relationship between HAM-D score and
      BDNF as well as their role as a therapeutic targets of MDD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cilostazol produces various powerful pleiotropic effects via restoration of intracellular
      second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Treatment with cilostazol against
      cerebral ischemic injury ameliorates negative effects of cerebral hypoperfusion through the
      PDE3- cAMP signaling cascade with subsequent activation of inducible transcription factor
      cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), suggesting the importance of the CREB signaling
      pathway.

      Activation of CREB promotes the gene expression of neuroprotective molecules that activate
      subsequent anti-apoptotic pathways with the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF). BDNF also regulates neurogenesis, proliferation, and survival of neural stem
      or progenitor cells, as well as neuronal survival. In addition, CREB and BDNF signaling play
      an important role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder .

      Psychopharmacotherapy with antidepressants or mood stabilizers provides an effective
      treatment for depression after stroke, but alternative therapy by activation of CREB and BDNF
      signaling may exert beneficial effects on various aspects of negative mood. Drugs that
      activate CREB and BDNF signaling may provide a potential therapeutic approach for treatment
      of poststroke depression via neural cell survival and proliferation of neural progenitor
      cells.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the potential adjunct antidepressant effect of
      cilostazol in adult patients with MDD. Furthermore, we will assess the relationship between
      HAM-D score and BDNF as well as their role as a therapeutic targets of MDD.

    <description>The principal measure of the outcome was the 17-items HAM-D. Scoring is based on the 17-item scale and scores of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-13 suggest mild depression, 14-17 moderate depression and scores over 17 are indicative of severe depression. Remission is defined as HAM-D total score ≤ 7 (primary outcome). Treatment response is defined as ≥ 50% drop in the HAM-D total score.</description>
