  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with pembrolizumab
      following disease progression on prior anti-PD-1 therapy in unresectable/metastatic melanoma
      (stage IIIB-IVM1d) or prior anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant setting. Subjects will be
      treated with talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab until confirmed complete response,
      disappearance of all injectable lesions, documented confirmed disease progression per
      modified immune-related Response Criteria simulating Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (irRC-RECIST), intolerance of study treatment, or 102 weeks from the first dose of
      talimogene laherparepvec and/or pembrolizumab, whichever occurs first.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years with histologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB to IVM1d melanoma
             and for whom surgery is not recommended. Subjects with stage IVM1d disease may be
             enrolled with up to 3 cerebral metastases, provided that all lesions have been
             adequately treated with stereotactic radiation therapy, craniotomy, or gamma knife
             therapy, with no evidence of progression and not requiring steroids for at least 2
             months prior to enrollment.

          -  Subjects must have measurable disease and be a candidate for intralesional therapy
             administration into cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal lesions.

          -  Subjects must have had prior treatment (for at least 2 to 3 consecutive cycles within
             an 8 week period) with a PD-1 inhibitor and have confirmed disease progression (as
             defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria). The anti-PD-1 therapy must be the immediate prior
             line of therapy before enrollment and subjects with disease progression on more than 1
             line of anti-PD-1 therapy are not eligible.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal, hepatic, and coagulation function.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects considered by the investigator to have rapid clinical progression due to
             melanoma

          -  Subjects with prior treatment and disease progression on more than 1 line of anti-PD-1
             therapy

          -  Stage IVM1d subjects must not have greater than 3 cerebral melanoma metastases, or
             clinically active cerebral melanoma metastases requiring therapy, and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis regardless of clinical stability.

          -  Primary uveal or mucosal melanoma, history or evidence of melanoma associated with
             immunodeficiency states or history of other malignancy within the past 3 years.

          -  Subjects must not have history or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune
             glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or other symptomatic autoimmune disease, or active
             autoimmune disease or syndrome requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years (ie,
             with use of disease modifying agents, steroids or immunosuppressive agents) except
             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy, or evidence of clinically significant
             immunosuppression.

          -  Subjects may not have been previously treated with talimogene laherparepvec or any
             other oncolytic virus.

          -  Subjects must not have active herpetic skin lesions or prior complications of herpetic
             infection and must not require intermittent or chronic treatment with an antiherpetic
             drug (eg, acyclovir), other than intermittent topical use.

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorizationin both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
