    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects of OsteoCrete in filling bone voids in participants with
      bone voids or defects. OsteoCrete may eliminate the need for further surgery and the removal
      of healthy bone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of the device, which for the purpose of this study is defined as the
      compound injected into bone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of absorption and bone ingrowth.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive OsteoCrete intraoperatively to fill voids that occur in bones during
      surgery or to augment screw fixation.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed for up to 1 year.
