      This trial studies the effects of a dietary intervention based on the Alternative Healthy
      Eating Index (AHEI) on inflammatory markers and breast density in healthy participants. The
      AHEI is a quantifiable measure of diet quality designed to target food and macronutrient
      sources that are associated with chronic disease risk. Adherence to the AHEI may be
      associated with a reduction in inflammatory biomarkers and sex steroid hormone levels
      compared to other dietary patterns/scores.

      OUTLINE:

      DIETARY INTERVENTION: Participants receive dietary counseling with a dietitian in person or
      via telephone to support adherence to a diet based on the AHEI guidelines once weekly for up
      to 12 weeks.

      DUAL X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA) ONLY STUDY: Participants undergo DXA scan for breast density
      measurement at baseline and at 12 weeks.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women will be eligible if they are nulliparous, aged 18-30, and score below 75 on the
             AHEI. Study eligibility will be assessed via online screening questionnaire and online
             Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). These criteria were chosen because of our focus on
             the years before first birth as a critical period for establishing breast cancer risk

          -  Participants must be able to come to two clinic visits, complete questionnaires in
             English, and will be required to discontinue all vitamins and nutritional supplements
             during the study period

          -  DXA ONLY PILOT STUDY: Participants must be able to come to one visit in the Prevention
             Center where they will receive the consent form and undergo the DXA scan. No
             intervention will occur and there will be no follow-up assessments or measurements
             beyond the DXA scan

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women will be ineligible if they are postmenopausal, pregnant, taking hormone therapy
             (e.g., oral contraceptives), or have chronic illnesses that are known to affect
             gastrointestinal absorption of nutrients

          -  Women who obtain a score of &gt;= 75 on the AHEI are also ineligible

          -  DXA ONLY PILOT STUDY: Women who are pregnant
