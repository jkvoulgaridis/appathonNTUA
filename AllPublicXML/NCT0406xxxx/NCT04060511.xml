  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HS-10342 is a small molecular, oral potent, selective CDK4/6 inhibitor. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate the safety/tolerability and the pharmacokinetic profile of HS-10342
      in Chinese advanced solid tumor patients. Preliminary efficacy will be also investigated in
      this study.
