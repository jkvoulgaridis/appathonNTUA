    <textblock>
      This trial studies the delivery of the ENABLE palliative care program by two different
      methods called a Virtual Learning Collaborative or Technical Assistance for patients with
      advanced cancer and their caregivers. Palliative care is specialized medical care for people
      with a serious illness that occurs at the same time as other medical treatment. The purpose
      of palliative care is to provide relief from symptoms and stress of serious illness, to help
      patients and their families clarify goals of care, and to focus on social support and
      spiritual well-being. The focus of the ENABLE palliative care program is on living well,
      managing stress, patient communication of their personal values and hopes for care, social
      support, and symptom management. This study may help doctors find the best ways to include
      palliative care services into their practices and the impact of palliative care on cancer
      patients and their caregivers? quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the effectiveness of Virtual Learning Collaborative (VLC) versus (vs.) Technical
      Assistance (TA) on Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends (ENABLE) program uptake, as
      measured by the proportion of patients who complete the ENABLE program, defined as having a
      palliative care assessment and completing the 6 ENABLE sessions. (Implementation Outcome,
      Patient Level)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the effectiveness of VLC vs. TA on National Cancer Institute Oncology Research
      Program (NCORP) practices? overall ENABLE program implementation, as measured by the General
      Organizational Index (GOI) (Service Outcome, Practice Level)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare NCORP practices randomized to VLC or TA on patient and caregiver quality of life
      (QOL) and mood outcomes. (Patient &amp; Caregiver Outcomes) II. Determine the relationship among
      ENABLE program uptake, overall ENABLE program implementation, and patients? QOL and mood
      across the two strategies.

      OUTLINE: Health care practice sites are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo a palliative care assessment, participate in 6 ENABLE phone-based
      sessions with a nurse coach over 20-40 minutes, and monthly follow-up calls for 6 months.
      Caregivers participate in 3 ENABLE sessions with a nurse coach and monthly follow-up calls
      for 6 months. The practice sites participate in a Virtual Learning Collaborative (VLC)
      consisting of group-based learning sessions, coaching, and applied quality improvement data
      collection, analysis and feedback opportunities monthly for 15 months.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo a palliative care assessment, participate in 6 ENABLE phone-based
      sessions with a nurse coach over 20-40 minutes, and monthly follow-up calls for 6 months.
      Caregivers participate in 3 ENABLE sessions with a nurse coach and monthly follow-up calls
      for 6 months. The practice sites undergo practice-based consultation calls with an
      ENABLE/Technical Assistance (TA) expert monthly for 15 months.

      After completion of the study, participants are followed up at 12 and 24 weeks.

    <description>Defined as having a palliative care assessment and completing all 6 ENABLE sessions. A logit generalized estimating equation model with exchangeable correlation structure (to account for clustering within practice) will be fitted to a binary patient uptake indicator (&quot;yes&quot; if the patient completed a palliative care assessment and all ENABLE program sessions prior to the 12 week assessments and &quot;no&quot; if the patient is still alive but has not completed a palliative care assessment and all six ENABLE program sessions prior to the 12 week assessments), with the group assignment as the main predictor. Model-predicted uptake proportions, odds ratios, relative risks, and confidence intervals for these measures will be used for interpretation. An additional analysis with sex, group assignment, and an interaction between the two as predictors will be conducted to examine whether this biological variable is a possible moderator of ENABLE program uptake.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Due to the small sample size for specific practice-level outcomes (24 VLC versus 24 TA), rather than conducting formal inference, practice-service outcome (i.e., ENABLE program implementation) comparisons will be descriptive statistics and effect size measures. Will use ENABLE General Organizational Index scores to calculate descriptive statistics and effect sizes to describe ENABLE program implementation at each practice cluster.</description>

    <measure>Patient mood and quality of life, measured by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item PROMIS Global Health measure uses Likert-scale response options for each item, ranging from 1 (always) to 5 (never). This instrument produces 2 scores: physical health and mental health score; we will use the the mental health score for mood and the total summary score for quality of life (QOL). We will compare NCORP practices randomized to VLC vs TA on patient mood and QOL.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient quality of life, assessed using the FACIT-Pal.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Pal consists of the FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General), a general measure of quality of life, and the palliative care subscale (Pal), which assesses issues specifically relevant to palliative care. The FACT-G is a 27-item questionnaire that provides a total score as well as four subscale scores: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional wellbeing. The FACIT-Pal includes 19 additional concerns relevant for persons at the end of life. The total score is the sum of the FACT-G (the first 4 subscales) plus the FACIT-Pal subscale.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver mood, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument assesses mood, including anxiety and depression. 7 questions rate the depression subscale and 7 questions rate the anxiety subscale. Each item has a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 to 3 with possible scores ranging from 0-21 for each subscale. Scoring for each sub-scale is as follows: 0-7 Normal, 8-10 Borderline abnormal, and 11-21 Abnormal.</description>
