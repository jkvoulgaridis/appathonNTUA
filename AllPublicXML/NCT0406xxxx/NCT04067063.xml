  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to make a suicide screening in the entire population of Milpa
      Alta (approximately 150,000 inhabitants), taking into account other outcomes such as
      depression, anxiety, alcohol and drugs. For this, an app for Smartphone (MeMind) or a web
      platform (www.MeMind.net) will be used in which the participants will take a
      self-administered questionnaire, composed of several psychometric instruments .

      It is expected that 70% of the population between 15 and 70 years old can do so directly with
      their own Smartphone, although web access posts will be enabled in educational and municipal
      units to avoid discrimination based on age or access to technology.

      Our main hypothesis argues that the early identification of people at risk in almost the
      entire community can be done with an App for Smartphone, serving to depict a map of mental
      health and related needs of the population, serving for the planning of healthcare services
      of the local environment, and ultimately for the best assistance of groups and individuals
      with greater needs through their identification and early reference to medical assistance.

    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is encompassed into MeMind for this purpose.
In C-SSRS, four constructs are measured. The first is the severity of ideation, which is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale from 1=&quot;wish to be dead&quot; to 5=&quot;suicidal intent with plan&quot;.
The second is the intensity of ideation, which comprises 5 items, each rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason for ideation.
The third is the behavior, which is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior.
And the fourth is the lethality, which assesses actual attempts; actual lethality is rated on a 6-point ordinal scale.
Results are coded in the instrument itself with colored labels that indicates definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior, quantify both of them and gauge their severity.
Definitions are available elsewhere (http://cssrs.columbia.edu).</description>
