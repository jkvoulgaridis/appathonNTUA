  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well stereotactic radiation therapy before surgery works in treating
      patients with cancer that has spread to the brain (brain metastases) and can be removed by
      surgery (resectable). Stereotactic radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that
      delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor, and may cause less damage to
      normal tissue. Giving stereotactic radiation therapy before surgery may make the return of
      brain metastases less likely and help patients live longer compared to surgery followed by
      radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the rate of leptomeningeal failure after neoadjuvant radiation therapy (NaRT)
      versus (vs) postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)/stereotactic radiation therapy
      (SRT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Local control of brain metastases. II. Rate of salvage treatment including surgery, SRS,
      SRT, or whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT).

      III. Dose and volume of radiation to adjacent normal brain parenchyma. IV. Rate of
      symptomatic radiation necrosis/steroid dependency. V. Rate of distant brain failure. VI. To
      compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 groups. VII. To determine the number of patients
      who die due to neurologic causes. VIII. To assess quality of life as assessed using
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy?Brain (FACT?BR).

      IX. To evaluate and compare the molecular makeup of tumor tissue in pre vs post radiation
      settings and determine differences in molecular and germline markers.

      X. To evaluate biomarkers and germline markers predicting response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo 1, 5, or 10 fraction of SRS/SRT radiation. Surgery is performed
      within 72 hours of radiation therapy.

      ARM B: Within 2-5 weeks after standard of care surgery, patients undergo 1, 5, or 10 fraction
      of SRS/SRT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

    <description>Local control of brain metastases is defined as tumor has not progressed or recurred with no radiographic or symptomatic progression. Using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for brain metastases, progressive disease will be defined as &gt; 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions; unequivocal progression of enhancing non?target lesions; new lesions; or substantial clinical decline. Will be compared using t test for continuous outcomes, log rank test for time?to?event outcomes and Z test for binary outcomes.</description>
