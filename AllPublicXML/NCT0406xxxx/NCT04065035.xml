      This single-center, split-body, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was
      conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerance of a topical firming body moisturizer when
      used over the course of 12 weeks by women with mild to moderate sagging, crepey skin, and
      overall photodamage on the upper arms. A total of 40 subjects completed study participation
      which included 10 subjects in the biopsy subgroup.

      This single-center, split-body, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial is being
      conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerance of the topical firming body moisturizer when
      used over the course of 12 weeks by women with mild to moderate sagging, crepey skin, and
      overall photodamage on the upper arms.

      Efficacy and tolerance will be assessed through clinical grading at baseline and weeks 4, 8,
      and 12. Efficacy will also be assessed through Corneometer and upper arm circumference
      measurements at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12, and Cutometer and Ultrasound measurements at
      baseline and weeks 8 and 12. Self-assessment questionnaires will be completed at baseline and
      week 12. Digital images will be taken at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12. Vectra H2 3D images
      will be taken at baseline and weeks 8 and 12. BMI will be measured at baseline and weeks 8
      and 12. Biopsies will be collected from a subgroup of at least 10 subjects at baseline and
      week 12 (two biopsies on each arm at each time point; total of 8 per biopsy subject).

      A total of 40 subjects completed study participation which included 10 subjects in the biopsy
      subgroup.

    <masking_description>Prior to the start of the study, Stephens will generate 2 randomization lists (1 for biopsy subjects and 1 for non-biopsy subjects) to establish treatment assignment to 1 arm (left or right) with the other arm untreated (receiving a placebo). Each list will first be created by concatenating blocks of size of 4 subjects, 2 with left arm treated/right arm untreated and 2 with right arm treated/left arm untreated. The lists will then be randomized by variables from 2 independent uniform distributions: 1 to randomize subjects within block and 1 to randomize blocks. After the randomization lists are created, treatment arm will be assigned to each subject number accordingly.</masking_description>
