      COLUMBIA-1 is a Phase 1b/2 platform study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of standard of
      care (FOLFOX plus bevacizumab) alone and in combination with novel oncology therapies in
      first-line metastatic microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS-CRC).

      COLUMBIA-1 is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter, randomized, multidrug platform study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of standard of care (FOLFOX plus bevacizumab) in combination
      with novel oncology therapies in patients with first-line metastatic MSS-CRC. The study is
      designed to concurrently evaluate potential novel combinations with clinical promise using a
      2-part approach. Part 1 is a Phase 1b study of safety, and Part 2 is a Phase 2 study of
      efficacy and safety.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is designed to concurrently evaluate potential novel combinations with clinical promise using a 2-part approach.
Part 1 is a Phase 1b study of safety, and Part 2 is a Phase 2 study of efficacy and safety. The treatment regimens evaluated in Part 2 will depend on the evaluation of safety outcomes in Part 1.
Following a screening period of up to 28 days, subjects will be centrally assigned (Part 1) or randomized (Part 2) to one of the open study arms. In both study parts, study treatment may be administered until disease progression or any discontinuation criteria are met.
In Part 2, experimental arms may be closed early based on futility from results of a planned interim analysis for each study arm. In both parts, new experimental arms consisting of FOLFOX and bevacizumab plus novel agent(s) may be added based on emerging nonclinical and clinical data via protocol amendment.</intervention_model_description>
