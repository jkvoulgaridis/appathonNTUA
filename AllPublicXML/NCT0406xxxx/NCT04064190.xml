  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase 2, open label, non randomized single arm study to determine whether the
      administration of vactosertib with durvalumab will provide meaningful increases in the
      Overall Response Rate (ORR) in patients with urothelial cancers that fail to achieve a CR
      with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 based regimens

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, non-randomized, two-cohort multi center study with a safety
      run-in of 6 patients in Cohort 1. It is anticipated that a total of 48 patients will be
      enrolled.

      Durvalumab will be administered with the standard regimen of 1500 mg intravenously (IV) every
      four weeks. Vactosertib will be administered at a dose of 200 mg PO BID for 5 days per week
      All treatment will be administered up to two years and the trial is anticipated to be
      completed over a period of 36 months.
