      This project will implement a 2 step protocol for multidisciplinary geriatric assessment in
      the Emergency Department (ED) and develop a promising researcher into an expert in
      Implementation Science and Quality Improvement. Candidate: Dr. Lauren Southerland is a
      Geriatric- and Emergency Medicine-trained physician at The Ohio State University Wexner
      Medical Center. She designed and leads the first accredited Level 1 Geriatric ED in the
      Midwest and has prior research on the care of older adults in the ED and in Observation
      Units. Training: The career development plan will build upon Dr. Southerland's unique
      fellowship training in Geriatrics with courses in Implementation and Dissemination Science, a
      Black Belt in Lean Six Sigma, and Master's in Public Health courses. This combination will
      position her as an expert in Implementation research, with the career goal of translating
      validated, effective elements of geriatric care into the daily practice of Emergency
      Medicine. Mentors: Dr. Southerland has an experienced mentorship team who will provide
      guidance in the intricacies of emergency research (Dr. Jeffrey Caterino, MD, MPH primary
      mentor), implementation strategies and studies of hospital staff and nurses (Dr. Lorraine
      Mion, PhD), implementation frameworks and reporting (Dr. Christopher Carpenter, an EM
      physician at Washington University at St. Louis), and identifying environmental and human
      factor barriers to quality care (Dr. Susan Moffatt-Bruce, MD, MPH, a vascular surgeon and
      researcher). Project: Multidisciplinary assessment by geriatricians, physical therapists,
      case managers, and pharmacists identifies and addresses underlying geriatric issues in older
      ED patients. However, only a few EDs across the country have been able to incorporate
      multidisciplinary care for their older patients, due to barriers such as personnel costs,
      work flow culture, and the 24 hour ED care model. We have developed a two-step protocol to
      address these barriers: Step 1 is ED nurses using quick, sensitive screens for fall risk (4
      Stage Balance Test), delirium (Brief Delirium Triage Screen), and frailty (Identifying
      Seniors at Risk Score). Patients with concerning results will be placed in an ED Observation
      Unit for (step 2) multidisciplinary geriatric assessment. Using an ED Observation Unit for
      these extended assessments overcomes the barriers to multidisciplinary geriatric assessment.
      In Aim 1 we will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Lean Six
      Sigma methods to identify and address residual barriers to full implementation. Aim 2 will
      evaluate the effectiveness of this protocol in regards to patient-oriented outcomes
      (functional status and health-related quality of life at 90 days). By using implementation
      frameworks and processes, we will develop a protocol that is effective, sustainable, and
      ready for dissemination to EDs across the US.

    <textblock>
      Older adult patients in the Emergency Department frequently experience poor outcomes due to
      lack of recognition of underlying syndromes, such as delirium, polypharmacy, falls, and
      social needs. This study uses rigorous implementation science processes to implement and
      investigate an ED protocol to screen older adults for these syndromes and address them with
      multidisciplinary geriatric assessments in an ED Observation Unit. Using an Observation Unit
      to evaluate older adult patients at risk is a novel strategy developed to address the current
      barriers of sustainability, cost, and timeliness that arose in prior studies of geriatric
      assessments in an ED setting.

      Specific Aim 1: Implementation: Develop, implement, and sustain a two-step intervention
      providing ED geriatric assessments by combining 1) ED nurse-based screening for geriatric
      syndromes of all older ED patients with 2) multidisciplinary geriatric assessment in an ED
      Obs Unit. Mixed-methods approaches and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation (CFIR)
      will be used to identify resource, organizational, patient, staff, and administrative factors
      that affect protocol adherence. Lean Six Sigma processes will be used to overcome barriers.
      The effects of the protocol in reference to ED quality metrics, staff work flow, and work
      culture will be tracked.

      Hypothesis 1a: Implementation: Lean Six Sigma processes will i) increase ED nurse-based
      screening rates to &gt;80% older adults in the ED and ii) increase protocol fidelity in the Obs
      Unit to &gt;80%.

      Hypothesis 1b: Sustainability: After 6 months of &gt;80% screening, the investigators will
      characterize the necessary elements for sustainability by systematically withdrawing
      implementation support strategies. Hypothesis: Attention to CFIR elements during
      implementation will result in routinization and institutionalization that does not
      significantly decrease with withdrawal or time, as assessed by sustainability surveys.37

      Specific Aim 2: Effectiveness: The investigators will describe the effect of this protocol on
      reducing the decline in functional status and reducing other patient and systems outcomes
      (e.g. health related quality of life (HRQoL)) commonly seen after an ED visit.38-40 To obtain
      patient-centered outcomes, two patient cohorts (pre and post implementation) will be
      recruited.

      Hypothesis 2a: The intervention will reduce the decline in functional status seen after ED
      visits. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, ED revisits, and results
      of the multidisciplinary assessments.

      Hypothesis 2b: Patients will be satisfied with the protocol as assessed by thematic analysis
      of qualitative subject interviews of post intervention patients.
