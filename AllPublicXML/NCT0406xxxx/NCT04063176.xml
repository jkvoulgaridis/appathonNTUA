    <textblock>
      The investigators enrolled 160 patients who visited Moscow state outpatient clinic №9 (and
      its two branches) within six months after acute myocardial infarction. The enrollment lasted
      from 01.03.2014 to 01.07.2015. The observation period is five years. During the first year
      after enrollment in the study, patients had follow-up visits every two months, from
      second-year every six months. Analysis of the prescribed therapy and its changes was carried
      out by the cardiologist in the clinic for the entire observation period, taking into account
      the concomitant diseases /indications/contraindications. Endpoints (the death, repeated
      cardiovascular complications (AMI, stroke), emergency hospitalization due to worsening of the
      main cardiovascular disease, the appearance of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias,
      invasive interventions) were defined during out-patient visits and telephone contact
