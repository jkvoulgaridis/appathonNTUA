      This study is designed as prospective, randomized, open-label, single-centered. In this
      study, healthy adults who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized and receive a BCG
      vaccine either using a conventional needle or MicronJet600 device. After vaccination, adverse
      events and progress will be observed.
