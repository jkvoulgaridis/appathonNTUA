      identification of heart sounds associated with severe aortic stenosis.

    <textblock>
      Prospective, non-randomized, multi-center study of adult subjects referred for
      echocardiography. Total of 200 enrolled subjects at 3 sites. Up to 10 roll-in subjects per
      site. Enrolled subjects will undergo: Vivio data capture, Eko stethoscope capture of heart
      sounds, Standard of care transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Vivio analysis will not be
      available to non-Avicena personnel. Recorded sounds from the FDA-approved Eko stethoscope
      will be presented to an independent expert physician review panel blinded to Vivio and TTE
      results, to compare diagnosis of severe AS using Eko (auscultation) vs. Vivio (algorithms).

    <measure>Secondary Endpoint 4 - Assessment of type and degree of all heart sounds associated with aortic stenosis (mild/moderate/severe).</measure>
    <time_frame>48 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of type and degree of all heart sounds associated with aortic stenosis (mild/moderate/severe). The heart sounds associated with severe aortic stenosis using a traditional electronic stethoscope include S1 (normal), S2 (single or paradoxically split) and a late peaking (mid to late systole) diamond shaped, grade 3 or higher murmur. The Vivio system can detect a single component of S2 (aortic) over the carotid but not the pulmonic component or splitting characteristics. It can also detect the nature and timing of the systolic murmur as transmitted through the vascular system to the carotid. The heart sounds associated with severe aortic stenosis include S1 (normal), presence or absence of S2. Less severe aortic stenosis is characterized by an early to mid-peaking diamond shape murmur with a soft but present aortic component of S2.</description>

             provider/cardiologist.

          3. Willing and able to participate in all study evaluations and allow access to medical
             testing and records.

          4. Signed informed consent or have a legally authorized representative who provides
             informed consent on behalf of the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:
