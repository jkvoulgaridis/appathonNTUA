      This study aims to determine the safety of HB-adMSC infusion and treatment effects of
      HB-adMSC infusion on brain structure, neurocognitive/functional outcomes, and
      neuroinflammation after subacute and chronic neurological injury in adults.

      This study aims to determine the safety of HB-adMSC infusion and treatment effects of
      HB-adMSC infusion on global gray and/or white matter, as well as structural integrity of GM
      and WM regions of interest in the corpus callous and corticospinal tracts as measured by
      fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in specific regions known to correlate
      with specific neurocognitive deficits in patients after neurological injury.
