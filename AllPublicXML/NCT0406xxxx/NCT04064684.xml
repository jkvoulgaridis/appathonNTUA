  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that inhaled steroids in patient with PARDS can decrease
      the days on mechanical ventilator measured by ventilator-free days,to improve the oxygenation
      index (OI) or oxygenation saturation index (OSI) in patients receiving inhaled steroids and
      to show the relevance and feasibility of a larger study by assessing the hypothesis in a
      small cohort of patients. Patient will be treated for a maximum of 10 days. Secondary
      objectives are to reduce the length of stay (LOS) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)
      and hospital admissions; to show less inflammation in the patients receiving inhaled steroids
      by measuring inflammatory markers from tracheal aspirates like Interleukin (IL6, IL8, tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) α, matrix metalloproteinase8 (MMP8) and matrix metalloproteinase9
      (MMP9). Lastly, to show that inhaled steroids can improve residual lung disease evaluated by
      Pulmonary Function Test (PFTs) and Impulse Oscillometry (IOS).
