  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that inhaled steroids in patient with PARDS can decrease
      the days on mechanical ventilator measured by ventilator-free days,to improve the oxygenation
      index (OI) or oxygenation saturation index (OSI) in patients receiving inhaled steroids and
      to show the relevance and feasibility of a larger study by assessing the hypothesis in a
      small cohort of patients. Patient will be treated for a maximum of 10 days. Secondary
      objectives are to reduce the length of stay (LOS) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)
      and hospital admissions; to show less inflammation in the patients receiving inhaled steroids
      by measuring inflammatory markers from tracheal aspirates like Interleukin (IL6, IL8, tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) Î±, matrix metalloproteinase8 (MMP8) and matrix metalloproteinase9
      (MMP9). Lastly, to show that inhaled steroids can improve residual lung disease evaluated by
      Pulmonary Function Test (PFTs) and Impulse Oscillometry (IOS).
