  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective phase II clinical trial to observe the efficacy and safety of
      Camrelizumab combined with AVD in the first-line treatment for patients with advanced
      classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a kind of malignant tumor of the lymph system, approximately 95%
      of which are classical hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL). Currently, ABVD and BEACOPP are commonly
      used in the first-line treatment for cHL. There are about one third of patients, whose
      pre-treatment assessment are mainly advanced cHL, suffering relapse and drug resistance.
      PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway plays an important role in the development and progression of
      cHL. Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab have been used in the therapy in relapsed and refractory
      patients with cHL. Camrelizumab, a humanized anti-PD-1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody, is
      independently developed in China. The goal of our trial is to assess the efficacy and safety
      of Camrelizumab combined with AVD (Epirubicin, Vincristine and Dacarbazine) in the first-line
      treatment for patients with advanced classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.
