  <brief_title>A Study to Test How Well Healthy Men Tolerate Different Doses of BI 1356225</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomised, Single-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial in Parallel Group Design to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Single Rising Oral Doses of BI 1356225 Administered as Oral Solution and Tablets to Healthy Male Subjects, and a Randomised, Open-label, Single-dose, Two-way Cross-over Bioavailability Comparison of BI 1356225 as Tablet With and Without Food</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of the SRD part of this trial are to investigate safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BI 1356225 in healthy male subjects
      following oral administration of single rising doses. The main objective of the BA part of
      this trial will be to explore the influence of food on the bioavailability of tablet fasted
      versus tablet fed

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR),
             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (inclusive)

          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal
             and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  Further exclusion criteria apply
