  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study has the potential to improve rehabilitation during the subacute phase of a
      stroke, aiming to reduce the individual's disabilities and risk of falling, enhance health
      promoting physical activity and independence in ADL.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the RCT is to investigate the effects of an innovative physiotherapy
      intervention, called I-CoreDIST when applied in comprehensive rehabilitation after discharge
      from a stroke unit and throughout the rehabilitation chain.The project comprises three
      related work packages that investigate: 1) effects on postural control and balance in various
      positions and functional activities, 2) effects on and level of physical activity, and 3)
      user's identifications of positive and negative features in content and coordination of
      physiotherapy integrated in post stroke rehabilitation. Function parameters of balance, gait
      and levels of physical activity at baseline and at 12 weeks will be compared to those
      obtained from the standard care group. Semistructured interviews will be conducted to
      identify patients' perceptions of key positive and negative features of content and
      coordination of I-CoreDIST and standard care rehabilitation after a stroke.

    <description>PASS is a validated postural assessment scale specifically designed to assess and monitor postural control after stroke. It contains 12 four-level items (0-3 points) of varying difficulty for assessing ability to maintain or change a given lying, sitting, or standing posture. The scale ranges from 0-36 points, sub-items are summed to calculate a total score. Higher score indicates better postural control.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-3L</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Survey to assess self-perceived quality of life. The EQ-5D-3L comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension.
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <measure>Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Survey to assess self-perceived quality of life. Stroke-Specific Quality-of-Life (SSQOL) scale is designed to measure multiple effects in poststroke patients. The scale consists of 49 questions grouped into 12 domains. Each domain is assessed on 5-point Gutterman type scales. Provides both summary and domain-specific scores. Domain scores are composed of unweighted averages. Summary scores are composed of an unweighted average of the 12 domain average scores. Scores range from 49-245 and higher scores indicate better functioning.</description>

    <description>The intervention starts with an assessment by the physiotherapist to identify the patient's movement problems in order to choose among the 48 exercises in the intervention. Each session lasts for 60 minutes + exercises 5-10 minutes outside of therapy and is performed 5-6 days/per week in the rehabilitation units, and 3 sessions/week + home exercises 30 minutes 3 days per week in home based or outpatient treatment during the 12 weeks period.To allow for individualisation, each exercise contains five levels of difficulty. All exercises demand enhancement of dynamic trunk stability and functional movements.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of exercises that demand enhancement of dynamic trunk stability and functional movements, combined with the following:
Optimised alignment and adaptation to the base of support and often using an unstable reference point for the trunk (therapeutic ball) or the distal body parts.
Enhanced somatosensory integration of hands, feet and face, including reduced influence of vision to enhance somatosensory integration.
Proximal stability prior to selective task-oriented movement of limbs, head, eyes.
Inclusion of dual tasks (motor/motor and motor/cognitive) in exercises and activities such as walking indoors, out-doors and climbing stairs.
Specific hands-on interactions or other adaptations to optimise alignment and neuromuscular recruitment.
Exercises combining core activation and moderate increase in heart rate: in lying, sitting, standing and walking.</description>
