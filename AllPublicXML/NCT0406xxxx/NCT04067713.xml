  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is looking into plasma tumour deoxyribonucleic acid (ptDNA), a substance
      that is shed by cancer cells and can be detected in blood samples. Analysing ptDNA may
      therefore be able to provide more information about the characteristics of prostate cancer.

      This study will involve taking additional blood samples during standard treatment. The
      samples will be analysed in laboratories for levels of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA); which
      gives information on the activity of the cancer; ptDNA; circulating tumour cells (ones that
      are derived from the cancer) (CTCs) and cells that affect immune system.

      The PARADIGM study is not, therefore, testing a new drug. Instead, the study is investigating
      if a new blood test can provide information about which current treatments for prostate
      cancer will work best for future patients with this disease.

      In the future and PARADIGM's ultimate aim is to identify which of the current treatment
      options will work best for patients. The research may also identify new opportunities for the
      development of drugs potentially useful in treating prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and with about 1 in 8 men
      diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. Up to a third of prostate cancer deaths
      occur when cancer spreads to other parts of the body known as metastatic prostate cancer,
      which is a major healthcare burden. Currently, physicians use a maximum of six cycles of
      Docetaxel and continue Abiraterone until disease progression with long term androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT).

      There is no early test to indicate if treatment is working for patients with metastatic
      prostate cancer. Currently Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is not sensitive enough to guide
      treatment alone. Studies in colorectal, lung and prostate cancers have started looking at
      substance called Plasma tumour deoxyribonucleic acid (ptDNA) and correlated presence of ptDNA
      will early relapse. Therefore, this study will investigate if the detection of ptDNA after
      initiating treatment is associated a worse clinical outcome. Our ultimate aim, is to identify
      which of the current treatment options will work best for patients in the future. This
      research may also identify new targets for the development of new drugs to test in clinical
      trials in the future.

      Assessments will include blood taken before and during treatment and at cancer progression.
      In selected centres, an optional Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (WBMRI) will be
      performed before and during treatment for those patients who are eligible. Patients will be
      followed up for a maximum of 5 years at the time they register onto the study. We expect
      recruitment duration to be 18 months.

        Newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer patients starting long term therapy with either
        abiraterone (PARADIGM A) or Docetaxel (PARADIGM D) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

        This is a UK based trial recruiting from approximately 10 sites over 18 months with a
        maximum follow up for 5 years.Patients will be screened at Multi disciplinary teams, and
        patient clinic appointments and those who fulfill eligibility criteria will be offered to
        take part. They will be given the patient information sheet (PIS) to take away and read and
        discuss with family and friends. They will be given the opportunity to ask questions before
        they consent. If the patient wishes, consent can happen on the same day as the PIS was
        given.
