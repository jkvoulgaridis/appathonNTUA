  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension and dyslipidemia are very prevalent diseases in general population, and the
      prevalence is keep increasing especially on population with advanced age. Both diseases are
      major risk factor of cardiovascular disease, and many complication could be induced if not
      managed properly. Also, these diseases need consistent medication for long time, so the
      compliance to the treatment is an important issue for these diseases.

      Treatment effect of olmesartan to hypertension and rosuvastatin to dyslipidemia is already
      proven in previous studies, and these medication does not have interaction with each other.
      By using fixed-dose combination of these drugs, the investigators could improve the
      compliance to medication, and may have better treatment effect.

      In this single center, randomized, phase 4 clinical trial, the investigators divided patients
      into 2 groups, one with fixed-dose combination of 2 drugs, while another with 2 separated
      drugs. Each patient in this study was evaluated at first visit, and outcomes are evaluated at
      26 weeks after the start point of medication. The primary outcome of this study was
      compliance of prescribe medication, and the secondary outcome was blood pressure (systolic,
      diastolic), cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol.
