    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial comparing
      hemocyte autograft (platelet rich plasma) to control injection (placebo) in subjects with
      reported cervical, thoracic or lumbar pain for at least 3 months with Pfirrmann grade changes
      at 7 or less and who are being considered for discography in order to identify pain generator
      discs in evaluation of potential surgical candidates.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit 180 subjects: 60 suffering from lumbar discogenic pain, 60 suffering
      from thoracic discogenic pain and 60 suffering from cervical discogenic pain. In each arm 40
      study subjects will be randomized to receive hemocyte autograft, while 20 will be randomized
      to receive contrast as the control group. All subjects will have blood drawn (50 cc) from any
      access site and have it prepared for hemocyte autograft. Using a 20 gauge introducer and 25
      gauge disc needle, subjects randomized to active condition will have exactly 3 cc of hemocyte
      autograft placed in a 3 cc syringe while subjects randomized to placebo will have exactly 3
      cc of saline placed in a 3 cc syringe. The syringe barrels and tubing will be completely
      covered with opaque tape so that the injector is blinded to the contents. For both
      conditions, 1-2 cc of designated injectant (PRP for active, saline for placebo) will be
      injected into the nucleus pulposus of each identified treatment level disc for lumbar; 0.5-1
      cc for thoracic and 0.5-1 cc for cervical. Primary endpoint will be at 8 weeks after
      injection. After 8 weeks subjects who received placebo are eligible for crossover to
      treatment arm with hemocyte autograft, and subject who received treatment arm are eligible
      for surgery if not improved.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial comparing hemocyte autograft (platelet rich plasma) to control injection (placebo) in subjects with reported cervical, thoracic or lumbar pain for at least 3 months with Pfirrmann grade changes at 7 or less and who are being considered for discography in order to identify pain generator discs in evaluation of potential surgical candidates. Randomization ratio was 2:1. After 8 weeks subjects who received placebo are eligible for crossover to treatment arm with hemocyte autograft, and subject who received treatment arm are eligible for surgery if not improved.
For subjects who cross over, follow-up schedule will reset with visits at 8 weeks and 26 weeks post-crossover.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Investigator, care provider, and participant were all blinded to injection contents (e.g., hemocyte autograft intervention vs. placebo control) An independent blinded evaluator assessed subjects at 4 weeks and 8 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine safety and efficacy of a single injection of hemocyte autograft into diseased discs for the treatment of back and neck pain. The PSFS is a self-report, patient-specific outcome measure designed to assess functional change in patients with pain and musculoskeletal disorders. The total score = the sum of the activity scores (10 maximum, which reflects a better level of functioning)/the number of activities (7 maximum). At least two points improvement on the average Pain Specific Functional
Scale (PSFS).</description>

    <measure>Adverse Event Reporting</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) and any other untoward signs or symptoms were collected at each study timepoint starting at the treatment injection. Serious adverse events (SAEs) determined by the investigator to be related to the study treatment were formally recorded. [NOTE: NONE REPORTED THROUGHOUT STUDY DURATION]</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The NRPS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity for adults. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing 'no pain' to 10 representing 'worst possible pain.' The NPRS can be administered verbally or graphically for self-completion. The respondent is asked to indicate the numeric scale value that best describes the intensity of their pain within the last 24-hours. Clinical improvement was denoted by at least 3 points improvement in Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A measure to gauge improvement in pain symptoms among lumbar and thoracic spine conditions. The ODI is a patient-based questionnaire which gives a subjective percentage score of functionality/disability for a list of activities of daily living among those rehabilitating from lower back pain. There are 6 statements scored from 0-5 (0 is the least pain/no pain, 5 is the greatest level of pain). Clinical improvement is characterized by more than 10% improvement in the ODI from baseline (calculated by [total scored/total possible score]*100).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The most commonly-used self-report measure to gauge improvement in pain symptoms among cervical spine conditions. The NDI is comprised of 10 items (each scored on a 0-5 rating scale, in which zero reflects &quot;no pain&quot; and five means &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;) including pain, personal care, reading, lifting, headaches, concentration, work ,driving, sleeping, and recreation. A higher score indicates greater level of disability. The NDI can be scored as a raw score of doubled and expressed as a percentile. 0-4 points (0-8%) = no disability. 5-14 points (10-28%) = mild disability. 15-24 points (30-48%) = moderate disability. 25-34 points (50-64%) = severe disability. 35-50 point (70-100%) = complete disability. Clinical improvement was indicated by improvement of at least 10% from baseline.</description>

    <description>The investigational product is hemocyte autograft derived from the subject's own blood. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of discogenic pain had a discogram with ¼ cc to ½ cc of contrast injected by hand (leaving up to ½ cc contrast in the needle lumen and connecting tube); any concordant pain will be noted. Subjects received the injectant delineated by coordinator-provided randomization. Subjects were awake for the entirety of study treatment procedure.
All subjects had blood drawn (50 cc) from any access site and double-centrifuged using the EmCyte Hemocyte Autograft system; the first spin separated the buffy coat, the second spin and subsequent siphoning separated a purified platelet sample.</description>
