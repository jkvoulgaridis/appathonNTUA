  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Thoraguard Surgical Drainage System in a
      real-world clinical environment. It is believed that this system will offer functional and
      clinical benefits over the current standard of care system for the removal of surgical fluids
      and air following thoracic surgery. Observations, experiences, and outcomes in a single
      hospital setting will be collected for the Thoraguard Surgical Drainage System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Thoraguard System is intended for use for drainage of blood, fluids, and gases following
      cardiac and thoracic surgery. The system consists of an electronic control module and
      drainage kit (fluid collection canister and drainage line) which connect to a proprietary
      chest tube but may also connect to other thoracic drainage catheters. The system continuously
      monitors line patency, automatically clears the chest tube (when used with Thoraguard Chest
      Tube) and drainage line from build-up, and provides digital readings of fluid output trends.
      The system is battery powered with integrated suction for ease of ambulation.

      Additionally, the system has patient safety alarms to notify clinical staff of unexpected
      events associated with postoperative drainage. These functions offer significant improvements
      over the current standard of care. Reliable post-operative drainage, reduced workload, and
      decreased variability in chest tube maintenance procedures have the potential to increase
      patient safety, reduce complications, and improve the patient experience.

    <description>The Device User Experience Survey is an unvalidated, Sponsor-generated questionnaire aimed to increase the Sponsor's understanding of the usability of the Thoraguard Surgical Drainage System. The questionnaire asks approximately 15 questions (includes yes/no responses, rating scales, and fill-in-the-blank sections) and is to be completed by the treating clinicians at the completion of the study. A summary of all treating clinician responses will be generated at the completion of the study to summarize the overall user experience with the device.</description>
