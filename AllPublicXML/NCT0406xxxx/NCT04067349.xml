      The role of laparoscopic liver surgery with respect to clinical outcome remains unclear. The
      investigators hypothesized that laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) is associated with better
      postoperative recovery than open liver resection (OLR).

      Twenty-one patients who underwent LR were included in this study (11 OLR (52.4%) and 10 LLR
      (47.6%), respectively). Postoperative recovery was measured by bicycle stress testing at
      months 1 and 6 after surgery and compared to preoperative stress testing. Standardized
      performance for bicycle stress testing was calculated based on age, sex, height and weight.
      Postoperative recovery was compared between groups as change of performance (%).
