  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioural family intervention (CBFI) is a brief psychosocial intervention that
      incorporates the model of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) into the family context. It
      builds upon the current trend of family interventions/psychoeducation with refocusing on the
      cognitive model within the family interpersonal relationship. Existing literature indicates
      that CBFI may be effective in improving positive and negative symptoms of people diagnosed
      with schizophrenia immediately following the programme. This mixed-method is to evaluate the
      feasibility and effectiveness of a CBFI programme for people with schizophrenia and their
      families in a local context. The findings may accumulate more evidence that CBFI is a brief
      and effective psychosocial intervention that is adapted to Hong Kong clinical settings.
