  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, translational study designed to explore the feasibility of molecular imaging
      with FBA-A20FMDV2, radiolabelled with fluorine-18 ([18F]-FBA-A20FMDV2), in patients with SH
      and CASH in hepatic metastatic disease. FBA-A20FMDV2, a synthetic peptide derived from the
      foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), has been shown pre-clinically to specifically bind to
      the epithelial specific integrin αvβ6 which is known to be overexpressed in tumours. In this
      study, we aim to evaluate the uptake of [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV2 ([18F]-IMAFIB) in patients with SH
      and CASH in CRC hepatic metastatic disease using PET. Up to ten subjects will undergo
      [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV-PET scanning. An adaptive study design will enable us to determine the
      optimal imaging protocol for future studies.

      This is a pilot study in two parts that aims to determine the feasibility of conducting
      PET-MR imaging using [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV2 ([18F]-IMAFIB) and novel PET-MR imaging in patients
      with SH and CASH in CRC hepatic metastatic disease. A combination of factors will be used to
      determine the feasibility of [18F]-IMAFIB PET-MR imaging including visual adequacy of the
      PET-MR image, adequate signal to noise ratio and the ability to evaluate changes in
      [18F]-IMAFIB uptake and PET-MR parameters. In addition, the operational feasibility of this
      study will be assessed. Up to 10 patients will be evaluated in this study. The number of
      patients to be included in this heterogeneous cohort of patients has been based on
      feasibility considerations taking into account recruitment rates and not on any formal
      statistical evaluation. An adaptive study design will be used with patients with imaging
      results being continuously assessed. In the first part 3 patients will be imaged, 2 with
      severe biopsy proven SH and one with severe CASH. Thereafter, depending on the imaging
      results, the second part will include up to 7 patients with mild to moderate SH and those
      with mild to moderate CASH. If there are major changes in the imaging protocol an amendment
      to the ethics committee will be submitted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to give written informed consent prior to admission to this study.

          -  Female or male aged ≥18 years.

          -  Patients with clinical or histological diagnosis of SH or CASH, having received
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy for CRC hepatic metastatic disease prior to hepatic
             resection.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential or male patients with female partners of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception as described in the
             protocol from the day of the scan and until 4 weeks after the scan.

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing potential performed
             on the day of the PET Scan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Breast feeding or pregnant women female patients.

          -  Previous or current exposure to animals that may harbour the FMDV.

          -  Previous long-term (≥ 3 months) residence in a country where FMDV is endemic (most
             parts of Africa, Middle East, Asia and parts of South America; see Appendix 1).

          -  Participant feels unable to lie flat on their back for a period of up to 95 minutes in
             the scanner.

          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of
             a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of the tracer, may affect the
             interpretation of the results, render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications or interferes with obtaining informed consent.

          -  Contraindications to MRI scanning (as assessed by MRI safety questionnaire) which
             include, but are not limited to:

               1. Intracranial aneurysm clips or other metallic objects.

               2. History of intra-orbital metal fragments that have not been removed by a medical
                  professional.

               3. Pacemakers, or other implanted cardiac rhythm management devices and non-MR
                  compatible heart valves.

               4. Inner ear implants.
