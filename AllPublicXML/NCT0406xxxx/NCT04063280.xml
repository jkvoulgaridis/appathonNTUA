  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center randomized controlled trial in only 24 patients showed a significant reduction
      of the recurrence rate by treatment of the normal appearing perimeter of the EMR defect using
      the argon plasma coagulator (2). A recent non-randomized trial suggested a substantial
      reduction by treatment of the perimeter with the snare tip in the soft coagulation mode (3).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The previous study using STSC was a non-randomized trial. In this trial investigators hope to
      provide definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of APC and STSC vs control. It is
      hypothesized that Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) or Snare Tip Soft Coagulation (STSC)
      treatment of the perimeter of the Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) defect will reduce the
      recurrence rate of adenomas when compared to our control of no treatment.
