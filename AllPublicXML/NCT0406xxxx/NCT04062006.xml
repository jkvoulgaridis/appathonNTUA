    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the clinical and immunological efficacy of low-dose Interleukin-2
      (IL-2) on polymyalgia rheumatica.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a single center, open-label, prospective study that routinely
      administered low-dose IL-2 therapy to monitor the improvement of clinical and laboratory
      parameters to explore its efficacy and to observe changes in immune cell subsets and
      cytokines. One million units of Recombinant Human Interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) was administered
      subcutaneously five days every week for 4 weeks and then once a week for 8 weeks. All
      patients were followed up for 3 months after treatment.
