  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every patient included in the study will undergo 1 conventional hemodialysis treatment, ie 1
      study visit. During the conventional hemodialysis treatment lasting 4 hours, 2 blood samples
      will be taken at different time points (5 minutes after dialysis start and 240 minutes after
      dialysis = at the end of the dialysis session) to evaluate coagulation activation (TAT,
      PF1+2). Hemodialysis session parameters (arterial and venous pressure, TMP, OCM, BVM and
      prefilter pressure) will be noted at different time points (T5, T30, T60, T120, T180, T240).
      After discontinuation of the dialysis session, total cell volume will be measured using the
      Renatron II system® and the number of open fibers will be determined using micro-CT scanning.

    <description>number of open fibers of dialyzer counted after microCT scanning of dialyzer membrane. Dialyzers were collected after the hemodialysis study treatment. All patients underwent their study treatments between October - December 2018. All micro CT scans were performed using the same scanner in Fabruary and March 2019.</description>

    <description>4h hemodialysis session using standard polysulphone dialyzer and Nikkiso dialysis monitors
Minimal dose of unfractionated heparin (UFH) with loading dose 500IE and maintenance 500IE/h, stopped 60 minutes before session end in case of AVF use.
Standard bicarbonate-based ultrapure dialysate. Na, K, Ca, bicarbonate concentrations according to the patient's routine dialysis prescription.
The blood flow rate maximized as per routine nursing care.
Dialysate flow rate fixed at 500 ml/min.
Dialysate temperature between 35.5°C and 36.5°C.
Ultrafiltration according to patient's dry weight and supported ultrafiltration rate.
At the end of the dialysis session the blood will be returned (100ml/min) to the patient.</description>
