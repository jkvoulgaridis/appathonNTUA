  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have provided extremely valuable information on
      medical therapies and procedures that have changed the way heart diseases are treated.
      However, despite these contributions, traditional RCTs are costly, the findings may not be
      applicable to patients unlike those in the study, and the use of trial findings may be
      infrequent. These limitations may be addressed by incorporating 'big data' in RCTs, which is
      the emerging field using electronic information that is routinely collected in various large
      administrative health databases. The Community Heart Outcomes Improvement and Cholesterol
      Education Study (CHOICES) will test the potential of using 'big data' in a 'real-world'
      clinical trial to measure outcomes using routinely collected health information. CHOICES aims
      to increase the use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to prevent heart attack and stroke
      in high-risk health regions across Ontario using a 'toolbox' of interventions. The 'toolbox'
      of interventions are informational strategies targeted for both patients and family
      physicians to help improve cholesterol management and contribute to shared decision making
      for heart healthy goals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 19,500 cardiac events could be prevented each year in Canada by use of statin
      therapy as recommended in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's Lipid Guidelines. Despite
      substantial evidence supporting statin use, several studies suggest dyslipidemia management
      in Canada remains suboptimal. In Ontario, prior work using the 2008 Cardiovascular Health in
      Ambulatory Care Research Team (CANHEART) 'big data' registry of almost the entire Ontario
      population of 9.8 million adults created through linkage of 17+ population health databases
      at ICES, has documented an approximate 2-fold variation across the province in cardiovascular
      events that is associated with performance of key cardiovascular preventive measures,
      particularly lipid screening and statin prescribing. This work noted that the variation did
      not have a clear association with traditional clinical risk factors or socioeconomic
      conditions. This observation suggests that heterogeneity in this care process may be
      modifiable with an intervention geared to improving adherence to national guidelines.

      In this pragmatic, cluster randomized registry trial, 'big data' is used to test the 'real
      world' effectiveness of a tailored, multicomponent intervention strategy aimed at improving
      lipid management (screening, risk assessment, statin initiation, statin adherence) amongst a
      primary prevention cohort of 40 to 75 year olds individuals living in 14 (of 28) communities
      in Ontario with higher than average rates of cardiovascular events. A multicomponent
      intervention strategy will include a 'toolbox' of lipid management resources for both patient
      and physicians in the intervention (high-risk) communities of the province. The intervention
      strategy will include tools to enable patients and physicians to make informed and shared
      decisions about statin therapy and will be implemented in the intervention communities using
      targeted local and social media strategies. Patient characteristics for those aged 40 to 75
      and clinical outcomes in this study will be measured without primary data collection using
      the 2016 CANHEART 'big data' registry, with the exception of stain use and adherence data
      available only in adults 66 to 75 years old.

The usual standard of care will follow clinical daily practice patterns provided by family physicians in Ontario for CVD prevention. This follows the periodic standard of care provided by Canadian cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes best practice guideline recommendations utilized based on each physician's clinical judgement, physical assessment, and discretion. Patients also typically have access to existing cardiovascular prevention materials offered online through publicly available websites.</description>

    <description>The 14 communities that are in the intervention arm of the trial will receive a multicomponent intervention that provides both physicians and patients with access to a 'toolbox' of lipid management resources. The components planned for the 'toolbox' are all evidence-based interventions and chosen after consultations with Canadian family physicians and implementation science experts based on their potential for scalability to the entire population, cost and practicality. Online tools will be used and the trial will leverage pre-existing implementation initiatives (e.g., newsletters, listservs) wherever possible to minimize study costs and increase accessibility.</description>
