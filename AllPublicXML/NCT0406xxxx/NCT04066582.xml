  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an established medical imaging technique that uses
      light to capture biological images from within optical scattering media (e.g., biological
      tissue). A high-resolution OCT has the characteristics of non-invasive, label-free,
      real-time, cellular resolution with high tissue penetration depth that are highly valuable
      for clinical use.

      AMO has developed an in-vivo OCT scanning system prototype based on the clinical needs and
      potential applications. This study is designed as an early feasibility study aiming for
      validation of AMO's in-vivo OCT scanning system in dermatology through collaboration with
      Mackay Memorial Hospital. The OCT can provide cellular-resolution (&lt;1μm in lateral and axial
      directions) images which can be utilized to identify organelles. A high-resolution OCT has
      the characteristics of non-invasive, label-free, real-time, cellular resolution with high
      tissue penetration depth that are highly valuable for clinical use.

      The proposed scenario in this study is to collecting OCT images of skins with suspicious
      lesion including tumor, inflammatory diseases or pigment alteration as well as normal skin by
      using AMO's in vivo OCT imaging system. By using traditional pathological biopsy images or
      dermoscopic images as gold standard references, investigators will try to identify different
      characteristics in OCT images of skin with suspicious lesion including tumor, inflammatory
      diseases, or pigment alteration as well as normal skins.
