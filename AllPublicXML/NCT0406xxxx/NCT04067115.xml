  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the trabectedin and irinotecan in the treatment of Ewings sarcoma, with
      a EWS-FLI1 mutation. Patients will also receive an infusion of 18F-FLT in combination with a
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan to help evaluate the effect of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trabectedin and Irinotecan may inhibit the activity of this Ewing sarcoma mutation.
      Trabectedin may suppress the proliferation of the gene involved in DNA damage response. It
      blocks EWS-FLI1 by inactivating the fusion protein and silences the target genes.

      Irinotecan also suppresses the genes regulating the tumor cells, generating DNA damage.
      Together, these drugs work in combination to suppress the gene regulating the tumor cells.
      This combination may suppress the activity of the tumor regulating genes, disrupting the
      activity of the genes. The infusion of 18F-FLT in combination with a Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET) scan will demonstrate whether the target cells have been suppressed.

    <measure>The recommended dose (RD) of trabectedin administered in combination with low dose irinotecan</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The recommended dose will be established by enrolling patients at the lowest dose and observing them for dose limiting toxicity. Dose limiting toxicity describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment. The maximum tolerated dose is the highest dose of a drug or treatment that does not cause unacceptable side effects. If 0 of the first 3 subjects experience DLT, the study will proceed to the next dose level. If 1 subject experiences a DLT, that dose level cohort will be expanded to 6 total subjects. If no additional subjects experience DLTs at that dose level cohort, the study will proceed to enroll the next dose level cohort.
If â‰¥ 2 of 6 subjects experience DLT, then that dose level is the recommended dose of trabectedin (RD). The study will proceed to the same process for the irinotecan escalation.
If 2 or all 3 subjects experience DLT, that dose level is the recommended dose of trabectedin (RD).</description>
