    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effects of a 12-week protein-rich individualized nutritional
      therapy combined with different time-efficient exercise programs on overall physical fitness
      (cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular fitness), inflammation, and muscle mass/body
      composition in patients with malignant disease undergoing curative or palliative anti-cancer
      treatment

    <measure>Patient-reported performance status-1</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported performance Status will be assessed using the ECOG Performance Status questionnaire. It describes a patient's level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability. The score ranges from 0-5 (lower values = better outcome).</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported performance status-2</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported performance status-2 will be assessed using the Karnofsky index. It is used methods to assess the functional status of a Patient. The score ranges from 0-100 (higher value = better outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported QoL will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. It contains 30 questions (items), representing various aspects/dimensions of QoL (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), and 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea).The scales of the different dimensions of QoL (higher values = better outcome) and symptoms (lower values = better outcomes) range from 0-100.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed using the FACIT-Fatigue scale. It contains 13 items (different aspects/dimensions of fatigue) each assessed on a scale of 0-4, with lower values indicating a better outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported Physical Activity (PA) will be assessed using the the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). IPAQ records 4 aspects of PA (job-, transportation-, housework-, and leisure-time-related). There are two forms of output from scoring the IPAQ. Results can be reported in categories (low, moderate or high PA levels) or as a continuous variable (MET minutes a week, 1 MET = resting energy expenditure). MET minutes represent the amount of energy expended carrying out physical activity. High PA = at least 1500 MET minutes/week; moderate PA: at least 600 MET minutes/week; low PA: &lt; 600 MET minutes/week. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Inflammatory blood markers</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Inflammation will be assessed by measuring blood levels (mg/L) of c-reactive protein (CRP) and high-sensitivity creactive protein (hs-CRP).</description>

    <measure>Cardiometabolic Risk Profile (Metabolic Syndrome Z-Score, MetS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MetS will be calculated MetS-Z-Score will be calculated from each individual's measures of waist circumference (cm), mean arterial blood pressure (mmHg), blood levels of glucose (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL), and HDL-cholesterol (mg/ dL), based on equations specific to sex.</description>
