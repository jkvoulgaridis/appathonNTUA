  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify new methods of measuring and improving collaborative
      goal setting between patients and clinicians in adult cystic fibrosis care.

      This study has 3 specific aims: Aim 1 will assess the construct validity of the coopeRATE
      Measure in the before phase of a before-and-after study in adult cystic fibrosis care
      settings. The coopeRATE Measure is a generic, patient-reported experience measure of
      collaborative goal setting that was recently developed in consultation with patients and
      other key stakeholders. Aim 2 will assess the impact of the coopeRATE Prompt intervention on
      collaborative goal setting and other outcomes in a before-and-after study in adult cystic
      fibrosis care settings. The coopeRATE Prompt intervention is a set of questions delivered to
      patients immediately before the clinical encounter that elicit their concerns and goals. Aim
      3 will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the coopeRATE Prompt and
      Measure in routine adult cystic fibrosis care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Collaborative goal setting</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the health care visit (Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>A new 3-item patient-reported measure under evaluation to assess collaborative goal setting between a patient and their clinician during the health care visit. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 ('Strongly disagree') to 3 ('Strongly agree'), with an additional 'Not sure' option. Scoring method is to be determined.</description>

    <description>Patient-reported shared decision-making during the health care visit, assessed using the 3-item collaboRATE measure (Elwyn et al., 2013; Barr et al., 2014). Each item is rated on a 10-point scale ranging from 0 ('No effort was made') to 9 ('Every effort was made'). Respondent's are assigned a score of 1 if every item is rated 'Every effort was made' and a score of 0 for all other response combinations.</description>
