  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II placebo-controlled intervention trial assessing aspirin (ASA) as a UV
      protectant in patients at risk for melanoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While melanoma risk is largely genetically determined, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation
      in sunlight is the major environmental risk factor. Although sunscreen use can reduce
      melanoma risk 2-fold, its efficacy has been questioned, and most patients do not apply
      sunscreens properly.

      This study will evaluate the downstream effects of aspirin (ASA) in human blood and skin
      moles (nevi) following oral ingestion. We will determine if chronic ingestion of ASA can
      modulate UV-sensitivity of the skin, UV-induced damage in nevi, and PGE2 levels in blood and
      nevi.
