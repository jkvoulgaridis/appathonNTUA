      The study aims to explore the clinical and immunological efficacy of low-dose IL-2 on
      Behcet's Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a single center, open-label, prospective study that routinely
      administered low-dose IL-2 therapy to monitor the improvement of clinical and laboratory
      parameters to explore its efficacy and to observe changes in immune cell subsets and
      cytokines. One million units of rhIL-2 was administered subcutaneously five days every week
      for 4 weeks and then twice a week for 8 weeks. All patients were followed up for 3 months
      after treatment.

These 8 variables are: fever, abdominal mass, abdominal tenderness, intestinal complications, extraintestinal manifestations, general well-being, abdominal pain, and total number of liquid stools. The last 3 variables are scored over 7 days by the participant on a diary card. Abdominal pain will be measured using the 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) to standardize the evaluation of pain and the result of 11-point NRS will be divided into 4 grades (none, mild, moderate, severe) to fill out the DAIBD. where, None indicate 0; Mild indicate 1-3; Moderate indicate 4-6; Severe indicate 7-10.</description>
