    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-centre two-arm randomized controlled trial. Both groups receive standard
      wound care + hydration. The intervention group also receives microcurrent therapy. Patients
      with surgical incisions from bilateral Brachioplasty procedures will be included in this
      study. One arm will be randomized in the intervention group and one arm in the control group.
      Objective and subjective outcomes are registered. The aim of this study is to investigate
      whether the outcomes of the patients of the intervention group differ significantly from the
      patients in the control group.

      Study procedures:

      Description of the clinical-investigation-related procedures in order of occurrence.

      Measurements will be carried out at the following time-points:

        -  15 days after surgery

        -  90 days after surgery

        -  180 days after surgery

      Measurement procedures:

      All patients will respect a 30 minute acclimatisation period in the measurement room with
      standardised room temperature (20-22°C) and relative humidity (40-50%). Patients will be
      asked to remove their silicones and pressure garments the evening before the actual
      measurement. The scar site used for testing is marked with a circular adhesive marking with a
      diameter of 30 mm. A picture is taken to establish the location. The following optimal
      patient position is recommended. For measurements on forearms and upper arms a seated
      position with the arm on a (massage) table.

      Order of occurrence:

        1. Intake questionnaire

        2. Digital photographs

        3. Patient and Observer Scar Assessment

        4. Colour measurement

        5. Hydration measurement

        6. Elasticity measurement

        7. Quality of Life questionnaires

      Intake questionnaire Patient will be asked to fill out an intake form with all relevant
      information for the study. This will include age, body weight, gender, ethnicity, date of
      surgery, smoking, scar revision or initial treatment,

      Digital Photographs A digital photograph will be taken from the patient's face and/or neck.
      This photograph will be taken from a standardised distance.

      Patient and Observer reported Scar Assessment Scale (PSAS-OSAS) The POSAS aims to measure
      scar quality. Current developments in scar treatment necessitate reliable and valid scar
      assessment tools. The POSAS is a comprehensive scale that is designed for the evaluation of
      all types of scars by professionals and patients. The Patient Scale gives the POSAS an
      important extra dimension because the patient's opinion is mandatory for a complete scar
      evaluation. When patients indicated may update their opinion without having to visit the
      hospital. This can be achieved at their convenience by internet or e-mail.

      Clinimetric studies support the use of the POSAS for subjective scar evaluation. The first
      publication on the POSAS (Version 1.0) was in 2004. With one extra item for the Observer
      Scale and minor textual modifications POSASv2.0 was tested on linear scars and published in
      2005.

      The POSASv2.0 consists of two parts: a Patient Scale and an Observer Scale. Both scales
      contain six items that are scored numerically on a ten-step scale from 1 (= healthy skin) to
      10 (= worst imaginable scar). Together they make up the 'Total Sum of Scores' of the Patient
      and Observer Scale. Furthermore category boxes are available to score nominal parameters
      (e.g. type of colour). Moreover, the patient and observer also score their 'Overall Opinion'.

      Colour measurement with Mexameter® Light is generated by a source lamp and is dispersed into
      its constituent wavelengths in a monochromator which results in a narrow band of the
      dispersed spectrum passing from the exit slit of the device. Suitable optics is used to lead
      this light, of a narrow wavelength band, to the sample being measured. A sample with an
      UV/Visible chromophore sample absorbs a certain amount of light and a suitable detector in
      the spectrophotometer detects the remaining light. The Beer-Lambert law is then applied to
      determine the concentration of the remaining light in the sample at a specific wavelength.
      The most commonly used wavelengths are 568 nm (green), 660 nm (red) and 880 nm (infrared). A
      melanin index can be computed from the results of red and infrared wavelengths and an
      erythema index is calculated from the results of green and red wavelength. Draaijers et al.
      stated that it is easier to understand the meaning of the erythema and the melanin index than
      the L*a*b* values.

      Hydration measurements with Corneometer CM825 The measuring principle is based on the
      capacitance method. Technical description of this type of instrument and its use has been
      published by many authors. Both probes (analog and digital) contain an inter-digital grid of
      gold electrodes, covered by a low dielectric vitrified material. A resonating system in the
      instrument detects the frequency shift of the oscillating system related to the capacitance
      (and hence hydration) of the biomaterial in contact with the probe. Unlike other instruments,
      there is no direct galvanic contact between the electrodes of the Corneometer and the skin
      surface. To enable a constant pressure of the probe on the skin surface a spring system is
      incorporated. According to the manufacturer the pressure of the old analog probe is in the
      range of 1.1-1.8 N, the new digital probe operates at a lower pressure (about 1 N or less).
      The Corneometer is factory-calibrated using an in vitro method. The principle of this in
      vitro calibration system developed by Courage-Khazaka for the Corneometer is based on the use
      of a C-K reference filter pad soaked with a calibration solution (saturated NaCl solution in
      water). With this impregnated filter pad a maximal hydration value of 120 ± 5 AU can be
      attained. When covering the surface of the impregnated pad with one layer of a very thin
      polyurethane foil, a hydration value of about 20 ± 5 AU should be obtained.

      Elasticity measurements with Cutometer® MPA580 The Cutometer® is designed to measure
      elasticity of the upper skin layer using negative pressure which mechanically deforms the
      skin. The measuring principle is based on the suction method. Negative pressure is created in
      the device and the skin is drawn into the aperture of the probe and released again after a
      defined time. Inside the probe the penetration depth is determined by a non-contact optical
      measuring system. This optical measuring system consists of a light source and a light
      receptor and two prisms facing each other that project the light from transmitter to
      receptor. The light intensity varies due to the penetration depth of the skin. The resistance
      of the skin to the negative pressure (firmness) and its ability to return to its original
      position (elasticity) are displayed as curves (penetration depth in mm/time) in real time
      during the measurement. This measurement principle allows data collection on the elastic and
      mechanical properties of skin surface and enables objective quantification of skin aging. The
      Cutometer® measures the vertical deformation of the skin in millimetres when the skin is
      pulled by means of a controlled vacuum into the circular aperture of the probe.

      Quality of Life Questionnaires

      EQ5D:

      The EQ-5D was developed by the EuroQol Group, an international, cross-disciplinary group that
      was set up in 1987 to investigate issues related to the evaluation of health. It has been
      translated to more than 60 languages, is used worldwide and has previously been used in
      Swedish population. The reliability and validity of EQ-5D have been documented, both in
      general and in burns-specific population.

      The EQ-5D descriptive system encompasses five questions covering five dimensions: mobility,
      self-care, usual activities, pain and anxiety/depression. For each dimension, respondents
      value their health by reporting whether they are experiencing 1 = ''none'', 2 = ''moderate''
      or 3 = ''extreme problems''. A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining the
      responses (1, 2 or 3) on each of the five dimensions. The EQ VAS is a vertical 20-cm line
      graded from 0 = ''worst possible health state'' to 100 = ''best possible health state'', on
      which the respondent is asked to mark his or her own current state of health. The EQ-5D
      health state can also be converted into a weighted index. The conversion into the index is
      based on norm values obtained in population-based enquiries. The EQ-5D index ranges from
      0.594 = ''death or worse than death'' to 1 = ''full health''.

      Dermatology Life Quality Index:

      The Dermatology life Quality Index (DLQI) is a ten-question questionnaire used to measure the
      impact of skin disease on the quality of life of an affected person. It is designed for
      people aged 16 years and above.

      There are 10 questions, covering the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and
      home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex,
      treatment. Each question refers to the impact of the skin disease on the patient's life over
      the previous week. Each question is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible score range from 0
      (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on
      quality of life)

    <description>Micro current therapy is a therapy to treat humans / animals using electric current with amperages flowing in the μA range. The device offers 2 treatment methods: manual treatment, which requires manual input corresponding to the mentioned parameters, and automatic treatment which, depending on the clinical picture and the currently measured resistance between the electrodes, allows the device to automatically change the mentioned parameters. For this study the investigators use an automatic treatment with predefined settings. This automatic programme consists of a variation of 20 different frequency settings during 17 minutes. This programme is repeated one time which leads to a total treatment time of 34 minutes. The intensity setting for the treatment is between 200 and 350 µA. The treatment is applied 5x per week in the first 6 weeks. The treatment is stopped after six weeks.</description>
