      This study is an open-label, two-part study to determine the absolute bioavailability (BA) of
      OZ439 using simultaneous intravenous [14C]-OZ439 microdose/800mg oral dosing and to
      investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of OZ439 granules administered as single doses
      suspended in different volumes and when co-administered with a single dose of Cobicistat, a
      strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, to healthy subjects in fasted state.

      Primary objectives of this study are:

        -  to determine the absolute bioavailability of OZ439 following a single oral dose of OZ439
           dispersion and a simultaneous single intravenous (iv) microdose (100 μg) infusion of
           [14C]-OZ439 under fasted conditions (Part 1)

        -  To evaluate the effects of a single oral dose of cobicistat, a strong cytochrome P450
           (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single oral dose of a
           dispersion of OZ439 simple granules under fasted conditions (Part 2)

        -  To evaluate the PK of single doses of OZ439 granules when restricting the target dosing
           volumes to 64.5 or 100 mL (Parts 1 and 2)

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of OZ439 when administered alone, and to assess
           the safety and tolerability of OZ439 and cobicistat when co-administered as single doses
           to healthy subjects (Parts 1 and 2)

        -  To determine the PK parameters of OZ439 single iv microdose (100 μg) infusion of
           [14C]-OZ439 (Part 1)

        -  To assess the effects of the total dosing volume and of dose to volume ratio on OZ439 PK
           under fasted conditions (Parts 1 and 2)

        -  To determine the PK parameters and exposures of cobicistat (Part 2)

      <desc>13 subjects (50%) reported a total of 29 TEAEs. In addition, a total of 3 AEs that had started prior to dosing were reported. These AEs did not preclude randomization and dosing of the subjects. There were no deaths or SAEs reported during the study. All TEAEs were transient and resolved without sequelae. One TEAE was still ongoing at the time of follow-up. None of the subjects were discontinued during the study due to TEAEs.</desc>
