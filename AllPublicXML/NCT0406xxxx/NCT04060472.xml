      1. Advantages of albumin-bound paclitaxel Paclitaxel for injection (albumin-binding type)
      uses human serum albumin (HAS) as a carrier, and paclitaxel and HSA are made into
      paclitaxel-bound albumin nanoparticles by a high-pressure homogenization technique. After
      injection of paclitaxel (albumin-binding) into the blood, it rapidly disintegrates and
      disperses into a smaller albumin-paclitaxel complex, which binds and activates the gp60
      albumin receptor on vascular endothelial cells, interacts with Caveolin on the cell membrane,
      and then is transported to the tumor intercellular substance by transcytosis. Tumor cells can
      secrete a SPARC protein with a specific affinity for albumin, which actively captures the
      albumin-paclitaxel complex in the tumor stroma and accumulates around the tumor cells. Since
      tumor neovascular endothelial cells highly express gp60 receptor and the SPARC protein is
      also highly expressed in the tumor region, the special transport mechanism of &quot;gp60- Caveolin
      / caveola -SPARC protein&quot; makes the paclitaxel for injection (albumin binding) have unique
      targeting and penetrating properties toward tumor tissues, hence the drug is highly
      concentrated in the tumor tissue, which can better increase the therapeutic effect and reduce
      the damage to normal tissues.

      Paclitaxel for injection (albumin-binding type) has the following advantages: (1) it is
      unnecessary to pre-administer anti-allergic drugs, the infusion time is within 30 min, and
      patients have good compliance; (2) due to its higher safety, the dosage can be given as high
      as 260-300 mg/m2; (3) it makes full use of gp60 / cysteine acid secretory protein (SPARC
      protein) channel to make the drug enrich toward the tumor area, and the effect is good; (4)
      as the dosage is within 80 ~ 300 mg/m2, the AUC increase proportionally with the administered
      dose, ]the body is linearly metabolized., the half-life period does not prolong with the
      dose, and the clinical medication is safe and controllable. Currently, the drug has been
      approved for breast cancer treatment in China; approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for breast cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer treatment;
      approved for gastric cancer treatment in Japan; and NCCN guidelines recommend it for the
      treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer, and cervical cancer.

      In summary, based on the biological advantages of albumin-binding paclitaxel such as
      high-distribution, high-dose, high-efficiency, and low-toxicity, the reported good clinical
      benefit and safety for hepatobiliary and malignant tumors, and the limited data about
      albumin-bound paclitaxel + oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment for advanced hepatobiliary
      and pancreatic malignancies, especially in Chinese patients, our center believes that is
      feasible and necessary to explore the effectiveness and safety of paclitaxel for injection
      (albumin-binding) combined with oxaliplatin as the first-line drugs for treatment of advanced
      oxaliplatin-based malignant tumors.

      2 Purposes To evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel (albumin-bound) combined with
      oxaliplatin as the first-line drugs for treatment of advanced hepatobiliary and malignant
      tumors.

      Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS) Secondary study endpoints: disease control
      rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and incidence and severity of adverse events (AE).
