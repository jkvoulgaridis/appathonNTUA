    <textblock>
      The research study is being conducted to test how a specialized type of Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET/CT) scan could potentially be useful in diagnosing or monitoring treatment in
      people with Parkinson's disease. If the subject decide to be in this study he/she will have a
      PET/CT scans using an imaging drug called 18F-NOS which will be used to measure inflammation
      in the brain.

      The purpose of this research is to test whether it is possible to measure inflammation in
      subject's brain using an imaging scan called Positron Emission Tomography / Computed
      Tomography (PET/CT). There are two groups of people who will participate in this study, a
      Parkinson's disease (PD) group and a Control group Both groups will have imaging with a
      radioactive drug called 18F-NOS which is an experimental radioactive drug used in PET/CT
      imaging to measure inflammation in the brain. 18F-NOS has not yet been approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use except in a research study. The use 18F-NOS in this
      study is allowed under an Investigational New Drug Application approved by the FDA.

      If subject agree to participate in this study, she/ he will undergo one experimental 18F-NOS
      PET/CT scan. During the scan, PET/CT images will be taken of subject head in order to capture
      pictures of their brain. The imaging procedures will be explained to subject in more detail
      below. Blood samples will be taken at various time points to measure the concentration of the
      imaging drug in your blood during the scan and a blood sample will be collected to measure
      specialized inflammation markers in the blood.

      Investigator hopes to compare the PET/CT scans for the two groups to see if there are
      differences between Parkinson patients and Controls. Investigator will also compare the
      results with other informationgathered about subject during their participation, including
      brain MRI and inflammation markers.
