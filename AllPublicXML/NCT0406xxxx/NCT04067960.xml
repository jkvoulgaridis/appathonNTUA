  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well a genetic test called pharmacogenomics works in
      directing the optimal use of supportive care medications in patients with stage III-IV
      cancer. Pharmacogenomics is the study of how genes may affect the body?s response to and
      interaction with some prescription medications. Genes, which are inherited from parents,
      carry information that determines things such as eye color and blood type. Genes can also
      influence how patients process and respond to medications. Depending on the genetic makeup,
      some medications may work faster or slower or produce more or fewer side effects.
      Pharmacogenomics testing may help doctors learn more about how patients break down and
      process specific medications based on their genes and improve the quality of life of cancer
      patients receiving clinical care.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate patient perceptions surrounding their quality of life (QOL) prior to
      pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing and 3 months post PGx testing.

      II. Understand the clinical utility/relevancy of PGx testing in cancer patients at Mayo
      Clinic Arizona from the viewpoint of their providers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo one-time collection of saliva sample for pharmacogenomics testing. Patients
      also complete quality of life assessment at baseline and at 3 months after pharmacogenomics
      testing.

      After completion of study, patients are followed for up to 1 year.

    <description>Will qualitatively assess provider opinions surrounding the clinical utility/relevancy of PGx testing in cancer patients via the provider survey. Provider survey responses will be examined (analyzed qualitatively) to determine the range of perceptions and experiences associated with PGx testing and result reporting for patient tests. Descriptive statistics will be used to report provider survey results.</description>
