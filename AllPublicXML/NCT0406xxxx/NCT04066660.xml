  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted evaluating the efficacy of
      Oligo-Fucoidan with the molecular weight ranged from 500 to 800 Da. as a supplemental therapy
      in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The previous study results demonstrate the
      advantages of Oligo-Fucoidan in improving the disease control rate. The previous study might
      provide insights into the development of cancer treatments, particularly in the combination
      of natural or herbal products with chemotarget agents.

    <textblock>
      Oligo-Fucoidan, a heparin-like molecule with high percentages of L-fucose and sulfated ester
      groups and low percentages of D-xylose, D-galactose, D-mannose, and glucuronic acid, was
      present in the cell wall matrix of brown seaweed. Brown seaweed Oligo-Fucoidan was reported
      to demonstrate various biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
      antiproliferative, and proapoptotic activities. Oligo-Fucoidan was also revealed to inhibit
      the growth of breast and lung cancers in animal models. Oligo-Fucoidan treatment induces the
      degradation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor and the consequent inhibition of
      the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. In addition to these molecular
      mechanisms, it is imperative to investigate the potential of Oligo-Fucoidan as a miRNA
      regulator for breast cancer treatment and thus delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying
      the anticancer effects of Oligo-Fucoidan. A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was
      conducted evaluating the efficacy of Oligo-Fucoidan with the molecular weight ranged from 500
      to 800 Da. as a supplemental therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The
      previous study results demonstrate the advantages of Oligo-Fucoidan in improving the disease
      control rate. The previous study might provide insights into the development of cancer
      treatments, particularly in the combination of natural or herbal products with chemotarget
      agents.
