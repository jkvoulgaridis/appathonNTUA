  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet used in the treatment of epilepsy.
      The diet can be an efficient treatment option in children with drug resistant epilepsy, with
      more than 50 % seizure reduction in about 40- 70 % of the patients. However, there is still a
      lack of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of action, how will respond to the treatment and
      potential adverse effects.

      The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate protein, low-carbohydrate diet. It is an
      internationally established treatment option in children with drug resistant epilepsy. About
      40 -70 % of children with drug resistant epilepsy treated with the ketogenic diet achieve &gt;
      50 % seizure reduction. However, even though the ketogenic diet has been used in the
      treatment of epilepsy for almost a Century, little is known about how the dietary treatment
      reduces seizures and which patients that will respond well. In addition, there is limited
      knowledge about potential adverse effects of the treatment. This is a prospective study
      following the patients from 4 weeks before initiating the ketogenic diet and during the
      treatment. The influence of the dietary treatment on the gut microbiota, epigenetics, quality
      of life, and adverse effects will be investigated.

The quality of life score is a parental measure of the impact for the family, based on their hopes and expectations of the effects of the ketogenic diet.The quality of life is rate on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = quality of life is poor, 10 = quality of life is very good)</description>
