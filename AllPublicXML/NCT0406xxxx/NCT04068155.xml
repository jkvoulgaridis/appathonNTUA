      A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation
      emitter device for Malignant Cutaneous Tumors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, open label, single arm, multi- center study, assessing the safety
      and effectiveness of diffusing alpha emitters radiation therapy (DaRT) delivered through
      radioactive seeds inserted into the tumor.

      This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used
      in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that
      will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in
      patients.

      Cutaneous lesions with histopathological confirmation of malignancy will be treated using
      DaRT seeds.

      Reduction in tumor size 9-11 weeks following DaRT insertion will be assessed. Safety will be
      assessed by the frequency, severity and causality of all Adverse Events (AE).
