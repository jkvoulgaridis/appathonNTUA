  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of nedisertib and to see how
      well it works with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy in treating patients with
      solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies that have spread to other places in the body
      (advanced/metastatic). Nedisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab,
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of
      radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer
      side effects. Giving nedisertib in combination with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation
      therapy may work better than other standard chemotherapy, hormonal, targeted, or
      immunotherapy medicines available in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary
      malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of nedisertib
      (M3814) in combination with hypofractionated radiation and avelumab in patients with
      advanced/metastatic solid tumors. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the combination
      of hypofractionated radiation, M3814, and avelumab as compared to the combination of
      hypofractionated radiation and avelumab in patients with advanced/metastatic hepatobiliary
      tumors by objective response rate (ORR) in non-irradiated lesions. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) II. To characterize the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of M3814 in combination with avelumab. (Phase I) III. To
      determine the efficacy of the combination of hypofractionated radiation, M3814, and avelumab
      as compared to hypofractionated radiation and avelumab by measurement of disease control rate
      (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), PFS outside the
      irradiated field, and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced/metastatic
      hepatobiliary tumors. (Phase II) IV. To determine if baseline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      repair defects inherent to some cholangiocarcinomas correlate with a more dramatic response
      to radiation compared to those without as measured by gamma H2AX phosphorylated (p)NBS1
      multiplex immunofluorescence (IFA) assay. (Phase II) V. To characterize the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profiles of M3814 and avelumab. (Phase II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES), ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq), mass
      cytometry (CyTOF), multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), and T cell receptor sequencing in
      order to:

      Ia. Determine if baseline tumor mutation burden and pattern, and neoantigen burden correlate
      with response.

      Ib. Determine if combination therapy results in changes in the immune landscape in both the
      tumor and the host that correlate with response.

      Ic. Determine if baseline defects in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair in some
      cholangiocarcinomas correlate with an increased response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nedisertib followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I:

      Patients with advanced/metastatic malignant solid tumors undergo 5 fractions of
      hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) every other day (QOD) on days -10 to 0. Patients also
      receive nedisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 7-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-28 of
      subsequent cycles, and avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 7 and 21. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients advanced/metastatic cholangiocarcinoma/gallbladder cancer are randomized
      to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo 5 fractions of hypofractionated RT QOD on days -10 to 0. Patients
      also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 7 and 21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients undergo 5 fractions of hypofractionated RT QOD on days -10 to 0. Patients
      also receive nedisertib PO BID on days 7-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles,
      and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 7 and 21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 90 days for
      up to 12 months.

             test will be required. The effects of M3814 and avelumab on the developing human fetus
             are unknown and there is the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. For
             this reason, women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry, for the duration of study treatment, and for 6 months after completion of M3814
             and avelumab administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M3814 and
             avelumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M3814 and
             avelumab

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a close caregiver
             or legally authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be
             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, definitive radiation, biological cancer therapy,
             or investigational agent/device within 21 days of first planned dose of study therapy
             (within 14 days for palliative radiation). Previously irradiated lesions may be
             re-irradiated provided there is disease progression in the irradiated lesion and the
             prescribed radiation dosage can safely be re- administered

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events

             exacerbated by or interfere with study treatment as determined between the sponsor and
             the study investigator

          -  Patients who received prior immunotherapy

          -  Patients with untreated/uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS)/leptomeningeal
             disease. Patients with asymptomatic, treated CNS disease are eligible if the treating
             physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is
             unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy and the following criteria
             are met:

               -  Radiographic demonstration of clinical stability upon the completion of
                  CNS-directed therapy and no evidence of interim progression between the

               -  Patients with a history of autoimmune hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid
                  replacement hormone are eligible

               -  Patients with controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin regimen are
                  eligible

               -  Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus of vitiligo with
                  dermatologic manifestations only who require only low potency topical steroids
                  (e.g., hydrocortisone 2.5%, hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%, fluocinolone 0.01%,
                  desonide 0.05%, alclometasone dipropionate 0.05%) are eligible

          -  Patients who receiving treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications
             (including, but not limited to, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine,
             methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents) within 6
             weeks, with the exception of:

               -  Patients with active autoimmune disease managed with systemic corticosteroids
                  less than the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg daily

             exception of patients with prior renal transplant for whom dialysis may be employed in
             the event of graft rejection

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness (e.g., including but not limited to
             uncontrolled hypertension [HTN] [systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 150, diastolic BP &gt;
             100], symptomatic congestive heart failure [CHF], unstable angina pectoris, recent
             ischemic myocardial infarction [MI] within 6 months, cardiac arrhythmia, recent
             transient ischemic attack [TIA or cerebrovascular accident (CVA)]) within 6 months

          -  Patients with serious active infection within 4 weeks prior to randomization (e.g.
             requiring hospitalization and/or intravenous [IV] antibiotics), signs/symptoms of
             infection within 2 weeks prior to randomization, or currently receiving oral or IV
             antibiotics for the treatment of infection. Patients receiving prophylactic
             antibiotics are eligible

          -  Patients with known chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection must have an
             undetectable viral load on suppressive therapy if indicated. Patients with known
             chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. Patients who are
             currently on curative treatment are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral
             load

          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are allowed on study provided
             they have:

               -  A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)

               -  No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention
                  of opportunistic infection

               -  A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL

               -  An undetectable HIV viral load on standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
                  testing

          -  Patients with history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug
             induced), organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing
             pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography
             (CT) scan

          -  Patients with known concurrent malignancy that is expected to require active treatment
             within two years, or may interfere with the interpretation of the efficacy and safety
             outcomes of this study in the opinion of the treating investigator. Superficial
             bladder cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancers, and low-grade prostate cancer not requiring
             cytotoxic therapy should not exclude participation in this trial. Patients with
             chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may be enrolled if they do not require active
             chemotherapy and their hematologic, renal and hepatic function meets criteria
             previously mentioned

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to M3814 or avelumab

          -  Patients unable to discontinue medications or substances that are potent inhibitors,
             inducers or sensitive substrates of CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C19 prior to study treatment are
             ineligible. Medications or substances that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 or
             CYP2C19 must be discontinued at least 1 week prior to first M3814 dose. Strong
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C19 must be stopped at least 3 weeks prior to the first
             dose. Drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A with a narrow therapeutic index as judged by
             the investigator must stop at least 1 day prior to first M3814 dose. Because the lists
             of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a
             frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product. The primary elimination
             mechanism of avelumab is proteolytic degradation, thus there are no contraindicated
             medications with respect to avelumab

          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study because M3814 and avelumab
             are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with M3814 and avelumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued
             if the mother is treated with M3814 and avelumab

          -  Patients who have received live vaccination within 30 days before the study

          -  Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant H2 blockers or proton-pump inhibitors
             (PPIs) prior to starting M3814 and avelumab on day 7. These must be discontinued &gt;= 5
             days prior to study treatment. Patients do not need to discontinue calcium carbonate

          -  Patients receiving sorivudine or any chemically related analogues (such as brivudine)
             and not able to discontinue prior to starting M3814 and avelumab on day 7 are excluded
