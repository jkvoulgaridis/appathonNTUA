    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and the safety/tolerability of
      pyrotinib in previously treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations or HER2
      exon 20 insertion mutations. Patient has had at least one prior systemic treatment for
      locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18-80years，ECOG PS：0-2，Life expectancy of more than 3 months，with measurable lesion (
             RECIST1.1).

          2. Histologically or cytologic confirmed EGFR or HER2 Exon 20 Insertion Mutation positive
             advanced Non-small cell lung cancer who failed prior therapies.

          3. ≥1 target lesion that has not received radiotherapy in the past 3 months and can be
             accurately measured in at least 1 direction；Previously received radiation therapy, but
             the radiotherapy area must be &lt;25% of the bone marrow area, and radiation therapy must
             have closed for at least≥4 weeks at the time of enrollment.

          4. Main organs function is normal.

          5. Signed and dated informed consent.

             HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) prior to
             study participation. The currently approved TKIs (ie, erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib,
             osimertinib) are not considered to be exon 20 insertion-selective and are permissible

             clinically significant arrhythmia; (3) myocardial infarction; (4) heart failure; (5)

             within 5 years after the start of treatment

         10. Respiratory syndrome (dyspnea≥CTC AE 2), severe pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial
             effusion

         11. Abnormal blood coagulation (INR&gt;1.5 or PT &gt; ULN + 4s or APTT &gt; 1.5 ULN), with bleeding
             tendency or receiving thrombolytic or anticoagulant therapy; Renal insufficiency:
             urinary protein ≥ ++, or 24-hour urine protein ≥ 1.0g

         12. Patient has had other malignancies within the past 3 years, except for stable
             non-melanoma skin cancer, fully treated and stable early stage prostate cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast without need of treatment

         13. Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding

         14. Judgment by the investigator that should not participate in the study if the patient
