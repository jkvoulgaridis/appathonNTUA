  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center study evaluating the Biological Allograft Chain Implant (BACI)
      as a bone void filler when implanted with Lenoss Medical manual surgical instrumentation in
      patients with painful vertebral compression fractures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vertebral compression fractures can be associated with severe, persistent pain and limitation
      of activities. This research study is being conducted to evaluate the ability of the BACI to
      provide stability and allow for natural fracture healing, which is expected to result in pain
      relief. BACI is used to fill holes in bone created by fracture and is made of cortical bone
      and provided by a tissue bank.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Achievement and Maintenance of a Clinical Significant Improvement in VAS score.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subject-reported pain over time using the BACI product will be assess using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for back pain on a scale of 0mm (no pain) to 100mm (worst pain imaginable). A clinically significant improvement is defined as at least a 20 mm reduction in the pain score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure of Physical Disability Assessed via the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire is a widely used health status measure for physical disability caused by low back pain. Scores range from 0 to 24 with higher scores representing higher levels of pain-related disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of Quality of Life Assessed via the EuroQol Health Outcome Instrument (EQ-5D-3L)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcomes. It contains questions in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and provides a simple descriptive profile and single index for health status preference. In addition, there is a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is the participant's rating of their health on a scale of 0 &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot; to 100 &quot;best imaginable health state&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of Activities of Daily Living Assessed via the Tegner Activity Level Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner Activity Level Scale is designed to measure a patient's activities of daily living, recreation, and competitive sports. The scale includes an assessment of level of activity pre- and post- injury. The scores range from 0 to 10 with a 0 representing sick leave or disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Implant Related Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of implant related complications will be tabulated. Intra-operative complications, surgical time, and any other significant adverse events will be summarized as safety variables. Adverse events will be tabulated by physician's assessment of seriousness, severity, expectedness, the event's causative relation to the Biological Allograft implant or the Access and Cavity Creation instruments, and by elapsed time since surgery. Adverse events that require secondary surgical intervention (SSI) will be flagged.</description>
