      Aim:

        -  Determine if external fixation decreases soft tissue complications compared to
           splinting.

        -  Determine if external fixation decreases time to definitive surgical stabilization and
           improves final fixation compared to splinting.

        -  Determine if external fixation improves functional outcomes as evaluated by validated
           functional scoring systems.

      Hypothesis:

        -  External fixation improves definitive fixation and functional outcomes of acute
           calcaneal fractures with decreased complication rates compared to splinting
