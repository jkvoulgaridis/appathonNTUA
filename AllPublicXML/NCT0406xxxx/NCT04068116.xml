      Study will investigate &amp; compare the left ventricular remodeling &amp; systolic function between
      two groups of ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary per-cutaneous coronary
      intervention applying ischemic post-conditioning to one of them.

    <textblock>
      Among re-perfusion strategies for the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction ,
      primary per-cutaneous coronary intervention is the preferred one within 120 minutes from the
      first medical contact.However , restoration of the coronary blood flow can paradoxically
      reduce the beneficial effects of myocardial re-perfusion , a phenomenon known as myocardial
      re-perfusion injury.Ischemic post-conditioning has been described as a measure for myocardial
      salvage , performed by making cycles of briefly interrupted perfusion during the early
      moments of coronary re-flow.Post-conditioning may be performed immediately after the early
      re-flow by creating cycles of interrupted inflation &amp; deflation of the angioplasty balloon in
      patients undergoing primary per-cutaneous coronary intervention.In this study investigators
      aim to compare the left ventricular remodeling and global systolic function immediately &amp; 6
      months after re-perfusion between two groups of 100 patients presenting with acute
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction, using ischemic post-conditioning in one group of patients
      undergoing primary per-cutaneous coronary intervention (n=50 patients) by making 4 cycles of
      repeated occlusion &amp; re-perfusion 30-second each by inflation/deflation of an appropriately
      sized per-cutaneous trans-luminal coronary angioplasty balloon.The other group will be
      investigated after re-perfusion by primary per-cutaneous coronary intervention without
      ischemic post-conditioning (n=50 patients)
