  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a 16-week behavioral intervention
      for increasing physical activity and reducing restless legs syndrome (RLS) severity in
      persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and RLS. The study includes a proposed sample of 20
      persons with MS and RLS that will be randomized into either a 16-week behavioral intervention
      arm aimed at increasing physical activity or a 16-week wait-list control arm.

      The primary aim of the proposed pilot RCT involves examining the efficacy of a 16-week
      behavioral intervention for increasing physical activity and reducing RLS severity in persons
      with MS and RLS. Secondarily, the investigators will be assessing changes in sleep quality
      and daytime sleepiness following the behavioral intervention. The study includes a proposed
      sample of 20 persons with MS and RLS that will complete a baseline testing session for
      measures of physical activity, restless legs syndrome severity, sleep quality, and daytime
      sleepiness. Participants will then be randomized into one of two study arms: (1) a 16-week
      Social Cognitive Theory-based behavioral intervention aimed at increasing physical activity;
      or (2) 16-week waitlist control with the option of completing the intervention upon
      completion of the study. All participants will complete a follow-up testing session at the
      conclusion of each 16-week arm.

    <description>Participants will complete the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Scale (IRLS), a 10-item questionnaire that provides a global score commonly used to assess the overall severity of symptoms as well as the frequency and impact of symptoms on daily life over the previous week.Overall symptom severity scores are determined by combining the sum of the answers on the questionnaire with total scores ranging from 0-40 and higher scores indicating a greater severity of symptoms.This will be completed at the baseline testing session.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity Levels as measured by the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) as a measure of the frequency of strenuous, moderate, and mild leisure-time physical activity performed for periods of 15 minutes or more over a typical week. Summary scores are calculated by multiplying the number of strenuous, moderate, and mild bouts by 9, 5, and 3, respectively, and summing those values into an overall score that ranges from 0 to 119; higher scores are represent a greater volume of physical activity. This will be completed at baseline testing.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) measures sleep quality and sleep disturbances over the past four weeks and containing seven different components of sleep. Components of sleep are scored from 0 (fairly good) to 3 (very bad) and component scores are summed for a global score ranging from 0-21; higher scores are indicative of worse sleep quality. Participants will complete this questionnaire at baseline testing.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Accelerometry provides device-measured aspects of sleep quality including sleep onset latency, time in bed, total sleep time, frequency of awakenings, time awake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency. Participants will be instructed to wear one ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer device on the non-dominant wrist each night (i.e., during time in bed for scheduled sleep time) for seven nights following the baseline testing session.</description>

    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is an 8-item questionnaire whereby participants are asked to rate how likely they would be to doze off or fall asleep during eight different situations in &quot;recent times&quot; to provide a global score of daytime sleepiness. Items are scored on a range of 0 (would never doze) to 3 (high chance of dozing) and summed to provide a global score of daytime sleepiness ranging between 0 and 24 with higher scores indicating more daytime sleepiness. Participants will complete the questionnaire at baseline testing.</description>
