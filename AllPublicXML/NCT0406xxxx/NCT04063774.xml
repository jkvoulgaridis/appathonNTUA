  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to develop a sensitive dengue diagnostic clinical algorithm using the
      resources that are available at the health care institutions, clinical expertise, and
      identification of signs and symptoms and variables of the hemogram associated with dengue.
      The performance of the potential algorithms were assessed under routine care. A single group
      cuasiexperimental study with a Bayesian adaptive design was conducted. Prior and cumulative
      information was used during intermediate analysis of clinical algorithms performance and
      according to these results algorithms were modified and then implemented in the subsequent
      study subjects. Men and women of all ages, seeking care due to fever of less than 15 days
      were recruited in 3 endemic areas in Colombia. The algorithms were applied by study
      physicians and blood samples taken for hemogram and dengue reference tests. It was planned
      that algorithms with high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (80%) were implemented in real
      life to assess their impact on patients outcomes alone and in combination with dengue rapid
      diagnostic tests but this was not feasible as not algorithms achieved the targetted
      performance. The experience of physicians using the algorithm in a mobile device was going to
      be explored with qualitative methods but this was explored with study physicians.
