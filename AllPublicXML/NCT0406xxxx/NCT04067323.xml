  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether MCT oil is effective in the change of blood
      lipid profile and body compositions on overweight or obese women aged 20-45.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blinded, community-controlled trial will be conducted to verify the
      effects of MCT oil on blood lipid profile and body compositions. 160 overweight or obese
      female subjects aged 20-45 years with body weight index [25 kg/m2 ≤ body mass index (BMI) &lt;
      40 kg/m2] will be recruited. The subjects will visit the research site for 4 times. On the
      first visit, the participants will be recruited to determine exact BMI, age range and
      eligible criteria. On the second visit, the recruited participants will be randomly assigned
      to consume a test or placebo product [test product: plain yogurt blending MCT oil; placebo
      product: plain yogurt blending soy oil (mainly long chain triglycerides - LCT)] and ingest
      the assigned product in daily lunch meals for 4 months. On the next 3 visits (at baseline, 2
      months and 4 months after intervention), the 12-hr fasting blood samples test will be
      conducted to check lipid blood profile and glucose; the body compositions and anthropometric
      index will be measured.

      Plans for site monitoring will be conducted by the independent supervisors from the National
      Institute of Nutrition's Experts who come from the different departments of NINVietnam and
      the experts of the collaborator for each visiting day and on the days when the participants
      receive products (every 10 days). In the site research, multiply supervised and cross-over
      staff will be implemented (staff from NINVietnam, Center of Disease Control branch, Medical
      Center of Province and Local Ward Health Stations). For following the consumed products, each
      participant will daily self-note in a designed notebook (trained before delivering products).
      If there is any different information between the staff and others, information will be
      checked again. The participants, consuming at least 90% the total amount of product, will be
      considered as complete intervention and will be analyzed.

      Data will be collected by questionnaire and checked again in the same day of collecting.
      Investigators will request and correct at the site research if any suspicious answer or
      missing data. The Body composition analyzer SC-330 TANITA scale will be checked and corrected
      before using. Each 100 subjects, this scale will be checked and corrected again. Data are
      reported as mean ± standard deviation, compared between 2 arms and in each group between
      baseline time and 2 or 4 months interventions.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a randomized, double-blind, community-controlled intervention trial. A screening survey will be used to recruit women aged from 20 to 45 considered overweight and obese within a city of Bac Giang province, Viet Nam, during which subjects will conduct nutritional status and determine whether overweight or obesity and eligible criteria. Subjects then will be randomly allocated to receive 1 of 2 treatment sequences, with a balanced number of subjects assigned to each dietary treatment (either MCT oil or Soya bean oil/soy oil mixed in yogurt together with their standard meals (lunch) daily) over a period of 4 months and their blood lipid and nutritional profiles checked.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The list of participants will be randomly coded and divided two group will be sealed. This envelop will stored by the head of National Institute of Nutrition, Vietnam. The investigators will be not known who the participants consume test product or placebo product during the recruiting stage and whole intervention period. The oil product will be packed in the same bottles (only different from coloring the label bottles), manufactured by Nortalic, Vietnam.</masking_description>

    <description>Blood samples are drawn after 12 hours and not over 16 hours overnight fasting and at least 24 hours of alcohol abstinence and collected in Heparin-containing (BD Vacutainer USA) tubes. Blood samples will consist of Cholesterol, Triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol and evaluated by The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), e.g. JAMA, 2001. 285(19): p. 2486-2497</description>

    <description>Weight is measured in kg with one decimal value by the Body composition analyzer SC-330 TANITA scale. Height is measured by wooden stadiometer with exactly 0.1cm.
