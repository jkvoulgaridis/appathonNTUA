  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An anal fistula is an abnormal communication between the luminal surface of the anorectal
      canal and the perianal skin. Fistulas can vary in their complexity and can be challenging to
      treat, due to the anatomical relation to the anal sphincter complex that controls continence.
      In addition, fistulas can display complex features such as branches, cavities and horseshoes;
      where the tract travels radially around the anal canal. All these features have a role in
      determining the most appropriate surgical treatment option, and are key to understanding the
      surgical decision-making process. This study will determine patient understanding of fistula
      anatomy, their perception of their own understanding, their rating of how good their
      clinician's explanation is and how this impacts the decision-making process using standard
      explanation with 2D images, versus a 3D printed model of a fistula.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous work has established a method of using traditional two-dimensional MR images to
      construct and print 3D models of perianal fistula, however the clinical utility of these
      models in the outpatient setting and their impact on patient knowledge of disease have not
      yet been assessed. This study is aimed at understanding how the use of 3D printed models can
      influence patient understanding of disease and support them in making decisions regarding
      treatment.

      Participants attending routine outpatient appointments will have their fistula explained to
      them using either a standard explanation, or a 3D printed model of a fistula. They will
      complete a short series of questionnaires and their answers will be analysed to determine if
      there is any benefit of using 3D models in a clinical consultation.

    <measure>Patient understanding of fistula anatomy and surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A score obtained using a non-validated questionnaire that assesses the patient's understanding of their fistula anatomy and the treatment that has been proposed.
Scores can range from 0 to 16, with a higher score suggesting better understanding.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient understanding of their fistula: Patient reported subjective assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>A self reported score that patients give for how well they feel they have understood their fistula and proposed surgery. Patients rate how well they understand their fistula on a scale of 1-10, where 1 denotes very poor understanding, and 10 equates to excellent understanding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of explanation: Patient reported subjective assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported subjective rating of how well their clinician explained their fistula and surgery to them. Four questions where patients rate how well their fistula was explained on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 equating to very poor understanding and 10 excellent understanding. An additional question asks the patient if the explanation relieved their anxiety (Yes/No). Responses to individual questions will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Conflict Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A validated questionnaire that assesses the level of uncertainty a patient has in making a decision. Subscales:
Uncertainty: Scores range from 0 (feels extremely certain) to 100 (feels extremely uncertain about best choice) Informed: Scores range from 0 (feels extremely informed) to 100 (extremely uninformed) Values clarity: Scores range from 0 (feels clear about personal values for benefits and risks) to 100 (feels extremely unclear about personal values) Support: Scores range from 0 (feels extremely supported in decision making) to 100 (feels unsupported in decision making) Effective decision: Scores range from 0 (good decision) to 100 (bad decision). The total score is obtained by the addition of each individual score, which is then divided by 16 and multiplied by 25. Scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>3D model utility</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported subjective rating of how useful the 3D model was, using a non- validated questionnaire. This includes 3 questions where patients rate how useful the model is on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 equating to not very useful, and 10 being very useful. The final question asks patients if they would like to see models in future consultations (Yes/No). Responses to individual questions will be presented.</description>
