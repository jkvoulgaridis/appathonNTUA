      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of chronic treatment with
      β1-adrenergic antagonist on the NOL index variation, the heart rate variation and the mean
      blood pressure variation after a standardized noxious stimulus.

      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the NOL values variations obtained in response to a
      standardized noxious stimulus under general anesthesia in a group of patients chronically
      treated with β1-adrenergic antagonists, will be similar to the NOL values variations
      previously obtained in response to a similar standardized noxious stimulus and previously
      reported in a group of patients without any β1-adrenergic antagonist.

      Background: The Pain Monitoring Device (PMD200TM) monitor (Medasense Biometrics Ltd., Ramat
      Gan, Israel) uses the Nociception Level (NOL) index, a multiple parameter-derived index that
      has recently shown a good sensitivity and specificity to detect noxious stimuli. The NOL
      index variations of the latest version of the PMD200TM has shown better sensitivity and
      specificity to detect standardized noxious stimulus than heart rate or blood pressure
      variation in a population without any β1-adrenergic antagonist treatment. β1-adrenergic
      antagonist treatment was so far a limitation to the use of the NOL index. Indeed,
      β1-adrenergic antagonists have a depressive action on the heart rate, including limitation of
      the heart rate variability after a noxious stimulus. Because heart rate and its variability
      are parameters which are part of the parameters combined to build the NOL index, chronic
      treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonist could alter the ability of the NOL index to detect
      noxious stimulus. However, Edry R. (Edry R, 2017) assessed the impact of chronic treatment
      with β1-adrenergic antagonist on NOL index variation after noxious stimuli in a pilot study
      (9 patients under chronic treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonist and under general
      anesthesia) and didn't show any influence of this treatment on the NOL index variation. But
      this study was not large enough and did not fully answered the question whether chronic
      treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonist might impact NOL ability to detect precise and
      standardized stimulus and to compare the results to those in patients without this type of
      chronic medication.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective:

      To explore the NOL variation in a group of patients under chronic treatment with
      β1-adrenergic antagonists submitted to standardized noxious stimulus under general
      anesthesia.

      Secondary objectives:

      Secondary outcome [1] To explore the heart rate variation and the mean blood pressure
      variation in a group of patients under chronic treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonists
      submitted to standardized noxious stimulus under general anesthesia.

      Secondary outcome [2] To compare the heart rate variation and the mean blood pressure
      variation in a group of patients under chronic treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonists
      submitted to standardized noxious stimulus under general anesthesia to a control group of
      patients without any β1-adrenergic antagonist chronic treatment; results gathered from a
      previous study (Renaud-Roy E, 2019), exposed to the same noxious stimulus and under the same
      anesthesia conditions.

      Secondary outcome [3] To explore the ability of the NOL index, the heart rate and the mean
      blood pressure to discriminate between noxious and non-noxious states in a group of patients
      with β1-adrenergic antagonist chronic treatment submitted to standardized noxious stimulus
      under general anesthesia. To determine sensitivity and specificity (ROC curve and AUC of ROC)
      for each parameter: HR, MAP, NOL index.

      Secondary outcome [4] To evaluate the NOL index, the heart rate and the mean blood pressure
      variations after tracheal intubation in patients with β1-adrenergic antagonist chronic
      treatment.

      Methods:

      50 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia for any types of surgery and who have been
      chronically treated with β1-adrenergic antagonists for at least three months prior to surgery
      will be enrolled. All patients will be consented prior to the surgery. Induction of
      anesthesia will be standardized for all patients and based on their adjusted body weight
      calculated before induction, with: IV midazolam (0.02mg/kg), IV propofol (1.5-2mg.kg-1), IV
      remifentanil (1mcg.kg-1 followed by a continuous infusion of 0.05 µg.kg-1.min-1), IV
      rocuronium (0.6 to 1mg.kg-1). Depth of anesthesia with desflurane will be maintained and
      monitored with the BIS index kept between 40 and 60. Intubation will be performed 3 minutes
      after the intravenous administration of the propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium boluses.
      The end of the bolus of remifentanil (given 1mcg/kg; adjusted body weight) will be the start
      of the 3 min period to wait before proceeding with the tracheal intubation. Three minutes
      after intubation, the remifentanil infusion will be decreased to 0.005 µg.kg-1.min-1 to
      reduce the risk of developing hypotensive events and to prepare the patient for the
      standardized noxious stimulus of the study protocol realized under very low doses of opioids
      under desflurane hypnosis with BIS 40-60.

      At least 10 min after the post-intubation decrease of the remifentanil infusion rate, the OR
      team will stop any physical contact/stimulation of the patient allowing at least a 3-minutes
      rest period under stable anesthesia. Baseline mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart
      rate (HR) will be defined for the rest of the study as the mean of 3 measures in the 3
      minutes during this &quot;no pain - no touching&quot; evaluation period to get baselines values of all
      the study parameters. If necessary, phenylephrine will be given to keep a MAP &gt; 65 mmHg.

      At this point, the standardized electrical (tetanic) stimulation will be applied on the area
      of the ulnar nerve at the wrist level, at a frequency of 100 Hz and a current of 70 mA for a
      duration of 30 seconds, followed by 3 minutes of observation period without any other
      stimulation of the patient by the anesthesia or the surgical team (EZstimII, Model ES400,
      Life-Tech, Stafford, Tx, USA). At the end of the observation period, the study is
      discontinued and the anesthesia will be conducted at the discretion of the anesthesiologist
      in charge of the patient.

        Enrollment of 50 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia for elective surgery. This
        number was determined on two previous studies conducted at Maisonneuve-Rosemont on the NOL
        index reactivity to the same stimulus and under the same anesthesia conditions and
        published in 2018 (Stockle PA et al. Minerva Anestesiologica) and 2019 (Renaud-Roy et al.
        CJA) from which we got full data from 50 patients who were not chronically treated by
        β1-adrenergic antagonists. We will compare this previous cohort to the new prospective
        cohort of patients chronically treated with β1-adrenergic antagonists.
