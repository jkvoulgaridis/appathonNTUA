  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting research to compare serum and urine titanium levels in
      children with early onset scoliosis who are being treated with certain types of metal spinal
      rods. These rods include traditional growing rods (TGR), magnetically-controlled growing rods
      (MCGR), and Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR). Children with metal rods may
      have elevated serum and urine titanium levels. These levels may remain elevated over time.
      The investigators will collect serum titanium levels from children with metal rods and
      children without metal rods to see if there are differences in their titanium levels. The
      investigators will then collect a second serum titanium level from children with metal rods
      at least 6 months later to see if the participants titanium levels remain elevated over time.
      The investigators will also collect urine titanium levels from children with metal rods to
      see if titanium is excreted in the urine.
