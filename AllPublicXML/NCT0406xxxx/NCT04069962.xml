      The G-oncoCOACH study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Comprehensive Geriatric
      Assessment (CGA) process coordinated by a geriatric team in combination with intensive
      patient coaching compared to the current standard of care, which is CGA coordinated by an
      oncology team.

      The G-oncoCOACH study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Comprehensive Geriatric
      Assessment (CGA) process coordinated by a geriatric team in combination with intensive
      patient coaching compared to the current standard of care, which is CGA coordinated by an
      oncology team. The Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework, developed to test complex
      interventions, is used to design this study. A multicenter randomized controlled trial will
      be conducted in two academic hospitals (UZ Brussel - UZ Leuven) with a follow-up at 3, 6 and
      12 months after the start of systemic therapy. Patients will be recruited in both academic
      hospitals in the period between the cancer diagnosis and the start of the systemic therapy.

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL): EORTC QLQ-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>QoL at 6 months since the start of the systemic therapy</time_frame>
    <description>QoL measured by the EORTC Qlq - C30. HRQOL evaluation was performed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status Scale (GHS). The two general questions 29 and 30 are selected: &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; and &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot;. Patients answer these two questions by means of seven-point Likert scales and the two scores are combined to define the GHS. The GHS score is linearly transformed to a 0-100 score to facilitate statistical interpretation. A higher HRQOL is reported by a higher GHS score.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of patient satisfaction: questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>over 1 year follow up since the start of the systemic therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Self-constructed questionnaire on patient satisfaction measuring the satisfaction of the patient with the care that has been received since the start of the systemic treatment (using a 5-point Likert scale; range 1 (not satisfied at all) -5 (very satisfied))</description>

    <measure>Evolution of functional status (FS) measured by Activities of Daily Living (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>over 1 year follow up since the start of the systemic therapy</time_frame>
    <description>FS measured by Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The ADL scale includes six items (bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence and feeding), with a score for each item scores ranging from one (able to perform the activity) to four (unable to perform the activity) (range: 6-24).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evolution of functional status (FS) measured by Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>over 1 year follow up since the start of the systemic therapy</time_frame>
    <description>FS measured by Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). The Lawton scale includes eight items (ability to use the telephone, shopping, cooking, housekeeping, doing laundry, taking own medication, making transports and ability to handle finances), with a score for each item of zero (low function, dependent) or one (high function, independent). Because some of these items (cooking, housekeeping and doing laundry) are only fully applicable in women, these three items were not assessed in males in the original form, so the total score in men ranged from zero to five (range women: 0-8; range men: 0-5).</description>
