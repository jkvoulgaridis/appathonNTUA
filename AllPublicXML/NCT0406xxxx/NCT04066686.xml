  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study which aims to assess the comfort of a spinal collar in
      patients who have them fitted as part of their clinical care due to neck injury.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study follows the patient journey including long term follow up (up to 120 days following
      admission). The information gathered will be from the standard clinical care delivered and
      include demographics, baseline function, the injuries sustained following trauma and
      prescribed analgesia with records of the most recent time and dose administered. Any scans
      done of the neck for clinical purposes will be anonymised and analysed for measurements of
      angulation. In addition to this there will be a survey on the comfort of the collar and of
      their functional ability at the current time at various points during their inpatient
      admission.

    <description>'Neck Disability Index' Questionnaire (Validated functional assessment which consists of ten questions in questionnaire format with multi-choice answer options). Maximum score is 50, best option score is 0, the worst is 5. The score is calculated as follows: Example - 16 (total scored) 50 (total possible score) x 100 = 32%. 100% means no improvement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients aged 18yrs and over with a C-spine injury immobilised in a spinal collar

          2. Patients must be nursed on Major Trauma Ward

          3. Ability to give informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients under 18yrs age

          2. Patients who lack capacity to consent for entry into the study

          3. Patients who are receiving level 2( High dependency unit) or level 3 (Intensive care
             unit) clinical care

          4. Patients who are unable to complete the visual analogue score or questionnaire due to
             having co-existent severe hearing and visual impairment. Severe hearing impairment
             will be defined as unable to hear the researcher with hearing aids if required. Severe
             visual impairment will be defined as being unable to read the patient information
             sheet even with visual aids.

          5. Patients unable to understand the patient leaflet in English.
