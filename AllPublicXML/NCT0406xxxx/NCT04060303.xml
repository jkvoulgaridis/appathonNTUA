  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initiated in the 1990s, perioperative Enhanced Recovery Protocols (ERPs) have progressively
      gained traction in a wide range of adult surgical disciplines and have decreased hospital
      length of stay (LOS), in-hospital costs, complications, and result in a markedly improved
      patient care experience that mitigates the physiologic stress of surgery and hastens
      recovery. Implementation of ERPs in pediatric surgery is lagging and concerted efforts to
      demonstrate both clinical effectiveness and to examine obstacles to implementation are
      needed. Specifically, pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergoing
      elective abdominal surgery represent an ideal population in which to study the implementation
      of ERPs. Almost one third of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and a quarter of patients
      with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) present before age 20. Up to three-quarters of CD patients
      require GI surgery for medically refractory disease and all patients with UC require
      colectomy to either manage severe disease or to mitigate cancer risks. Over the past four
      years, investigators modified existing adult ERPs to meet the needs of pediatric patients
      undergoing elective GI surgery. Based on the positive results of a pilot study, the
      investigators propose to conduct a multicenter, prospective, pragmatic, study using a
      stepped-wedge, cluster, randomized controlled trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of
      ERPs while assessing implementation fidelity, sustainability, and site-specific adaptations.
      The cluster randomized trial design is ideally suited for this type of pragmatic intervention
      implementation. The National Implementation Research Network's five Active Implementation
      Frameworks (AIFs), which identifies competency, organization, and leadership as drivers of
      implementation, empowers team collaboration, and facilitates rapid-cycle evaluation, will be
      used to optimize implementation. The investigators propose to conduct the ENhancing Recovery
      In CHildren Undergoing Surgery (ENRICH-US) Study in 18 US hospitals participating in the
      Pediatric Surgical Research Collaborative (PedSRC) by implementing and evaluating the
      effectiveness of the Pediatric ERP in GI Surgery on clinical outcomes for pediatric IBD
      patients and by measuring by fidelity and sustainability of the intervention while
      identifying organizational, leadership, and competency-based drivers of improved ERP
      implementation and sustainability.

      This application proposes to implement an ERP for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and undergoing
      elective abdominal surgery. They represent an ideal population in which to study the
      implementation of ERPs because almost one third of patients with CD present before age 20 and
      up to three-quarters of CD patients require gastrointestinal (GI) surgery for medically
      refractory disease. A quarter of UC patients present before age 20 and all patients with UC
      require colectomy to either manage severe disease or mitigate cancer risks. The GI surgical
      procedures performed in children with IBD are similar to the adult procedures for which ERPs
      have been well tested and validated.

      The study team has previously modified existing adult ERPs to meet the needs of pediatric
      patients undergoing elective GI surgery, primarily for IBD, by conducting (a) a systematic
      literature review, (b) a national survey to assess readiness for implementation, and (c) an
      expert panel adjudication of ERP elements. The investigators also conducted a pilot study to
      assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effectiveness of the pediatric ERP in 79
      pediatric patients who underwent elective GI surgery. Patient and provider education
      materials were created, a learning collaborative explored drivers and obstacles to
      implementation, patient advocates were engaged to enhance the quality improvement process,
      and data were routinely fed back to the implementation team members. The pilot study
      demonstrated a 50% decrease in LOS, from 5 to 3 days, near elimination of intraoperative and
      post-operative opioid use, and a 30% decrease in perioperative fluid administration, without
      any increase in post-surgical complications or re-hospitalization.

      Based on these promising results, the investigators propose the ENhancing Recovery In
      CHildren Undergoing Surgery (ENRICH-US) Study in 18 US hospitals that participate in the
      Pediatric Surgical Research Collaborative (PedSRC). This multicenter study will use a
      stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized, pragmatic clinical trial design to evaluate the
      effectiveness of ENRICH-US while also assessing implementation fidelity, sustainability, and
      site-specific adaptations. The investigators will optimize implementation using the National
      Implementation Research Network's five Active Implementation Frameworks (AIFs), which
      identify competency, organization, and leadership as drivers of implementation and empower
      team collaboration and facilitate rapid-cycle evaluation.

    <description>The ENRICH-US Protocol includes perioperative counseling and education, maintaining euvolumia through limited perioperative fasting and limited intraoperative fluid resuscitation, early enteral intake and mobilization, limited use of opioids, and non-routine use of surgical drains and tubes. Elements span the pre-, intra-, and post-operative experience for patients and involve care coordination among surgery, anesthesia, and nursing providers. Though individually simple, the concomitant implementation of the combined elements results in a markedly improved patient care experience that mitigates the physiologic stress of surgery and hastens recovery.</description>

    <ipd_description>All data collected during the study will be made available such that further advancement of ERP principles will be made possible by building upon these data. In addition to the peer-reviewed publication of study results and the dissemination of findings through publicly available websites, blogs, and newsletters, the PI and Biostatistics Director will create a patient-deidentified data set that will be made publicly available to researchers. We have included a request for funds to curate this dataset for public use. It will include clinical data and outcomes collected through REDCap for the complete ENRICH-US study, as well as, raw data for the PedsQL health-related quality of life surveys. All data will be fully de-identified. A copy of the study protocol, data definition dictionary, and public use file with instructions will also be generated for ease of use. Data will be made available in a format that will easily be used in mainstream software analysis packages (e.g., ASCII, SAS).</ipd_description>
