      The purpose of this study is to examine choroidal thickness in beta-thalassemia patients and
      compare it to the one of healthy controls.

      An equal number of transfusion dependent beta-thalassemic patients and age and sex matched
      healthy volunteers will undergo spectral-domain optical coherence tomography utilizing the
      enhanced depth imaging application to visualize and measure the choroid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beta thalassemia is an inherited hemoglobinopathy, associated with defective production of
      beta-chain globin resulting in problematic HbA production. It is classified according to the
      severity as minor, intermedia and major. Patients suffering from beta-thalassemia intermedia
      and beta-thalassemia major require regular blood transfusions. Transfusion related
      hemosiderosis in these patients necessitates the use of chelating agents to prevent iron
      overload in vital organs such as the liver and heart.

      A number of ocular abnormalities can present in beta-thalassemia patients. Those are
      categorized as pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)-like changes that include angioid streaks, peau
      d'orange like fundus and optic nerve head drusen and non-PXE-like changes such as increased
      venous tortuosity.

      Furthermore, it is well established that prolonged treatment with some of the chelating
      agents such as deferoxamine are associated with ocular toxicity, namely nyctalopia, colour
      perception anomalies, visual field disturbances, cataract formation, optic neuropathy and
      pigmentary retinopathy.

      The pathophysiology of those ocular manifestations has not been fully clarified. The role of
      the choroid has not been determined since this particular tissue was previously unaccessible
      to imaging. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography is able to image the choroid
      providing reasonable clarity compared to spectral domain optical coherence tomography.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate possible alterations of choroidal thickness in beta
      thalassemia as compared to healthy controls.
