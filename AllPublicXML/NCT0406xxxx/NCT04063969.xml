  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to measure the radiation safety climate in the hybrid angiography suite using
      self-assessment and to investigate the relationship of radiation safety climate with their
      self-reported safety behaviors.

      The hypothesis is that a radiation safety climate does exist and can be measured using
      self-assessment. Additionally, it is expected that the radiation safety climate positively
      influences radiation safety behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation safety in the hybrid angiography suite is a primordial safety component which is
      relevant for endovascular team members and patients. To date, many interventions which aim to
      improve radiation safety habits of an endovascular team focus on improving technology and
      team radiation safety knowledge. Safety literature has indicated that a safety climate can be
      identified as the shared perceptions of team members or workers about the safety in their
      workspace and that this safety climate is closely related to safety behaviors and outcomes.
      In endovascular specialties, the concept of a radiation safety climate remains unexplored.
      Therefore, this study aims to measure the radiation safety climate in a diverse pool of
      endovascular team members from different hospitals, using self-assessment questionnaires and
      to investigate the relationship of radiation safety climate with their self-reported safety
      behaviors.

    <description>All vascular surgeons, surgical trainees, nurses active in the hybrid angiography suite at one of the participating centers will be invited to participate in the study.
All participating team members complete an online questionnaire containing an assessment of their perceived radiation safety climate (28 items, 5 dimensions), radiation safety behaviors(2 items, 2 dimensions), radiation safety knowledge (single item) and radiation safety motivation (single item). All data will be stored pseudonymized.</description>

    <description>In each center, five patients undergoing primary elective endovascular repair for an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) will be enrolled in the study.
For each participating patient, a set of demographical (BMI, case difficulty, ASA-grade,etc.), procedure-related (procedure duration, contrast use, etc.) and radiation dose parameters (DAP, cumulative air kerma) will be collected and stored in a pseudonymized way.
Participation in this study has no effect on the interventional procedure, or the chosen approach.</description>
