  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Viltolarsen compared to
      placebo in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients amenable to exon 53 skipping.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess
      the efficacy and safety of Viltolarsen in ambulant boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
      Eligible patients with out-of-frame deletion mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping will be
      randomized to receive once weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of 80 mg/kg Viltolarsen or
      placebo for up to 48 weeks.

      The study will enroll approximately 74 patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. Clinical
      efficacy will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits, including functional tests
      such as Time to Stand Test (TTSTAND), Time to Run/Walk 10 Meters Test (TTRW), Six-minute Walk
      Test (6MWT), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), Time to Climb 4 Steps Test (TTCLIMB)
      and Hand-held dynamometer (elbow extension, elbow flexion, knee extension and knee flexion on
      the dominant side only).

      Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and physical examinations throughout the study.

      Blood samples will be taken periodically throughout the study to assess the pharmacokinetics
      of study drug.

    <description>Change in North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA)
The NSAA is a functional scale devised for use in ambulant children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It consists of 17 activities graded 0 (unable to perform), 1 (performs with modifications), 2 (normal movement). It assesses abilities necessary to remain ambulant that have been found to progressively deteriorate in untreated DMD patients, as well as in other muscular dystrophies such as Becker Muscular Dystrophy. NSAA Total Score ranges from 0 to 34, with a score of 34 implying normal function.</description>
