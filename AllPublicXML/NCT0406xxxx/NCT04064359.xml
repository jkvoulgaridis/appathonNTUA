  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate OBT076, which is a drug that combines an antibody
      with an anti-cancer drug. This class of drugs are called Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADC).
      Antibodies are normally produced in the human body by the immune system to fight infections
      but can be designed to target cancer cells and deliver an anti-cancer drug. OBT076 is
      composed of an antibody that targets the CD205 protein on cancer cells and delivers an
      anti-cancer drug which can kill them. OBT076 is an &quot;Investigational Drug&quot;, which means that
      it is still being studied and has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or any other regulatory authorities
      to be prescribed by doctors for the treatment of metastatic or recurrent solid tumors. The
      use of OBT076 in this study is investigational.

      This is a Phase I research study designed to look at several dose levels of the study drug to
      find the highest dose level that is safe and well-tolerated (does not cause unacceptable side
      effects), and to examine the effects of the study drug in a small group of research
      participants. The study will also look at the effectiveness of OBT076 as an anti-cancer
      therapy. Once the optimal dose is determined and safety is assessed, additional research
      participants will be treated at the optimal dose level to further evaluate safety and
      effectiveness.

      Study OBT076-001 is an open-label, Phase I, dose escalation and expansion clinical study of
      OBT076, a CD205-directed ADC, in CD205+ve, and HER2-ve metastatic breast cancer and recurrent
      and/or metastatic CD205+ve solid tumors. Part A, the dose escalation phase of the study, will
      explore escalating IV doses to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of OBT076.
      Approximately 20 subjects will be included in Part A of the study. Part B, the expansion
      phase of the study, will further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of OBT076
      administered at or below the MTD in expansion cohorts. Approximately 50 subjects will be
      enrolled in Part B. Parts A and B will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment, and
      Follow-up.
