      Prospective comparative study of Mixed Reality Technology（MR）assisted lumbar pedicle screws
      placement and traditional lumbar pedicle screws placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the randomized controlled method was adopted to prospectively include the
      samples, and the differences in surgical procedures and efficacy were compared between the
      thoracolumbar pedicle screw implantation assisted by MR and the traditional thoracolumbar
      pedicle screw implantation, so as to provide a plan for clinicians to choose the surgical
      method.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Course of disease≥6 months, all patients with lumbago back pain, radiation pain of
             lower limbs, lumbar disc herniation diagnosed with or without spinal stenosis.

          -  The course of disease≥6 months, all patients had lumbar back pain, accompanied by or
             without intermittent claudication, and the diagnosis of lumbar spondylolisthesis was
             clear, but the vertebral isthmus was not broken.

          -  The patient's symptoms were consistent with the imaging examination results, failed to
             respond to conservative treatment, and met the surgical indications.

          -  The lesion segment is no more than 3 vertebral bodies.

          -  Preoperative improvement of X-ray, CT, MRI examination.

          -  Patients without active bleeding and female patients is not in menstrual period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lumbar acute infection, lumbar tuberculosis, tumor and other diseases.

          -  Patients with severe cardiopulmonary insufficiency, intolerance to surgery, diabetes
             and poor blood glucose control, combined with coagulation dysfunction and other
             contraindications.

          -  Vertebral fracture patients.

          -  Bone Mineral Density (BMD) examination: BMD was measured by dual-energy X- ray
             absorptiometry at the lumbar spine (L2 ~ L4) and femoral head, and BMD and T values
             were observed. Abnormal bone mass were excluded according T &gt;- 1 SD
