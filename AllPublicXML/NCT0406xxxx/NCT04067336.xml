  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human (FIH) dose escalation will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      KO-539, a menin-MLL(KMT2A) inhibitor, in patients with refractory or relapsed AML who have
      failed or are ineligible for any approved standard of care therapies, including HSCT.

    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), open-label, dose-escalation study of KO-539, a
      menin-MLL(KMT2A) inhibitor, will determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses
      using a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) adaptive design when administered to
      patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML. If an maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cannot be
      identified, a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. A expansion phase in
      specific genetic subgroups is planned following determination of the MTD/RP2D. KO-539 will be
      administered as a once daily oral dose in 28 continuous day cycles.

             infections and other such drugs that are considered absolutely essential for the care
             of the patient.

          9. Patient has a known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, or
             hepatitis B surface antigen indicative of active infection.

         15. Underlying medical condition that, in the Principal Investigator's opinion, will make
             the administration of study treatment hazardous or obscure the interpretation of
             toxicity determination or adverse events (AEs).

         16. Women who are pregnant or lactating. All female patients with reproductive potential
             must have a negative pregnancy test prior to starting treatment.
