    <textblock>
      This study will be done with subjects who already habitually wear scleral contact lenses. The
      study lens is made with a material that is already widely available and has a new design. It
      will be fit by the investigators and will be assessed and at one week and 1 month.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects may be male or female, of any race, and at least 18 years old at the time of
             the pre-treatment examination.

          2. Subjects must habitually wear scleral contact lenses for an average wearing time of 6
             hours per day.

          3. The prospective eye(s) must have refractive hyperopia or myopia from +20.00 to -20.00
             diopters sphere (spectacle plane), with up to -10.00 diopters of refractive
             astigmatism (spectacle plane), as determined by manifest refraction (phoropter or
             trial frame with a 12.5 mm vertex distance).

          4. Subjects must have best spectacle corrected visual acuity of at least 0.5 logMAR in
             each eye.

          5. Subjects must be willing and capable to return for all scheduled follow-up visits for
             a period of at least 3 months (minimum of 1 month from initial dispensing).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant over the
             course of the study.

          2. Subjects with a history of any of the following medical conditions: collagen vascular
             disease, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency diseases, ocular herpes zoster or
             simplex, endocrine disorders (including, but not limited to active thyroid disorders
             and diabetes), lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

             Note: The presence of diabetes (either type 1 or 2), regardless of disease duration,
             severity or control, will specifically exclude subjects from eligibility.

          3. Subjects with active ophthalmic disease or abnormality including glaucoma,
             chorioretinitis, central retinal artery or vein occlusion, intraocular or ocular
             infection.

          4. Subjects who are participating in any other clinical trial (FDA or other)
