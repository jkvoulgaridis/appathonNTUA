    <textblock>
      Purpose: To report the feasibility and to obtain preliminary data on the effects of using an
      enhanced Otago Exercise Programme to reduce fall risk in individuals with osteoarthritis
      (OA).

      Participants: Ten participants from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project who have OA,
      are at risk for falls, and are 65+ years old.

      Procedures (methods): All participants will receive the 6-month enhanced Otago program. The
      investigators will assemble data: quantifying participant adherence to and safety of the
      intervention, ascertaining retention of participants for 6 months, determining acceptability
      of the program, and other validated measures (e.g., number of falls and fall severity,
      balance measures).

    <description>The Otago Exercise Programme is a falls prevention program that is successful at reducing falls in adults 65+ years of age. Briefly, this program includes flexibility, progressive lower extremity strengthening with ankle weights, and balance exercises. The investigators are replacing the Otago walking program with the evidence-based Arthritis Foundation's Walk With Ease program.</description>

Participants who identify with items 6 or 7 are considered active. Those who identify with items 1-5 are considered to have suboptimal aerobic physical activity levels.
Sedentary:
I rarely or never do any physical activities.
Under-active:
I do some light or moderate physical activities, but not every week.
Under-active regular - light activities:
I do some light physical activity every week.
Under-active regular:
I do moderate physical activities every week, but less than 30 minutes a day or 5 days a week.
I do vigorous physical activities every week, but less than 20 minutes a day or 3 days a week.
Active:
I do 30 minutes or more a day of moderate physical activities, 5 or more days a week.

        <description>Four timed static balance tasks of increasing difficulty are completed without assistive devices: 1) feet together stand for up to 10 seconds; 2) semi-tandem stand (heel of one foot placed to the side of the big toe of the other foot) for up to 10 seconds; 3) tandem stand (one foot in front of the other, heel touching toe) for up to 10 seconds; and 4) one leg stand for up to 30 seconds. Time for each test is recorded in seconds. If the participant cannot achieve a task, this is recorded as 0 seconds.</description>

Otago Exercise Programme and Walk with Ease: The Otago Exercise Programme is a falls prevention program that is successful at reducing falls in adults 65+ years of age. Briefly, this program includes flexibility, progressive lower extremity strengthening with ankle weights, and balance exercises. The investigators are replacing the Otago walking program with the evidence-based Arthritis Foundation’s Walk With Ease program.</description>

Participants who identify with items 6 or 7 are considered active. Those who identify with items 1-5 are considered to have suboptimal aerobic physical activity levels.
Sedentary:
I rarely or never do any physical activities.
Under-active:
I do some light or moderate physical activities, but not every week.
Under-active regular - light activities:
I do some light physical activity every week.
Under-active regular:
I do moderate physical activities every week, but less than 30 minutes a day or 5 days a week.
I do vigorous physical activities every week, but less than 20 minutes a day or 3 days a week.
Active:
I do 30 minutes or more a day of moderate physical activities, 5 or more days a week.

          <title>Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity: Aerobic Score</title>
          <description>Participants are asked to identify from a list of 7 items which one accurately describes their current level of aerobic physical activity. Participants who identify with items 6 or 7 are considered active. Those who identify with items 1-5 are considered to have suboptimal aerobic physical activity levels.
Sedentary:
I rarely or never do any physical activities.
Under-active:
I do some light or moderate physical activities, but not every week.
Under-active regular - light activities:
I do some light physical activity every week.
Under-active regular:
I do moderate physical activities every week, but less than 30 minutes a day or 5 days a week.
I do vigorous physical activities every week, but less than 20 minutes a day or 3 days a week.
Active:
I do 30 minutes or more a day of moderate physical activities, 5 or more days a week.
I do 20 minutes or more a day of vigorous physical activities, 3 or more days a week.</description>
