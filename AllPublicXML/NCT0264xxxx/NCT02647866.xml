    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of administration of
      multiple ascending doses of KHK4083 and to select the highest dose tolerated by subjects with
      moderately active Ulcerative Colitis (UC) followed by a Long-term Extension Therapy (LTE)
      phase for eligible subjects with a clinical response.

    <textblock>
      A Phase 2, double-blind clinical study of multiple ascending doses of KHK4083 (or placebo)
      with an Long-term Extension Therapy (LTE) phase will be conducted in approximately 60
      randomized adult subjects with moderately active UC who have a documented unsuccessful
      previous treatment.

      The Treatment Period includes double-blind Induction Therapy (12 weeks) and Open-label
      Therapy (OLE) phase (40 weeks) for eligible subjects at Week 12. Subjects already enrolled in
      the double-blind, long-term extension (LTE) under preceding versions of the protocol who
      worsen may be eligible to transition to the OLE up to Week 28.

      The Follow Up Period after the last administration will be for up to 16 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>Double-blind Induction Therapy was separated into Part A for administration of multiple ascending IV doses of KHK4083 (or placebo) to subjects in Cohorts 1-3 and Part B for administration of the maximally tolerated dose (as determined in cohorts 1-3) in expansion cohort 4. Subjects in Part A were prohibited from participating in Part B.
Subjects in each cohort were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive KHK4083 or placebo by IV infusion over 60 minutes (± 10 min.). Each subject received a total of 6 treatments (1 IV infusion per treatment) every 2 weeks from Week 0 (Day 1) to Week 10.
Subjects who completed double-blind Induction Therapy (i.e., at least 5 of 6 treatments) and had a clinical response or mucosal healing, as defined above, were eligible to continue in double-blind Long Term Extension Therapy (Weeks 12-52) &amp; after protocol amendment all subjects who received at least 5 of 6 treatments were eligible for Open Label Extension Therapy (Weeks 12-52).</intervention_model_description>
