    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators would use the training workshops as a capacity build method
      to deliver the holistic health knowledge for the trainers and ambassadors implementing and
      assisting the community-based programs for the public. The investigators hypothesize that the
      training workshops and mobile health messages would promote the health awareness and the
      health of the participants. The investigators would expect the participants influence the
      health behavior and attitude of their family members.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Holistic health is an integration and interaction of physical and psychosocial health.
      Positive psychology is a science of happiness, which focuses on positive emotions and
      personal strengths. It is used as a preventive and complementary medicine, which also is
      crucial component in family holistic health (happiness, harmony and health). Healthy diet can
      help to achieve energy balance and healthy weights. Sufficient daily consumption of fruit and
      vegetables, as well as limitation on the intake of sugar, salt and fat could prevent major
      diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers. Physical activity is believed
      to contribute to physical and mental health, as well as social well-being. However, physical
      inactivity was found to be a local and worldwide issue. and most Hong Kong people are having
      sedentary lifestyle. Studies show that the increase of physical activity and healthy diet
      reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and improve cardio-pulmonary functions; whereas
      sedentary behaviors increase the risk.

      The Project team will schedule the training workshops for the trainers and ambassadors
      implementing and assisting community-based programs for the public. The investigators
      hypothesize that the training workshops and mobile health messages would promote the health
      awareness and the health of the participants. The investigators hypothesize that the training
      workshops promote the participants' knowledge and enhance the participants' behaviors related
      to family holistic health, such as positive psychology, physical activity and healthy diet.
      The investigators would expect the participants influence the health attitude of their family
      members.
