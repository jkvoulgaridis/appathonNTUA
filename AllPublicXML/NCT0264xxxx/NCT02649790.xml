  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, multi-center, open-label clinical study with separate dose
      escalation (Phase 1) and expansion (Phase 2) stages to assess preliminary safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of the second generation oral XPO1 inhibitor KPT-8602 in patients
      with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM), metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC),
      metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and higher risk myelodysplastic
      syndrome (HR-MDS).

      Dose escalation and dose expansion may be included for all parts of the study as determined
      by ongoing study results.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MTD will be based on the assessment of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of therapy and will be defined as the highest dose at which 1 of 6 patients, at most, experiences DLTs within Cycle 1. Dose escalation will continue until an RP2D is selected based on DLT assessment.</description>

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Written informed consent obtained prior to any screening procedures and in accordance
             with federal, local, and institutional guidelines.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years.

             Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (Part F):

          3. Documented diagnosis of MDS with 5-19% myeloblasts.

          4. Patients should be intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS by International Prognostic Scoring
             System (IPSS).

          5. Patients believed to be IPSS high risk, without clearly meeting IPSS categories above
             should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to enrolling.

          6. HMA refractory patients including:

               1. ≥ 2 cycles of azacitidine and/or decitabine or experimental agents (such as
                  SGI-110 or ASTX727 or similar) with clear progressive disease (PD) (no count
                  recovery with ≥50% increase in bone marrow blasts)

                  OR

               2. ≥ 4 cycles of azacitidine and/or decitabine (or other hypomethylating therapy)
                  with lack of improvement (no CR/CRi/PR/HI).

          7. Patients receiving a stable dose of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) for at
             least 1 month at the time of study entry may continue to receive ESA.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA
