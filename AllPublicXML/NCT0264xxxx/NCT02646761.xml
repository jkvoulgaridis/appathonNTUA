  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if home-based therapy with monitoring via
      telemedicine can overcome many barriers to compliance and improve rehabilitation. Patients
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty will be followed for 10 weeks during their outpatient
      physical therapy course. Subjects will undergo standard physical therapy or physical therapy
      paired with InterACTION for 10 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Value Was Evaluated as the Ratio of Change in the Activities of Daily Living Scale Score to the Costs of Rehabilitation.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The value was calculated the ratio of the difference between the 10 week and baseline Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS) of the Knee Outcome Survey divided by the total charges for the physical therapy treatment sessions. The ADLS is a 14-item measure of symptoms and activity limitations for individuals with a variety of knee impairments. Items are scored from 0 to 4, and the total score is the sum of all the items divided by 70 and multiplied by 100. The ADLS score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing less symptoms and greater levels of activity. Higher ratio of the change in the ADLS score to the costs for rehabilitation represents greater value.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants That Complied With Rehabilitation Program</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance with the use of the InterACTION device was measured by reports generated from the device. Subjects in the Standard Physical Therapy Group completed exercise logs that were monitored at each study visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Satisfied With InterACTION Device</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects in the interACTION group were asked &quot;Would you consider using the InterACTION device if you had to do rehabilitation again in the future?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance Based Outcome Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The performance based measures included the 6-minute walk test (measured as distance in meters); stair climb test (measured as time in seconds divided by the number of steps); timed up and go test (measured in seconds); and unilateral balance test (measured in seconds). To combine the 4 performance-based outcome measures into a single composite score, the score for each test was converted to a z score (individual's score - overall mean)/overall standard deviation. As such, the z-score represents the number of SD deviations an individual's score is above or below the overall study mean. A z-score of 0 implies the participants score is the same as the mean score. A z-score of 0.1 would indicate that the participant's z score is .1 (10%) of a standard deviation above or below the overall mean. The average of the z scores for each performance-based outcome measure as the unit of analysis.</description>

        <title>Value Was Evaluated as the Ratio of Change in the Activities of Daily Living Scale Score to the Costs of Rehabilitation.</title>
        <description>The value was calculated the ratio of the difference between the 10 week and baseline Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS) of the Knee Outcome Survey divided by the total charges for the physical therapy treatment sessions. The ADLS is a 14-item measure of symptoms and activity limitations for individuals with a variety of knee impairments. Items are scored from 0 to 4, and the total score is the sum of all the items divided by 70 and multiplied by 100. The ADLS score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing less symptoms and greater levels of activity. Higher ratio of the change in the ADLS score to the costs for rehabilitation represents greater value.</description>

        <description>The performance based measures included the 6-minute walk test (measured as distance in meters); stair climb test (measured as time in seconds divided by the number of steps); timed up and go test (measured in seconds); and unilateral balance test (measured in seconds). To combine the 4 performance-based outcome measures into a single composite score, the score for each test was converted to a z score (individual's score - overall mean)/overall standard deviation. As such, the z-score represents the number of SD deviations an individual's score is above or below the overall study mean. A z-score of 0 implies the participants score is the same as the mean score. A z-score of 0.1 would indicate that the participant's z score is .1 (10%) of a standard deviation above or below the overall mean. The average of the z scores for each performance-based outcome measure as the unit of analysis.</description>
