    <textblock>
      Nulliparous women with a live singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation past 34
      gestational weeks will be randomized to lateral episiotomy or no episiotomy when operative
      vaginal delivery by vacuum extraction is indicated. Primary outcome is clinically diagnosed
      obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) of any degree.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has started at Danderyd Hospital. Danderyd Hospital is a large teaching hospital
      affiliated to the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. South General Hospital in
      Stockholm, Uppsala University Hospital, Falun Hospital, and Helsingborg Hospital have joined
      the trial 2017-2018. Additional hospitals are joining during 2019.

      Informed consent is collected from nulliparous women with a singelton, live fetus in cephalic
      presentation, with a planned vaginal delivery and without previous gynecological surgery due
      to incontinence or genital prolapse. Women can be approached at any time from gestational
      week 24 until delivery, unless they are in severe pain or discomfort, there is not enough
      time to consider the information, or any other reason not to obtain consent. The informed
      consent form is kept at the receiving research department and a note of consent/no consent is
      made in the obstetrical medical file.

      At indication for vacuum extraction, the patient's consent is confirmed verbally and
      allocation is made by sealed opaque envelopes on the vacuum extraction equipment mobile cart.
      Randomization is performed 1:1 in random permuted blocks generated by an external
      organization (Karolinska Trial Alliance).

      Lateral episiotomy is performed according to the intervention description. Total sample size
      has been calculated to 1400 women, if a reduction in OASIS prevalence from today's 12.2% to
      7.7% in operative vaginal deliveries is to be detected (estimated drop-out rate 3% for the
      primary outcome). The women will be recruited over a maximum of 4 years. An interim analysis
      will be performed after 350 randomized women to each arm, since a 50% reduction to less than
      6.1% sphincter tears could be detected with less than 5% risk of a type-1 error at this
      sample size. If such a reduction is seen, the study will be closed.

      Data is collected prospectively through Case Record Forms and the obstetrical medical file
      Obstetrix (Cerner Sverige AB), which covers approximately 98% of deliveries with complete
      data, and the Swedish Pregnancy Register covering the whole of Sweden from 2015. Using a
      weblink, questionnaires from the national Perineal Tear Register, are sent out electronically
      for the follow-up of the study participants. In addition, questionnaires regarding birth
      satisfaction (BSS-R and CEQ 2.0) are sent at 8 weeks after delivery. Questionnaires regarding
      sexual function (FSFI and FSDS) and quality of life (Euro-QoL-5D) at delivery and after 12
      months.

      A follow-up from registers regarding mode of delivery and prevalence of episiotomy and OASIS
      in subsequent births will be performed at 5 years and 10 years after the index birth.

      A substudy takes place in Stockholm and Uppsala, where included (randomized) women are
      examined at 6-12 months after delivery with 2D and 3D endovaginal and anal ultrasound to
      detect levator and sphincter injuries, measure episiotomy scars, establish POP-Q scores, and
      evaluate a new questionnaire for pelvic floor function after perineal tears.

      Another substudy takes place in Stockholm and Falun, where women who have been asked for
      consent (both affirmative and non-affirmative responders) as well as midwives who have tried
      to obtain consent, are invited to a qualitative interview study to explore the recruitment
      experience of women and midwives.
