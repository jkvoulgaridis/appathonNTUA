      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine when given with fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine, and filgrastim and
      to see how well they work in treating younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has
      come back after treatment (relapsed) or is not responding to treatment (is refractory).
      Liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine is made up of two chemotherapy drugs,
      cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride, and works to stop cancer cell growth by blocking
      the cells from dividing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate and
      cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Filgrastim may
      increase the production of blood cells and may help the immune system recover from the side
      effects of chemotherapy. Giving liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine followed by
      fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine, and filgrastim may be a better treatment for patients with
      relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and may cause fewer side effects to the heart, a common
      effect of other chemotherapy treatments for acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and the toxicities associated with
      liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) in pediatric and young adult patients
      with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To estimate the response rate (complete remission [CR] plus complete remission with
      partial platelet recovery [CRp]) after CPX-351 (cycle 1) followed by fludarabine phosphate,
      cytarabine, and filgrastim (FLAG) (cycle 2) in children with AML in first relapse.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rate (CR + CRp + complete remission with incomplete blood count
      recovery [CRi]) after one cycle of CPX-351.

      II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of plasma cytarabine and daunorubicin after CPX-351
      administration to pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the response in biomarkers of cardiac injury to a single cycle of CPX-351.

      II. To explore the effect of CPX-351 on novel biochemical and imaging markers of
      cardiotoxicity, including plasma micro ribonucleic acid (RNAs) (miRNA) and myocardial
      deformation.

      III. To explore the role of rare coding variants as risk factors for anthracycline-induced
      cardiomyopathy.

      OUTLINE:

      COURSE 1: Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 0 and at day 28-30 or up to 7
      days prior to day 1 of course 2, and liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients without evidence of central
      nervous system (CNS) disease (CNS1) receive no further CNS-directed therapy in course 1.
      Patients with &lt; 5 white blood cells per microliter of blood with blast cells (CNS2) disease
      may receive additional 4-6 doses of cytarabine IT twice weekly starting 48 hours after the
      third dose of liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine until CNS is clear at the
      discretion of the investigator. Patients meeting criteria for CR, CRp, and CRi may proceed to
      course 2.

      COURSE 2: Patients receive filgrastim on days 1-5 and then on day 15 until blood count
      recovery, and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes and high-dose cytarabine IV over 1-3
      hours once daily (QD) on days 1-5.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months, and
      then yearly for 5 years.

The relationship between 6-hour miR-29b and -499 expression and change in left ventricular global longitudinal strain between the pre-cycle and end of cycle 1 echocardiograms will be determined by calculating a Spearman correlation coefficient.</description>

      <desc>Adverse event reporting is collected routinely using case report forms. The SAE table reflects NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEs) submitted by the institution, via expedited reporting (NCI AdEERs / CAeRs). The “AE Other” table reflects all CTCAEs collected excluding those that were reported as SAEs. Ineligible patients are excluded from reporting of adverse events. All-Cause Mortality includes all deaths collected on the study.</desc>

          <description>COURSE 1: Patients receive cytarabine IT on day 0 and at day 28-30 or up to 7 days prior to day 1 of course 2, and liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients with CNS1 receive no further CNS-directed therapy in course 1. Patients with CNS2 disease may receive additional 4-6 doses of cytarabine IT twice weekly starting 48 hours after the third dose of liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine until CNS is clear at the discretion of the investigator. Patients meeting criteria for CR, CRp, and CRi may proceed to course 2.
COURSE 2: Patients receive filgrastim on days 1-5 and then on day 15 until blood count recovery, and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes and high-dose cytarabine IV over 1-3 hours QD on days 1-5.</description>
