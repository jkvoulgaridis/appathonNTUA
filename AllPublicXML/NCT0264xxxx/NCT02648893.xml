    <textblock>
      In this study, meals based on multiple food crops (containing either biofortified or
      commercially-available food crops) will be fed to young children in Madanapalle, Andhra
      Pradesh, India over a period of nine months to measure growth, cognitive changes, and immune
      function in comparison to children receiving non-biofortified crops. Mothers of the
      participating children will also be included in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron, zinc, and vitamin A deficiency remain a major worldwide public health problem
      especially in developing countries such as India. In this randomized study, 200 children aged
      6-12 months (and their lactating mothers) from Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh, India will be fed
      meals based on (either biofortified or commercially-available) multiple food crops three
      times per day, six days per week, for nine months. We will recruit children from 6 - 24
      months of age. The goal of this study is to examine the effects of the biofortified multiple
      food crops on immune function, growth, and cognitive function in this age group. The key
      outcome measures are biomarkers of vitamin A, iron and zinc status, growth (anthropometric
      z-scores), and immune and cognitive function. Nutrient biomarkers will be assessed at
      enrollment (baseline), at an intermediate time point (midline; random serial sampling) and
      after 9 months of follow-up (endline). Additionally, we will measure concentrations of
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), as iron and zinc biomarkers can
      be influenced by inflammation. To assess cognitive function, multiple specific aspects of
      memory and attention will be assessed. Higher-level, integrative cognitive abilities that
      require the coordination of multiple specific functions, such as problem-solving and
      exploratory behavior and global aspects of attention during free play with toys, will also be
      assessed. In addition, the Development Assessment Scales for Indian Infants (DASII) test will
      be conducted at baseline, intermediate, and endline assessments to obtain a broad measure of
      attainment of developmental milestones that can be used to compare the characteristics of
      this cohort with those reported in the literature.
