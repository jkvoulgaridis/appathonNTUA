  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study to test Sym015 in humans. The primary purpose of this study is to see
      if Sym015 is safe and effective for patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies without
      available therapeutic options.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first part of the study (Part 1, dose-escalation), Sym015 will be evaluated for safety
      and tolerability. Additionally, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined.
      Sym015 will be given at different dose levels on an every second week (Q2W) dosing schedule.
      Each patient will be given one fixed dose level.

      In the second part of the study (Part 2, dose-expansion), dosing will be at the RP2D on a Q2W
      dosing schedule. Three cohorts will be included:

        -  Basket Cohort: Patients with KRAS wild-type (WT) advanced solid tumor malignancies with
           MET-amplification and without therapeutic options. Patients must have no prior therapy
           with MET-targeting agents, except a subset of patients having received prior therapy
           with a MET-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). As of December 2018, accrual to
           this cohort is suspended.

        -  Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) MET-Amplified Cohort: Patients with advanced NSCLC
           with MET-amplification, and without available therapeutic options. Patients may have
           received prior therapy with MET-targeting and/or epidermal growth factor receptor
           (EGFR)-targeting agents.

        -  NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping alteration (METex14del) Cohort: Patients with advanced
           NSCLC METex14del, and without therapeutic options. Tumors need not be MET-amplified, and
           patients may have received prior therapy with MET-targeting and/or EGFR-targeting
           agents.
