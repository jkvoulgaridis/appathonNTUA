  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy of a 20 week multi-modal treatment comprised
      of lovastatin or placebo, and the Parent-implemented Language Intervention (PILI) in children
      with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Children will be randomized to drug or placebo in a
      double-blind design with all participating in the PILI. The primary endpoint will be to
      measure improvements in spoken language and behavior among lovastatin-treated than placebo
      treated participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first multi-modal treatment to combine a targeted treatment for FXS, lovastatin,
      with an innovative parent-implemented intervention (PILI) targeting language and challenging
      behavior delivered through telehealth technology.The hypothesis is that targeted treatments
      will be more effective when applied in combination with PILI. Examination of whether changes
      in the activity of key pathways/proteins influenced by fragile X mental retardation protein
      (FMRP) (the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) and MMP-9) are biomarkers of treatment
      responsiveness. Because lovastatin is also an anti-inflammatory, characterization of MEK/ERK
      signaling in peripheral immune cells both pre- and post- treatment will be carried out to
      determine whether levels of these signaling molecules are predictive biomarkers of treatment
      response. It is hypothesized that those individuals with elevated inflammatory cytokine
      profiles will be most responsive to lovastatin treatment. Once modeled in FXS, results from
      these studies can then be applied to other neurodevelopmental disorders including
      RASopathies.

      The behavioral component of the proposed multi-modal treatment will be a Parent-implemented
      Intervention (PILI) that targets improvements in spoken language and challenging behavior for
      10- to 17-year-olds with FXS by increasing parental verbal responsiveness (PVR) within
      picture-book based story-telling episodes. Parents will be encouraged to use the targeted
      strategies in other everyday interactions with their child. The intervention will be
      delivered to parents in their homes by way of video teleconferencing (VTC). Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive the behavioral intervention alone or in combination with
      Lovastatin.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome reflects the diversity of vocabulary used. Higher scores reflect more skill. The lowest possible value is zero. No theoretical maximum can be defined because the wordless picture books can lead to a large and indeterminate set of options for the amount of talk and the vocabulary used. In a previous study of a nonpharmacological intervention, the range at baseline was 9-177, and at post-treatment, the range for the combined treated and nontreated groups was 23-214, although these values were not corrected for the number of C-units produced (McDuffie at el. 2018 Developmental Neurorehabilitation).</description>

    <measure>FXS- Normed Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Social Avoidance Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC-C is a 58-item caregiver-rated behavior scale used to examine treatment effects on challenging behaviors for individuals with FXS in the following domains: (1) irritability; (2) lethargy/social withdrawal; (3) stereotypic behavior; (4) hyperactivity; and (5) inappropriate speech. Caregiver rates the subject's behavior as follows: 0 = not a problem, l = the behavior is a problem but slight in degree, 2 = the problem is moderately serious, 3 = the problem is severe in degree. Sansone et al. (2012) further subdivided social withdrawal to rate social avoidance in FXS. The subscale includes 4 items which were originally part of the Lethargy/Withdrawal subscale. This subscale captures core aspects of the FXS phenotype related to gaze avoidance, social ''escape'' behaviors, and social anxiety. Subscale score ranges from 0 to 12, higher scores reflect a more problematic behavior.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) - Spoken Language Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The measure was used to assess parental impressions of progress in two key symptoms: spoken language impairment and social impairment. The distance of the mark from one end is used as the outcome variable for analysis. Caregivers mark on a visual line measuring 10 cm with &quot;worst behavior&quot; at 0 cm and &quot;best behavior&quot; at 10 cm. For each behavior the caregiver is instructed to mark their impression of the behavior at baseline visit and again at the 10-weeks and 20-weeks visits. The calculated distance in cm between the marks drawn at the baseline and follow-up visits thereby demonstrates whether each behavior improved, worsened, or stayed the same during the study, and by how much. Shown here is the mean distance in cm from the &quot;worst behavior&quot; side for the Spoken Language Impairment scale, at baseline. The smaller the value, the worse the behavior. The range is minimum 0 cm to maximum 10 cm.</description>

          <description>A standardized test designed to measure developmental functioning and IQ for individuals ranging in age from 2 years to adulthood. Minimal verbal directions are used in the administration to allow assessment of cognitive ability independent of language ability. The Brief IQ screener is composed of 4 subtests: figure ground, form completion, sequential order, and repeated patterns subtests. IQ scores are the sum of the scaled scores for the subtests. Scores range from a minimum of 36 to a maximum of 169.</description>

        <title>FXS- Normed Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Social Avoidance Subscale</title>
        <description>The ABC-C is a 58-item caregiver-rated behavior scale used to examine treatment effects on challenging behaviors for individuals with FXS in the following domains: (1) irritability; (2) lethargy/social withdrawal; (3) stereotypic behavior; (4) hyperactivity; and (5) inappropriate speech. Caregiver rates the subject's behavior as follows: 0 = not a problem, l = the behavior is a problem but slight in degree, 2 = the problem is moderately serious, 3 = the problem is severe in degree. Sansone et al. (2012) further subdivided social withdrawal to rate social avoidance in FXS. The subscale includes 4 items which were originally part of the Lethargy/Withdrawal subscale. This subscale captures core aspects of the FXS phenotype related to gaze avoidance, social ''escape'' behaviors, and social anxiety. Subscale score ranges from 0 to 12, higher scores reflect a more problematic behavior.</description>

        <title>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) - Spoken Language Impairment</title>
        <description>The measure was used to assess parental impressions of progress in two key symptoms: spoken language impairment and social impairment. The distance of the mark from one end is used as the outcome variable for analysis. Caregivers mark on a visual line measuring 10 cm with &quot;worst behavior&quot; at 0 cm and &quot;best behavior&quot; at 10 cm. For each behavior the caregiver is instructed to mark their impression of the behavior at baseline visit and again at the 10-weeks and 20-weeks visits. The calculated distance in cm between the marks drawn at the baseline and follow-up visits thereby demonstrates whether each behavior improved, worsened, or stayed the same during the study, and by how much. Shown here is the mean distance in cm from the &quot;worst behavior&quot; side for the Spoken Language Impairment scale, at baseline. The smaller the value, the worse the behavior. The range is minimum 0 cm to maximum 10 cm.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome reflects the diversity of vocabulary used. Higher scores reflect more skill. The lowest possible value is zero. No theoretical maximum can be defined because the wordless picture books can lead to a large and indeterminate set of options for the amount of talk and the vocabulary used. In a previous study of a nonpharmacological intervention, the range at baseline was 9-177, and at post-treatment, the range for the combined treated and nontreated groups was 23-214, although these values were not corrected for the number of C-units produced (McDuffie at el. 2018 Developmental Neurorehabilitation).</description>
