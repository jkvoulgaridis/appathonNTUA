    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies topical cryotherapy (cooling hands and feet with
      ice bags) in reducing pain in patients with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy or
      paclitaxel induced acute pain syndrome. Peripheral neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
      pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts of the body.
      Paclitaxel produces a disabling syndrome of acute aches and pains. Topical cryotherapy is
      being studied to see if it can help relieve pain from peripheral neuropathy or acute pain
      syndrome caused by chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate whether topical cryotherapy can alleviate paclitaxel-induced peripheral
      neuropathy.

      II. To estimate whether topical cryotherapy can alleviate paclitaxel-induced acute pain
      syndrome (P-APS).

      III. To examine the possible relative toxicities related to topical cryotherapy in this study
      situation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients apply bags filled with crushed ice to hands and feet for 15 minutes before,
      for 60 minutes during administration, and for 15 minutes after finishing administration of
      paclitaxel.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on weeks 1-12.

      In both arms, courses repeat once a week for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 6 months.

    <measure>Area Under the Curve (AUC) EORTC CIPN20 Sensory Neuropathy Subscale Adjusting for Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Average Area Under the Curve per assessment (aAUCpa) of EORTC Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Module (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20) Sensory Neuropathy Subscale adjusting for baseline. The EORTC CIPN20 scoring algorithm was used for the sensory (items 31-36, 39, 40 and 48) subscale scores on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores represent fewer symptoms (better QOL). The aAUCpa for the subscale is calculated as the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment from pre-treatment-initiation to the week-12 assessment then subtract the corresponding baseline Sensory Neuropathy subscale score, with positive scores represent symptoms has improved from baseline and negative scores represent symptoms has worsen from baseline.</description>

        <description>Average Area Under the Curve per assessment (aAUCpa) of EORTC Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Module (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20) Sensory Neuropathy Subscale adjusting for baseline. The EORTC CIPN20 scoring algorithm was used for the sensory (items 31-36, 39, 40 and 48) subscale scores on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores represent fewer symptoms (better QOL). The aAUCpa for the subscale is calculated as the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment from pre-treatment-initiation to the week-12 assessment then subtract the corresponding baseline Sensory Neuropathy subscale score, with positive scores represent symptoms has improved from baseline and negative scores represent symptoms has worsen from baseline.</description>
