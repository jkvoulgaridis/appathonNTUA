    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa and Asia. The aim of this trial is to compare efficacy and
      safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart twice daily and biphasic insulin aspart twice daily
      in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus before, during and after Ramadan.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Hypoglycaemic Episodes Both According to the Novo Nordisk Definition for Hypoglycaemic Episodes (Severe or BG Hypoglycaemia) as Well as According to the ADA definition1 Confirmed Symptomatic</measure>
    <time_frame>From week 0 to 4 weeks post Ramadan</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent hypoglycaemic episodes: If the onset of the episode occurred on or after the first day of investigational medicinal product (IMP; IDegAsp/BIAsp 30) administration, and no later than 1 day after the last day on IMP, before switching to or being treated with another insulin product.
The above mentioned definitions (in endpoint title) should read as the following:
Novo Nordisk definition; severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode that was severe according to ADA classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose (PG) value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
American Diabetes Association (ADA) definition; documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode, during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia were accompanied by a measured PG concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).
Due to character limitation, severe hypoglycaemia as per ADA classification is not defined here; see next outcome measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Nocturnal (00:01-05:59 am) Severe or BG Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>From week 0 to 4 weeks post Ramadan</time_frame>
    <description>Number of treatment-emergent severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes, which occurred between 00:01 and 05:59 both inclusive.
Novo Nordisk definition; severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode that was severe according to ADA classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose (PG) value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
Severe hypoglycaemia as per ADA classification: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

          <title>Insulin Degludec/Insulin Aspart</title>
          <description>Subjects received insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) subcutaneously (s.c.; under the skin) in the thigh, upper arm or abdomen for a duration of 16-28 weeks (8−20 weeks treatment initiation period [pre-Ramadan], 4-week Ramadan treatment period, and 4 week post-Ramadan period). IDegAsp was administered twice daily (BID) during the entire treatment period with the breakfast/lunch meal and evening meal (during Ramadan Suhur and Iftar), with or without OADs. Subjects on pre-trial basal, premixed or self-mixed insulin therapy were converted unit-to-unit to trial insulin, BID IDegAsp at the same total insulin dose as the subject’s pre-trial total daily insulin dose. Subjects used a fixed dose adjustment titration algorithm and there was no minimum or maximum dose for trial products. To optimise and maintain glycaemic control, IDegAsp dose was adjusted based on the subjects’ SMPG values, measured twice daily during pre-Ramadan and post-Ramadan and 4 times daily during Ramadan.</description>

The above mentioned definitions (in endpoint title) should read as the following:
Novo Nordisk definition; severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode that was severe according to ADA classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose (PG) value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
American Diabetes Association (ADA) definition; documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode, during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia were accompanied by a measured PG concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).
Due to character limitation, severe hypoglycaemia as per ADA classification is not defined here; see next outcome measure.</description>

          <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Hypoglycaemic Episodes Both According to the Novo Nordisk Definition for Hypoglycaemic Episodes (Severe or BG Hypoglycaemia) as Well as According to the ADA definition1 Confirmed Symptomatic</title>
          <description>Treatment-emergent hypoglycaemic episodes: If the onset of the episode occurred on or after the first day of investigational medicinal product (IMP; IDegAsp/BIAsp 30) administration, and no later than 1 day after the last day on IMP, before switching to or being treated with another insulin product.
The above mentioned definitions (in endpoint title) should read as the following:
Novo Nordisk definition; severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode that was severe according to ADA classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose (PG) value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
American Diabetes Association (ADA) definition; documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode, during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia were accompanied by a measured PG concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).
Due to character limitation, severe hypoglycaemia as per ADA classification is not defined here; see next outcome measure.</description>
          <population>Analysis was based on the safety analysis set (SAS), which included all subjects receiving at least 1 dose of the investigational product (IDegAsp) or its comparator (BIAsp 30).</population>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Nocturnal (00:01-05:59 am) Severe or BG Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>Number of treatment-emergent severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes, which occurred between 00:01 and 05:59 both inclusive.
Novo Nordisk definition; severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode that was severe according to ADA classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose (PG) value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
Severe hypoglycaemia as per ADA classification: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

IDegAsp was administered BID during the entire treatment period with the breakfast/lunch meal and evening meal (during Ramadan Suhur and Iftar), with or without OADs. Subjects on pre-trial basal, premixed or self-mixed insulin therapy were converted unit-to-unit to trial insulin, BID IDegAsp at the same total insulin dose as the subject’s pre-trial total daily insulin dose. Subjects used a fixed dose adjustment titration algorithm and there was no minimum or maximum dose for trial products. To optimise and maintain glycaemic control, IDegAsp dose was adjusted based on the subjects’ SMPG values, measured twice daily during pre-Ramadan and post-Ramadan and 4 times daily during Ramadan.</description>
