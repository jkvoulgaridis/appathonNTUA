  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate performance criteria over one week of daily wear to determine if
      the comfilcon A asphere lens (test) performs equivalently to the comfilcon A sphere (control)
      in terms of measurement and subjective ratings of visual performance.

      Both comfilcon A asphere lens (test) and comfilcon A sphere (control) are Coopervision
      lenses.

      This study is a prospective, single site, daily wear, double masked, randomized bilateral
      cross over dispensing study of binocular wear of comfilcon A asphere lens (test) and
      comfilcon A sphere lens (control) over 1 week of daily wear. Assessments will be obtained
      upon dispensing each lens pair and following 1 week of daily lens use.
