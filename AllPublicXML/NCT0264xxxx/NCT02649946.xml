    <textblock>
      This study will compare the use of the COVERA™ Vascular Covered Stent (following percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty (PTA)) to PTA alone for the treatment of stenotic lesions in the
      upper extremity venous outflow of the arteriovenous (AV) access circuit of subjects dialyzing
      with an AV fistula.

    <measure>Effectiveness Endpoint: Number of Participants With Target Lesion Primary Patency (TLPP)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>TLPP is defined as the interval following the index intervention until the next clinically driven reintervention at, or adjacent to,the original treatment site or until the extremity is abandoned for permanent access. Primary patency ends when any of the following occurs: a) clinically driven reintervention in the treatment area; b) thrombotic occlusion within the treatment area; c) surgical intervention that excludes the original treatment area from the AV circuit, and/or d) abandonment of the AV fistula due to inability to treat the original treatment area. COVERA Vascular Covered Stent (following PTA) is evaluated against subjects treated PTA alone.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Freedom From AV Access Circuit Localized or Systemic Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Safety is defined as freedom from any adverse event(s) (AEs), localized or systemic, that reasonably suggests the involvement of the AV access circuit (not including stenosis or thrombosis) that require or result in any of the following alone or in combination: additional interventions (including surgery); in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization; or death.</description>

    <measure>Endpoint With Hypothesis Testing: Number of Patients With Target Lesion Primary Patency (TLPP) at 12 Months Post Index Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>TLPP is defined as the interval following the index intervention until the next clinically driven reintervention at the original treatment site or until the extremity is abandoned for permanent access. Primary patency ends when any of the following occurs: a) clinically driven reintervention in the treatment area; b) thrombotic occlusion within the treatment area; c) surgical intervention that excludes the original treatment area from the AV circuit, and/or d) abandonment of the AV fistula due to inability to treat the original treatment area. Not all TLPP 12-month data were available at the time of writing the interim analysis report, therefore, the results for this outcome measure will be presented when the final study report is completed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endpoint With Hypothesis Testing: Number of Participants With Access Circuit Primary Patency (ACPP).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>ACPP is defined as the interval following the index intervention until the next access thrombosis or repeated intervention.
ACPP ends with a reintervention anywhere within the access circuit. Vessel rupture caused by PTA is not an ACPP failure unless achieving hemostasis also causes thrombosis.
Testing of this secondary endpoint is performed in a hierarchical fashion.Thus, In order to perform hypothesis test of ACPP at 6-month, TLPP at 12-months must be successful.Since not all TLPP at 12-month results were available at time of interim CSR report, results of ACPP at 6-month will be presented when the final report for the study is completed.</description>

    <measure>Endpoint Without Hypothesis Testing: Index of Patency Function (IPF)</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>IPF is defined as the time from the index study procedure to study completion or access abandonment divided by the number of visits for a reintervention performed on the AV access circuit in order to maintain vascular access for hemodialysis. A visit is defined as one (1) procedural event, regardless of the number or type of interventions performed during the visit. The index procedure is counted as the first visit to ensure all subjects have a denominator of at least one.
Whereas the measure time frames for the overall study are 1, 3, 6, 12,18 and 24 months, the preliminary report only provides the 1, 3, and 6 months results. The 12,18 and 24 months results will be provided in the final reporting for the study.
The IPF is representative of the number of days between interventions to maintain access circuit patency. Higher values represent a better outcome, that is, more time elapsed between the Index study procedure and reinterventions.
mITT results are analyzed.</description>

        <description>ACPP is defined as the interval following the index intervention until the next access thrombosis or repeated intervention.
ACPP ends with a reintervention anywhere within the access circuit. Vessel rupture caused by PTA is not an ACPP failure unless achieving hemostasis also causes thrombosis.
Testing of this secondary endpoint is performed in a hierarchical fashion.Thus, In order to perform hypothesis test of ACPP at 6-month, TLPP at 12-months must be successful.Since not all TLPP at 12-month results were available at time of interim CSR report, results of ACPP at 6-month will be presented when the final report for the study is completed.</description>

        <title>Endpoint Without Hypothesis Testing: Index of Patency Function (IPF)</title>
        <description>IPF is defined as the time from the index study procedure to study completion or access abandonment divided by the number of visits for a reintervention performed on the AV access circuit in order to maintain vascular access for hemodialysis. A visit is defined as one (1) procedural event, regardless of the number or type of interventions performed during the visit. The index procedure is counted as the first visit to ensure all subjects have a denominator of at least one.
Whereas the measure time frames for the overall study are 1, 3, 6, 12,18 and 24 months, the preliminary report only provides the 1, 3, and 6 months results. The 12,18 and 24 months results will be provided in the final reporting for the study.
The IPF is representative of the number of days between interventions to maintain access circuit patency. Higher values represent a better outcome, that is, more time elapsed between the Index study procedure and reinterventions.

          <title>Endpoint Without Hypothesis Testing: Number of Participants With Post-intervention Secondary Patency</title>
          <description>Secondary Patency is defined as the interval after the index intervention until the access is abandoned. Multiple repetitive treatments can be included in post-intervention secondary patency.
Whereas the measure time frames for the overall study are 1, 3, 6, 12,18 and 24 months, the interim report only provides the 1, 3, and 6 months results. The 12,18 and 24 months results will be provided in the final reporting for the study.
mITT subjects results are presented.</description>
          <population>Post-Intervention Secondary Patency by Follow-Up Period (mITT Subjects). (n) varies in relation to the number of failures (access abandonment) recorded at 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. Accordingly, the (n) for each period may be different from the overall (N) reported in the Participant Flow section.</population>
