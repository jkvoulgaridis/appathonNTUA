    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment, and at 12 and 24 weeks after end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status. The 5 items in the EQ-5D-5L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 5 levels of severity (1: indicating no problem, 2: indicating slight problems, 3: indicating moderate problems, 4: indicating severe problems, 5: indicating extreme problems), and a separate visual analog scale (VAS).
Responses to the 5 dimension scores were combined and converted into a single preference-weighted health utility index score by applying country-specific weights.The range for EQ-5D-5L index score is 0 to 1 where '0' is defined as a health state equivalent to being dead and '1' is full health.The higher the score the better the health status.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status. with a separate visual analog scale (VAS).

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Index Score</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status. The 5 items in the EQ-5D-5L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 5 levels of severity (1: indicating no problem, 2: indicating slight problems, 3: indicating moderate problems, 4: indicating severe problems, 5: indicating extreme problems), and a separate visual analog scale (VAS).
Responses to the 5 dimension scores were combined and converted into a single preference-weighted health utility index score by applying country-specific weights.The range for EQ-5D-5L index score is 0 to 1 where '0' is defined as a health state equivalent to being dead and '1' is full health.The higher the score the better the health status.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Absenteeism</title>
        <description>The WPAI Hepatitis C V2.0 is an HCV specific questionnaire used to measure work absenteeism, work presenteeism, and daily activity impairment. Respondents were asked about time missed from work and time while at work during which productivity was impaired in the past seven days. Results of WPAI are expressed as a percentage of impairment from 0 to 100, with higher percentages indicating greater impairment and less productivity.
Absenteeism indicates the percentage of work time missed due to health problems.</description>

        <description>The WPAI Hepatitis C V2.0 is an HCV specific questionnaire used to measure work absenteeism, work presenteeism, and daily activity impairment. Respondents were asked about time missed from work and time while at work during which productivity was impaired in the past seven days. Results of WPAI are expressed as a percentage of impairment from 0 to 100, with higher percentages indicating greater impairment and less productivity.
Presenteeism indicates the percentage of impairment while working due to health problems.</description>
