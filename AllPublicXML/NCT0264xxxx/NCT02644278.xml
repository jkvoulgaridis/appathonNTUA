    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX-984 (M9831)
      administered alone and in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), and to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and preliminary evidence of efficacy of VX-984 in
      combination with PLD in participants with advanced solid tumors.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-Emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that were reported or worsened on or after the start of study drug dosing through the 28-day Safety Follow-up visit. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

        <title>Part A: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-Emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that were reported or worsened on or after the start of study drug dosing through the 28-day Safety Follow-up visit. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-Emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that were reported or worsened on or after the start of study drug dosing through the 28-day Safety Follow-up visit. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

        <description>The best overall response was defined as the number of participants who had achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best overall response according to radiological assessments as adjudicated by the IRC from randomization until the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD). CR: Complete Response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. Partial response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD defined as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of target lesions recorded since treatment started.</description>

          <description>The best overall response was defined as the number of participants who had achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best overall response according to radiological assessments as adjudicated by the IRC from randomization until the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD). CR: Complete Response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. Partial response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD defined as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of target lesions recorded since treatment started.</description>
