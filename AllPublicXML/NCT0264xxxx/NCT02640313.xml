  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating data in the literature suggests that radiolabeled-choline (18F-choline) is a
      sensitive molecular tracer for PET imaging that is taken up in activated cells and, as such,
      is able to identify active inflammatory sites. The investigators hypothesize that 18F-choline
      is also highly taken up in vulnerable plaques in comparison to the stable ones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accumulation and subsequent activation of inflammatory cells in the atherosclerotic plaques
      play an essential role in transforming a stable plaque into a vulnerable plaque at risk to
      rupture. On this basis, the study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of 18F-choline
      PET in identifying ongoing inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques. The investigators
      hypothesize that 18F-choline PET is efficient in detecting intraplaque inflammation and
      identify vulnerable plaques that are prone to rupture in comparison to the stable ones.

      It is likely that by correlating the inflammatory status of an atherosclerotic plaque (on
      18F-choline PET) with the presence of other vulnerable plaque features (on MR imaging) would
      be of high clinical relevance for clinical diagnosis of vulnerable plaques.
