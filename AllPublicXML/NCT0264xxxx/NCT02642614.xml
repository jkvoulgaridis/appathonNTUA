        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent consistent with ICH-Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines

          -  Males or females not of childbearing potential between 40 and 80 years (each
             inclusive) of age, on the day of patientÂ´s signature of informed consent.

             for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD).

             (Visit 3).

          -  Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Significant pulmonary disease other than COPD or other medical conditions as
             determined by medical history, examination, and clinical investigations at screening
             that may, in the opinion of the investigator, result in the any of the following:

               1. Put the patient at risk because of participation in the study

               2. Influence the results of the study

               3. Cast doubt on the patients ability to participate in the study

             (whichever is greater).

          -  Patients with surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics
             of the trial medication as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Patients with veins unsuited for venipuncture (for instance, veins which are difficult
             to locate, access or puncture, veins with a tendency to rupture during or after

          -  Patients who are unable to comply with the dietary regimen.

          -  Patients who have been previously randomized in this study.

          -  Patients who have donated more than 100 mL blood in the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 and
             between Visit 1 and Visit 3 or patients who have the intention to donate blood between
