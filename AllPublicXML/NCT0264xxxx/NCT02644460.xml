    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial evaluating abemaciclib (LY2835219), an inhibitor of cyclin
      dependent-kinases 4 and 6 (Cdk 4/6) in children and young adults with newly diagnosed diffuse
      intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (Stratum A) and in relapsed/refractory/progressive malignant
      brain (Grade III/IV, including DIPG; MBT) and solid tumor (ST) patients (Stratum B).

    <textblock>
      Stratum A- Appropriate dose RT will be administered in 30-33 fractions over approximately 6
      weeks for Stratum A patients. Treatment with abemaciclib (LY2835219) will start on the same
      day as radiation therapy (RT) and continue twice daily during and after RT for a maximum
      treatment duration of 2 years. Investigators plan to treat a maximum of 4 cohorts of research
      participants (dosage levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) with escalating doses of abemaciclib (LY2835219)
      starting with dose level 1 (80% of adult dose). A cycle is defined as 28 days and the first 6
      weeks of therapy will constitute the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluation period.
      Participants must take abemaciclib by mouth as intact capsules.

      Stratum B - Abemaciclib (LY2835219) will be administered orally on a twice daily basis
      continuously for 28 days, which defines one cycle. The maximum treatment duration will be 2
      years. Investigators plan to treat a maximum of 4 cohorts of research participants (dosage
      levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) with escalating doses of abemaciclib starting with dose level 1 (80%
      of adult dose). Dose escalation will be independent of Stratum A escalation. A cycle is
      defined as 28 days and the first 4 weeks of therapy will constitute the DLT-evaluation
      period. Participants must take abemaciclib by mouth as intact capsules.

             eligible once they meet peripheral blood count criteria.

          -  Growth factors: Patients must be off all colony forming growth factors(s) for at least
             1 week prior to registration (filgrastim, sargramostim, erythropoietin) and at least 2

          -  Patients with any concomitant significant medical illness that in the investigator's
             opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy, or that would impair

             tolerance to this treatment

          -  Patients receiving any other anticancer or investigational drug therapy

          -  Prior therapy with abemaciclib
