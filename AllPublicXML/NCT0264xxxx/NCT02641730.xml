  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), multicenter (when more than
      one hospital works on a medical research study) placebo-controlled (an inactive substance
      that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a
      clinical study) study in participants with palmoplantar pustulosis. The study will consist of
      3 phases: screening phase (up to 6 weeks), treatment period (week 0 - week 60) and
      observational period (up to week 84). Participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups (200 milligram [mg] guselkumab, 100 mg guselkumab or placebo group) using a stratified
      block randomization method in a 1:1:1 ratio at Week 0 and Group III (placebo) participants
      will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups at Week 16. Participants will
      primarily be assessed for change from baseline in Palmo-Plantar Pustular Area and Severity
      Index (PPPASI) total score at Week 16. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PPPASI assesses severity of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) lesions and response to therapy. In PPPASI, palms, soles are divided into 4 regions: right palm(RP), left palm(LP), right sole(RS), left sole(LS), that account for 20 percent (%), 20%,30%,30%, respectively, of total surface area(TSA) of palms, soles. Each area is assessed separately for erythema(E), pustules/vesicles (P), desquamation/scales (D), each rated on a scale (0-4). PPPASI produces score range of 0-72 using formula, PPPASI=(E+P+D)Area*0.2(RP)+(E+P+D)Area*0.2 (LP)+(E+P+D)Area*0.3(RS)+(E+P+D)Area*0.3(LS). Higher a score more the severe disease. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met treatment failure(TF) criterion(lack of efficacy/AE of worsening of PPP/who started a protocol-prohibited medication/therapy that could improve PPP), their baseline value carried forward to post baseline attending visits before and at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

    <description>PPSI assesses the severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy with a score ranging from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more severe disease. In the PPSI system, the more severely affected location (palms or soles) were to be identified as the evaluation sites at screening that to be assessed at all subsequent visits. Evaluation sites were assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles and desquamation/scale, for most severe skin lesion rated on a scale of 0 to 4. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion, their baseline value carried forward to the post-baseline attending visits before and at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

    <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a participant's QOL. It is a 10-item participant-reported outcome questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall QOL, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect QOL: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 30. Higher score indicates more severe disease. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion, their baseline value carried forward to the post-baseline attending visits before and at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

    <description>SF-36 consists of 8 individual domains, which are weighted sums of questions in their section. 8 domains are: vitality(VT), physical functioning(PF), bodily pain(BP), general health(GH), Role-Physical(RP), Role-Emotional(RE), social functioning(SF) and mental health(MH). Each of these 8 scales (domains) is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Based on scale scores, summary PCS is derived. Scales contributing most to the scoring of the SF-36 PCS include PF,RP,BP and GH. Other domains not noted contribute to scoring but to a lesser degree. Scoring is derived based on an algorithm as presented in Japanese edition manual. Summary PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) Total Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>PPPASI assesses severity of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) lesions and response to therapy. In PPPASI, palms, soles are divided into 4 regions: right palm(RP), left palm(LP), right sole(RS), left sole(LS), that account for 20 percent (%), 20%,30%,30%, respectively, of total surface area(TSA) of palms, soles. Each area is assessed separately for erythema(E), pustules/vesicles (P), desquamation/scales (D), each rated on a scale (0-4). PPPASI produces score range of 0-72 using formula, PPPASI=(E+P+D)Area*0.2(RP)+(E+P+D)Area*0.2 (LP)+(E+P+D)Area*0.3(RS)+(E+P+D)Area*0.3(LS). Higher a score more the severe disease. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met treatment failure(TF) criterion(lack of efficacy/AE of worsening of PPP/who started a protocol-prohibited medication/therapy that could improve PPP), their baseline value carried forward to post baseline attending visits before and at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Palmoplantar Severity Index (PPSI) Total Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>PPSI assesses the severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy with a score ranging from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more severe disease. In the PPSI system, the more severely affected location (palms or soles) were to be identified as the evaluation sites at screening that to be assessed at all subsequent visits. Evaluation sites were assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles and desquamation/scale, for most severe skin lesion rated on a scale of 0 to 4. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion, their baseline value carried forward to the post-baseline attending visits before and at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPPASI-50 Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>PPPASI assesses severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy. In PPPASI system, palms and soles are divided into 4 regions: right palm, left palm, right sole, and left sole, that account for 20%, 20%, 30%, and 30%, respectively, of TSA of palms and soles. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles, and desquamation/scales, each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. PPPASI produces a score range from 0 to 72. Higher score indicates more severe disease. PPPASI-50 response represents participants who achieved at least a 50% improvement from baseline in the PPPASI score. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PPSI Total Score</title>
        <description>PPSI assesses the severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy with a score ranging from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more severe disease. In the PPSI system, the more severely affected location (palms or soles) were to be identified as the evaluation sites at screening that to be assessed at all subsequent visits. Evaluation sites were assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles and desquamation/scale, for most severe skin lesion rated on a scale of 0 to 4. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion, their baseline value carried forward to the post-baseline attending visits before and at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period).

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPPASI-50 Response</title>
        <description>PPPASI assesses severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy. In PPPASI system, palms and soles are divided into 4 regions: right palm, left palm, right sole, and left sole, that account for 20%, 20%, 30%, and 30%, respectively, of TSA of palms and soles. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles, and desquamation/scales, each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. PPPASI produces a score range from 0 to 72. Higher score indicates more severe disease. PPPASI-50 response represents participants who achieved at least a 50% improvement from baseline in the PPPASI score. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at Week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 60, 72 and Week 84</time_frame>
        <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period). Here 'n' signifies the number of participants analyzed at the specified time point.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPPASI-50 Response</title>
          <description>PPPASI assesses severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy. In PPPASI system, palms and soles are divided into 4 regions: right palm, left palm, right sole, and left sole, that account for 20%, 20%, 30%, and 30%, respectively, of TSA of palms and soles. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles, and desquamation/scales, each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. PPPASI produces a score range from 0 to 72. Higher score indicates more severe disease. PPPASI-50 response represents participants who achieved at least a 50% improvement from baseline in the PPPASI score. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at Week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>
          <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period). Here 'n' signifies the number of participants analyzed at the specified time point.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPPASI-75 Response</title>
        <description>PPPASI assesses severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy. In PPPASI system, palms and soles are divided into 4 regions: right palm, left palm, right sole, and left sole, that account for 20%, 20%, 30%, and 30%, respectively, of TSA of palms and soles. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles, and desquamation/scales, each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. PPPASI produces a score range from 0 to 72. Higher score indicates more severe disease. PPPASI-75 response represents participants who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the PPPASI score. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at Week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as nonresponders at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period).

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPPASI-90 Response</title>
        <description>PPPASI assesses severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy. In PPPASI system, palms and soles are divided into 4 regions: right palm, left palm, right sole, and left sole, that account for 20%, 20%, 30%, and 30%, respectively, of TSA of palms and soles. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles, and desquamation/scales, each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. PPPASI produces a score range from 0 to 72. Higher score indicates more severe disease. PPPASI-90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90% improvement from baseline in the PPPASI score. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at Week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 60, 72 and Week 84</time_frame>
        <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period).

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPPASI-100 Response</title>
        <description>PPPASI assesses severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy. In PPPASI system, palms and soles are divided into 4 regions: right palm, left palm, right sole, and left sole, that account for 20%, 20%, 30%, and 30%, respectively, of TSA of palms and soles. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles, and desquamation/scales, each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. PPPASI produces a score range from 0 to 72. Higher score indicates more severe disease. PPPASI-100 response represents participants who achieved at least a 100% improvement from baseline in the PPPASI score. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at Week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 60, 72 and Week 84</time_frame>
        <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period). Here 'n' signifies the number of participants analyzed at the specified time point.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPPASI-100 Response</title>
          <description>PPPASI assesses severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy. In PPPASI system, palms and soles are divided into 4 regions: right palm, left palm, right sole, and left sole, that account for 20%, 20%, 30%, and 30%, respectively, of TSA of palms and soles. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles, and desquamation/scales, each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. PPPASI produces a score range from 0 to 72. Higher score indicates more severe disease. PPPASI-100 response represents participants who achieved at least a 100% improvement from baseline in the PPPASI score. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at Week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>
          <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period). Here 'n' signifies the number of participants analyzed at the specified time point.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPSI-50 Response</title>
        <description>PPSI assesses the severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy with a score ranging from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more severe disease. In the PPSI system, the more severely affected location (palms or soles) were to be identified as the evaluation sites at screening that to be assessed at all subsequent visits. Evaluation sites were assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles and desquamation/scale, for most severe skin lesion rated on a scale of 0 to 4. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion, their baseline value carried forward to the post-baseline attending visits before and at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPSI-75 Response</title>
        <description>PPSI assesses the severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy with a score ranging from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more severe disease. In the PPSI system, the more severely affected location (palms or soles) were to be identified as the evaluation sites at screening that to be assessed at all subsequent visits. Evaluation sites were assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles and desquamation/scale, for most severe skin lesion rated on a scale of 0 to 4. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion, their baseline value carried forward to the post-baseline attending visits before and at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPSI-90 Response</title>
        <description>PPSI assesses the severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy with a score ranging from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more severe disease. In the PPSI system, the more severely affected location (palms or soles) were to be identified as the evaluation sites at screening that to be assessed at all subsequent visits. Evaluation sites were assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles and desquamation/scale, for most severe skin lesion rated on a scale of 0 to 4. PPSI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90% improvement from baseline in the PPSI score. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at Week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 60, 72 and Week 84</time_frame>
        <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period). Here 'n' signifies the number of participants analyzed at the specified time point.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPSI-90 Response</title>
          <description>PPSI assesses the severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy with a score ranging from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more severe disease. In the PPSI system, the more severely affected location (palms or soles) were to be identified as the evaluation sites at screening that to be assessed at all subsequent visits. Evaluation sites were assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles and desquamation/scale, for most severe skin lesion rated on a scale of 0 to 4. PPSI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90% improvement from baseline in the PPSI score. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at Week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>
          <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period). Here 'n' signifies the number of participants analyzed at the specified time point.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PPSI-100 Response</title>
        <description>PPSI assesses the severity of PPP lesions and their response to therapy with a score ranging from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more severe disease. In the PPSI system, the more severely affected location (palms or soles) were to be identified as the evaluation sites at screening that to be assessed at all subsequent visits. Evaluation sites were assessed separately for erythema, pustules/vesicles and desquamation/scale, for most severe skin lesion rated on a scale of 0 to 4. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion, their baseline value carried forward to the post-baseline attending visits before and at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <description>The PGA documents the Physician's Global Assessment of the PPP overall skin lesions status. The participant's PPP is assessed as clear (0), almost clear (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5). Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders at week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <description>The PGA documents the Physician's Global Assessment of the participant's palmoplantar overall skin lesions status. The participant's PPP is assessed as clear (0), almost clear (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5). Participants who achieved a PGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) were reported. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders through Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 60, 72 and Week 84</time_frame>
        <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period). Here 'n' signifies the number of participants analyzed at the specified time point.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PGA Score of Cleared (0) or Almost Cleared (1)</title>
          <description>The PGA documents the Physician's Global Assessment of the participant's palmoplantar overall skin lesions status. The participant's PPP is assessed as clear (0), almost clear (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5). Participants who achieved a PGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) were reported. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders through Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>
          <population>Population included Randomized analysis set. The missing values were imputed based on TF criterion and LOCF method until Week 60; no imputation performed for missing data after Week 60 (in observational period). Here 'n' signifies the number of participants analyzed at the specified time point.</population>

        <description>The PGA documents the Physician's Global Assessment of the participant's palmoplantar overall skin lesions status. The participant's PPP is assessed as clear (0), almost clear (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5). Participants who achieved a PGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) and had at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline were reported. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion were considered as non-responders through Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a participant's QOL. It is a 10-item participant-reported outcome questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall QOL, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect QOL: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 30. Higher score indicates more severe disease. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion, their baseline value carried forward to the post-baseline attending visits before and at Week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the 36-Item Short-Form Health Assessment Questionnaire (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score</title>
        <description>SF-36 consists of 8 individual domains, which are weighted sums of questions in their section. 8 domains are: vitality(VT), physical functioning(PF), bodily pain(BP), general health(GH), Role-Physical(RP), Role-Emotional(RE), social functioning(SF) and mental health(MH). Each of these 8 scales (domains) is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Based on scale scores, summary PCS is derived. Scales contributing most to the scoring of the SF-36 PCS include PF,RP,BP and GH. Other domains not noted contribute to scoring but to a lesser degree. Scoring is derived based on an algorithm as presented in Japanese edition manual. Summary PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion, their baseline value carried forward to post-baseline attending visits before and at week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

          <description>SF-36 consists of 8 individual domains, which are weighted sums of questions in their section. 8 domains are: vitality(VT), physical functioning(PF), bodily pain(BP), general health(GH), Role-Physical(RP), Role-Emotional(RE), social functioning(SF) and mental health(MH). Each of these 8 scales (domains) is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Based on scale scores, summary PCS is derived. Scales contributing most to the scoring of the SF-36 PCS include PF,RP,BP and GH. Other domains not noted contribute to scoring but to a lesser degree. Scoring is derived based on an algorithm as presented in Japanese edition manual. Summary PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion, their baseline value carried forward to post-baseline attending visits before and at week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by participants and consists of EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analog scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and unable. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, VAS where the endpoints are labeled 'Best imaginable health state' (score of 100) and 'Worst imaginable health state' (score of 0). Participants were analyzed according to the treatment at week 0 or 16. Participants who discontinue study agent as they met a TF criterion their baseline value carried forward to the post-baseline attending visits before and at week 16 and after TF were applied, remaining missing data were handled with LOCF till Week 60.</description>
