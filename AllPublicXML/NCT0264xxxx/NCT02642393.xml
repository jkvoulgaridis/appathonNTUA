  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to determine
      whether oral inosine dosed to moderately elevate serum urate (from ≤5.7 mg/dL to 7.1-8.0
      mg/dL) over 2 years slows clinical decline in early PD.

      Clinical decline will be assessed as change in the primary outcome variable of the Movement
      Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), a composite scale
      comprising patient- and clinician-reported outcomes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capsules containing 500 mg of inosine (active drug) or ~500 mg of lactose (placebo) will be
      taken orally up to two capsules three times per day (i.e., up to 3 g/day) for 24 months. In
      the inosine-treated group the number of capsules taken per day will be titrated to serum
      urate levels - measured at trough at study visits no more than three months apart - in order
      to achieve concentrations of 7.1-8.0 mg/dL. Initial dosing will be tailored to individualized
      factors including gender and pretreatment serum urate, and then advanced gradually toward the
      projected target dose. Adjustments in dosing of placebo capsules in the control arm will be
      algorithm-based to match dosing of inosine capsules in the active drug arm.

      Following study drug discontinuation all subjects will be followed during a 3-month wash-out
      period by telephone calls and a final study visit. All study visits after screening will
      include measurement of the primary outcome variable (MDS-UPDRS) and most will include
      secondary outcome variables: adverse events, dose adjustments, disability warranting
      initiation of dopaminergic therapy, Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL),
      39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), Schwab &amp; England Activities of Daily
      Living (S&amp;E ADL) scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and orthostatic vital signs.

    <description>The primary outcome of the trial is rate of change in the Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) I-III total score over 24 months estimated from a shared-baseline, random-slopes mixed model, censoring follow-up of subjects after initiation of dopaminergic therapy. Parts I-III of the MDS-UPDRS include ratings of non-motor experiences of daily living, motor experiences of daily living, and a motor examination. The MDS-UPDRS is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4 where higher scores imply worse symptoms. Parts I-III contain 59 total questions (13 in Part I, 13 in Part II, and 33 in Part III). Total scores for Parts I-III are calculated as simple sums of component items with mean imputation by Part if no more than 1, 2, or 7 items are missing for Parts I through III, respectively. Total scores may range from 0 to 236, with 0 meaning no symptoms and 236 meaning worse symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Rate of Change in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire - 39 Item Version (PDQ-39) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of change in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire - 39 item version (PDQ-39) scale points (over the time between baseline visit and final visit on study drug) will be assessed for subjects in each treatment group. The PDQ-39 asks 39 questions organized over eight domains (scales): mobility (10 items), activities of daily living (6 items), emotional well-being (6 items), stigma (4 items), social support (3 items), cognition (4 items), communication (3 items), and bodily discomfort (3 items). Each item has five possible ordinal responses, from never to always, depending on frequency of the symptom over the preceding month. The eight scales' scores are generated by Likert's method of summated ratings and then transformed to a single figure that ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores are associated with more symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Rate of Change in Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of change in Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) scale points (over the time between baseline visit and final visit on study drug) will be assessed for subjects in each treatment group. Neuro-QOL is a set of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures that assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people with neurological disorders. It comprises 17 domains of HRQL covering physical, psychological and social health. Domains tested include anxiety, cognitive function, communication, depression, emotional and behavioral dyscontrol, fatigue, lower extremity function- mobility, positive affect and well- being, stigma, upper extremity function- fine motor and ADL, sleep disturbance, satisfaction with social roles and activities, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. Higher raw scores are associated with more of the concept being measured. All scales range from 8 to 40 except for Positive Affect and Well-Being which ranges from 9 to 45.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Rate of Change in Schwab and England Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of change in percentage points on the Schwab and England scale for functional disability (over the time between baseline visit and final visit on study drug) will be assessed for subjects in each treatment group. The Schwab and England scale is a Site Investigator and subject assessment of the subject's level of independence. The subject will be scored on a percentage scale reflective of his/her ability to perform acts of daily living. Printed scores with associated descriptors range from 0% to 100% in increments of 5%, with higher percentages associated with more independence. A score of 0% implies &quot;vegetative functions such as swallowing, bladder and bowel functions are not functioning; bedridden&quot;. A score of 100% implies &quot;subject has full ability and is completely independent; essentially normal&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Rate of Change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of change in points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (for cognition; over the time between baseline visit and final visit on study drug) will be assessed for subjects in each treatment group. The MoCA assesses attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Points are awarded for the correct completion of MoCA tasks. Scores for each task are summed for a total score (range 0-30). Higher scores indicate greater cognitive capacity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptomatic Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>three months (after both initiation and discontinuation of study drug)</time_frame>
    <description>Symptomatic effects will be estimated by changes in motor and other features (e.g., as assessed by short-term change in Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS] I-III total score) during the first 3 months of wash-in at the start of period 1 and during the 3-month wash-out of period 2. The MDS-UPDRS includes ratings of non-motor experiences of daily living, motor experiences of daily living, and a motor examination. The MDS-UPDRS is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4 where higher scores imply worse features. Parts I-III contain 59 total questions (13 in Part I, 13 in Part II, and 33 in Part III). Total scores are calculated as simple sums of component items with mean imputation by Part if no more than 1, 2, or 7 items are missing for Parts I through III, respectively. Total scores may range from 0 to 236, with 0 meaning no symptoms and 236 meaning worse symptoms.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome of the trial is rate of change in the Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) I-III total score over 24 months estimated from a shared-baseline, random-slopes mixed model, censoring follow-up of subjects after initiation of dopaminergic therapy. Parts I-III of the MDS-UPDRS include ratings of non-motor experiences of daily living, motor experiences of daily living, and a motor examination. The MDS-UPDRS is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4 where higher scores imply worse symptoms. Parts I-III contain 59 total questions (13 in Part I, 13 in Part II, and 33 in Part III). Total scores for Parts I-III are calculated as simple sums of component items with mean imputation by Part if no more than 1, 2, or 7 items are missing for Parts I through III, respectively. Total scores may range from 0 to 236, with 0 meaning no symptoms and 236 meaning worse symptoms.</description>

        <title>Clinical Efficacy: Rate of Change in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire - 39 Item Version (PDQ-39) Scale</title>
        <description>Rate of change in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire - 39 item version (PDQ-39) scale points (over the time between baseline visit and final visit on study drug) will be assessed for subjects in each treatment group. The PDQ-39 asks 39 questions organized over eight domains (scales): mobility (10 items), activities of daily living (6 items), emotional well-being (6 items), stigma (4 items), social support (3 items), cognition (4 items), communication (3 items), and bodily discomfort (3 items). Each item has five possible ordinal responses, from never to always, depending on frequency of the symptom over the preceding month. The eight scales' scores are generated by Likert's method of summated ratings and then transformed to a single figure that ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores are associated with more symptoms.</description>

        <description>Rate of change in Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) scale points (over the time between baseline visit and final visit on study drug) will be assessed for subjects in each treatment group. Neuro-QOL is a set of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures that assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people with neurological disorders. It comprises 17 domains of HRQL covering physical, psychological and social health. Domains tested include anxiety, cognitive function, communication, depression, emotional and behavioral dyscontrol, fatigue, lower extremity function- mobility, positive affect and well- being, stigma, upper extremity function- fine motor and ADL, sleep disturbance, satisfaction with social roles and activities, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. Higher raw scores are associated with more of the concept being measured. All scales range from 8 to 40 except for Positive Affect and Well-Being which ranges from 9 to 45.</description>

        <description>Rate of change in Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) depression module scale points (over the time between baseline visit and final visit on study drug) will be assessed for subjects in each treatment group. Neuro-QOL is a set of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures that assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people with neurological disorders. Higher raw scores are associated with more of the concept being measured. The depression module score ranges from 8 to 40.</description>

        <description>Rate of change in percentage points on the Schwab and England scale for functional disability (over the time between baseline visit and final visit on study drug) will be assessed for subjects in each treatment group. The Schwab and England scale is a Site Investigator and subject assessment of the subject's level of independence. The subject will be scored on a percentage scale reflective of his/her ability to perform acts of daily living. Printed scores with associated descriptors range from 0% to 100% in increments of 5%, with higher percentages associated with more independence. A score of 0% implies &quot;vegetative functions such as swallowing, bladder and bowel functions are not functioning; bedridden&quot;. A score of 100% implies &quot;subject has full ability and is completely independent; essentially normal&quot;.</description>

        <description>Rate of change in points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (for cognition; over the time between baseline visit and final visit on study drug) will be assessed for subjects in each treatment group. The MoCA assesses attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Points are awarded for the correct completion of MoCA tasks. Scores for each task are summed for a total score (range 0-30). Higher scores indicate greater cognitive capacity.</description>

        <title>Symptomatic Effects</title>
        <description>Symptomatic effects will be estimated by changes in motor and other features (e.g., as assessed by short-term change in Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS] I-III total score) during the first 3 months of wash-in at the start of period 1 and during the 3-month wash-out of period 2. The MDS-UPDRS includes ratings of non-motor experiences of daily living, motor experiences of daily living, and a motor examination. The MDS-UPDRS is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4 where higher scores imply worse features. Parts I-III contain 59 total questions (13 in Part I, 13 in Part II, and 33 in Part III). Total scores are calculated as simple sums of component items with mean imputation by Part if no more than 1, 2, or 7 items are missing for Parts I through III, respectively. Total scores may range from 0 to 236, with 0 meaning no symptoms and 236 meaning worse symptoms.</description>
