  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, prospective trial assessing the efficacy and
      safety of microneedling treatment alone vs. microneedling treatment followed by treatment
      with Bellafill for correction of distensible atrophic facial acne scars.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into two study Periods. In Period I, subjects will attend a Screening
      visit (Week -4) and undergo the Bellafill skin test. At Visit 1 (Day 0), all subjects will
      commence microneedling treatment for their atrophic acne scars. Subjects will then return to
      the clinic at Week 3 and Week 6 (Visits 2 and 3, respectively) for follow-up evaluation and
      additional cycles of microneedling treatment.

      At Week 12 (Visit 4), all subjects commence Period II and are randomized to Bellafill
      Treatment (Track A) or to No Treatment (Track B):

        -  Track A: Consists of three (3) study visits. At Visit 4, subjects randomized to the
           &quot;Bellafill&quot; group will receive treatment with Bellafill for their atrophic acne scars.
           Subjects return for Visit 5A (Month 1 after randomization) for evaluation and follow-up,
           and will receive touch-up injections with Bellafill to achieve optimal correction (if
           necessary). Subjects will then be followed-up at Visits 6A and 7A which will occur at
           Month 3 and Month 6, respectively, after their last Bellafill treatment.

        -  Track B: Consists of one (1) study visit. At Visit 4, subjects randomized to the &quot;No
           Treatment&quot; group will complete visit evaluations and then return for follow-up at Visit
           5B (approx. Month 3 after randomization).

The device will then be reoriented vertically and rolling will be repeated in a vertical direction.</description>

            <description>Subjects undergo microneedling as described for the Microneedling Only group. Then at Week 12, all eligible scars within the treatment areas on each side of the face will be treated with Bellafill (injected using a standard tunneling technique). A touch-up treatment is allowed at Month 1 after initial treatment, if additional treatment is required to achieve optimal correction.

The device will be rolled in a horizontal direction with medium pressure. After every roll, the device will be lifted and positioned a few millimeters inferior to the previous starting point. Rolling will be repeated until the entire skin area has been treated. The device will then be reoriented vertically and rolling will be repeated in a vertical direction.
