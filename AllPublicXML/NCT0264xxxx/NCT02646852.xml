  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, two-arm, dose escalation study of PLX038 intravenous infusion
      administered to patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors. This study will explore
      two different dosing schedules: Arm 1, once every 3 week (q3w), and Arm 2, once weekly for 2
      consecutive weeks of a 4-week cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PLX038 is an investigational drug product that has demonstrated reasonable antitumor activity
      in preclinical colorectal, gastric and lung tumor models in animals. This is a first in human
      trial to determine the maximum, safest dose of PLX038 IV that can be administered to patients
      either once every 3 weeks or once every 2 weeks.

Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL.

               -  Serum sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium within normal limits for the
                  institution (supplements may be given to correct values)
