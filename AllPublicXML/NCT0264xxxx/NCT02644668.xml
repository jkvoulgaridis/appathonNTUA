      This study evaluated the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of CK-2127107 (hereafter referred to as
      reldesemtiv) versus placebo on measures of skeletal muscle function or fatigability in
      patients with Type II, III, or IV spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CY 5021 was a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study of
      reldesemtiv in 2 sequential ascending dose cohorts of patients with SMA. Patients were
      randomized 2:1 to receive reldesemtiv or placebo twice daily for 8 weeks. Patients randomized
      to reldesemtiv in Cohort 1 received a dose of 150 mg twice daily and patients randomized to
      reldesemtiv in Cohort 2 received 450 mg twice daily. Within each cohort, randomization was
      stratified by ambulatory status (ambulatory versus non ambulatory).

      The primary objective of the study was to determine the PD effects of reldesemtiv on measures
      of pulmonary function, respiratory function, muscle strength, and motor function. Other PD
      measures included changes in the timed up and go (TUG) test, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and
      patient and investigator global assessments. Secondary objectives included safety of multiple
      doses of reldesemtiv and an evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of reldesemtiv.

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 8 in Percent Predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FVC was measured using a calibrated spirometer (in units of liters). Patients were instructed to take as deep an inspiration as possible followed by a maximum exhalation (blowing out all the air in their lungs). Values obtained were converted to percent predicted values (ie, the test result as a percent of predicted values for patients of similar demographic and baseline characteristics [eg, height, age, sex]).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 8 in Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MIP was measured (in units of cm H20) using a calibrated spirometer with an inspiratory pressure valve attached. For the test, patients were asked to inhale as forcefully as possible, to their maximum pressure.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 8 in Maximum Expiratory Pressure (MEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MEP was measured (in units of cm H20) using a calibrated spirometer with an exspiratory pressure valve attached. For the test, patients were asked to maximally inhale then perform a forced exhalation with as forcefully as possible.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 8 in Muscle Strength Mega-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength of 3 muscle groups (elbow flexion, knee extension, and shoulder abduction) were measured bilaterally using a hand-held dynamometer. Muscle strength was measured twice for each body location; if the variability between the 2 measures was &gt; 15%, a third measure was obtained.
The maximum muscle strength of the 2 measurements was identified and transformed as a percent change from baseline using the equation: ([postbaseline value - baseline value] / baseline value) × 100.
The mega-score was a composite score that averaged strength across the 3 muscle groups. It was calculated as the mean of the non-missing transformed muscle strength scores among the 3 muscle groups each measure bilaterally (totaling 6 body locations).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 8 in the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMS-E)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HFMS-E evaluated the level of independent mobility and motor skills through assessment of 33 test-items, each scored from 0 (worse) to 2 (better). The total score was calculated as the sum of the scores among the 33 test items, and has a range from 0 to 66.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 8 in Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RULM assessed motor function in the upper limbs (specifically shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand function) that related to activities of everyday life. The RULM consisted of 20 items, 1 of which was scored on a 7-point scale (from 0 to 6) and the remaining 19 were scored on a 3-point scale (from 0 to 2); the higher the total score, the better the function.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 8 in the 6MWT</measure>
