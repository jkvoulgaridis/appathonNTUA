    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, open label, single centre, non-randomised study in patients with advanced solid
      malignancies consists of two parts:

        1. Single Dose Period - will characterise the absorption, metabolism, excretion and
           pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of [14C]AZD2014 from the body

        2. Multiple Dose Period - will further assess the safety and tolerability and anti-tumour
           activity of multiple doses of AZD2014 when given as a monotherapy or given in
           combination with paclitaxel or fulvestrant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, single centre, non-randomised study in patients with advanced
      solid malignancies that is refractory or resistant to standard treatment or where no suitable
      effective standard treatment exists or for whom paclitaxel or fulvestrant are appropriate
      treatment choices. The study will be divided in two parts:

        1. Single Dose Period - will enrol up to 6 evaluable patients to characterise the
           absorption, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetics of a single radiolabelled [14C]
           oral dose of 125mg AZD2014 via residential intensive PK sampling over 8 days. An
           evaluable patient is defined as patient who does not vomit within 2 hours post dose and
           who has completed the scheduled PK sampling.

        2. Multiple Dose Period - patients who have completed the Single Dose Period may continue
           to receive treatment as outpatients. Patients will be allocated to different treatment
           regimes as decided between Investigator and patient on a risk / benefit basis. From Day
           1, Cycle 1, non-radiolabelled AZD2014 treatment will be administered as oral tablets to
           patients, either as:

      i. 50mg BD monotherapy ii. 125mg BD taken on first 2 days of treatment each week in
      combination with 500mg intramuscular fulvestrant on Day 1, Cycle 1, Day 15, Cycle 1; Day 1,
      Cycle 2, then Day 1 of each monthly cycle thereafter iii. 50mg BD taken on first 3 days of
      treatment each week for 6 weeks in combination with a single weekly paclitaxel infusion
      (80mg/m2 ) followed by a one week break from treatment where no AZD2014 or paclitaxel will be
      given. This 7 week schedule composes one cycle of treatment. Patients will be given up to 6
      cycles of paclitaxel, although additional cycles of paclitaxel may be given if deemed
      appropriate by the Investigator.

      Radiolabelled AZD2014 will be administered to fasted patients (i.e. no food 2 hours before
      and 1 hour after each dose). Non-radiolabelled AZD2014 will be administered either under
      fasted or non-fasted conditions. The safety and tolerability and anti-tumour activity of
      AZD2014 and combination with paclitaxel or fulvestrant will be evaluated in all enrolled
      patients respectively using conventional safety parameters, AEs/SAEs and RECIST 1.1.

      <recruitment_details>First subject enrolled: 8 February 2016; Last Subject Last Visit: 21 December 2016 (End of Study [EoS]). The study was performed at a single study centre in the United Kingdom. Adult patients with advanced solid tumours refractory or resistant to standard therapies were recruited into this 2 period study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>4 patients were enrolled (signed informed consent). Following [14C]-AZD2014, patients either continued AZD2014 as monotherapy or in combination with a standard regimen of fulvestrant or paclitaxel as appropriate and at the Investigator’s discretion. No patients were recruited into AZD2014+paclitaxel treatment regimen.</pre_assignment_details>

Multiple Dose Period: From Day 1 Cycle 1, patients could continue non-radiolabelled AZD2014 (AZD2014 monotherapy), which was administered as an oral tablet. Patients continued treatment as outpatients until withdrawal due to adverse events (AEs), withdrawal of consent, progression of disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, until the patient was no longer receiving clinical benefit or the patient started any new anti-cancer therapy.</description>

        <title>Total Radioactivity in Plasma Following Administration of [14C]-AZD2014</title>
        <description>The mean concentrations of total radioactivity in plasma collected from each patient who received a single oral dose of 125 mg [14C]-AZD2014 are presented for time points of plasma sampling up to 48 hours post-dose. Geometric mean concentrations were not quantifiable after 48 hours. The total [14C] radioactivity in plasma was converted to concentration equivalents of AZD2014 based on the actual specific activity of the dose.</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples collected: Day 1 at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 32 and 48 hours (h) post [14C]-AZD2014 dose in the Single Dose Period.</time_frame>
        <population>The Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis population consisted of all evaluable patients who were dosed with [14C]-AZD2014 in Cycle 0 and who had reportable and evaluable PK concentration data. Patients were excluded if they vomited at or before 3 hours post-dosing or had identified procedural or scientific deficiency as being likely to impact the PK data.</population>

        <title>Total Radioactivity Concentrations in Saliva Following Administration of [14C]-AZD2014</title>
        <description>The mean concentrations of total radioactivity in saliva collected from each patient who received a single oral dose of 125 mg [14C]-AZD2014 are presented for time points of saliva collection up to 12 hours post-dose. Geometric mean concentrations were not quantifiable after 12 hours. The total [14C] radioactivity in saliva was converted to concentration equivalents of AZD2014 based on the actual specific activity of the dose.</description>
        <time_frame>Saliva was collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h post [14C]-AZD2014 dose in the Single Dose Period.</time_frame>
        <population>The PK analysis population consisted of all evaluable patients who were dosed with [14C]-AZD2014 in Cycle 0 and who had reportable and evaluable PK concentration data. Patients were excluded if they vomited at or before 3 hours post-dosing or had identified procedural or scientific deficiency as being likely to impact the PK data.</population>

          <description>The mean ratios of saliva AZD2014 to saliva radioactivity concentrations are presented for the timepoints of saliva collection up to 10 hours post-dose. Geometric mean ratios were not calculated after 10 hours. Radioactivity excreta data for 1 patient was not included due to technical issues with radioactivity sample collection.</description>
          <population>The PK analysis population consisted of all evaluable patients who were dosed with [14C]-AZD2014 in Cycle 0 and who had reportable and evaluable PK concentration data. Patients were excluded if they vomited at or before 3 hours post-dosing or had identified procedural or scientific deficiency as being likely to impact the PK data.</population>

        <title>Best Overall Response (BOR) Assessment</title>
        <description>Anti-tumour activity through assessment of BOR. BOR was defined for each patient as follows according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions since baseline. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions.
Stable Disease (SD): Any cases that do not qualify for either PR or progressive disease (PD).
PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. BOR for each patient was determined as the best response recorded from the day study treatment started until progression or until the last evaluable RECIST tumour assessment in the absence of progression.</description>
        <time_frame>RECIST 1.1 assessments were performed pre-dose at screening and then once every 8 weeks relative to the start of treatment in the Multiple Dose Period.</time_frame>
        <population>The efficacy analysis population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had a baseline tumour assessment.</population>

Multiple Dose Period: From Day 1 Cycle 1, patients could continue non-radiolabelled AZD2014 (AZD2014 monotherapy), which was administered as an oral tablet. Patients continued treatment as outpatients until withdrawal due to AEs, withdrawal of consent, progression of disease according to RECIST 1.1, until the patient was no longer receiving clinical benefit or the patient started any new anti-cancer therapy.</description>
