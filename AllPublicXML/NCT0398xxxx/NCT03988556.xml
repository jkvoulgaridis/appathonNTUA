    <textblock>
      The main objective of the present study is to investigate the feasibility, safety and
      tolerability of CareMin650 in patients with 1) head &amp; neck cancer at high risk of or
      suffering from oral mucositis and/or radiation dermatitis due to the administration of
      radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy, 2) breast cancer
      at high risk of or suffering from radiation dermatitis due to the administration of
      radiotherapy.

      The main objective of the present study is to investigate the feasibility, safety and
      tolerability of CareMin650 in patients with 1) head &amp; neck cancer at high risk of or
      suffering from oral mucositis and/or radiation dermatitis due to the administration of
      radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy, 2) breast cancer
      at high risk of or suffering from radiation dermatitis due to the administration of
      radiotherapy.

      This is a prospective non-comparative study. Two cohorts of patients will be included, based
      on the tumour location. Each cohort will be divided into two subgroups according to whether
      the treatment is for curative or preventive purposes.

        -  Patients with head &amp; neck cancer (cohort A), either starting radiotherapy with or
           without chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy (no lesions, prophylactic intent,
           cohort A1) or having started treatment and presenting with grade 1 to 3 lesions of oral
           mucositis and/or radiation dermatitis (curative intent, cohort A2).

        -  Patients with breast cancer requiring radiation therapy (cohort B), either starting
           radiation therapy (i.e. no lesions, prophylactic intent, cohort B1) or having started
           treatment and presenting with grade 1 to 3 lesions of radiation dermatitis (curative
           intent, cohort B2) it is planned to select a maximum number of 72 patients (36 in each
           cohort)

      Consecutive patients will be included in each of the four predefined subgroups, until the
      target number of patients in each subgroup has been reached.

      The photobiomodulation treatment will be initiated at inclusion and will be continued for the
      duration of radiotherapy (6 to 8 weeks maximum).

      The maximum total participation in the study is anticipated to be approximately ten weeks for
      each patient.

    <description>CareMin650 is a photobiomodulation device which consists of a Lightbox and a light applicator to deliver red light with wavelength of 650 nm and irradiance between 10 and 50 mW/cm² to skin or mucosa.
For curative treatment, the dose to be delivered has been set at 6J/cm2. If the lesions of patients included in a curative cohort are resolved before the end of the radiotherapy period, the treatment will be applied with a preventive aim and the dose will decrease from 6 to 3J/cm2.</description>
