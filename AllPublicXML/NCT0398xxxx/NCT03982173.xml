          7. Detection of ≥ 5 somatic mutations per megabase measured by whole exome sequencing in
             a tumor sample of the patient taken after completing last therapy, within a molecular
             screening program (this data must been known before screening period)

          8. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN (for subjects with documented/suspected Gilbert's disease,
             bilirubin ≤ 3 ×ULN), ALT or AST ≤ 2.5 ULN (for subjects with liver metastases, AST or

         11. At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, which can be measured at baseline as
             ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm)

             repeated assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
             guidelines v1.1.

         12. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male
             partner must use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception, from screening,
             and must agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the final dose of
             durvalumab and tremelimumab or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy,
             whichever is the longer time period; cessation of birth control after this point
             should be discussed with a responsible physician. Male partners of a female subject

               4. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
                  result within 3 days prior to initiation of study drugs Nonsterilized males who
                  are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a
                  male condom with spermicide for 180 days after the final dose of durvalumab and
                  tremelimumab or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy, whichever
                  is the longer time period. Female partners of a male subject must use a highly
                  effective method of contraception throughout this period. Not engaging insexual
                  activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm
                  method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.
                  Male subjects should refrain from sperm donation and female subjects should
                  refrain from oocyte donation throughout this period.

         13. Absence of any psychological, familial or geographical condition potentially hampering
             compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be
             discussed with the patient before inclusion in the trial
