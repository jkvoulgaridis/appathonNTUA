  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac CT allows the assessment of the heart and of the coronary arteries by use of ionising
      radiation. Although radiation exposure was significantly reduced in recent years, further
      decrease in radiation exposure is limited by increased image noise and deterioration in image
      quality. Recent evidence suggests that further technological refinements with artificial
      intelligence allows improved post-processing of images with reduction of image noise.

      The present study aims at assessing the potential of a deep-learning image reconstruction
      algorithm in a clinical setting. Specifically, after a standard clinical scan, patients are
      scanned with lower radiation exposure and reconstructed with the DLIR algorithm. This
      interventional scan is then compared to the standard clinical scan.

    <description>The experimental intervention is an additional CT scan with a lower dose (about 20 to 50% decrease) and a similar contrast agent administration that is reconstructed with a deep-learning image reconstruction immediately after the clinical CT scan. The additional time required is about 5 minutes.</description>

  <arm_group>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control intervention consists of the routinely performed cardiac CT datasets reconstructed with a standard iterative reconstruction algorithm (ASIR-V). Median radiation dose is about 0.5 mSv, range between about 0.2 and 1.2 mSv; median contrast agent administration about 45 mL, range between 35 and 55 mL.</description>

    <description>TrueFidelity (Deep Learning Image Reconstruction, DLIR) software by GE Healthcare.
The medical device in question is a novel reconstruction algorithm for raw CT data which is based on artificial intelligence approaches, namely deep-learning iterative reconstruction (DLIR). This DLIR algorithm will be installed on the console of the CT Revolution scanning device, which is in routine clinical use for cardiac CT scans at the Department of Nuclear Medicine at the University Hospital Zurich. Purpose of this installation is the assessment of the performance of the DLIR algorithm during a limited time span of six weeks.
The algorithm will be CE-marked at the time of installation and use (statement by GE Healthcare provided separately). Its intended use is the reconstruction of CT datasets.
Of note, the novel DLIR algorithm will not substitute any clinical routine procedures currently in use. That is, diagnosis will still be made using the standard reconstruction algorithms.</description>
