    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to gain preliminary information regarding whether breast imaging
      with or without a core needle biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) but before surgery
      can accurately predict complete pathologic response (pCR) in women with triple negative or
      HER2- positive breast cancer. pCR is defined as having no residual invasive breast cancer or
      ductal carcinoma in situ.

        Study entry is open to women 18 years of age and older regardless of race or ethnic
        background. While there will be every effort to seek out and include minority patients, the
        patient population is expected reflect those at the University of Minnesota with triple
        negative or HER2+ breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven triple negative (TN) (ER-/PR-/HER2-) or HER2 positive
             (ERany/PRany/HER2+) breast cancer for which neoadjuvant chemotherapy is planned

          -  A biopsy clip placed at the time of diagnostic biopsy

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Must be able to read and write in English due to the importance of survey
             (questionnaire) completion to meet the study's endpoint - this is justified as there
             is no individual benefit to study participation

          -  Able to provide written consent prior to any research related activities

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Stage IV breast cancer

          -  T4 breast cancer

          -  Previous ipsilateral breast cancer

          -  Any contraindication for undergoing a contrast-enhanced breast MRI and/or the breast
             biopsy between chemotherapy and surgery
