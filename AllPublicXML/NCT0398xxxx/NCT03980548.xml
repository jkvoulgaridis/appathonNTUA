  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our preliminary data suggests that pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial fission
      protein, Drp1, reduced atherosclerotic plaque volume and attenuated macrophage accumulation
      within the plaque in an ApoE-/- mouse model of wire-induced carotid arterial injury.
      Furthermore, we hypothesize that modulation of mitochondrial morphology and metabolism with
      Drp1 inhibition prevents atherosclerosis by reducing monocyte activation and migration. In
      this research proposal, our overall objective will be to investigate the role of Drp1 in
      human monocytes and macrophages as novel therapeutic targets for preventing atherosclerosis.

      Study 1 (tissue sample study): To investigate the changes in mitochondrial function and
      pro-inflammatory markers in human arterial atherosclerotic plaques.

      Hypothesis: Macrophages from femoral artery atherosclerotic plaques in patients with
      peripheral artery disease will display upregulation of mitochondrial fission proteins and
      features of pro-inflammatory activation.

      Study 2 (white blood cell study): To investigate the changes in mitochondrial function and
      pro-inflammatory markers in white blood cells from patients with stable and unstable coronary
      artery didease (CAD).

      Hypothesis: Monocytes from patients with unstable CAD will display upregulation of Drp1 and
      features of pro-inflammatory activation, mitochondrial fission, impaired mitochondrial
      respiratory function, and perturbed metabolism, when compared to monocytes from patients with
      stable CAD.

    <description>Primary outcome analysis for aim 1:
The primary endpoint is &quot;mitochondria-shaping&quot; proteins expression quantified on immunoblotting in patients with atherosclerosis disease. The statistical analysis will be performed by 2-tailed student's T-test with the platelet &quot;mitochondria-shaping&quot; proteins expression as the response variable. The primary analyses will be by per protocol analysis and there will also be an intention to treat analysis.
