  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study. The main purpose of this
      research is to test the safety and measure the immune response of the trivalent vaccine
      against invasive Salmonella disease. The vaccine will be tested over a range of doses.
