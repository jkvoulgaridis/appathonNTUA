      Introduction: Core stability exercises and treadmill training play a crucial role in physical
      therapy interventions and have an effect on balance in children with Down syndromes (DS),
      whether core stability exercises or treadmill training has more effect on improve balance has
      not been investigated yet. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of core
      stability training versus treadmill exercises on balance in children with Down syndrome.
      Methods: Forty-five children with Down syndrome included in the study. The children aged 4-6
      years, and they were equally divided randomly into three groups (A), (B) and (C). Group A
      received traditional physical therapy intervention strategies to facilitate the balance of
      participated children. Group (B) received same as the group (A), with additional core
      stability exercises training. Group (C) received same intervention strategies as group (A) in
      conjunction with a treadmill exercise program. The children's balance was evaluated using the
      Berg Balance Scale and the Biodex Balance System. Treatment sessions were for 60 min, thrice
      a week, for eight consecutive weeks.

    <description>The Biodex Balance System (BBS) is used to adjust the stability of a suspended circular force plate. The force platform has a maximum of twenty degrees tilt in any direction when completely un-stabilized and determines the stability of participant based on the variance of the platform from the center. The Berg Balance Scale is a clinical assessment of functional balance. It consists of fourteen functional tasks of increasing difficulty, and each scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 (task is performed independently=4; unable to complete the task=0). The maximum possible score is fifty-six which indicating no identifiable balance difficulties.</description>
