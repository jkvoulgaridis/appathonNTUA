  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognostic value of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and BRAF expression in
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is not well-defined. In this study the investigators
      investigated alterations in PD-L1, BRAF and EGFR by using immunohistochemistry analysis in a
      cohort of consecutively enrolled NPC patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NPC is a common type cancer in Macau and Southern China. The role of PD-L1 in NPC remains
      controversial. There many reasons behind these inconsistent findings. We used the SP263
      antibody with the standard cut off value of 1% and 5%, which is frequently used for lung
      cancer and other cancer types. We also plan to include over 150 patients, which will be the
      largest study in NPC. This will help us to gain insights in NPC.
