  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For chronic hemodialysis patients, the creation of a well-functioning arteriovenous (AV)
      fistula is critical for ensuring that patient receive adequate hemodialysis. Unfortunately,
      the primary failure rate for AV fistulas after surgery is about 40%, and this percentage has
      not changed despite a number of trials of pharmaceutical agents and biologic agents. A key to
      success in the development of a useable AV fistula is an adequate arterial and venous
      diameter in the access forearm. Although exercise is commonly used to increase vessel
      diameter after AV fistula placement, Investigators are unaware of published studies that
      report on the effect of exercise prior to AV fistula placement to assist with the maturation
      of a newly created AV fistula. In this pilot trial, the Principal Investigator will evaluate
      the feasibility and possible benefits of pre-surgical exercise on forearm AV fistulas.

  <detailed_description>

      The trial is designed to determine if a pre-surgical exercise program will improve the
      likelihood of a useable forearm AV fistula. In this pilot study, the feasibility of the
      proposed intervention will be assessed in terms of both patient acceptability and patient
      outcomes. In addition, results from this feasibility study will be used to help determine
      power calculations for a full-scale trial.

      Patients will be eligible for this pilot clinical trial if scheduled for placement of an
      elective forearm AV fistula for chronic hemodialysis access. Patients will be randomized
      using a random number generator to either the intervention or the control group. The
      intervention group will be instructed in the use of hand grip with built in digital counter.
      These instructions will include the use of the hand grip on a daily basis with an increasing
      number of hand grip squeezes to be performed each week up until the time of fistula
      placement.

      Patients in the control group will not receive any pre-surgical instructions for exercise in
      the access arm. In both groups, patients will be provided with post-surgical instructions on
      the use of a squeeze ball on a daily basis once the steri-strips from the surgical site have
      fallen off.
