      This is a retrospective follow-up observational study of participants with CD with and
      without PAF from January 2002 to March 2017. The study will verify the potential of using
      procedure codes to reliably identify participants with PAF in Validation Study (Objective 1),
      compare Crohn's participants with PAF (cases) to matched participants without PAF (controls)
      to determine the disease burden and healthcare resource utilization of Crohn's related PAF in
      Ontario, and will describe the participant's journey among Crohn's participants following the
      first diagnosis of PAF (Objective 3).

      The study will enroll approximately 600 participants (300 participants with PAF and 300
      participants without PAF). All participants will be enrolled in 2 observation groups:

        -  CD Participants with PAF

        -  CD Participants without PAF

      The data will be collected through Ontario health administrative data. Participants will be
      observed retrospectively who were diagnosed with CD with and without fistula between April
      2002 and July 2013. Participants will be followed up retrospectively from the index period
      (that is onset of PAF) to the end of study (Objective 2), and for 5 years following the index
      date (Objective 3). The overall time for data collection in this study will be approximately
      7 months.
