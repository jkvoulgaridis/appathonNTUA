  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a window of opportunity translational study investigating the use of pre-operative
      pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in non-metastatic colorectal cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with radiologically-assessed locally advanced non-metastatic colorectal cancer will
      receive the following treatment before surgery:

      Colon cancers:

      One cycle of CAPEOX chemotherapy Two cycles of Pembrolizumab on Day 1 (concurrent with CAPEOX
      chemotherapy) and Day 22

      Rectal cancers:

      Following completion of chemo-radiotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/ capecitabine, patients
      will receive 2 cycles of Pembrolizumab given 3 weeks apart

      Pre-operative biopsy and surgical samples as well as blood will be collected for
      translational studies.
