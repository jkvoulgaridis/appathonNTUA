      Background:

      Bacteria that live inside the stomach and intestines are important for health. Chronic
      granulomatous disease (CGD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can make people have
      unhealthy bacteria. This can lead to gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Researchers want to see
      if people with CGD and IBD feel better when they change the bacteria in the stomach by
      following a special liquid diet.

      Objective:

      To see if an elemental diet can change the bacteria in the stomach and intestines of people
      with CGD and IBD. Also, to see if this helps GI symptoms.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 8-40 years with CGD, CGD-associated colitis, and IBD.

      Design:

      Participants will first be screened with:

      Upper GI endoscopy and/or colonoscopy. A long, thin tube with a tiny camera at the end will
      be passed into the participant s body through the mouth or anus. Tissue will be collected.
      Participants will be sedated for the procedure. They will be sedated using a special mask or
      small plastic tube placed in an arm vein using a needle.

      Participants will be put on the special diet for up to 4 weeks. They will stay in the
      hospital for the first 1-2 weeks. They will have check-ups. They will have blood, urine, and
      stool samples collected. They will keep a symptom diary to record how they feel and any GI
      symptoms.

      Participants will have 2 follow-up visits. The first will be right after they finish the
      diet. The second will be 4 weeks later. They will have blood, urine, and stool samples
      collected. They will learn about re-introducing other foods into their diet.

    <textblock>
      Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare genetic immune disorder that results in
      recurrent and severe infections, and inflammatory dysregulation. For almost 50% of patients
      with CGD, this inflammation causes severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However,
      treatment is long term and challenging as CGD-IBD is prone to relapse, and use of immune
      modulators must be balanced with increased risk of infectious complications. Conventional IBD
      (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) is likely caused by an inappropriate inflammatory
      response to intestinal microbes, which is influenced by the environment in a genetically
      susceptible host. While it is not yet clear if intestinal dysbiosis is a result or cause of
      intestinal inflammation, studies suggest that correcting intestinal dysbiosis may improve
      intestinal inflammation. Studies in patients with conventional IBD suggest that strict
      dietary restrictions can resolve symptoms of IBD and induce remission as effectively as
      glucocorticoids but without the side effects of those drugs. Because these diets alter the
      gut microbiome, they may serve as effective treatment for CGD-IBD.

      In this study, we propose to treat 5 patients &gt;= 8 years old who have CGD and IBD with 4
      weeks of an elemental diet. Participants will stay as inpatients for up to 2 weeks and will
      return for follow-up at the end of the diet to begin tapering off and be reintroduced to
      normal food. The primary objective of this study is the evaluation of changes in the
      microbiome before and after the elemental diet. Secondary objectives are evaluations of
      tolerability and safety of the diet, along with changes in local and systemic markers of
      inflammation, and improvement of IBD symptoms as determined by reduction in Harvey-Bradshaw
      Index score.
