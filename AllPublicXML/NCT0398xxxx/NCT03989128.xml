  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the problems that cancer patients face when filling prescriptions for
      opioids (medications that are used to manage pain). Pain is one of the most common symptoms
      among cancer patients. Opioid therapy is generally the treatment of choice for adequate
      management of cancer-related pain. Knowledge of these problems may help health care providers
      assess the most effective treatment options for cancer patients, and inform policy makers of
      the adjustments that need to be made to regulations to ensure cancer patients don't lose
      their access to opioids.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate patients' perceptions of overall difficulties when filling their opioid
      prescription.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine cancer patients' perceptions of financial, logistical, and psychosocial
      difficulties when filling their opioid prescription.

      II. To evaluate the association between patient characteristics and patient difficulty
      filling opioid prescriptions.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete a survey over 5-10 minutes.

    <description>The proportion of patients who have experienced any difficulty when filling their prescription will be reported along 95% confidence intervals. Association of patients' characteristics with experiencing difficulty will be evaluated by Wilcoxon rank sum test and chi-square (Fisher's exact) test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively.</description>

        Cancer patients on opioids for pain management provided by the Supportive Care Center

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be on opioids provided by the Supportive Care Center (SCC), and must
             have visited the SCC 2 previous times for the purpose of opioid pain management. This
             will ensure that 1) patients will have been told that they are being prescribed an
             opioid as a treatment for pain, and 2) patients will have gone to a pharmacy to fill
             their opioid prescription a minimum of one time.

          -  Patients must be able to understand, read, write, and speak English.

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent document.

          -  Patients must have a cancer diagnosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have clinical evidence of cognitive impairment (Memorial Delirium
             Assessment Scale [MDAS] score of &gt;= 13) as determined by the research staff, treating
             physician, or nurse.

          -  Patients who are considered to be in severe physical or emotional distress based on
             the assessment by the research staff.

          -  Patients who refuse to participate in the study.
