  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to build a clinical data research infrastructure that will begin
      to enhance capacity to use electronic health record (EHR) data and patient reported outcomes
      measures (PROs) to conduct opioid related research in emergency departments (EDs). 200 adult
      patients with a history of non-medical opioid use, opioid use disorder, or acute opioid
      overdose will be enrolled and will be asked to complete three PRO surveys (baseline, 3 days
      post ED discharge, and 30 days post discharge).
