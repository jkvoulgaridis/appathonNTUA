    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive and
      irreversible degeneration of nerve cells. The loss of these cells leads to the continuous
      decline in muscle function with alterations in biochemical and haematological parameters. The
      objective of this study was to examine the effects of exercise training on physical function
      and biochemical markers in elderly Alzheimer's disease patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinetti test</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 10-15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The 3-likert test assesses balance and gait abilities with an individual sitting in an armless chair, rising up, staying standing, turning 360° and then sitting back down. Gait is scored over 12 and balance is scored over 16, totalling 28 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The 14-item 5-likert (from 0 to 4) scale objectively determines a patient's balance ability during a series of predetermined tasks. Scores of each item are summed up: the total score ranges from 0 to 56. The lowest the score the lowest is the level of function, the highest the score the highest is the level of function.</description>
