  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because the optic nerve is surrounded by the cerebrospinal fluid, increase / decrease in the
      intracranial pressure can be examined by an increase / decrease in the optic nerve sheath
      diameter (ONSD). Non-invasive trans-orbital ultrasonography has been used to measure the ONSD
      and shown to be useful in differentiating patients with increased intracranial pressure (&gt; 20
      cmH2O).

      Arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) is closely related to cerebral blood flow.
      According to the textbook, an increase in PaCO2 in the range of PaCO2 = 25 mmHg to PaCO2 = 75
      mmHg can cause a change in intracranial pressure by proportionally increasing cerebral blood
      flow. Because end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (ETCO2) reflects PaCO2, a significant
      correlation may be expected between the ETCO2 and the ONSD.

      Previous studies in adult patients showed that ONSD was sensitively increased / decreased
      according to short-term hypercapnia (ETCO2 = 50mmHg) or hypocapnia (ETCO2 = 30mmHg) for 10
      minutes and normalized at normal ETCO2 (40mmHg). Therefore, the reactivity of the ONSD
      according to the change of the ETCO2 was confirmed in adult patients.

      In normal pediatric patients, ONSD is expected to respond to changes in ETCO2. However, no
      previous study has confirmed this. In addition, the reactivity of ONSD was not studied in
      neonates and infants with open fontanelle.

      In this study, the investigators will performed trans-orbital ultrasonography in pediatric
      patients with normal intracranial intracranial pressure aged 18 years or younger scheduled
      for surgery under general anesthesia. The ONSD will be measured at three ETCO2 levels;
      35mmHg, 40mmHg, and 45mmHg.

      Induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation will be performed with standard
      electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and ETCO2
      monitoring.

      The ONSD will be measured at three different ETCO2 levels (35mmHg, 40mmHg, and 45mmHg). Each
      ETCO2 levels will be maintained within +-2mmHg for 10 minutes.

      A high frequency linear probe will be used to get the images of optic nerve sheath and the
      diameter (ONSD) will be measured at 3 mm from the papillary segment in the transverse plane.
      Mean arterial pressure and heart rate will be recorded during ONSD measurements. The open or
      closure of Fontanelle will be examined after ONSD measurements.

      The ONSD and Eyeball size measurements will be performed by two independent researchers who
      do not participate in ultrasound examination using stored images.
