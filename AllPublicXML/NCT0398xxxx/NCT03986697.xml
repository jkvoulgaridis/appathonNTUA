  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is thought to promote coronary artery disease via a
      number of mechanisms: abnormal lipid profiles, endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, insulin
      resistance and renal impairment are the main pathological mechanisms driving atherosclerosis
      as a consequence of cART. An association between protease inhibitors and increased
      cardiovascular disease risk has been shown in many large cohort trials.

      CT Coronary Angiography (CTCA) is now widely used to assess for the presence of
      atherosclerosis, typically in patients presenting with chest pain. This imaging technique
      allows visualisation of the coronary arteries and quantification of any atherosclerotic
      disease that may be present. This technique is being increasingly used as a surrogate for
      cardiovascular disease risk.

      HART CT is an open label, prospective, randomised-control pilot study to investigate the
      feasibility of performing a future appropriately powered multi-centred randomised control
      trial using CT based outcome data as a surrogate for cardiovascular disease risk.

      Participants will be randomised to either continue their usual cART or switch to Biktarvy (a
      fixed dose combination of bictegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide). A baseline
      CT scan will be performed. If there is any evidence of atherosclerosis a further CT scan will
      be performed at the end of the study (approximately 48 weeks). This will allow quantification
      of any change in coronary artery plaque burden or characteristic. Participants will be also
      followed up for any changes in metabolic health.

    <description>Agatston calcium scoring is a highly reproducible well validated scale outlining the burden of calcific coronary artery disease. Agatston score is a function of calcium volume and density. The volume is calculated in mm3 and multiplied by a density weighting factor depending on the haunsfied units.

    <description>Coronary segments are graded as normal (no stenosis), stenosis 1%-29%, 30%-49%, 50%-69%, â‰¥70% by visual semiquantification method, with assignment of scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. Stenosis is not measured when the vessel diameter was &lt;2 mm. Total segment stenosis score (TSS) per person is calculated by summing all the 15 individual SSSs with a possible score ranging from 0 to 60.
Change in segmental stenosis scores will be assessed using summary statistics and parametric or non-parametric measures of significance.</description>
