      This study evaluates the effects of self-learning exercise from multimedia content on pain
      and disability in patients with low back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For see the full effect of exercise treatment, exercise adherence should be high. In patients
      with chronic non-specific low back pain, the complex nature of the core-stabilization
      exercises decrease the exercise adherence. Some novel studies show that multimedia learning
      can increase efficiancy of complex skill learning and can be better from classic face to face
      learning.

      So this study evaluates the effects of self-learning exercise from multimedia content on pain
      and disability in patients with low back pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Pain Level at Eight Week and Third Month</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, eighth week and third month</time_frame>
    <description>Full Scale Name: Visual Analog Scale
Pain change will be measured throughout Study and Follow-up with Visual Analog Scale. This scale is a 100 millimeter line drawn horizontally on an A4 sheet of paper. The left end of the line shows &quot;no pain at all&quot;, the right end shows &quot;my pain is as bad as it could be&quot;, while the remaining part shows the intermediate values. So minimum score was 0, and maximum score was 100. The patient is asked to mark the severity of the pain on the chart. Validity and reliability were made. The minimal clinical significance difference in chronic low back pain was 20 millimeters.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Disability Score Level at Eight Week and Third Month</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, eighth week and third month</time_frame>
    <description>Full Scale Name: Turkish version of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (2.0)
The last reliable and validate Turkish Version of Oswestry Disability Index will be used. This version contains 10 multiple-choice questions that question how low back pain affects a person in his or her daily life. Each question has 6 options. As the disability increases, the score of each problem increases. In the worst case you can get 50 points. The last point is the patient's score 100.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Exercise Adherence Level between Eight Week and Third Month</measure>
    <time_frame>At eighth week and third month</time_frame>
    <description>The Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS), which evaluates exercise compliance, will be administered 2 times to determine change at eight weeks and third month. This scale consists of 3 parts: A, B, C.
Section A, consists of 6 items not included in the scale scoring.
Section B consists 6 items, and every item have five point likert scale and describes how to do the recommended home exercise. Minimum point for this section 0, and maximum point is 24. The higher score shown exercise adherece is high.
Section C is the section that evaluates the reason for the absence of compliance with the recommended home exercise and contains 10 items, every item have five point likert scale. Sections are calculated to result in a possible score between 0 and 40. The higher score shown exercise adherece is high.</description>
