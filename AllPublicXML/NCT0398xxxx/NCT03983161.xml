    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, single oral dose study to assess
      the PK of fedratinib in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, and in matched
      subjects with normal hepatic function.

      Degrees of hepatic impairment will be determined during screening by the subject's score
      according to Pugh's Modification of Child's Classification of Severity of Liver Disease.

             documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or postmenopausal (defined
             as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening, with a follicle-stimulating
             hormone [FSH] level in the post-menopausal range according to the laboratory used at
             Screening); FSH to be performed at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation
             with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor.

          6. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) must:

               1. Have a negative pregnancy test as verified by the Investigator at Screening and

                  testing during the course of the study, as applicable, and after the end of study
                  treatment. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence from
                  heterosexual contact.

               2. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to

             a pregnant female or FCBP while receiving study treatment, and for at least 30 days
             after the last dose of IP, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

          8. Subject has clinical laboratory safety test results that are within normal limits or
             acceptable to the Investigator.

          9. Subject is afebrile (febrile is defined as ≥ 38°C or 100.3°F), with supine systolic
             blood pressure (BP) ≥ 90 and ≤ 160 mm Hg, supine diastolic BP ≥ 50 and ≤ 100 mm Hg,
             and pulse rate ≥ 40 and ≤ 100 beats per minute at Screening.

             Inclusion Criteria for Subjects with Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment (Groups 1
             and 3)

             Each subject with moderate or severe hepatic impairment must also meet all the
             criteria listed below for entry:

         10. Subject has moderate or severe hepatic impairment or cirrhosis due to chronic hepatic
             disease and/or prior alcohol use.

         11. Subject has moderate (Group 1) or severe (Group 3) hepatic impairment as defined by
             Child-Pugh Score.

               -  Group 1 subjects (moderate hepatic impairment) are required to have documented
                  confirmation of the diagnosis of cirrhosis made by biopsy, laparoscopy, or
                  imaging study with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9 at Screening.

               -  Group 3 subjects (severe hepatic impairment) are required to have documented
                  confirmation of the diagnosis of cirrhosis made by biopsy, laparoscopy, or
                  imaging study with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13 at Screening.

             If biopsy or laparoscopy is not performed prior to Screening, subjects can be included
             only if they have chronic liver disease and objective evidence of portal hypertension
             (ascites diagnosis by imaging or varices), or current medication for consequences of
             portal hypertension.

             Subjects should be enrolled into the group corresponding to the Child-Pugh
             classification score that most accurately reflects the most severe hepatic disease
             classification within the past 6 months (based on past medical history or physical
             examination observation).

             *Note: If a Child-Pugh score was previously calculated and documented in the last 6
             months, and it is more severe than the one calculated at Screening, then that previous
             value will be used for study entry purposes. If the Screening Child-Pugh score is more
             severe, then it will be used. If no score was calculated in the 6 months prior to
             Screening, then the score obtained at Screening will be used. Adequate documentation
             should be provided to substantiate the Child-Pugh score assigned to each subject.

         12. Subject must be medically stable for at least 1 month before Screening with clinically
             acceptable medical history, PE, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and 12-lead
             ECGs consistent with the underlying stable hepatic impairment condition, as judged by
             the Investigator.

         13. Subject must be stable on a concomitant medication regimen (defined as not starting a
             new medication[s] or a change in the dosage or frequency of the concomitant
             medication[s] within 7 days or 5 half-lives [whichever is longer] before dosing with
             fedratinib).

         14. Subject may be treated with diuretics for ascites. Subjects with severe ascites at
             time of enrollment may be included at the discretion of the Investigator.

         15. Subject may have a history of encephalopathy; however, they must be on stable
             treatment for at least 1 month prior to Screening, and must not have had an acute
             encephalopathic episode in the 1 month prior to Screening.

         16. Subjects must not have history of hepatorenal syndrome or hemolysis.

         17. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG at Screening (QTcF ≤ 480
             msec).

         18. Subject must have estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min at Screening as
             calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula.

             Inclusion Criteria for a Matched Healthy Subjects (Groups 2 and 4) Each matched
             healthy subject must meet all the criteria listed below for entry:

         21. Subject must match a subject in Groups 1 or 3, as needed, with respect to sex, age (±
             10 years), and weight (± 13.6 kg [30 pounds]).

         22. Subject is in good health as determined by past medical history, PE, vital signs, ECG,
             and clinical laboratory safety tests. Clinical laboratory safety tests (ie,
             hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) and 12-lead ECGs must be within normal limits
             or clinically acceptable as judged by the Investigator.

          4. Subject has any significant and relevant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or
             psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study at
             the Investigator's discretion.

          5. Subject has any condition that places the subject at an unacceptable risk if he or she
             were to participate in the study.

          6. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) within 2 years before dose administration, or
             positive drug screening test reflecting consumption of illicit drugs.

             a. If positive drug screen in a subject with hepatic impairment is due to prescription
             drug use, the specific drug and dosing regimen of the prescription drug must be
             reviewed with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor to ensure lack of interference with the PK
             assessments of this study, according to the protocol. The decision and its rationale
             will be documented in the Trial Master File.

         13. Subject has a history of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) within 1 year before dose administration, or a

             study, including a subject who is unable to communicate or to cooperate with the
             Investigator or the clinical staff.

         19. Subject has a hypersensitivity to ondansetron. 4.3.1. Exclusion Criteria for Subjects
             with Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment (Groups 1 and 3) The presence of any of the
             following will exclude a hepatically-impaired subject from enrollment:

         20. Subject has any serious medical condition (excluding hepatic impairment and related
             complications), clinically significant laboratory abnormality not related to hepatic
             impairment and related complications, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the

             or 4 encephalopathy who are treated with concomitant medications to control
             encephalopathy will receive pre-treatment score for the Child-Pugh classification.

         22. Subject has a history of incipient/planned liver transplantation within 6 months of
             Screening or has received a liver transplant.

             Exclusion Criteria for a Matched Healthy Subject (Groups 2 and 4) Each matched healthy
             subject will be excluded from entry if any of the criteria listed below are met:

         23. Subject has any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, is considered to prevent the subject from safely completing the
             study.

         24. Subject has any unstable clinically significant illness within 3 months prior to the
             study.

         25. Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric
             illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

         26. Subject has used any prescribed systemic or topical medication (including but not
             limited to analgesics, anesthetics, etc) within 30 days or 5 drug half-lives

             days prior to (but at least 5 half-lives prior to) fedratinib dosing may be admitted
             into the study if such usage is not expected by the Investigator to have persistent PK
             effects at the time of fedratinib dosing. Such effects may include, but are not
             limited to, cytochrome induction or covalent cytochrome inhibition. These cases must
             be approved by Sponsor's Medical Monitor. The decision and its rationale will be
             documented in the Trial Master File.

         27. Subject has used any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including
             vitamin/mineral supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days or 5 drug half-lives

             a. A subject who has used (or will have used) a nonprescribed medication less than 14
             days prior to (but at least 5 half-lives prior to) fedratinib dosing may be admitted
             into the study if such usage is not expected by the Investigator to have persistent PK
             effects at the time of fedratinib dosing. Such effects may include, but are not
             limited to, cytochrome induction or covalent cytochrome inhibition. These cases must
