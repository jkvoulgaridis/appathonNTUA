      The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, safety and tolerability,
      predictors of success of EUS-B-FNA in the diagnosis of malignant parenchymal lung lesions.

      The Investigators will also evaluated the adequacy of samples obtained for molecular analysis
      in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women worldwide.
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) represents about 80-90% of all lung cancers. Endoscopic
      ultrasound with bronchoscope fine needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA) is a safe and accurate
      technique that has been mostly described for the diagnosis and the mediastinal nodal staging
      of NSCLC, as a complementary technique to endobronchial ultrasound trans-bronchial needle
      aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) or when EBUS-TBNA may be difficult and/or contraindicated for clinical
      reasons (e.g. excessive cough, respiratory failure etc).

      Few retrospective studies evaluated the sensitivity and the safety of this technique in the
      diagnosis of parenchymal pulmonary lesions suspected for lung cancer, in contact or adjacent
      to the esophagus. Few data are available on the adequacy of the samples obtained by EUS-B-FNA
      for molecular analysis in NSCLC. The main predictors of success are still unclear.

      The primary aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-B-FNA
      in the diagnosis of malignant parenchymal lung lesions. The Investigators will also evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of the technique, the main predictors of success and the adequacy
      of samples obtained for molecular analysis in patients with NSCLC

    <description>Proportional number (percentage) of samples obtained with EUS-B-FNA containing sufficient material (i.e. malignant cells) for molecular analysis in NSCLC following assessment by a pathologist/molecular biologist.

    <measure>Detection of predictors of successful aspirate based on the implementation of regression models</measure>
    <time_frame>At study completion (expected February 2021)</time_frame>
    <description>Implementation of regression models (logistic regression analysis) to detect variables related to a successful aspirate: anatomical (i.e. lung, lobe of the lesion), endoscopic (type of endoscope, type of needle, number of needle passes, needle aspiration technique), pathological (presence/absence of rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), health personnel performing ROSE (i.e pathologist, respiratory physician, cytotechnician), pathological technique used for diagnosis and molecular analysis (smear, cell-block, liquid based cytology). A specific unit of measure is not included, being the computation of the present variables based on the measurement of absolute numbers not recorded with a specific unit of measure. The unit of measure is basically identified by the single element of the variable.</description>
