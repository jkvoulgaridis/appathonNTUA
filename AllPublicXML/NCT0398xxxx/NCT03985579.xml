  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research is to asses the efficacy of kinesiology taping application in breast
      engorgement in early postpartum stage.

      Kinesiology application will be performed by women's health physiotherapist. Patient's
      perceived improvement and milk outflow following application will be assessed.
