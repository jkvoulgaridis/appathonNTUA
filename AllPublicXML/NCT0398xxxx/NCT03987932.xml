  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth sedentary reduction program over a
      6-month period of time in adults with past or present knee symptoms, injuries, or surgeries.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary behavior, in excess, is associated with numerous health consequences including poor
      physical function. Older adults with symptomatic knee pain spend the majority of their waking
      hours engaging in sedentary behaviors. To reduce the risk of disability, improve quality of
      life, and prevent deterioration in physical function, it is imperative the investigators
      develop ways to reduce sedentary time. Smartphone ownership among older adults is increasing
      and may provide a scalable opportunity to disseminate a sedentary reduction intervention.
      Therefore, this study aims to evaluate and compare changes in sedentary behavior and physical
      function between an mHealth sedentary reduction, mHealth intervention plus coaching, and
      delayed mHealth group. Sedentary behavior and physical function will be assessed at baseline,
      1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after randomization.

    <description>Participants randomized to NEAT!2 will have their NEAT!2 app turned on after randomization. When 30 minutes of continuous non-movement or sedentary time is detected, the NEAT!2 app will provide a vibration or audio notification as well as display a reminder on the phone's lock/home screen. Participants will be asked to use the app for the 3 months of the intervention. Participants will be given an initial goal to reduce total sedentary time by 30 minutes/day, ultimately progressing to a 90 minute/day reduction by 3 months. After the 3-month assessment, participants randomized to NEAT!2 will have the option to continue using the app until 6 months.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will have their NEAT!2 app turned on after randomization. In addition, to receiving the identical app and given the same goals as participants randomized to NEAT!2, NEAT!2+Calls participants will receive 10-15 minute bi-weekly coaching calls. After the 3-month assessment, participants will have the option to continue using the app until 6 months. During this time, participants will not receive any coaching calls.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to Delayed NEAT!2 will not receive any contact or app between baseline and 3 months. However, after completing the 3-month assessment, participants will receive the NEAT!2 application. Participants will then have the option to use the app between 3 and 6 months.</description>
