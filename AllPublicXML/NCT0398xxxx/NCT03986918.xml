    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate patient outcomes in regards to safety and
      effectiveness based on the clinical performance of the reference devices to further support
      the assessment of residual risk identified in the Clinical Evaluation Report for the Ortho
      Development Hip System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term surveillance of survivorship and complications can help to identify pre-surgical
      comorbidities, perhaps leading to a lower risk of implant failure and subsequent revision
      surgery. By understanding the role of comorbidities in the specific population, it is
      possible to increase patient outcomes and satisfaction, while reducing the costs associated
      with complications and revision surgeries.

      This study consists of prospective collection and analysis of data for a consecutive series
      of patients that underwent total hip arthroplasty with the Ortho Development Ovation® Hip
      System at the study site between 2012 and December 2015. It is estimated that over 400
      patients received the subject system. Each of these patients will receive a survey within the
      mail when they approach, or have exceeded, their five-year post-surgical time period.
