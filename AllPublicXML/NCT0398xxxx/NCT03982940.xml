    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate, in a controlled setting, the
      safety and performance of the BeGraft+ balloon expandable covered stent Graft System (Bentley
      Innomed, Hechingen, Germany) implanted as bridging stent in BEVAR (branched endovascular
      aortic repair) for complex aortic aneurysms
