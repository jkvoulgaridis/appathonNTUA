    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-period 10-week treatment within-subject
      crossover study of neflamapimod in early-stage Huntington disease (HD). The primary objective
      is to determine whether neflamapimod can reverse hippocampal dysfunction in patients with
      early-stage HD, as assessed by the virtual water-maze-test for evaluating spatial learning
      and selected tests on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women age 30 to 70 years, inclusive.

          2. Willing and able to provide informed consent.

          3. Must have genetically confirmed HD and identified cognitive deficits:

               1. Stage 1, as defined by Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total
                  Functional Capacity (TFC) score &gt;10, and,

               2. CANTAB Paired Associate Learning Total Adjusted Error Score of &gt;16.

          4. Normal or corrected eye sight and auditory abilities, sufficient to perform all
             aspects of the cognitive and functional assessments.

          5. No history of learning difficulties that may interfere with the subject's ability to
             complete the cognitive tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A profile of impairment that is not consistent with HD.

          2. Diagnosis of any other ongoing central nervous system condition other than HD,
             including, but not limited to, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and
             Parkinson's disease.

          3. Suicidality, defined as active suicidal thoughts within 6 months before Screening or
             at Baseline, defined as answering yes to items 4 or 5 on the Columbia-Suicide Severity
             Rating Scale (C-SSRS), or history of suicide attempt in previous 2 years, or, in the
             Investigator's opinion, at serious risk of suicide.

          4. Ongoing major and active psychiatric disorder, moderate to severe depressive symptoms,

             study.

             unable to adhere to contraception requirements specified in the protocol (see Section
             5.8).

         14. Female subjects who have not reached menopause or have not had a hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy and are not willing or unable to adhere
