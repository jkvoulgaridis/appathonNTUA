    <description>The Short Form 36-Item Survey version 1.0 (SF-36) is used for patient-reported health and consists of 36 questions. The weighted sums of scores in each of eight defined domains (relating to experience of different aspects of general health, symptoms and functions) are compiled into different scales according to a standardized algorithm. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability, i.e. a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. We use the public domain version, called the the RAND-36 Item Health Survey.</description>

    <description>The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) is used. It has been developed to assess patient satisfaction with diabetes treatment. The questionnaire is composed of two different factors. The ﬁrst factor assesses treatment satisfaction and consists of six questions and the second factor consists of two questions, which assess the burden from hyper- and hypoglycemia. Treatment satisfaction is assessed as the sum of the scores of the six questions on the ﬁrst factor (total score 36), with a higher score indicating higher treatment satisfaction.</description>
