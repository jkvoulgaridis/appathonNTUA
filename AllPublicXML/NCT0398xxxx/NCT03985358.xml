  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioid abuse has been increasing dramatically in recent years. There is growing
      concern regarding the unprecedented increase in morbidity and mortality related to the use of
      opioids.1-2 In 2010 the rates of opioid sales, deaths, as well as associated treatment
      admissions have increased to more than triple the rates in 1999.1-2 Although policy makers
      and the media often associate the opioid crisis as a problem of nonmedical opioid abuse,
      evidence has suggested that opioid addiction occurs in both medical and nonmedical users.2
      The Centers for Disease control and Prevention reported and warned that long-term opioid use
      often starts with treatment of some type of acute pain.3 Prescription opioids have been shown
      to be favorable in perioperative pain management, however, their effectiveness in chronic
      pain management is not as clear. Surgeons are among the highest opioid prescribers. Many
      common elective as well as trauma-related procedures have been reported as possible causes of
      increased prolonged opioid usage. Recent evidence also suggested that a considerable number
      of patients who were prescribed opioids struggle to with transitioning to non-opioid pain
      medications.1-6 Numerous methods have been considered and explored in effort of decreasing
      the misuse and abuse of prescription opioids. One of the methods being opioid counseling, in
      which patients are educated on the effects and risks of short-term and long-term opioid usage
      and physicians recommend and discuss the appropriate opioid usage as well as alternative
      nonopioid options. It has also been indicated that counseling is more effective if given
      earlier on in the patient's surgical care rather than through rushed education overview at
      discharge.1,4-6 Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of
      perioperative opioid counseling within a specific group of patient population who are
      undergoing bilateral reduction mammoplasty.
