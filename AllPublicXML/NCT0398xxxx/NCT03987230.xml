      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is between the ages of 18 to 60 and has the full legal capacity to volunteer;

          2. Has read and signed an informed consent letter;

          3. Agrees to refrain from the use of ocular lubricants during the study period;

          4. Agrees to not to use eye-related cosmetics for upcoming study visits

          5. Is willing to use the study products

          6. Is willing and able to follow instructions regarding study procedures and maintain the
             appointment schedule;

          7. Has corneal sensitivity within physiological limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;

          2. Is a contact lens wearer (due to reduced corneal sensitivity);

          3. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection; including moderate and severe
             dry eye (OSDI ≥ 23);

          4. Has a systemic (such as diabetes, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis) or ocular
             condition (such as glaucoma) that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a
             study outcome variable;

          5. Is using any systemic or topical medications (such as glaucoma drops, antibiotics,
             anti-inflammatory) that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study outcome
             variable;

          6. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study (such
             as fluorescein dye to highlight structures of the eye and used regularly in optometric
             practice) and study products in this study;

          7. Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment; (due to the
             possibility of fluctuating vision as a consequence of variation in hormone levels);8

          8. Has undergone refractive error surgery (e.g. LASIK, PRK);

          9. Is a smoker (as smoking reduces tear film stability) * For the purposes of this study,
             active ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which requires
             therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid
             abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and
             conjunctival staining and dry eye (Ocular Surface Disease Index, OSDI&lt;23/100) are not
             considered active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result
             of previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.
