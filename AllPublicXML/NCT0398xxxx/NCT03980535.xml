  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance
      spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) software works in improving the image quality of scans in both
      patients and healthy volunteers. Improving the image quality of MRI and MRSI through new
      software may lead to implementation of these techniques and better clinical care for
      patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To help develop and/or optimize new magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy
      applications and analysis software in order to provide the best MR services for the
      investigator's patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo an additional investigational MRI or MRSI sequence along with the standard
      MRI or MRSI. Healthy volunteers undergo an investigational MRI or MRSI sequence. Healthy
      volunteers may also undergo an additional standard sequence if there is one that can be
      compared to the investigational sequence. All MRI or MRSI procedures, including the standard
      MRI or MRSI, are no longer than 60 minutes.

    <description>A set of images will be collected using the new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or MR spectroscopy techniques. Whenever appropriate, another set of images using the standard of care software will also be collected and this set of images by the standard of care software will be compared to the images that are collected with the new MRI or MR spectroscopy techniques.</description>
