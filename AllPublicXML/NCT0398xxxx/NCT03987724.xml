  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims at investigating tumor blood flow response to acute exercise in human
      cancer patients. It is hypothesized and expected that acute exercise increases tumor blood
      flow, which could plausibly increase the efficacy of cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has been applied as an adjunctive therapy in the secondary prevention of
      many cancers, but very little is currently known clinically and mechanistically about the
      effects of physical activity and exercise on tumor itself. Based on recent evidence from
      pre-clinical studies, it is plausible to expect that changes in tumor blood flow and its
      heterogeneity, oxygenation, and metabolism due to exercise would increase the delivery of
      chemotherapy and other cancer drugs into the tumor increasing the efficacy of cancer
      treatment.

      Eight (8) newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma cancer patients will be recruited to investigate
      whether these pre-clinical findings can be extended to humans to serve as an evidence-based
      proof-of-concept for the possible inclusion of exercise in the treatment of cancer during
      chemotherapy. To study the effect of acute physical exercise on tumor blood flow and its
      heterogeneity, supine bicycle exercise in a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner will
      be used to exercise Hodgkin lymphoma cancer patients. These experiments are additional
      measurements to their normal treatments, and no new interventional approaches will be
      conducted in this study.

      The study consists of one fitness test assessment, and tumor blood flow measurements with PET
      at rest and during supine cycling exercise.
