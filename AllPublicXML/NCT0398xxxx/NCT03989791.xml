  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no evidence to prove the impact of post-procedural diet on post-polypectomy bleeding
      (PPB) or delayed perforation. No relevant study has been conducted and it is yet to be
      determined if absolute diet is necessary for post-polypectomy patients, and the comparison
      between normal diet and absolute diet also remains unclear. Therefore, we carried out this
      randomized controlled study to evaluate and compare tthe clinical effect of different diets
      on post-polypectomy patients.

    <description>Patients in absolute diet group were fasted from any food with intravenous infusion of 5% glucose and sodium chloride instead in the first 24 hours. Then, the patients will be given soup for the next 24 hours if there was no delayed complication or discomfort during the fasting. Finally, they will gradually transit from soup to normal diet such as porridge, noodles and rice in the third 24 hours.</description>

    <description>Patients in normal diet group were directly given normal diet such as porridge, noodles and rice as usual after polypectomy. Meanwhile, all the patients in two groups were given PPI for 3 days intravenously and restricted from vigorous exercise for 14 days.</description>
