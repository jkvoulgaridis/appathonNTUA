  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations occur in up to 50% of Asian patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) confers a significant survival benefit. This study aims to
      assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy with or without Intercalated
      combination of icotinib in patients undergoing resection of stage IIB to IIIA (N1-2)
      EGFR-mutated NSCLC.
