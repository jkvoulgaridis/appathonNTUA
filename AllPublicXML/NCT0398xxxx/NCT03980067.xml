  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a virtual reality (VR) distraction game played
      prior to procedural sedation for long bone fracture reduction will improve post-discharge
      negative behavior changes following discharge from the pediatric Emergency Department (ED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial will investigate the use of a virtual reality (VR) distraction
      game prior to IV ketamine procedural sedation for long bone fracture reduction. Prior studies
      have demonstrated that children undergoing anesthesia or procedural sedation can have
      lingering negative behavioral changes lasting several weeks after discharge home. Children
      who are anxious have higher rates of developing negative behavior changes. Opiate pain
      control and pre-operative instructional workshops have demonstrated efficacy in decreasing
      negative behavior outcomes. There is some evidence that distraction techniques, such as VR,
      can alleviate pre-procedural anxiety and pain during procedures. To our knowledge, evaluating
      the use of a non-pharmacologic, virtual reality intervention and its effects on reducing
      post-discharge negative behavior changes following discharge from the Emergency Department
      has not been evaluated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Hospitalization Behavior Questionnaire (PHBQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Post-Hospitalization Behavior Questionnaire, a parent-report tool, with 27 items in six categories, comprising general, separation, and sleep anxieties, eating disturbance, aggression towards authority, apathy/withdrawal accesses negative behavioral changes in children post-surgery, hospitalization (Kain et al., 1996, Kain et al., 1999) or after minor ED procedures (Brodzinski et al., 2013). It takes 10 minutes and is given prior to the sedation and at 1-week via text/email, phone, or mail follow up post-discharge.
Parents compare their child's behavior pre-hospitalization to post using the following: much less than before (1), less than before (2), same as before (3), more than before (4), and much more than before (5). Scores above 3 indicate greater maladaptive behavioral changes, below 3 indicate improvements and 3 indicates no change in behavior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The m-YPAS assesses study participant's anxiety at the time of induction of anesthesia. It is completed in &lt;1 minute, reliable, and its validity compares favorably to the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (Kain, Z. 1997). The Emergency Department provider completes the m-YPAS twice during the study: on patient arrival/enrollment and immediately preceding sedation after VR intervention or standard of care.
m-YPAS categories are activity, vocalizations, emotional expressivity, state of apparent arousal, and use of parent). Each item has Likert-type responses reflecting children behaviors and is rated from 1 to 4 or 1 to 6 (depending on the item), and higher numbers indicate the highest severity within that item.
Scores range from 23-100 and a score &gt;30 is defined as anxious.</description>

    <description>The virtual reality headset, device, and software, created by Stanford's Childhood Anxiety Reduction through Innovation and Technology (CHARIOT)program/Weightless Studio, LLC will be utilized in this study. Children in the VR intervention group will be allowed to select a distraction-based game to play with active VR content featuring interactive avatars and interactive experiences tailored to the pediatric population that allow players to do things such as control penguins sliding down a mountain while collecting pebbles for points, control puppies running in space to collect treats to the rhythm of music, and control an asteroid miner exploring an asteroid belt and collecting points based on color of asteroids collected. The game will last a minimum of 5 minutes in duration, provided participant tolerance. The participant may play longer if desired prior to receiving procedural sedation and the total length of activity played will be documented.</description>
