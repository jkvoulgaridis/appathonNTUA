  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rational : A lot of people in the province of Quebec suffer from Parkinson's disease and they
      are mostly vulnerable because they gradually lose their autonomy with the worsening of the
      disease. Physiotherapy was proven to be an effective treatment method for these patients.
      However, accessibility to care remains a major issue.

      Objective: This project aims to establish the clinical feasibility of a Tai chi
      rehabilitation program through tele rehabilitation to patients suffering of Parkinson's
      disease.

      Methodology : This pilot study will be conduct with a pre/post-test device. Therefore, to
      reach the objective, an evaluation will be done before the intervention and directly after
      the end of the 12 weeks program. Also, the obstacles encountered during the interventions
      will be noted in a logbook.

      Benefits: This is a priority research because its aim is to develop a care system that is
      efficient and accessible for a target population. The results of this study will confirm the
      possibility to put in place a telerehabilitation program who could reach, on a larger scale,
      more patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.
