      1. To establish whether circulating tumour DNA is detectable in the plasma of patients with
           platinum refractory/resistant Germ Cell Tumours

        2. If ctDNA is detectable, perform exploratory analyses to:

             1. Describe the molecular aberrations in plasma from metastatic GCTs with platinum
                refractory/resistant disease

             2. Describe aberrations detected in sequential detected in sequential samples form the
                same individual patient and evaluate whether there are hyposthesis-generating
                changes that temporarily associate with clinical resistance.

      This project will study the plasma of patients who have metastatic GCTs with platinum
      refractory/resistant disease in order to establish if ctDNA is detectable and then analyse
      the molecular aberrations. Archival diagnostic tissue will be recalled (this is the tissue
      used to make the initial diagnosis of testicular cancer). Excess tissue acquired from
      clinically mandated prospective biopsies will be stored and plasma which has been collected
      at a maximum of 15 time-points per year will be analysed. Clinical data will be accessed to
      make clinically meaningful associations with plasma and tissue molecular aberrations.

        Patients will have consented to the collection and storage of blood samples and archival
        tissue at the RMH bio-bank. Testicular cancer management is focused in a single
        multidisciplinary clinic (Sutton Friday AM) and is the centre for follow up of these
        patients. We propose to initially analyseclinical material from 18 patients who have
        attended this clinic. To meet our primary objective, patient samples will be selected based
        on the burden of metastatic tumour in the patient at the time of the blood sample. Samples
        will be selected from patients at the latest available time-point in their disease process
        where the disease burden was at its highest.

        The minimum sample requirement for our primary and secondary objectives is a blood sample
        taken during at least one timepoint. However if there are an excess of patients with bloods
        samples collected when metastatic disease burden is at its highest, patient samples will be
        preferentially selected if they have sequential samples.
