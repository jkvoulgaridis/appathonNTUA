  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is still no effective treatment for advanced mucosal melanoma at present. The efficacy
      of single-agent PD-1 inhibitors is less than 20%. It is urgent to explore regimens to improve
      the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in patients with advanced mucosal melanoma. This study is
      performed to explore the safety and efficacy of apatinib plus SHR-1210 in patients with
      advanced mucosa melanoma whose diseases progress after chemotherapy.

      Apatinib is an oral small molecule anti-angiogenesis inhibitors. It inhibits VEGFR-2 tyrosine
      kinase activity, thereby blocking VEGF-induced signaling and exerting a strong inhibitory
      effect on tumor angiogenesis.Apatinib has shown anti-melanoma activity in retrospective
      study. However, the efficacy is still very low. SHR-1210 is an anti-PD-1 antibody produced by
      Hengrui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Apatinib plus SHR-1210 has shown synergy in several
      malignancies. This study is conducted to explore the efficacy and safety in advanced mucosa
      melanoma
