      SLEEP-4-ALL-1 is a pilot and ecological study corresponding to the developpement phase of a
      randomized controlled multicentric trial SLEEP-4-ALL-2. The main objective of this second
      study will be the validation of a stepped-care model in the treatment of persistant insomnia
      in cancer patients.

      The primary objective of SLEEP-4-ALL-1 is to determine the acceptability of a self-screening
      for insomnia in cancer outpatients at Gustave Roussy.

    <description>To patients who have given their consent for the self-screening, the research assistant will propose 3 questionnaires, which will be completed in the waiting room and returned the same day:
Ad hoc questionnaire for demographics and medical data;
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI, 7 items, Savard et al., 2005);
Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS, 10 items, Visual Analogue Scale, Bruera et al. 1991) assessing comorbidities as pain, dyspnea, anxiety or depression...
The ISI scoring will be realized by the research assistant (in the research office) immediately after its completion.</description>
