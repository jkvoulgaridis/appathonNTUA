  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In China, birth defects can reach as high as 5.6%, about 900,000 new cases of birth defects
      are added each year, making it the second cause of death for infants, with a total death rate
      of 19.1%. At present, China implements the three-level prevention and control system for
      birth defects, which is performed before marriage, before birth, and during the neonatal
      period. Newborn screening is the last line of defense against birth defects. Early screening
      diagnosis and timely intervention are extremely important, especially for diseases which can
      be preventive and treatable. This study aims to evaluate the clinical application of
      high-throughput targeting sequencing in newborns, and investigate whether this new technology
      can significantly shorten the time of examination, improve the diagnosis rate, guide the
      intervention treatments and promote prognosis for these disease.
