    <textblock>
      This study evaluates acceptability and efficacy of multidomain intervention program to
      prevent cognitive impairment and protect brain health in Korean at-risk elderly. A third of
      participants will receive facility-based intervention for 6 months, a third will receive
      home-based intervention for 6 months, and a third is waiting list controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite extensive research in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), no treatment has yet
      been developed to modify the progression of AD. Therefore, it is important to manage vascular
      and metabolic risk factors, to eat healthy foods, to exercise, and to participate in social
      activities to prevent dementia. The FINGER study showed that the multi-domain intervention
      program is effective to prevent cognitive impairment and disability in elderly.

      In South Korea, exercise and leisure programs, and brain activity for the elderly also have
      been conducted in welfare centers and public health centers. However, there are not enough
      programs that have proven effective in the studies.

      So the investigators would like to develop a multi-domain intervention program and
      investigate applicability and efficacy before a large-scale randomized controlled trial.

    <description>A group will consist of 5 or 10 persons depending on the size of the study center. Exercise training will be guided by study exercise therapists at a gym and consist of programs for progressive muscle strength training, aerobic exercise, and exercises to improve postural balance and flexibility using elastic bands, floor plate and chairs (three times per week, 60 min per session).The cognitive training program is a program including tasks to be effective in episodic memory, executive function, attention, working memory, calculation, and visuospatial function (twice per week, 60 min per session). The nutritional intervention is conducted by study nutritionists (three individual sessions and seven group sessions). Management of metabolic and vascular risk factors will include additional meetings with the study nurse (at 0, 4, 8, 16, and 20 weeks), and the study physician (at 0 and 12 weeks). Motivational training is conducted by psychologist (four group session).</description>

    <description>The nutritional intervention, management of metabolic and vascular risk factors, social activity, and motivational training in the home-based intervention are similar to the facility-based intervention. The physical exercise programs consist of one group session (60 min) and two home-based sessions (60 min per session) per week in the first 2 months of the trial. During the remaining months of the 6-month study, participants in the home-based intervention attend a 1-h physical exercise group session per two weeks and two or three exercise sessions (60 min per session) alone at home per week. The cognitive training programs consist of one group session (60 min) and one home-based sessions (60 min per session) per week in the first 2 months of the trial. For the remainder of the 6-month study, participants in the home-based intervention attend a 1-h group cognitive training session per two weeks and one or two cognitive training sessions (60 min per session) alone at home per week.</description>
