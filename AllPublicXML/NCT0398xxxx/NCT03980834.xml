  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, hybrid implementation-effectiveness design.whose primary
      aim is to examine the impact of ParentCorps plus Thrive Professional Learning, relative to
      Thrive Professional Learning and Inspire Professional Learning alone, on teachers' classroom
      teaching (knowledge, beliefs, skills and practice related to family engagement and social
      emotional learning) and teachers' social emotional development. The study also aims to
      understand the impact of Thrive Professional Learning versus Inspire Professional Learning
      alone on teachers and classrooms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Modified (ERQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Respondents indicate their tendency toward reappraisal (six items) and suppression (four items) through a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from one (strongly disagree) to seven (strongly agree). Independent scores are computed for each ER strategy. The ERQ had high internal consistency for both the cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression subscales (Î± = .79 and .73, respectively) in a sample of undergrad students. The higher the scores the greater the use of the emotion regulation strategy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Panorama Teacher and Staff Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The survey exists as a series of scales, or sets of survey questions related to a single topic (e.g., Teaching Efficacy, Staff-Family Relationships or Educating all Students). The instrument was developed based on modern principles of survey design to substantially minimize measurement error. Some of these principles include wording items as questions, avoiding response options that may introduce acquiescence bias, avoiding double-barreled items, and using a variety of response options to capture a wider range of perceptions. This survey is currently in the process of being evaluated to accumulate evidence that the questions, scales, and instruments are reliable and valid.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mindfulness in Teaching Scale-Modified</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>used to assess the unique ways in which mindfulness may manifest in intrapersonal and interpersonal behaviors of teachers in a K-12 school setting. The original form of the self report measure is composed of two factors, &quot;intrapersonal&quot; and &quot;interpersonal&quot; mindfulness,and is a 14-item scale. The interpersonal sub scale has shown to predict teacher burnout (emotional exhaustion, de personalization) and instructional efficacy in working with students (social-emotional and behavioral management) over time. Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficients were found to be .861 for &quot;Intrapersonal Mindfulness&quot; and .711 for &quot;Interpersonal Mindfulness.&quot; Higher score indicates more positive teaching behavior.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Engagement of Families from Latino Backgrounds Questionnaire-Modified [PEFL- English]</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>a 43-item Likert-type measure. The PEFL explores four dimensions of parental engagement related to children's school readiness: foundational education, supplemental education, school participation, and future-oriented teaching. The higher the average score on that scale, the more parents have agreed with the positive statements in the survey.</description>

    <description>group-based series to prepare facilitators (mental health professionals and teachers) to implement Programs with fidelity and to ensure high levels of exposure by parents and students. Mental health professionals are supported to facilitate the Program for Parents (day and after-school versions) with fidelity. Pre-K teachers and assistants are supported to implement the Program for Students in the classroom. In addition, early childhood staff (including Kindergarten teachers as needed) is trained to facilitate the Program for Students during after-school hours in parallel with the Parenting Program. All facilitators receive training on engaging parents to participate</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participants are lead teachers, assistant teachers, teaching assistants,
             paraprofessionals and teacher aides in 238 sites with Pre-K in NYC (for the purposes
             of this study, the term &quot;teachers&quot; will be used to represent this group). The
             inclusion criteria include teachers who participate in Thrive or Inspire Professional
             Learning in 2018-2019. Additionally, 449 teachers from 81 district schools (that are
             part of the Thrive and Inspire Professional Learning) are were randomized into the
             study will participate.

          -  To be eligible for the study, sites met the following criteria: a) have 2 or more PKFA
             classrooms; b) serve a high-need population and c) leaders ranked Thrive or Inspire as
             a first or second preference for the school. &quot;High need&quot; was defined as follows: the
             site level percentage of students in poverty was above the median of the eligible
             pool; the site level percentage of students in poverty was in the second quartile of
             the eligible pool and two or more students were listed as living in temporary housing;
             and/or the site level percentage of students in poverty was in the first quartile of
             the eligible pool and 5 or more students were listed as living in temporary housing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Sites that were currently implementing ParentCorps at the time of the randomization
             were not eligible for the study. Only teachers who were part of the Thrive or Inspire
             Professional Learning tracks in 2018-2019 will be eligible.
