    <measure>Time to transfusion independence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in patient reported outcomes for the Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Levels Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to approximately 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, non-disease specific instrument used to measure health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L assesses general health on 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). The scores for the 5 dimensions are used to compute a single utility index score ranging from 0 to 1 representing the general health status of the individual, with higher scores indicating better health state.</description>
