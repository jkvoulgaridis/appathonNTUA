      This study evaluates the health condition and its evolution with time of Cannabis consumers
      in the Canadian population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, legalization of recreational use is likely to have decreased the perception of
      risks associated with Cannabis use, and means that the reported adverse effects of Cannabis
      are not so important, suggesting that Cannabis may be useful for their illness as an
      alternative or complementary therapeutic.

      More Canadian physicians prescribed Cannabis for their patients. Both Recreational and
      medical use of Cannabis increase and will continue to grow up in the next coming years.
      Regardless, the typology of Cannabis use, more information on the health condition of
      Cannabis consumers may be helpful for the medical prescription of Cannabis, in particular in
      older adults who are more at risk of side effects.

    <description>The decrease of cognitive function changes the activities of daily living to older adults. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale ( IADLs) will be used to assess independent living skills to people who are a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. A summary score range from 0 ( low function, dependent) to 8 ( high function, independent) will be given to each participant based on their daily activities.</description>

    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>around 20 years</time_frame>
    <description>It will be used the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) that rates how often over the past week people experience symptoms that are associated with depression. In scoring the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, a value of 0,1,2,3 is assigned to a response based on the emotional feelings that the participants have.</description>
