  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study a relapse prevention program for adult former
      smokers in Northeast Ohio. The study will also look at how different people respond to the
      program. Participants asked to take part in this study because they contacted the team for
      help remaining tobacco-free or otherwise expressed interest in the program. The study
      includes completing surveys and receiving text messages to help stay tobacco free.

      The main objective of this study is to conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility,
      acceptability, and initial efficacy/clinical significance of a tobacco relapse prevention
      intervention designed for low-income African Americans.

      In this study, the team will estimate effect sizes for a culturally specific (CS) relapse
      prevention intervention compared to standard relapse prevention in a sample of low-income
      African American smokers and examine predictors of time to smoking relapse.

      In a community-based clinical trial, adults who recently quit smoking (N=100) will be
      randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: (1) CS Relapse Prevention or (2)
      Standard Relapse Prevention. The primary outcome variables collected will include
      biochemically verified point prevalence abstinence (ppa) at 6-weeks and time to smoking
      relapse (TTR) over 3-months. This study will test daily hassles, cessation self-efficacy,
      coping strategies, and adherence to NRT as individual difference factors that may affect
      response to CS relapse prevention.

Based on participants' reconstruction of their smoking history, abstinence variables will be determined. For instance, if there has been no smoking in the 7 days preceding the assessment, the criterion for 7-day point prevalence abstinence (ppa) will be met.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 4 group sessions of a novel culturally specific, CBT-based intervention. They will also receive Path2Quit, a newly developed video-text program, which delivers 6 weeks of CS video messages (1-2 times/day) and provides 24/7 access to messages pulled from 3 keywords (HELP1, JONES, SLIP). Notably, CS relapse prevention will incorporate surface and deep structure elements,17 including race-matched interventionists, religion/spirituality, discussion of race-related stress, traditional values (e.g., collectivism), culturally specific recipes, etc.
All participants will receive 4 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; transdermal nicotine patches or nicotine gum).</description>

Users can text one of 3 keywords (MOOD, CRAVE, or SLIP) to receive a relevant message from the system 24/7.
