      In the experimental group, patients received Camrelizumab injection (SHR-1210) 200mg d1, CIK
      cells 1x10^10 d14; Q3W, for 4 cycles; then Camrelizumab injection maintenance treatment for 2
      years. In the control group, patients received Camrelizumab injection 200mg d1, Q3W, for 2

          5. Patients with disease progression after treatment with interferon or TKI.

          6. ECOG score will be 0 or 1 within 7 days before randomization.

          7. Within 14 days before the start of treatment, the results of laboratory test of blood
             routine, liver, kidney function and hormone levels must be met the following criteria:

             White blood cells: more than 3.0 × 109/L; Platelets: more than 100 × 109/L;

             treatment, such as the use of corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants. Substitution
             therapy (such as thyroxine, insulin, or physiological corticosteroid replacement
             therapy for adrenal or pituitary dysfunction) is not a systemic treatment.

         11. Mental illness or other illnesses, such as uncontrollable heart disease or pulmonary
             disease, diabetes, etc.

         12. Subjects who are known to be allergic to any of the constituents of the drug being
             studied.
