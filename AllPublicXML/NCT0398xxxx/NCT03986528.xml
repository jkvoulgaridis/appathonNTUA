      This study include a multicenter, randomized, controlled post-market clinical trial.The
      randomized clinical trial will enroll approximately 334 patients. Participants will be
      randomly divided into experimental (n=167) and control groups (n=167).Patients in the
      experimental group will receive Kanglaite Injection combination with first-line chemotherapy
      based on NCCN Guidelines (2019.V3). Patients in the control group will receive first-line
      chemotherapy based on NCCN Guidelines (2019.V3).The primary endpoint is PFS(progression free
      survival).The research protocol was approved by the relevant ethics committees, and the study
      was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
      Patients gave written informed consent to participate in the trial.
