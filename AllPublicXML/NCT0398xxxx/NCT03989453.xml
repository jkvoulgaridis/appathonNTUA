      This is a randomized clinical trial of single-blind with 2 arms (Control group and
      experimental group), in which a pre-treatment-postest design has been used.

      The study will define two groups:

      A control group (CG) that will not be submitted to treatment, which will be evaluated in the
      pre and post phase of the study. Participants assigned to this group will receive general
      advice on the positive effects of regular physical activity and will be given a guide to
      recommendations for promoting physical activity.

      An experimental group (GE) that after an initial evaluation will undergo a physical training
      program based on Chi Kung exercises.

      Once the intervention is finished, it will be submitted to a final evaluation to see if there
      is a difference or not with the results obtained at the beginning.

    <masking_description>The assignment to the groups will be of simple random type and hidden. Those responsible for admitting patients to the intervention phase will not know what group has been assigned each. This assignment will be made in advance by a researcher who will not intervene in the later stages of evaluation, intervention, data recording and elaboration of database. The assignment will be communicated through sealed and totally opaque envelopes.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning-at three months</time_frame>
    <description>A simple and valid assessment of both sleep quality and disturbance that might affect. They consist of 10 questions divided into four subscales: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep discomfort, medication use and daytime dysfunctions, adding up to a total score. The higher value represents a worse result.</description>
