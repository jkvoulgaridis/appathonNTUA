  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening Wizard (SW). Primary Care Providers (PCPs) are often uncertain about how to best
      refer adolescents who screen positive for depression or suicidality. Screen-positive youth
      who are either not in treatment, or express dissatisfaction with current treatment will be
      consented by an on-site research assistant (RA). Those parents and patients receiving SW will
      answer additional questions: adaptive screens developed in a previous NIMH study (MH100155)
      for suicidal risk, anxiety, and mania; perceived barriers; and preferences about treatment.
      SW generates recommendations for PCPs reflecting patient clinical needs and preferences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening Wizard will be delivered by Primary Care Providers (PCPs) at well child visits,
      beginning with screening occurring within the waiting room which will yield decision support
      guidance delivered and followed by the PCP at that same visit.

      This study will utilize a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design. This stepped wedge
      design involves the sequential random rollout of an intervention over two time periods.
      Following a baseline period in which no clusters (=practices) are exposed to the
      intervention, the crossover is typically in one direction, from control to intervention and
      continues until both of the clusters have crossed-over to receive the intervention, with
      observations taken from each cluster and at each time period.

      Hypothesis: The use of Screening Wizard will increase the rate of personalized referrals
      experts in specialty mental health would provide, compared to Treatment as usual (TAU).

    <measure>Usability &amp; Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>At exit interview after Baseline phone visit. The baseline visit occurs 24-48 hours after initial screening and the exit interview call will be made within 1 month following the completion of the baseline phone assessment.</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction to Screening Wizard will be assessed through questions developed by investigators to understand experience with the program. Questions investigators have adapted from literature reviews on satisfaction include: &quot;If a friend were in need of a mental health referral, would you recommend Screening Wizard to him/her?; How satisfied are you with the amount of help you received?; Have the services you received helped you to deal more effectively with your problems?. The response options include: No, definitely not; No, I don't think so; Yes, I think so; Yes, definitely.</description>

    <description>Satisfaction with the technical components of interventions will be assessed through the certain questions from the Post System Satisfaction and Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). The PSSUQ is 19 items with response options ranging from 1 to 7 where 1=strongly disagree and 7=strongly agree. The PSSUQ has sub-scores derived from subsets of the questions which reflect system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality. Questions from sub-domains were chosen to tailor the questioning to this particular intervention.</description>

The final completely de-identified dataset(s) will include demographic and clinical data at baseline, and primary and secondary outcomes for all studies, including those funded by the innovation contests. These analytic datasets may also include derived variables with documentation. Our form datasets will include original case report forms, a detailed codebook of variable names, value labels, and programming formats and all study documentation including the protocol and manual of procedures. For descriptive/raw data, study investigators/study staff will upload to NIMH's National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Health Illness (NDCT) on a semi-annual basis all analyzed data being uploaded prior to primary paper publication.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>These data will be released to the NDCT soon after each project's &quot;main outcomes&quot; manuscript is accepted for publication.</ipd_time_frame>
