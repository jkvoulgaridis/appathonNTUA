  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common pediatric rheumatic disease of
      childhood. Most children still experience prolonged periods of active disease, however, there
      is still lack of effective and specific markers for early diagnosis of relapse. The
      pathogenesis of JIA is thought to be the result of a combination of host genetic and
      environmental triggers and The microbiota is a potential contributing factor to the
      development of the disease. (1-3)-ß-D-Glucan (BDG), a component of most fungal cell walls,
      possess immunomodulatory activities. Latest studies demonstrate that it acts as a trigger for
      autoimmune arthritis in adult. However the relation with JIA is not clearly defined. The
      objective of this study was to evaluate the (1,3)-Béta-D-Glucans level in patients with JIA
      and whether higher serum BDG levels are correlated with JIA activity of disease,
      comparatively with usual markers.
