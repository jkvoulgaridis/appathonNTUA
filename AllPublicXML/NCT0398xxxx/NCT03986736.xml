      Major trauma is associated with a release of alarmins (DAMPs - damage-associated molecular
      patterns) from the injured tissues. This process results in the activation of the immune
      system, which is one of the main mechanisms participating in the development of organ
      dysfunctions in patients with major trauma.

      Major trauma is associated with a release of alarmins (DAMPs - damage-associated molecular
      patterns) from the injured tissues. This process results in the activation of the immune
      system, which is one of the main mechanisms participating in the development of organ
      dysfunctions in patients with major trauma. Limited literary sources describe a correlation
      between the mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) and the value of plasma creatine kinase (sCK) (which is
      released from the injured muscles), which suggests a possible correlation between the number
      of released alarmins and the degree of rhabdomyolysis (damage of striated muscles).
      Rhabdomyolysis is further - due to the direct nephrotoxicity of myoglobin (sMb) released from
      the injured muscles - a significant factor participating in the development of acute renal
      failure in patients with serious injuries. Considering the fact that the serious injury need
      not include a vast damage of the muscle mass (especially in traumas with a minimal impairment
      of extremities), the correlation between the DAMPs and sCK/sMb values need not be constant in
      relation to the extent and localization of the injury defined with the AIS (Abbreviated
      Injury Scale) and ISS (Injury Severity Scale) scales. The DAMPs released from injured tissues
      immediately after trauma include HMGB-1 (high mobility group box 1); a correlation has been
      observed between the early post-injury levels of HMGB-1 and unfavorable outcome (defined with
      development of organ dysfunctions and increased mortality). Considering the fact that the
      DAMPs examination (including HMGB-1) are routinely available, and are also rather expensive,
      they are not a standard part of examinations performed in patients with serious trauma.
      Determination of correlation between HMGB-1 and the routinely available examinations of sCK
      and sMb would make the use of sCK and sMb examinations as direct indicators of mechanical
      tissue damage. Furthermore, this data has a significant descriptive impact in case of direct
      inclusion of sCK and sMb into predictive scoring systems, which currently do not contain
      relevant physiological parameters correlating with the extent of the injury.

      In the second part of the study, the authors will concentrate upon evaluation of correlation
      of HMGB-1, serum creatine kinase and serum myoglobin in relation to the development of acute
      kidney injury (AKI), and in relation to the values of AKI markers, specifically NGAL
      (neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin). The currently used AKI criteria are based upon
      relatively imprecise and late parameters (urine output, level of serum creatinine), and that
      is why AKI is identified in the clinical practice only in the stage of advanced and
      irreversible morphological and functional changes of kidneys.

      The aims of the study are the following:

        -  To verify the correlation between the levels of circulating alarmins (HMGB-1) and the
           levels of sCK and sMb

        -  To identify the correlation between the levels of circulating alarmins and localization
           of the injury (according to AIS and ISS scoring systems)

        -  Mutual comparison of predictive levels of sCK and sMb in relation to the development of
           post-injury kidney failure

        -  Mutual comparison of predictive levels of sCK and sMb in relation to the serum and urine
           levels of AKI biomarkers

        -  Comparison of predictive levels of serum and urine NGAL in relation to the development
           of post-injury AKI
