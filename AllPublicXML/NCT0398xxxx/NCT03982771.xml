      This will be a single center, open-labeled, single arm, phase-II pilot study. The treatment
      and the response evaluation phase will last from the time of enrollment up to 21 months
      (evaluation will be carried out every 3 months in the first 9 months and every 6 months from
      Month 9 to Month 21). The maintenance and follow-up phase to assess for progression of
      disease will last from 21 months to 45 months after enrollment (evaluation will be carried
      out every 12 months). The total study duration will be 4 years after the last patient starts
      study medication.

    <description>Overall response is composed by biochemical, lymph node and symptom response, is the primary outcome of this study. According to the CDCN response criteria, an overall CR (complete response) requires a complete biochemical, lymph node, and symptomatic response; and overall PR (partial response) requires nothing less than a PR across all categories, but not meeting criteria for CR; an overall SD (stable disease) requires no PD (progression disease) in any of the categories and not meeting the criteria for CR or PR; an overall PD occurs when any category has a PD.</description>

    <measure>Change in PHQ-9 score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 of the BCD treatment until 12 months after the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 score (Patient Health Questionnaire scale-9) is a nine-item self-administered instrument to assess depressive symptoms which incorporates the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) classification for major depressive disorder. Each item is scored 0 - 3, which results in a range of scores between 0 and 27. PHQ-9 scores are interpreted as follows: (1) score &lt;5, no depression; (2) score 5 - 9, mild depression; (3) score 10 - 14, moderate depression; (4) score 15 - 19, moderately severe depression; and (5) score 20 - 27,severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in MCD-related overall symptom score</measure>

    <description>Change of MCD symptom scores. MCD symptom score (MCD disease related overall symptom score) is a 34-item score based on NCI-CTCAE (V4.0) adverse events. Each item is scored 0-5, which results in a range of scores between 0 and 170. More scores indicate more severe disease activity.</description>
