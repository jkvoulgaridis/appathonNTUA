  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to find thermal differences in foot in a group of children, detecting the
      most suitable footwear to acquire optimal foot temperature and taking into account that
      children in school age usually wear sports shoes instead of school shoes in most dimensions
      of daily life. It is assumed by general population that sports shoes increase sweating and
      provide less perspiration apart from biomechanical criteria, so for this reason the
      investigators are going to examine which thermal pattern offers each variety of footwear.

      Infrared thermal image allows detecting object´s temperature visually in a non-contact way.
      That makes the technique useful for different applications like in construction/ building,
      ecology, industry and medicine. Evolution of thermographic equipments makes it more
      accessible. It is a non- contact, non- invasive technique that helps researchers monitoring
      body temperature. So that, it is used to investigate ocular, liver, kidney and brain
      diseases, dental diagnosis, breast cancer detection or even sports injuries.

      It is increasing the use of thermographic imaging in podiatry, so the main trials concerned
      to diabetes mellitus, vascular disorder or dermatological applications.

      Nevertheless, there is little known about children´s foot temperature. Main studies are
      related to core temperature or variations in temperature among different parts of the body of
      enfants.

      In consequence, the investigators found a lack of information related to such a significant
      topic, not only for podiatrists, but also for population in general.
