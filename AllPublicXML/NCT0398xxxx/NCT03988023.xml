    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, single dose design. This study is conducted in male
      and female patients between ≥40 and 85 years of age with severe osteoarthritis of the knee.
      Approximately 1034 patients with severe osteoarthritis of the knee randomized 1 to 1
      treatment group (1:1) will receive a single intra- injection of 4 milliliter (mL) of Ampion
      or saline.

      The clinical effects of treatment on severe osteoarthritis of the knee will be evaluated at
      baseline and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 weeks, using the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC®) osteoarthritis Index 3.1, and the Patient's Global
      Assessment of disease severity (PGA).

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC A (Pain Subscale) The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC®) Osteoarthritis Index is a questionnaire that measures pain, stiffness, and function both independently and collectively, using a Likert 3.1, 5-point scale. The Likert Scale uses the following descriptors for all items: none, mild moderate, severe, and extreme, corresponding to an ordinal scale of 0-4. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <description>Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Severeity (PGA)
The PGA is a 5-point scale used to capture the participant's overall impression at the time of the assessment in the index knee. This is a single question and the score ranges from 0 to 4, where 0 anchors &quot;very well&quot; and 4 anchors &quot;very poor.&quot; A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline.</description>

          -  Moderate to moderately-severe OA pain in the index knee (rating of at least 1.5 on the
             WOMAC Index 3.1 as measured by 5-point Likert Pain Subscale) assessed at screening

          -  Ability to temporarily discontinue nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for 48
             hours prior to scheduled clinical efficacy evaluations

          -  Isolated patella femoral syndrome, also known as chondromalacia

          -  Any other disease or condition interfering with the free use and evaluation of the

               1. No IA injected pain medications in the study knee during the study

               2. No analgesics containing opioids. NSAIDs may be continued at levels preceding the

               6. No immunosuppressants

               7. No use of corticosteroids &gt; 10 mg prednisolone equivalent per day

               8. If corticosteroid use is ≤ 10 mg prednisolone equivalent per day, and if
                  clinically indicated, subjects should be allowed to decrease their corticosteroid
                  use. Additionally, some subjects may need to increase their steroid dose to treat
                  worsened symptoms in the treated knee, and subjects who increase their
                  corticosteroid dose above their starting dose of corticosteroid during the study
                  will be treated as &quot;treatment failures&quot; for efficacy analysis

          -  No human albumin treatment in the 3 months before randomization or throughout the
