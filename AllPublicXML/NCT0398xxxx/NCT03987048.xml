  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhotic patients have a poor outcome in intensive care unit (ICU). Septic shock is a
      leading cause of ICU admission and death in this specific population. We performed a
      monocentric retrospective study; all cirrhotic patients admitted in the ICU with septic shock
      from 2002 to 2013 were included. The aim of the study was to identify prognostic factors for
      both short- and long-term mortality in these patients. Demographic, clinical and biological
      data, organ supports, and outcomes were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis were
      carried out regarding both ICU and one-year mortality.
