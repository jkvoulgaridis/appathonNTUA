  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CD19 CAR-T therapy is an effective treatment choice for refractory/relapsed acute
      B-lymphoblastic leukemia, but relapse after CAR-T treatment still occurs and is the main
      reason for CAR-T treatment failure. The exhaustion of CAR-T cells and the subsequent
      inability to maintain CAR-T cell killing effect were major underlying factors for relapse and
      there was no solution so far. In this study, T cells expressing CD19 antigen (feeding T cell)
      were constructed and expanded in vitro. Feeding T cells and CD19 CAR-T cells were infused
      back into the patients sequentially to continuously stimulate CD19 CAR-T cells so as to
      enhance the therapeutic effect and reduce the relapse rate.
