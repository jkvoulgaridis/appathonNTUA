  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estimated glomerular filtration rate(eGFR) is significantly reduced in patients with
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of this study is to research that
      the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction is significantly higher when the glomerular filtration rate below a
      certain value.

      The investigators retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 1157 patients with ST-segment
      elevation myocardial infarction. In-hospital adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was defined
      as: cardiac arrest, cardiac rupture, malignant arrhythmia, and cardiac death. All the
      patients were divided into 3 groups according to the patient's estimated glomerular
      filtration rate(eGFR) (eGFR≥90ml/min/1.73m2; 90ml/min/1.73m2&gt;eGFR≥60ml/min/1.73m2;
      eGFR&lt;60ml/min /1.73m2). COX regression analysis and K-M survival curves are used to calculate
      the correlation between eGFR and in-hospital MACE.
