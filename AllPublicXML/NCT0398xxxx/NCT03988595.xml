  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test any good and bad effects of aerobic exercise performed while you are
      receiving the usual first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer. The researchers think
      that exercise helps delay the development of resistance to hormone therapy while slowing the
      growth of tumors.

    <intervention_model_description>Exercise therapy will consist of individualized walking delivered 3 to 5 times weekly for 24 weeks. This trial will evaluate four escalated doses of exercise (90 mins/wk, 150 mins/wk, 225 mins/wk, or 300 mins/week).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Feasibility is defined in terms of the relative dose intensive (RDI), the proportion of the planned exercise prescription that was completed without requiring a dose modification or interruption. The MFD is defined as the dose estimated to result in approximately 70% of patients achieving an RDI ≥ 75%.</description>

    <description>Exercise sessions will consist of individualized, walking delivered following a non-linear(i.e., exercise intensity is continually altered and progressed in conjunction with appropriate rest/recovery sessions across the entire intervention period) dosing schedule across 3 to 5 individual treatment sessions/wk for 6 months. All exercise sessions will be implemented and monitored using TeleEx at the patient's home. General physical activity as well as exercise performed outside of the structured treatment sessions will be evaluated via continuous monitoring using MSK approved telemedicine / wireless technology.</description>
