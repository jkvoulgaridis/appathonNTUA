      Cognitive action control allows resisting to irrelevant information to easily produce desired
      goal-directed behaviors. This cognitive process is disturbed in patients with Parkinson's
      disease (PD). However, the neural signature of this impairment has not been clarified yet.
      Several studies using electroencéphalography (EEG) showed that conflict situations in healthy
      participants are inevitably associated with a power increase of neuronal oscillations in the
      theta frequency band (~4-8Hz) in the medial frontal cortex (MFC). Conflict situations are
      also associated with theta functional connectivity between the MFC and task-relevant brain
      areas. The theta power increase and connectivity are respectively interpreted as a marker of
      the integration of conflicting information and as a candidate for communication between the
      brain areas involved in implementing cognitive action control. The objective of this project
      is to test the hypothesis that the deficit of cognitive action control observed in PD comes
      from a lack of integration of the conflict information and / or communication of this
      information between the MFC and other task-relevant brain areas. Investigators willl study
      this cognitive process using a classic conflict task, the Simon task, and by recording brain
      activity using high density EEG coupled with cortical source connectivity analyses. The
      results will allow us to evaluate whether theta oscillations can serve as a marker of
      cognitive control disorders in Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      Alterations in cognitive action control in patients with PD are well described from a
      behavioral point of view. However, there is currently very little information to directly
      link these difficulties to functional alterations of brain areas, or of efficient
      communication within large scale brain networks. Thus, the objective of this project is to
      specify the neuronal substrates linked to the difficulties in cognitive action control
      observed in patients with PD. The rational is based on the recent findings on the role of
      theta (4-8 Hz) neuronal oscillations in cognitive action control. Indeed, converging evidence
      linked this process to an increase in theta oscillatory power around midfrontal electrodes
      (FCz, Cz) and to an increase in theta functional connectivity with task-relevant brain areas.

      The working hypotheses are based on the hypothesis proposed by Cohen (2014). It proposes that
      the medial frontal cortex (MFC; around the pre-SMA) would be involved in the integration of
      conflicting information, observable by studying theta oscillations' power. On the other hand,
      the phase synchronization of theta oscillations between the MFC and the other task-relevant
      cortical areas would reflect the degree of recruitment of the entire network participating in
      the implementation of an efficient cognitive control. Thus, according to this model, a
      conflict situation would lead to two main measurable electrophysiological reactions in the
      cortex: i) an increase in the power of theta oscillations around the MFC, ii) an increase in
      theta phase synchronization between the MFC and the other cortical areas (such as the lateral
      prefrontal and parietal cortices) involved in implementing cognitive action control. These
      two electrophysiological effects will be the main judgment criteria of this study.

      The hypothesis is that the behavioral difficulties in cognitive action control observed in PD
      patients stem from a lack of integration of the conflicting information and / or a weaker
      communication of this information to the areas implementing the cognitive control of the
      action. The alteration of one or both of these aspects may explain the weaker cognitive
      action control observed in patients. Moreover, by inspecting the disrupted brain networks, it
      will be able to make hypotheses explaining the alteration of cognitive control in PD. For
      example, a weaker functional connectivity between the MFC and the posterior parietal cortex
      could indicate a lower redirection of attentional resources following the presentation of a
      conflictual stimulus. Another possibility would be a weaker functional connectivity between
      the MFC and the inferior prefrontal cortex, which would rather indicate a lack of recruitment
      of the inhibitory system.

      The main hypothesis will be tested by comparing the performance of a group of PD patients to
      that of a group of healthy participants whose brain activity will be collected during the
      realization of a Simon task via a high resolution electroencephalography system. The
      behavioral performances will be compared as well as the source-reconstructed
      electrophysiological data. Specifically, the power of the theta oscillations within the
      medial frontal cortex, as well as the phase synchronization between the other cortical areas
      involved will be compared between the two groups. Brain-behavior relationships will also be
      investigated in order to try to link PD behavioral impairments to changes in theta
      oscillatory power/connectivity.

    <description>The scalp electrical activity will be collected by a 256-electrodes EEG montage (Electrical Geodesics Inc).
During the task, participants will be asked to answer on a right or left button according to the color of a circle (yellow or blue) presented on the left or right side of a screen. Participants will have to ignore the stimulus position and respond only according to its color. This leads to two experimental conditions When the color of the circle and its position indicate the same answer, the situation is congruent and the answer is facilitated. Conversely, when they indicate two opposite responses, a conflict between the two alternative actions appears and must be resolved to provide a correct answer. This situation is said to be incongruent. At each trial, the stimulus is shown to the left or right of a central fixation cross. The participants then have to answer on a right or left button. At each trial, the reaction time and the accuracy of the response will be collected.</description>

        PD patients will be recruited from the Neurology unit of the Rennes University Hospital.
        The study will be proposed to them during their hospitalization, which is independent from
        this study and occurs as part of their routine care. Most patients are hospitalized in
        order to conduct pre-surgical evaluations before deep brain stimulation. No changes in
        treatments or any other type of routine care will be made during this study.

        HC volunteers will be recruited from the general population using a volunteer database from
        our lab. HC's travel expenses will be refunded by the hospital
