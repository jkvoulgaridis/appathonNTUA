      Objective: To investigate the long-term effects of targeted follow-up of new fitness center
      members compared to usual practice, on frequency of visits and membership terminations after
      four years.

      Design and setting: A participant and provider blinded parallel group randomized controlled
      trial conducted at eight Fitness Centers in Trondheim, Central Norway.

      Participants: The inclusion criteria were new members &gt;16 years who between September 1st to
      9th 2014 signed up for an ordinary contract with a minimum duration of 12 months.

      Intervention: The intervention consisted of two phone calls and one e-mail delivered over 6-8
      weeks after enrollment, aiming to motivate members to get started using the fitness center
      and its services. Usual practice at the fitness center is self-directed use.
