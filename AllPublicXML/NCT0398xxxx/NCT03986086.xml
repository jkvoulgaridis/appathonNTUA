    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is evaluate the safety and tolerability of MPH966, a neutrophil
      elastase inhibitor, and its ability to prevent graft-versus-host disease after hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant.

      Phase 1 is a 3+3 dose escalation study to determine the safety and recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) of MPH966 in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HCT). We will evaluate up to 4 doses: 60 mg po bid, 120 mg po bid, 180 mg po bid, and 240 mg
      po bid. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy will be assessed in real time and pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics after each dose cohort before escalating to the next cohort.

      Phase 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the clinical
      efficacy of MPH966 vs. placebo in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after
      HCT, using the RP2D as determined by the phase 1 trial.

          7. Willing to abstain from sexual activity or use two methods of birth control while on
             study drug and for 5 half-lives (4 days) after last dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. If female, pregnant or nursing.

          2. Life expectancy &lt;6 months

          3. Other malignancy or neoplastic disease (i.e. aside from the malignancy for which they
             are undergoing HCT) within the past 5 years with the exception of treated
             basal/squamous cell skin carcinoma or treated cervical cancer in situ

          4. Clinically significant active infection within 1 week of starting study drug

          5. Any of the following organ system function criteria:

               1. Cardiac: Ejection fraction ≤40% or myocardial infarction within 6 months of
                  transplant or QTc &gt;450 msec for males and &gt;470 msec for females or other EKG
                  abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator may put the subject at risk
                  or interfere with study assessments

               2. Renal: Creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≤ 60 mL/min as estimated by the
                  Cockcroft-Gault equation

               3. Pulmonary: FEV1, FVC, or corrected DLCO ≤40% predicted (forced expiratory volume
                  in 1 second; forced vital capacity; and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon
                  monoxide, respectively)

               4. Hepatic: Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x (in the absence of known inherited
                  hyperbilirubinemia, e.g. Gilbert's) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine
                  transaminase (ALT) &gt;3 x upper limit of institutional normal for age (grade 2 or
                  higher) and/or INR &gt;1.5 (unless on anticoagulant), or history or evidence of

                  chronic liver disease (e.g. Wilson's disease, autoimmune liver disease, primary
                  biliary cirrhosis, etc.). Abnormalities in platelet number or albumin will not be
                  considered exclusion criteria given that these are often due to the hematologic
                  malignancy for which the patient is undergoing HCT rather than actual liver
                  dysfunction

               5. Uncontrolled infection, including detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or
                  hepatitis C virus (HCV) by serology or nucleic acid testing or HIV by polymerase
                  chain reaction (PCR)

             i. Treated HBV/HCV/HIV with documented clearance is ok f. Other significant organ
             dysfunction (cardiac, pulmonary, renal, metabolic or central nervous system) that is
             uncontrolled and may interfere with study completion

          6. Any significant medial history of alcohol abuse within 3 months of starting study drug
             and/or unwillingness to abstain for the duration of the study and follow up periods

          7. Prior (within 30 days) or concomitant use of another neutrophil elastase inhibitor
             (e.g. alpha-1 antitrypsin)

          8. Plan for in vivo or ex vivo T cell depletion.

          9. Participated in another clinical study involving an investigational drug or device
             within 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to planned start of MPH966/placebo, or scheduled
             to participate in another clinical study involving an investigational drug or device
             within Day 100 of transplant

               1. If the patient develops GVHD within the first 100 days, they are allowed to
                  enroll on trials of investigational drugs to treat GVHD provided they come off of
                  this study.

               2. Enrollment in biorepository or supportive care trials that do not involve
