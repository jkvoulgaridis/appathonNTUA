  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to develop and examine a personalized, text-based intervention designed
      to improve engagement with mental health (MH) treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Text2Connect (T2C) aims to increase perceived susceptibility/severity of
      depression/suicidality and decrease stigma in at-risk adolescents and their parents. The
      investigators hypothesize that modification of patient beliefs leads to change talk, thereby
      increasing the experience of discrepancy which affects motivation for change. These
      experiences in turn influence decisional balance away from ambivalence toward readiness for
      change.

      Assignment of Interventions:

      This study will utilize a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design. This stepped wedge
      design involves the sequential random rollout of an intervention over 2 time periods.
      Following a baseline period in which no clusters (= practices) are exposed to the
      intervention, the crossover is typically in one direction, from control to intervention and
      continues until both of the clusters have crossed-over to receive the intervention, with
      observations taken from each cluster and at each time period.

      This study will pilot Text2Connect in two community pediatric practices using a stepped wedge
      design (n = 50 adolescents).

      Hypothesis: Readiness for mental health care will be greater among adolescents in T2C vs
      adolescents referred during TAU.

    <description>Satisfaction with the technical components of interventions will be assessed through the certain questions from the Post System Satisfaction and Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). The PSSUQ is 19 items with response options ranging from 1 to 7 where 1=strongly disagree and 7=strongly agree. The PSSUQ has sub-scores derived from subsets of the questions which reflect system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality. Questions from sub-domains were chosen to tailor the questioning to this particular intervention.</description>

Our form datasets will include original case report forms, a detailed codebook of variable names, value labels, and programming formats and all study documentation including the protocol and manual of procedures. For descriptive/raw data, study investigators/study staff will upload to NIMH's National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Health Illness (NDCT) on a semi-annual basis all analyzed data being uploaded prior to primary paper publication.</ipd_description>
