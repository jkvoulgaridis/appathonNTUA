  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to determine whether rebaudioside consumption can be used as a treatment for
      adolescents with Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) by demonstrating a decrease in
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels participants will be randomized to receive one of three
      8-week liquid diet interventions:

        1. Standard of care

        2. Water delivery

        3. Water with Rebaudioside (stevia natural sweetener)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Current treatment strategies for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD, have
      focused on lifestyle management through a combination of diet and exercise but there are no
      recommendations for dietary changes that have been proven superior to others. Preliminary
      data showing an improvement in liver enzymes and fibrosis in mice has demonstrated a novel
      use of rebaudioside, the non-caloric sweetener (NCS) Stevia leaf's extract, potentially
      identifying this NCS as a therapeutic intervention where currently there are no targeted
      treatments.

      Intervention: All participants will receive standard of care for diet and nutrition.
      Additionally, participants will be randomized to one of four 8-week liquid diet
      interventions:

        1. Standard of Care

        2. Water Delivery

        3. Water with Rebaudioside (Stevia Natural Sweetener)

      Objectives and Purpose: To determine whether rebaudioside consumption can be used as a
      treatment for adolescents with NAFLD by demonstrating a decrease in ALT levels.

    <description>We will order and deliver bottled water to the homes of subjects in the treatment group. We will provide each participant with a weekly supply of about 36 16.9 fl oz single-serving containers.

    <description>We will order and deliver a commercially-available stevia-sweetened soft drink Zevia (Los Angeles, CA) to each participant in the treatment group. We will provide each participant with a weekly supply of 24 12 fl oz single-serving containers. Zevia will be provided in an assortment of flavors for the first week, then catered to the preference of the participant for the remainder of the study. We will instruct subjects to notify us by calling a dedicated telephone line on occasions when a delivery is expected but not received so that the problem can be corrected expeditiously. Participants will also be asked to keep track of how many containers they consume using a sticker chart, and we will also phone parents weekly to verify the sticker charts</description>
