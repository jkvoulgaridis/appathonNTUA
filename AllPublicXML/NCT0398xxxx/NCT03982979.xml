      The study will be a prospective, multi-center, non-blinded, controlled study, intended to
      evaluate the extended use of the HM3 LVAS compared to the HMII LVAS in those patients that
      are ongoing at the 2-year follow-up in the MOMENTUM 3 IDE trial. A total of 1028 subjects
      were enrolled in the MOMENTUM 3 IDE trial. Approximately 533 subjects were ongoing support at
      the 2-year follow-up and are eligible for enrollment in this PAS. This study will be
      conducted at sites that participated in the MOMENTUM 3 IDE trial which will include up to 69
      centers in the United States.

      Subjects on LVAD support after the MOMENTUM 3 IDE trial 2-year follow-up visit can be
      enrolled after providing consent to extended follow-up. They will be followed to 5 years
      post-implant or outcome (transplant, explant or death), whichever occurs first.

      Subjects who have been transplanted, their device exchanged to another pump other than a HM
      II or HM3, or explanted after the MOMENTUM 3 IDE trial 2-year follow-up but prior to
      providing consent for this PAS can also be enrolled. Data between the 2-year follow-up visit
      and the date of pump exchange, explant, or transplant will be retrospectively collected.

      Once enrolled, if subjects receive a device exchange to any device other than HM II or HM3,
      at any time during the study, they will be withdrawn from the study and will not be followed.

      In the event that a subject expired prior to providing consent, IRB approval will be obtained
      to collect the date and cause of death.

        As part of the PAS requirement, this study will consent male and female subjects with
        advanced refractory left ventricular heart failure who were implanted with the HM3 or HMII
        LVAS in the MOMENTUM 3 IDE trial and are ongoing at the 2-year follow up. Subjects must
        meet all eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent prior to conducting any
        investigation-specific procedures not considered standard of care.
