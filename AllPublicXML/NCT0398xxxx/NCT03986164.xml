  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized and longitudinal clinical study is to compare the
      installation of immediate implants in the esthetic zone through computer-guided-surgery and
      conventional surgery. To this end, 22 patients who need implant-supported replacement on the
      anterior region of the maxilla will be selected and after extraction will receive: Guided
      surgery (GS): installation of dental implant with the aid of the virtually planned guide by
      means of specific software; Conventional surgery (CS): installation of dental implant
      performed freehand using a conventional surgical guide made by study models.

      anterior region of the maxilla will be selected and after extraction will receive: Guided
      surgery (GS): installation of dental implant with the aid of the virtually planned guide by
      means of specific software; Conventional surgery (CS): installation of dental implant
      performed freehand using a conventional surgical guide made by study models. Tomographies
      will be performed 10 days after the surgery for the measurement of both linear and angular
      shifts between the installed implants and the virtual planning. All the clinical and
      radiographic assessments (Plaque and Bleeding Index, Drilling Depth, Relative Clinical
      Insertion Level and the Margin Position of Peri-Implant Mucosa) will be carried out after the
      surgery and within 6 and 12 months of post-operative. Assesments of the esthetic success
      (pink/white score) and survival and success of the implant will also be carried out. In the
      prosthetic part, it will be assessed the abutment mobility; corrective measures for the
      prothesis; repair on prothesis or abutment. The success and survival assessments of crowns
      will be done through structure fracture, occlusal roughness, marginal integrity and contour
      of the restoration. It will also be assessed the procedural impact in quality of life by
      applying a 36-closed-question-survey focused on appearence, pain, oral comfort, general
      performance, feeding and chewing. Subsequently, the data will be tabulated, and according to
      their distribution, the appropriate statistical tests will be applied, considering a 5% index
      of significance to all the analyses.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a longitudinal parallel randomized clinical trial, in Piracicaba Dental School, State University of Campinas (FOP-UNICAMP), periodic follow-ups will be performed for one year after the installation of implants in the anterior maxilla, by means of computer-assisted dental implant surgery or conventional surgery. The study will be conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration (2008), following the protocol for randomized clinical trials (Consort) (Schulz et al., 2010). The implant placement evaluations; radiographic and clinical evaluations of peri-implant tissues; as well as the success of the implants and the rehabilitation will be carried out immediately, 6 and 12 months after the implant installation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participating individuals will be allocated within each group through a computer-generated list, stored in a brown opaque envelope, under the care of an individual (TCB) other than the examiner. Only the professional responsible for the treatments will have access to the codes and both the patients and the examiners will be blind to the group to which each patient belongs, making possible the characterization of the study as double-blind.</masking_description>

    <description>A minimally traumatic extraction will be performed aiming at the preservation of tissue integrity. After this step, milling will be performed using a sequence of guides and cutters recommended by the Raptor Implacil / Bioparts (Implacil De Bortoli) system manufacturer for implant installation (Cone Morse 3.5mm from 11-13mm Implacil De Bortoli) in computer-guided surgeries.
In the spaces between the implant and the buccal bone plate will be filled with xenogene biomaterial (Geistlich Bio-Oss 0.25-1mm). Immediately after implant installation, the prosthetic component (Smart Line, Trunnion CM 3.5mm - T 1.5-3.5mm, height 4mm - Implacil De Bortoli) will be placed.
If necessary, the sutures of the surgical procedures will be performed with polygalactin 5.0 (Vycril Rapid®, Jonhson's Jonhson, São José dos Campos) and will be removed after 7 days.</description>

    <description>The sequence of cutters recommended by the manufacturer for this type of surgery and installation of the same type of implant (Cone Morse due cone 3.5mm) will be adopted. The perforations of the collar for future insertion of the implants will be performed aiming the installation of the implants with its platform installed with sub-crestal position. The implant should be installed along the palatine wall to obtain primary stability, at the center of the mesio-distal width predetermined by the final restoration, with a minimum distance of 2 mm from the adjacent tooth, and 3 mm from the free gingival margin, becoming slightly palatinate (Kan et al, 2018). Immediately after installation, the prosthetic component (Smart Line, Trunnion CM 3.5mm - T 1.5-3.5mm, height 4mm) will be placed. If necessary, the sutures of the surgical procedures will be performed with polygalactin 5.0 (Vycril Rapid®, Jonhson's Jonhson, São José dos Campos) and will be removed after 7 days.</description>
