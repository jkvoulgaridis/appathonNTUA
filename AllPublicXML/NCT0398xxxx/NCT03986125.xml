  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized clinical trial of an emotional awareness and expression
      intervention (EAET) and a mindfulness meditation intervention (MMT) for Wayne State
      University students with anxiety and somatic symptoms. Each of these treatments will be
      compared to a wait list control condition and to one another to evaluate how well the
      treatments improve physical and psychological symptoms, stress, and interpersonal functioning
      of 120 Wayne State University students at 4-week and 8-weeks post-randomization. This
      research is intended to provide an evidence-based approach to working with emotions to
      improve both anxiety and somatic symptoms in young adults and will illuminate how EAET
      compares to the commonly used mindfulness training. It is hypothesized that both active
      interventions will be superior to no treatment, and differences between the two treatments
      will be explored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is an increasingly common condition among college students and is often accompanied
      by somatic symptoms. These conditions impair students' social, psychological, and academic
      functioning and outcomes. Although students are utilizing campus and community mental health
      centers at increasing rates, these resources are strained. The present study aims to test the
      efficacy of two brief treatment options for students.

      Integrating techniques from several emotion-focused therapies, the investigators have
      developed and tested an intervention encouraging the awareness and expression of habitually
      suppressed or avoided emotions. This Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) has
      been evaluated with various patient populations including fibromyalgia, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic pelvic pain, and medically unexplained symptoms. Results of these trials
      suggest that the intervention is efficacious in improving physical and psychological
      well-being, and is equal to or superior to other psychological interventions for somatic
      conditions. The present study seeks to advance the EAET literature by evaluating the efficacy
      of the intervention for a broader population and by employing a strong and conceptually
      different comparison condition: mindfulness meditation training.

    <description>The 15-item measure asks patients how much they have been bothered by various somatic symptoms such as headaches, back pain, and digestive distress during the previous 2 weeks, with answers ranging from 0 (not at all) to 2 (a lot). Items are summed to generate a total score with higher scores indicating greater distress regarding somatic symptoms.</description>

    <description>The 14-item measure asks patients how often they had experienced thoughts and feelings such as lack of control and difficulty coping during the previous 2 weeks, with answers ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Items are summed to generate a total score with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction With Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to four and eight weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-item measure asks patients the degree to which they agree with statements such as &quot;In most ways my life is close to my ideal&quot;, with answers ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Items are summed to create a total score with higher scores indicating a greater degree of satisfaction with life.</description>

    <description>Measures the extent to which patients outwardly display emotion. The 17-item measure asks patients the degree to which items such as &quot;I display my emotions to other people&quot; describe them on a scale from 1 (never) to 6 (always). Scores are summed to generate a total score with higher scores indicating greater emotional expressiveness.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to four and eight weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-item measure asks patients to rate the degree to which statements indicating four components of mindfulness (attention, focus on the present, awareness, and acceptance) apply to them, on a scale ranging from 1 (rarely/not at all) to 4 (almost always). Items are summed to generate a total score with higher scores indicating greater mindfulness.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptance and Action Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to four and eight weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>). The 9-item measure assesses avoidance of private experiences such as emotions, thoughts, and memories as well as the ability to take action under adverse circumstances. It asks patients to indicate how true each statement is of themselves on a scale ranging from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true). Items are summed and higher scores indicate greater levels of psychological inflexibility.</description>
