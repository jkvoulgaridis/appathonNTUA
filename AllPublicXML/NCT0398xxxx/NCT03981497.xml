  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational, retrospective and prospective, monocentric study. The objective is to evaluate
      the short, medium and long-term clinical course of patients undergoing microwave ablation
      (MWA) for small renal tumors and primary and secondary liver neoplasms. Evaluation of
      clinical efficacy (progression free survival),safety and technical outcome of microwave
      ablation as well as clinical outcome of the procedure will be evaluated.At the end of the
      follow-up periods, the data collected will be compared with those available in the literature
      on MWA, cryoablation (CA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgical resection.

        Subjects with indication of laparoscopic or percutaneous ablation of primary or secondary
        liver tumors and small primary kidney tumors (according to ESMO guidelines).

        All patients will follow their normal therapeutic procedure and no examination will be
        added to what is already provided for in the normal management of patients suffering from
        these diseases.
