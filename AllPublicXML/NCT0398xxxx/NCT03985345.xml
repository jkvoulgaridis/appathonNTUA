  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After birth, the perineum has to be trained in order to recover its functions.

      This study is designed to assess the quality of life evolution with the EMY connected device.

      The secondary purposes are to evaluate patient compliance to the EMY probe, to observe the
      evolution of urine scores over the duration of the trial in order to consider a comparative
      study thereafter, and to evaluate the interest of using the EMY connected perineal probe in
      the context of stress urinary incontinence.
