  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening programs and advances in imaging have led to more breast lesions being diagnosed at
      an impalpable stage. Multiple localisation techniques for nonpalpable breast lesions have
      been developed during the past decades. Specifically, several alternatives to the golden
      standard hooked-wire technique have become available, of which magnetic seed localisation is
      one of the newest approaches. Since September 2018, Magseed® localisation is the standard of
      care for localising impalpable breast lesions in UZ Leuven. In this study, the oncological
      safety, the clinical safety and surgeon satisfaction of Magseed® localisation will be
      assessed and retrospectively compared to hooked-wire localisation.
