      Background Three-dimensional (3D) imaging and subsequent 3D virtual treatment planning are
      becoming state of the art in orthognathic surgery. However, current available software is
      still too time-consuming. KLS Martin (Tuttlingen, Germany) has currently completed the
      preclinical phase of their novel 3D virtual planning software, &quot;IPS (Individual Patient
      Solutions) CaseDesigner (IPSCD)&quot;.

      Objectives The authors aim to test pre-release versions of the IPSCD software under
      real-world working conditions by a single surgeon.In specific, the authors aim to demonstrate
      that the IPSCD will ensure a significant reduction in treatment planning time.

      Study design closed beta-phase Patients presenting at the division of maxillofacial surgery
      at the different hospital centers, for an orthognathic-related problem will receive a
      complete routine work-up, including a cone-beam CT (CBCT) according to the IPSCD protocol.
      The same surgeon will run all the virtual planning steps with both conventional software
      (Maxilim) and the novel software. Timing of the eight major steps will be measured with a
      digital chronometer.
