  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The national epidemiological survey showed that the prevalence rate of pre-diabetes was up to
      35.7% in China. Previous study indicated that lifestyle intervention in people with impaired
      glucose tolerance could delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. However, patients with
      pre-diabetes do not pay enough attention to their glucose metabolism, and most of them rarely
      monitor their blood glucose. With the increasing use of smartphones, mobile applications
      (APPs) can be applied in the education and management of chronic diseases, including
      diabetes. Thus, the investigators will conduct a multi-centered, two-armed, open-labeled,
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether the behavioral intervention by a mobile APP
      can prevent the occurrence of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance.

      The investigators hypothesize that behavioral intervention in pre-diabetes with using a
      mobile APP that incorporates nutrition, exercise and psychological support from trained
      professional doctors will:

        1. Reduce the risk of the onset of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance.

        2. Increase the reversal rate of becoming normal glucose tolerance and reduce the levels of
           glycosylated hemoglobin in pre-diabetes.

      Participants from fourteen research centers in the mainland of China will be recruited in the
      study. People will be screened for a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The patients
      whose fasting glucose between 6.1mmol/L and 7.0mmol/L or 2-hour value between 7.8mmol/L and
      11.1mmol/L will be diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance and recommended to participate
      in the study.

      People who meet the eligibility criteria and who are willing to provide informed consent will
      be enrolled and randomized to behavioral intervention group and control group. People in the
      behavioral intervention group will be educated and monitored by a mobile APP that provides
      behavioral support including health knowledge education, mental health counseling, smart diet
      advice, intelligent exercise guidance, and target weight management. Meanwhile, the
      behavioral support will be modified by endocrinologists, dieticians, sports medicine
      professionals and psychologists individually based on the feedback of their characteristics
      and performance recorded in the APP. Participants randomized to the control group only have
      regular care in their local hospitals.

      Every three months, participants in the intervention group will be back to their research
      centers and be collected with information including HbA1c levels, blood pressure, heart rate
      tests, adverse events, combined medications and health checklists. Investigators conduct
      face-to-face health education, lifestyle guidance and mobile APP software inspection. Every
      one year, 75g OGTT (0min, 60min, 120min points of blood glucose and insulin levels), liver
      and kidney function, blood lipids, glycosylated hemoglobin, urine routine and
      electrocardiogram will be evaluated in both of the group. Investigators will compare the
      diabetes risk in the two groups to evaluate whether behavioral intervention with a mobile APP
      can reduce the risk of the onset of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance.
      Investigators also will compare the reversal rate of becoming normal glucose tolerance in
      prediabetes and the changes of glycosylated hemoglobin levels in both groups. Behavioral
      intervention with the APP will last for two years.

    <description>The lifestyle intervention will be launched by an APP installed in participants' private mobile phones, including health knowledge education, mental health counseling, smart diet advice, intelligent exercise guidance, and target weight management. Nutrition recommendation is conducted according to the Chinese Dietary Guide, Chinese and International Guidelines of Gestation Diabetes Management. Exercise guidance is given based on the Guidelines for National Fitness of China, Chinese and International Guidelines of Gestation Diabetes Management. Psychological support is given by sending education articles on mental health. Participants are encouraged to update data about their diet, exercise and body weight through the APP. The face to face education class will be conducted by an obstetrician, an endocrinologist and a nutritionist together to modify the behavioral supports individually based on the feedback of their characteristics and performance recorded in the APP.</description>
