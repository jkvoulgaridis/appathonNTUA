  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinopathy pigmentosa (which affects about 40,000 patients in France) leads to destruction
      of the peripheral retina. This condition, often familial, frequently affects young patients.
      Visual acuity is excellent for a long time, the disease affecting the central macular region
      only belatedly. On the other hand, the visual field is very quickly narrowed to a central or
      paracentral zone.

      For the patient, knowing the limits of his visual field and learning to adapt is necessary
      especially when traveling.

      The management of these patients is twofold:

        -  an orthoptist carries out an overall evaluation of the visual field using the Goldmann
           device (30 cm projection of the areas seen and not seen by the patient's eye), then
           performs rehabilitation over several weeks

        -  an instructor of locomotion (open specialization: occupational therapist, case of this
           project,...) carries out an evaluation in situation, followed by a personalized
           reeducation over several weeks. The first sessions consist in establishing a climate of
           confidence, presenting the objectives of the management of locomotion and begin to
           understand the movements inside and outside accompanied. The following of the
           rehabilitation is an apprenticeship of the optimal use of the residual field of vision
           and the proposed technical aids (white cane), in the whole of the displacements, inside
           and outside.

      The residual field of vision is evaluated by a device at the first appointment at the
      specialized center. This examination, necessary for the professional, is not informative for
      the patient. It is sometimes supplemented by the evaluation of the visual field of view
      (ECVS). The ECVS, done jointly by the orthoptist and the locomotion instructor, consists in
      evaluating the functional visual field on a horizontal plane at 1m (meter) and 5m, and
      vertical at 5m. The field of vision of the patient, immobile, is materialized by targets
      deposited at each limit of the zones seen that it indicates.

      The investigators believe that the passing of a visual field on the ground, thanks to the
      projection of the zones of vision, allows the patient to improve his knowledge on his visual
      possibilities (and gaps) and thus to make his reeducation more efficient.
