  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well hypofractionated radiation therapy works compared to
      the conventional one in treating patients with prostate cancer. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy beam to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Hypofractionated radiation therapy
      delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more
      tumor cells and have fewer side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities in patients treated
      with hypo-fractionated postoperative radiotherapy relative to the conventional postoperative
      radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To report patient outcome to include local control, loco-regional control, distant
      metastases, biochemical progression-free survival, prostate-cancer specific survival (PCSS),
      time to salvage therapy.

      II. To compare freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) and time to progression (TTP) with
      definition of post prostatectomy nadir + 2 ng/mL in both treatment arms.

      III. To evaluate patient reported quality of life outcomes with hypo-fractionated compared to
      standard fractionated postoperative radiotherapy using validated surveys (Expanded Prostate
      Cancer Index Composite [EPIC]-26, SF-12) and use of erectile dysfunction medications/devices.

      IV. To compare patient reported GU symptoms using the EPIC-26 survey at end of radiation
      therapy (RT), 6, 12, 24 and up to 60 months from the end of radiation therapy.

      V. To compare patient reported GI symptoms using the EPIC-26 survey at end of RT, 6, 12, 24,
      and up to 60 months from the end of radiation therapy.

      VI. To report health economics in delivering shorter hypofractionated courses of radiotherapy
      compared to standard course (indirect and direct cost).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo conventional radiation therapy daily over 6.5 weeks after standard of
      care surgery.

      ARM II: Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy over 4.5 weeks after standard of
      care surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-6 months, and then every
      6-12 months for up to 5 years.
