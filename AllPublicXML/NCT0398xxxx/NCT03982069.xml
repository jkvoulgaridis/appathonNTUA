    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate immunologic response to different types of influenza
      vaccine among children/adolescents/young adults 4-21 years of age. This is a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT), that will assess immune response in about 440 participants (about 220
      per vaccine arm) pre- and post-vaccination to FluMist (live attenuated influenza vaccine
      given by nasal administration) and Flucelvax (egg-free cell-culture inactivated influenza
      vaccine).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-blinded, randomized controlled trial analyzing influenza vaccine immunogenicity
      response in children/adolescents/young adults aged 4-21 years given one of two FDA approved
      and licensed influenza vaccines: FluMist (live attenuated influenza vaccine by nasal
      administration) and Flucelvax (egg-free cell-culture inactivated influenza vaccine). This
      study will enroll about 440 healthy participants, about 220 per vaccine arm. Participants
      will be randomized in blocks of 4 using a 1:1 allocation to receive either FluMist or
      Flucelvax. Blood work will be conducted on all participants at baseline prior to vaccine
      receipt and post-vaccination at Day 7 (range 6-9 days) and Day 21 (range 21-35 days). The
      primary objective of the study is to determine pre- and post-serologic responses to each
      vaccine type.
