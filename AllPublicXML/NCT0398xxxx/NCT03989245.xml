      The purpose of this study is to compare the rate of re-hospitalizations in relation to a
      disruptive behaviour disorder (at 3 and 6 months) between patients who have received care in

      The purpose of this muliticentric non-interventional study is to compare the rate of
      re-hospitalization in relation to a disruptive behaviour disorder between patients receiving
      care in Cognitive Behavioural Unity UCC (target arm) and those who have received care in
      Geriatric Care Unit and Rehabilitation SSR (Control arm ).

      At Inclusion (Month 0) : Inclusion of patients admitted in UCC or in geriatric SSR units for
      less than 8 days after obtaining of their non opposition.

      Following data: Socio-educational Level, somatic and psychiatric comorbidities,
      classification of the type of dementia, evolution of nutritional status, biology (hemoglobin,
      creatinine, albuminemia), cognitive evaluation, treatment, pain assessment, assessment of
      disruptive behaviour disorders, discharge modalities, assistance plan, legal protection
      (before and after hospitalization), types of restraints, measurement of fall rates and their
      consequences, pathology and/or symptoms observed ( incidents) during hospitalization and
      vital status will be collected at inclusion and follow-up (1, 3 and 6 months ).

      At 1 month (M1), exit from hospitalization (M1): Data provided by Investigator .

      At 3 months (M3) and 6 months (M6) after discharge from hospital in UCC or SSR: Sponsor's
      Clinical Research Associateall call patient (or his legal representative) or to the primary
      caregiver or attending physician or EHPAD coordinating physician for collection of
      questionnaires.
