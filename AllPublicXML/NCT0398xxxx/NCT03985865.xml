  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want to investigate whether bitter compounds, denatonium benzoate and quinine
      hydrochloride, have a distinct effect on gastrointestinal hormone release after infusion into
      the stomach or duodenum. Furthermore, we want to observe an effect on hunger sensations and
      hedonic food intake. Moreover, we suggest somatostatin as a driving factor for decreased
      motilin and ghrelin release after intragastric administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intragastric administration of the bitter tastants denatonium benzoate (DB) or quinine
      hydrochloride (QHCl) decreases orexigenic hormone levels, and reduces hunger sensations.
      Contradictory, in vitro studies on human gastric and duodenal tissue showed that DB exposure
      increased motilin and octanoylated ghrelin levels. DB stimulated somatostatin (SST) release,
      which is an inhibiting paracrine hormone. We hypothesized that the reduction in hunger
      ratings and hormone levels is stronger after intragastric compared to intraduodenal
      administration, and that these differences are mediated by differential SST release. Fourteen
      healthy female volunteers participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study.
      After an overnight fast, DB (1 µmol/kg), QHCl (10 µmol/kg) or placebo were given intragastric
      or intraduodenal via a feeding tube. Blood samples were taken at regular time points to
      obtain the hormonal release. Hunger was rated at the same points on a 100 mm visual analog
      scale (VAS). Ad libitum milkshake intake was assessed at the end of the experiment and taste
      was scored on a VAS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in plasma levels of motilin, ghrelin, somatostatin, GLP-1 and CCK after bitter administration into the stomach or duodenum</measure>
    <time_frame>A first blood sample is taken as a reference 10 min before administration of the condition. After the infusion, every 10 min blood samples are taken for 2 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Infusion of bitter compounds into the stomach or duodenum is performed via a nasogastric feeding tube. Afterwards, an intravenous dwelling line is placed to take blood samples at several time points during the experiment. Hormone levels of motilin, ghrelin, somatostatin, GLP-1 and CCK are collected with according enzyme inhibitors.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in hunger scores after bitter administration into the stomach or duodenum</measure>
    <time_frame>Hunger is scored every 10 min during the whole experiment starting 20 min before the infusion, until 2 hours after the infusion. 1 minute before and after ad libitum drinking, hunger is scored.</time_frame>
    <description>Infusion of bitter compounds into the stomach or duodenum is performed via a nasogastric feeding tube. Hunger is scored on a 100 mm visual analog scale at several time points during the experiment. Two hours after the infusion, the nasogastric feeding tube and intravenous dwelling line are removed and the subject drinks ad libitum from a chocolate milkshake until they are fully satisfied. Hunger is scored right before and after drinking the milkshake.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in hedonic food intake after bitter administration into the stomach or duodenum</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours after the infusion of a condition, subjects drink from the milkshake without an intermission.</time_frame>
    <description>Infusion of bitter compounds into the stomach or duodenum is performed via a nasogastric feeding tube. Two hours after the infusion of a bitter compound or placebo, the subjects drink ad libitum from a chocolate milkshake until they are fully satisfied. The milkshake is weighted before and after the experiment to calculate the amount of consumed calories (1 g milkshake = 1 kcal).</description>
