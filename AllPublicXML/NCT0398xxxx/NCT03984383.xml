  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the inflammatory response of endothelial cells to various
      stimulations, in particular the production of IL33 and of endocan in response to allergens,
      agonists of microorganisms and pollutants.

      For that purpose, this project attempts to set up a biological collection of lung and
      umbilical cord endothelial cells.

      Lung endothelial cells are resected from a surgical specimen, resulting from a lung cancer
      surgery.

      Umbilical cord-derived endothelial cells are taken from the umbilical cord collected during
      the delivery.
