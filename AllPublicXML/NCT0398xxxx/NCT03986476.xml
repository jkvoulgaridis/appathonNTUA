  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of supplementation with two different probiotic
      products (Lactobacillus reuteri strains) on the intestinal barrier function, gut health and
      stress symptoms in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) patients.

      After having given their written informed consent, subjects will complete screening
      procedures to evaluate their eligibility for the study (visit 1). Study participants will
      undergo two baseline visits (visits 2 and 3, 3 weeks apart) to account for individual
      variations, and will then be randomly assigned to 6-week intake of one of two Lactobacillus
      reuteri strains, or placebo in a ratio of 1:1:1 (stratified by sex). Participants will attend
      a study visit three weeks into the intervention (visit 4) and at the end of the intervention
      (visit 5, week 6). The intestinal permeability will be assessed using a standardized
      multi-sugar test at visit 2, visit 3, visit 4, and at end of intervention (visit 5). Blood,
      saliva and faecal samples will be collected at visit 2-5. In addition, gastrointestinal
      symptoms will be recorded at those visits (using Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale-IBS,
      GSRS-IBS; IBS severity scoring system, IBS- SSS). Quality of life using the 5Q-5D-5L and
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores will also be recorded at those visits. In
      addition, at visit 3 and visit 5, the IBS-Quality of life (IBS-QoL) and the Perceived Stress
      Scale (PSS) will be completed. In a daily diary, participants will record stool frequency and
      consistency from visit 2 until end-of-study visit 5. Dietary habits of the patients will be
      assessed via a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and a 3-day food diary before the
      intervention (between visit 2 and 3).
