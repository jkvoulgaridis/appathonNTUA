  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy comprise a group of disorders made up of over 30 mutations
      which share a common phenotype of progressive weakness of the shoulder and hip girdle
      muscles. While the individual genetic mutations are rare, as a cohort, LGMDs are one of the
      four most common muscular dystrophies. The overall goal of project 1 is to define the key
      phenotypes as measured by standard clinical outcome assessments (COAs) for limb girdle
      muscular dystrophies (LGMD) to hasten therapeutic development.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The genetic heterogeneity has been a barrier to broad natural history efforts, with prior
      investigations often limited to single gene mutations. Much attention is paid to the
      variability within individual mutations (e.g. distal presentations), as opposed to defining
      the best strategy for measuring change in overall LGMD disease burden. This presents a major
      dilemma for LGMD rare disease research: how to balance diverse genes leading to overlapping
      phenotypes, versus variants in the same gene leading to divergent phenotypes. What is clear,
      is as a group, LGMDs are chronic and progressive leading to significant lifetime morbidity
      and represent a large unmet clinical need.

      Recent developments in the investigator's genetic understanding of LGMD and molecular
      approaches to therapy have led to proposed gene replacement therapies for at least three of
      the LGMD mutations. Several of these gene replacement therapies are currently in
      pre-clinical/phase 1 testing, leading to an urgent need for natural history data. In
      addition, non-specific therapies which target muscle mass or function are being tested in
      other muscular dystrophies and may prove beneficial for LGMD.

        GRASP-LGMD covers a broad geographical distribution and we expect the race and ethnicity to
        match that of the United States. However, past experience in both the clinical and research
        LGMD populations shows that some minority subgroups are under-represented in research
        studies. To assist with recruitment of persons from diverse backgrounds we will utilize the
        Community and Special Populations Engagement Personnel supported through the CTSA networks
        to reach out to under-represented communities through a variety of local techniques which
        could include direct outreach, advertising with local advocacy groups, organizations, or
        newsletters, and local advertising using a variety of media which could include Social
        Media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter), radio, and newspapers.
