  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is poor,the role of
      chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced esophageal cancer has been
      established, which can convert some unresectable esophageal cancer into resectable esophageal
      cancer.PD-1 antibody has been shown to improve the pathological complete response rate in
      NSCLC, however, the data in neoadjuvant of esophageal squamous carcinoma is relatively rare.
      This study was designed to know the value of PD-1 antibody in neoadjuvant therapy of
      esophageal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is poor, the 5-year
      survival rate is less than 50%. It is necessary to conduct studies in these patients to
      reduce the rate of postoperative recurrence and prolong the disease-free survival. The role
      of chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced esophageal cancer has been
      established, which can convert some unresectable esophageal cancer into resectable esophageal
      cancer. The PD-1 antibody, teripalimab, is an immunological checkpoint inhibitor that has
      shown clinical efficacy in advanced esophageal cancer, but there has been relatively few data
      on neoadjuvant therapy. This study was designed to comprehend the pathological complete
      response rate, disease-free survival, and safety of neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy
      plus teriprilin patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
