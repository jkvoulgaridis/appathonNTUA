  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening eating disorder characterised by an intense fear
      of weight gain and disturbed body image, which motivates severe dietary restriction or other
      weight loss behaviours (e.g. purging). Treatment efficacy in adults with AN remains low: only
      a small percentage of individuals fully recover, and dropout rates are high. For adolescents
      with a relatively short term illness duration (under 3 years), family-based therapy has been
      associated with more favourable outcomes. However, for those adolescents with a longer
      illness duration (over 3 years), there are no specific treatments associated with positive
      long-term outcomes and these individuals are at risk of developing a severe and enduring form
      of the illness (SE-AN).

      In part, treatment can be problematic due to ambivalence, which is reflected in poor take-up
      of certain treatments (e.g. pharmacological treatments that lead to weight gain) and high
      drop-out rates. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated efficacy
      for treatment of AN in adults and improving treatment adherence. However, this has yet to be
      investigated in adolescents with AN.

      This study will use a novel type of rTMS, theta burst stimulation (TBS), including
      intermittent TBS (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS). TBS takes as little as a few minutes
      duration compared to the classical rTMS protocol which takes approximately 37.5 minutes. In
      addition, TBS has been found to produce longer after-effects of the induced plastic changes
      and has a lower stimulation intensity, which may therefore be more practical and potentially
      safer to administer in people with AN. Thus, the aim of this proof-of-concept trial is to
      obtain preliminary data on the safety and short-term (i.e. up to 24 hours) effects of a
      single session of iTBS and cTBS, compared to sham TBS, on reducing core symptoms of AN.
