  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients included in the study included the necessary tests U / A, K, Na, Cr, BUN, CBC, And U
      / C was checked and anesthesia counseling was done. Patients were prepared for action. The
      demographic and clinical data of the patients, including age, sex, size, and location of the
      stones were recorded.

      Then patients as random allocation were divided into two groups: A (control group, no basket
      of bases and group B (use of pneumatic synchronous buccal waist). The dividing person and the
      patients themselves were not aware of which group they were in. They were double-blind was.

      In each group, ureteroscopy was performed using a standard F9.5 ureteroscope. After reaching
      the rock in group A (control), the probe of the pneumatic crusher was passed through the
      working channel of the ureteroscope and began crushing the rock.

      During the crushing process, the minimum flow of water, flattening and the single-shot impact
      was used to minimize the stone's retropulsion.

      In group B (using a basket of wires3F) the helical type was passed through the four wires of
      the working channel of the ureteroscope and routed to the proximal part of the rock, and the
      stone was routed to the bowl, then the stone was ducted The gasket was kept, and the probe of
      the pneumatic crusher also passed through the working channel and proceeded to break it down.
      Conditions were observed during the stomach as the control group. Ureteroscopic crushing was
      performed by a urologist in both groups under similar technical conditions. Findings during
      and after the completion of crushing include the success, stone retropulsion or parts larger
      than 3 mm, which requires secondary measures (SWL - ureter stenting, resection ureteroscopy),
      the duration of stone breakdown and traumatic ureteric complications in both groups it is
      registered.
