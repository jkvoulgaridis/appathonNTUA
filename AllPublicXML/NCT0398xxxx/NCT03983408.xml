    <textblock>
      The objective of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and open-label
      extension study is to figure out the impact of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) on fatigue in
      patients with rheumatic diseases.

      Primary objective

      : Improvement of fatigue after using KRG in patients with rheumatic diseases according to

      Secondary objectives

        1. Improvement of dryness after using KRG in patients with rheumatic diseases according to
           EULAR Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI)

        2. Improvement of quality of life after using KRG in patients with rheumatic diseases
           according to EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)

      The study population will be adult patients with rheumatic diseases, especially primary or
      secondary Sjögren's syndrome who have experienced dryness for more than 3 months.
      Participants are ramdomly assigned to KRG and placebo group and they are using KRG or placebo
      for the first 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the concealment of allocation is lifted and all
      patients are provided with KRG for next 12 weeks with open-label extension study
