      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Study of the Safety, Efficacy and

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with
      open-label follow-up to identify the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of a repeated-dose
      regimen of DPI 386 nasal gel (intranasal scopolamine gel) for the prevention and treatment of
      nausea associated with motion sickness. The study will have two arms: DPI-386 nasal gel and
      placebo nasal gel for Treatment Day 1. Treatment Day 1 will include 50 subjects per arm, for
      a total of 100 subjects (n=100). All 100 subjects from Treatment Day 1 will receive
      open-label DPI-386 Nasal Gel for Treatment Days 2-4 (50 of these were originally randomized
      to receive placebo prior to receipt of the investigational product.).

      Treatment Day 1 will be conducted aboard an ocean-going vessel to obtain data in an
      operationally relevant real world environment and within 30 days of Treatment Day 1,
      Treatment Days 2-4 will take place at the clinical site.

    <masking_description>This study is double-blinded placebo controlled for all treatment arms on Treatment Day 1. All DPI-386 Nasal Gel and placebo nasal gel vials are opaque and indistinguishable. The DPI-386 Nasal Gel and placebo nasal gels are identical in color and viscosity, and without identifiable smell. Treatment Days 2-4 are open-label.</masking_description>

    <measure>Severity of nausea as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) over the treatment period.</measure>
    <time_frame>During Treatment Day 1 voyage.</time_frame>
    <description>Respondents specify their degree of nausea by indicating a point along a continuous 100 mm line between two end-points; left one is for &quot;No nausea&quot; and the right one for &quot;Very severe nausea&quot;. Scoring is based on the length from left point and a higher score means more severe degree of nausea (Spinks &amp; Wasiak, 2011).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety in terms of cognition as measured by the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT).</measure>
    <time_frame>During Treatment Day 1 voyage</time_frame>
    <description>The PVT is a neurocognitive assessment that measures alertness and tests sustained attention and reaction time. It was originally developed for sleep studies, and involves simple reaction time testing by requiring the participant to push a button as soon as the stimulus (a light) appears. After a response, the reaction time (in ms) is displayed. The inter-stimulus interval varies from two to 10 seconds, so it is not predictable, and the entire task takes 10 minutes (Dorrian, Rogers, &amp; Dinges, 2005). There are also shorter versions which have been validated as reasonable substitutes for the 10 minute version, such as the five minute (Lamond, Dawson, &amp; Roach, 2005)) and three minute versions (Grant, et al., (2017).</description>
