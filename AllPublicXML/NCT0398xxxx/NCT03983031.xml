  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of rituximab to 12 patients diagnosed with treatment
      resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder in an open trial.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunological factors may be determinants for some psychiatric disorders, thus
      immunomodulation may be helpful. Rituximab (antibodies against CD20, cluster of
      differentiation), a standard treatment for multiple sclerosis, is an anti-inflammatory drug,
      hitherto not tested for psychiatric disorders.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the psychiatric symptoms of
      treatment-resistant adult psychiatric patients, diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder
      (OCD), are significantly improved after treatment with rituximab. The investigator's purpose
      is to implement recent insights from &quot;Immunopsychiatry&quot; to find efficacious, but still
      tolerable treatment for these patients.

      This is a single-site, 20-week, open pilot, add-on treatment as usual, trial, where the
      patients will be followed for 1 year.

      Rituximab will be administered with one single dose of 1000 mg. Investigators will analyse
      inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers in relation to the primary outcome, treatment response
      (defined as clinically relevant reduction in the validated measure Y-BOCS). Other outcomes
      are &quot;much&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; on Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I)
      and change in Personal and Social Performance Scale measuring overall disability.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Yale-Brown obsessive- compulsive scale (Y-BOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Y-BOCS maps symptoms and measures severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms by a clinician. Y-BOCS has a range between 0 and 40 points, higher scores denotes worse symptoms. Outcome is measured as change in Y-BOCS score from baseline. At least 35% reduction in the score since baseline is defined as a response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) gives a score for disability. The PSP is a 100-point single-item rating scale (range 1-100), subdivided into 10 equal intervals. Lower scores denote lower functioning. The ratings are based mainly on the assessment of patient's functioning in four main areas: 1) socially useful activities; 2) personal and social relationships; 3) self-care; and 4) disturbing and aggressive behaviours. Change in score between enrolment and week 20 will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-severity (CGI-S) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>week 20</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S is a clinician rated measure of overall clinical severity that is rated on a scale between 1 and 7. A person with no clinical complaints or problems will get a score of 1. The score 7 indicates the highest level of severity is phrased as &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) in relation to inflammatory markers</measure>
    <time_frame>week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) measures change of symptoms on a 7 point Likert scale. A CGI-I score of 1 or 2 corresponds to be much or very much improved. Change in inflammatory markers in blood (gene expression and proteins) towards normality, in relation to clinical response (assessed by the clinician) will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I). Proportion of responders.</measure>
    <time_frame>week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) measures change of symptoms on a 7 point Likert scale. A CGI-I score of 1 or 2 corresponds to be much or very much improved. Three different informants base their CGI-I evaluations on independent assessments: a) The treating clinician, b) The patient's self-assessment and c) A next of kin. If the mean value of these three is below 2.5 then the patient will be regarded as a responder (representing much or very much improved since baseline).</description>

    <measure>Adverse event: Any Adverse Reactions (AAR). Safety and tolerability of Rituximab</measure>
    <time_frame>week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Any Adverse reactions (AAR) is a rating scale developed for this study and is not a validated questionnaire. It consists of a list of 26 symptoms. AAR maps adverse events related to rituximab treatment. These items are assessed for severity on a Likert scale (4 levels: none; mild; moderate; severe) and frequency (3 levels: occasionally; daily; several times daily). AAR is assessed by the clinician. An adverse event scale was required as an outcome measure by the Swedish Medical Products Agency.</description>
