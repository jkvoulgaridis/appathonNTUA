  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic
      (PK) study to determine the MTD and optimal dosing of Oratopo. No control group has been
      included.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and activity study.
      Eligible subjects will be adults with advanced solid tumor malignancies. In the treatment
      period groups of 3 to 6 subjects will receive a single dose of oral Oratopo will be
      administered and will be followed for toxicity. Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is
      reached, or nonlinear increases in exposure are confirmed, or a maximum dose of Oratopo is
      reached.
