  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves measurements of body composition using a DEXA scanner, lung function,
      buoyancy and floating technique. An understanding of the effects of physiological and
      anthropometric measures on an individual's ability to float may lead to the creation of a
      'Floatability Score' to aid current public information. With this floatability score a set of
      actions that people of certain body types should adopt in water will be created, to tailor
      the current public safety messaging in an attempt to ensure more people are aware of how they
      can float in water

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 2000 and 2013 an average of 425 people in the UK drowned per annum, and a reported
      100,000 people were involved in water-related emergencies involving search and rescue
      services. Approximately half had not intended to go into the water. Research identifies that
      in the first 1-3 minutes of immersion, during the &quot;cold shock response&quot; (CSR), there may be
      an increased probability of drowning fatalities. As a result of this, a theme of 'Float
      First' was created whereby individuals are advised to float for 1-3 minutes following
      immersion (by undertaking the minimum amount of activity possible to maximise the amount of
      air trapped in clothing layers and hence creating additional buoyancy) until the effects of
      the CSR have declined. However, a number of people have come forward indicating that despite
      the advice given, they are unable to float. This study is designed to establish the minimum
      activity level a person needs to stay afloat and combine this with anthropomorphic and
      physiological measures to develop advice for people of different shapes, sizes and body
      compositions.
