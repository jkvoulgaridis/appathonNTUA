      Ivabradine may be useful as a rate controlling agent in atrial fibrillation without negative
      effects on hemodynamics and inotropy. The objective in this proof of concept study is to
      investigate the hypothesis that ivabradine will slow the ventricular response in patients
      with permanent atrial fibrillation and previously-implanted pacemakers.

      In a simple cross-over study, the investigators will evaluate the impact of oral Ivabradine
      on exercise treadmill test, percent pacing as stored in pacemaker diagnostics, and 6 minute
      walk test.

      Aim/Hypotheses

      â€¢ To determine if the addition of Ivabradine to baseline cardiac medications slows mean and
      maximum heart rates in permanent atrial fibrillation

        -  Ivabradine will lower mean and maximum heart rates on treadmill exercise test, without
           lowering blood pressure

        -  Ivabradine will increase percent pacing, and lower rates over time as shown on pacemaker
           diagnostic data

        -  Ivabradine will improve exertional symptoms and exercise tolerance due to atrial
           fibrillation as measured by the Borg's scale during a six-minute walk test.

      Study Design

        1. Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation will undergo baseline exercise treadmill
           test, measurement of heart rates and percent pacing from pacemaker diagnostics, and a 6
           minute walk test with symptomatic assessment of dyspnea using the Borg's scale score.

        2. Oral Ivabradine will be started at 5 mg twice daily, and up-titrated to a maximum dose
           of 7.5 mg twice daily at 7 days if percent pacing has not increased significantly or
           rates have not slowed more than 20bpm.

        3. Exercise treadmill test, measurement of heart rates and percent pacing from pacemaker
           diagnostics, and a 6 minute walk test with symptomatic assessment of dyspnea using the
           Borg's scale score will be repeated at 2 weeks.
