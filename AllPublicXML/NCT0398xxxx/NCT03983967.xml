      The purpose of this study is to investigate and validate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or
      maximum available dose (MFD), safety and efficacy on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
      beyond Milan criteria who undergo liver transplantation.

      ILC-IIT-07 is open-label, phase 1/2 clinical trial to confirm safety on patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan criteria who undergo liver transplantation. For primary
      outcome, maximum feasible dose (MFD) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be evaluated.

      For secondary outcome, Time to Recurrence(TTR), Recurrence-Free Survival(RFS), Overall
      Survival(OS) will be evaluated.
