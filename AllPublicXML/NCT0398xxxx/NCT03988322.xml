  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) is considered as a screening method for early
      detection of lung cancer in the population at risk, and it also allows to detect chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Studies in European
      population showed the benefit of volumetric assessment of CT screening-detected lung nodules
      compared to diameter-based assessment. Screening for COPD and CVD, in addition to lung
      cancer, may significantly increase the benefits of low-dose CT lung cancer screening. The
      objective is to assess the screening performance of volume-based management of CT-detected
      lung nodule in comparison to diameter-based management, and to improve the effectiveness of
      CT screening for COPD and CVD, in addition to lung cancer, based on quantitative measurement
      of CT imaging biomarkers in a Chinese screening setting. Thus, a population-based comparative
      study will be performed in Shanghai, China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit 10,000 asymptomatic participants between 40 and 74 years old from
      Shanghai urban population. The 5000 participants in the intervention group will undergo a
      low-dose CT scan at baseline and one year later, and will be managed according to European
      volume-based protocol. The 5000 participants in the control group will undergo a low-dose CT
      scan according to the routine CT protocol and will be managed according to the clinical
      practice. Epidemiological data will be collected through questionnaires. In the fourth year
      from baseline, the diagnosis of the three diseases will be collected. The screening
      performance will be compared between volume-based and standard protocol for managing
      early-detected lung nodules. The effectiveness of quantitative measurement of CT imaging
      biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer, COPD and CVD will be evaluated.

      The detected lung nodules in the intervention group will be classified into three groups
      depending on nodule volume: &lt; 100 mm3 (negative result), 100-300 mm3 (indeterminate result)
      and &gt; 300 mm3 (positive result). In case of a negative result, a CT scan after one year is
      recommended. In case of an indeterminate result, a 3-month follow up CT is recommended at
      which VDT will be assessed. For short VDT (&lt; 400 days), the screening result is positive.
      Long VDT (&gt; 400 days) is considered a negative screening result. In case of a positive
      result, referral to a multidisciplinary team is recommended for further investigation. The
      detected nodules in the control group will be managed according to the recommended cut-off
      values of diameter from NCCN Clinical Practice Guideline in Oncology for Lung Cancer
      Screening.

In this arm, the participants will be scanned with low-dose CT with routine scanning parameters used for lung cancer screening in the hospital for two rounds (at baseline and in the second year). The screen-detected lung nodules will be managed according to the diameter of the nodule. The imaging biomarkers related to lung cancer, COPD and cardiovascular disease will be visually assessed.</description>

    <description>Participants will be screened with a low-dose CT (a Philips 256-slice CT system). The CT images will be obtain according to the pre-defined CT scan protocol. This CT protocol is developed for quantitative assessment of lung nodules, COPD and coronary artery calcium. Detected lung nodules will be managed according to the European volume-based protocol, based on the volume and volume doubling time of lung nodule. COPD will be management according to the result of lung function test. The imaging biomarkers (eg., emphysema index, airway wall thickness, and coronary artery calcium ) will be quantitatively registered. In addition, a number of participants' characteristics will be collected: physical examination (weight, height, blood pressure), laboratory measurements (eg., fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol). The social-demographic characteristics, risk factors of the 3 diseases, and health status of the participants will be collected through questionnaires.</description>
