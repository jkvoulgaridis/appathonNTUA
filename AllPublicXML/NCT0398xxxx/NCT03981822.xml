      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the dose regimen,
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of VP-102 in subjects with External Genital Warts (EGW).
      This study is divided into two parts (Part A and Part B). Increasing durations of skin
      exposure to study drug (VP-102 or placebo) will be evaluated in three treatment groups prior
      to progressing to enrollment in Part B. Part A &amp; B will enroll a approximately 108 subjects
      completing 4 treatment applications every 21 days and continuing with follow-up assessments
      at Day 84, 112 and 147.

    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the Dose Regimen, Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of VP-102 in
      Subjects with External Genital Warts. It is divided into two parts (Part A and Part B). The
      aim of Part A is to determine the two best treatment regimens for evaluation of safety and
      efficacy in Part B.In Part A, Study drug (VP-102 or placebo) will be administered once every
      21 days for up to four applications. Enrollment will begin in Group 1, then proceed into
      Group 2, and lastly into Group 3. A safety review will be conducted to determine whether
      enrollment can be initiated into the next Group. An additional blinded safety review will be
      performed after all six subjects in Group 3 have completed the 48-hour Visit, in order to
      support dose selection for Part B (Safety and Efficacy). Part B of the study will begin
      enrollment only after the Sponsor has selected the two dose regimens from Part A. The study
      will remain blinded until completion of both parts of the study.

      In Part A, up to 18 subjects will be randomized to VP-102 or placebo treatment with three
      different regimens. When Part B is open an additional ~90 subjects will be enrolled and
      randomized to VP-102 or placebo with two treatment regimens. Two of the treatment arms will
      be VP-102 Regimen 1 and VP-102 Regimen 2. The other two treatment arms will be placebo
      (Placebo Regimen 1 and Placebo Regimen 2), with corresponding durations of skin exposure
      matching those selected for VP-102 Regimen 1 and Regimen 2. As an example, if the regimens
      selected from Part A are the 2-hour and 6-hour applications of VP-102, then VP-102 Regimen 1
      would be VP-102 treatment for 2-hours and VP-102 Regimen 2 would be VP-102 treatment for
      6-hours. Likewise, Placebo Regimen 1 would be placebo treatment for 2 hours and Placebo
      Regimen 2 would be placebo treatment for 6-hours. Randomization of the four treatment arms
      (VP-102 Regimen 1:VP-102 Regimen 2:Placebo Regimen 1:Placebo Regimen 2) will be 3:3:2:2. In
      both Regimen 1 and Regimen 2, study drug will be administered to EGW once every 21 days for
      up to four applications. Subjects will be asked to remove the study drug at the designated
      time selected from the dose regimen findings in Part A of the study. Treatment will continue
      with a minimum of every 21 days, until complete clearance or a maximum of four treatment
      sessions. Safety assessments including recording of local skin reactions are conducted at
      each treatment visit and at follow up visits Day 84, 112, and 147.

    <intervention_model_description>The aim of Part A is to determine the two best treatment regimens for evaluation of safety and efficacy in Part B. Increasing durations of skin exposure to study drug (VP-102 or placebo) will be evaluated in three treatment groups (n=6/group) that will enroll progressively.
Part B of the study will begin enrollment only after the Sponsor has selected the two dose regimens in Part A, which will be called VP-102 Regimen 1 and Regimen 2.Approximately 90 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to one of four treatment arms (two treatment regimens, each with VP-102 and Placebo). Randomization will be stratified by sex so that neither gender exceeds ~60% of any treatment arm. Two of the treatment arms will be VP-102 Regimen 1 and VP-102 Regimen 2. The other two treatment arms will be placebo (Placebo Regimen 1 and Placebo Regimen 2), with corresponding durations of skin exposure matching those selected for VP-102 Regimen 1 and Regimen 2.</intervention_model_description>
