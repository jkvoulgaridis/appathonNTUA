      To develop an audiovisual decision aid (AVDA) to improve the informed consent process. The
      investigators aim to examine the impact of a comprehensible AVDA that is written below the
      8th grade reading level. The AVDA would be used for surgical consent compared to traditional
      verbal consent. Additionally, the investigators plan to determine whether this effect varies
      across the measured levels of health literacy of our patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To address the limitations of consent, interventions have been developed to improve the
      quality of information provided to patients including written pamphlets, videos, and
      websites. Such interventions have been called decision aids. Decision aids may promote
      informed consent through greater knowledge and consistency of personal values or attitudes
      with an enacted choice. Providing adequate information increases satisfaction, more rapid
      symptom resolution, reduced emotional distress, reduced use of analgesia, and possibly
      shorter hospital admissions. Cochrane reviews have established that audiovisual decision aids
      enhance informed surgical consent, yet little data exists about the benefits of such aids in
      Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS)4.

    <intervention_model_description>the proposed study is to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in surgical preparedness between women who receive a standard surgical consent for pelvic reconstructive surgery (control) and those who receive a standard surgical consent that is enhanced with an audiovisual decision aid (treatment) for the same surgery. Equivalently, the null hypothesis is that the odds ratio is 1.00.</intervention_model_description>

This item is asked on day of consent and patients respond using a six-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree).</description>
