  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A case series of patient having mucoepidermoid carcinoma, had standard treatment protocol and
      surgeries and followup was performed and the patient postoperative quality of life and
      recurrent rate was recorded
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This case series presents mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Palatal mass was resected with safety
      margin then immediate opturator inserted; superficial parotidectomy was also done for parotid
      lesion sparing facial nerve. Post-operative radiotherapy was recommended by pathologist due
      to evident perineural spread. The patient is tumor free after one year follow-up.

      Clinical reports about synchronous multiple salivary tumors are very rare, consequently there
      is little known about its management and clinical presentation. Presence of one or more risk
      factor should favor expectation of multiple tumors and mandate examination of all salivary
      tissues. Each tumor should be diagnosed and treated separately according to its nature and
      extension.
