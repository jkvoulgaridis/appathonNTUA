  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, 2 part, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), randomized, placebo-controlled,
      FTIH study in a combined single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) attributes of GSK3732394 in healthy subjects. The
      data gathered in this study will further enable clinical development of GSK3732394 in
      HIV-infected subjects. Approximately 72 healthy subjects will be randomized in the study.
      Part 1 will be designed as a single ascending dose (SAD) and Part 2 as multiple ascending
      dose (MAD). Each subject in the SAD cohort will receive a single dose of blinded GSK3732394
      or blinded placebo (PBO) in 6:2 ratio. Part 1 will consist of five ascending single-dose
      cohorts with an additional expansion cohort included as required. Part 2 will consist of up
      to three ascending repeat-dose cohorts (MAD Cohorts 1, 2, and 3), randomized to four weekly
      doses of GSK3732394: PBO in 6:2 ratio on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

    <intervention_model_description>In Part 1 of the study each of the subjects in the SAD cohorts (SAD Cohorts 1-5; SAD Cohort 6 is a possible expansion cohort that will be added as needed) will receive a single dose of blinded GSK3732394 or blinded PBO (GSK3732394: PBO = 6:2), per their randomization assignment. Part 2 will consist of up to three ascending repeat-dose cohorts (MAD Cohorts 1, 2, and 3), each with 8 subjects (GSK3732394: PBO = 6:2) will receive four weekly doses of GSK3732394 or PBO on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22.</intervention_model_description>

The blind may be broken if, in the opinion of the investigator, it is in the subject's best interest for the investigator to know the study treatment assignment.</masking_description>
