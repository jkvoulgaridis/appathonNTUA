  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a peptide of 28 amino acid residues that belongs to
      the glucagon/secretin superfamily of peptides. It is produced in different regions of the
      nervous system, including the brain, trigeminovascular system and several autonomic nerves.
      Once released from neurons, it acts on vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1 (VPAC1),
      vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (VPAC2) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
      polypeptide type I receptor (PAC1), by mediating smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilation and
      water secretion. Along with other neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide
      (CGRP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), it is released from
      the trigeminal afferents and exerts a strong vasodilating activity on the cranial
      vasculature, sharing the activation of adenylate cyclase. Especially, it shares 70% structure
      with PACAP and acts on the same receptors. But, unlike it, VIP cannot induce a long-lasting
      vasodilation and has a modest capability to induce migraine attacks. Whether a long-lasting
      infusion of VIP may induce a prolonged vasodilation in the cerebral vessels and migraine, as
      a twenty-minute infusion of PACAP, is unknown.

    <description>12 healthy volunteers of both genders will be included in the main study. Participants will meet twice, with at least one week in between. The main study is a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial among placebo (sterile saline, non-active substance) and VIP. Intravenous infusion of VIP / placebo (saline) will be conducted over 120 minutes. Patients will be asked after each trial day to record headache strength, accompanying symptoms, and drug use for up to 24 post-infusion.</description>
