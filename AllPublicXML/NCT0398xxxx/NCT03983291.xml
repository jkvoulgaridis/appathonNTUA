      This study investigates if a physiotherapeutic exercise program designed to relax facial
      muscles associated with the expression of negative emotions and to activate and strengthen
      facial muscles associated with the expression of positive emotions can reduce the symptoms of
      depression and improve wellbeing and quality of life in the affected patients.

      Activity of the facial musculature expresses emotions, but also generates proprioceptive
      signals to the emotional brain that maintain and reinforce the expressed emotions. This has
      been described by Charles Darwin and William James in the facial feedback hypothesis.

      Studies have shown that interruption of facial feedback by the injection of botulinum toxin
      into the corrugator and procerus muscles, which express negative emotions like sadness,
      anger, and fear, can reduce the symptoms of depression.

      In the present study we investigate, if similar effects can be achieved by a relaxing massage
      of these and other muscles that are associated with the expression of negative emotions and
      if strengthening exercises of muscles that express positive emotions, the zygomaticus and
      orbicularis oculi muscles, can contribute to the rehabilitation of positive emotionality in
      depression. After instruction by a physiotherapist, participants will practice the exercises
      daily for 15 minutes.
