  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this evaluation is to document the incidence of post procedure DW-MRI lesions
      (relative to baseline) in patients treated with the transcarotid artery revascularization
      (TCAR) procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center evaluation of patients requiring carotid
      revascularization who are treated with the FDA-cleared ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS in
      conjunction with the FDA-approved ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System. Both the ENROUTE
      Transcarotid NPS and ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System have received CE mark and are
      commercially available in the European Union.

      Patients enrolled in this study will have been offered the TCAR intervention as part of
      standard of care for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis, regardless of whether or not
      they agree to be in the study. Therefore, the act of participation in this procedure will not
      be the determining factor in whether or not the patient receives the TCAR treatment. Subject
      participation means they agree to undergo two additional DW-MRI imaging procedures
      immediately after the procedure and at 30 days to determine whether there is an increase in
      new white lesions. Any other procedure other than the active collection of consent and data
      by the sponsor is standard of care for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis.

      These patients will be monitored to document the incidence of post procedure DW-MRI lesions
      (relative to baseline).
