  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients are often accompanied by infertility. Non-obese
      PCOS infertility is more difficult to treat than obese PCOS. The study included non-obese
      PCOS patients who had not recovered from regular menstruation after six months of metformin
      treatment. Half of the patients were treated with clomiphene for ovulation induction and half
      with GnRH pulse therapy.

      To investigate whether GnRH pulse therapy of non-obese PCOS women can improve ovulation
      rate.The investigators plan to recruit non-obese PCOS women with abnormal GnRH pulse mode not
      effective of metformin treatment at childbearing age. By using GnRH pulse therapy and
      Clomiphene therapy. the investigators will intervent the participants for 3 months and to
      compare outcome in each group.
