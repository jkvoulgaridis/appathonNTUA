  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of preventive Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) for reducing the
      incidence of WHO's grade 3-4 oral mucositis in children and young adults receiving
      chemotherapy regimens associated with a high rate ofmucositis: conventional chemotherapy or
      High Dose Chemotherapy (HDC) conditioning regimens with Hematological Stem Cell
      Transplantation (HSCT).
