  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is widely used for lower extremity surgery, and sedation is often required
      during surgery. For sedation, propofol, midazolam and dexmedetomidine are frequently used.
      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha 2 receptor agonist, and has sedating and
      analgesic effect. Compared with propofol and midazolam, it has little or no respiratory
      inhibition and hemodynamically stable. It also has the effect of reducing delirium in the
      elderly. Dexmedetomidine has also been reported to prolong the duration of sensory and motor
      blockade effects of spinal anesthesia. However, several studies have reported that
      administration of dexmedetomidine in spinal anesthesia increases the incidence of
      bradycardia.

      In a study of healthy young adults, concurrent administration of atropine with
      dexmedetomidine in spinal anesthesia significantly reduced the frequency of bradycardia
      requiring treatment. However, in elderly patients, it is often reported that there is little
      response to atropine in bradycardia, and ephedrine is more effective in treating bradycardia
      than atropine in the elderly.

      The investigators therefore compared ephedrine and atropine as pretreatment to reduce the
      incidence of bradycardia when using dexmedetomidine as a sedative in elderly patients
      undergoing spinal anesthesia.
