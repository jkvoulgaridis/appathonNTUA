      The aim of this retrospective study is to assess extension apparatus function of the knee
      based on clinical, radiological, isokinetic and gait analysis data in patients after surgical
      treatment. There will be used physical examination, Lysholm-Tegner and Kujala scale for
      clinical assessment. Merchant and lateral X-ray pictures will be analysed for patellar
      position verification along with isokinetic and gait evaluation to produce conclusions
      referring to efficacy of the treatment. All subjects included in the study were treated with
      mpfl reconstruction. Follow-up longer than 2 years in all cases, about 45 patients included.

    <textblock>
      Recurrent patellar dislocation occurs mostly in adolescents. Recently medial patellofemoral
      ligament reconstruction has become treatment of choice in most cases. There is still
      insufficient literature to assess the operative treatment results according to functional
      testing.

      mpfl reconstruction with gracilis tendon harvesting. Follow-up provided is longer than 2
      years in all 45 cases planned to enroll. All subject are to be mailed and invited to check-up
      visit including analysis of parameters mentioned above. Soon after data collection text of
      the publication will be made. The results will be discussed with recent literature and
      conclusions will be made.
