  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind multicenter Phase III study for evaluating the efficacy
      and safety of pyrotinib in women with early stage high-risk breast cancer after adjuvant
      trastuzumab. The main purpose of this study is to investigate whether pyrotinib can further
      reduce the risk of recurrence from previously diagnosed HER-2 positive breast cancer after
      adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab.
