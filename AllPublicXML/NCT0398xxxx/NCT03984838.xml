  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG), a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 integrase inhibitor (INI), and
      Rilpivirine (RPV), a non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), are each
      approved in the United States (US), European Union, and other countries for the treatment of
      HIV-1 infection. JULUCA is a combination of Dolutegravir and Rilpivirine indicated for the
      treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral (ARV) experienced adult subjects who are
      switching from their current antiretroviral treatment to the 2-drug combination. Although,
      the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of DTG/RPV (50 milligram [mg]/25mg)
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets have been extensively studied, these parameters have not
      been assessed exclusively in Japanese subjects. This study will evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a single dose DTG/RPV 50 mg/25 mg FDC in a
      healthy adult Japanese population to support a post-approval commitment for DTG/RPV 50 mg/25
      mg FDC in Japan.

             (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or manually over-read. The specific
             formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
             individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other
