  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic drug monitoring of antiinfectives in intensive care patients is an usual research
      topic of the last years. Based on research result, which have shown subtherapeutic plasma
      concentrations of antibiotics, a routines therapeutic drug monitoring for
      Î²-lactam-antibiotics was implemented in January 2018 at Clinic for Anesthesiology at
      University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany. This study is an prospective evaluation of these
      TDM-program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial infections are associated with high mortality in intensive care patients.
      Antibiotic therapy is the only causal opportunity to treat those infections. Pharmacokinetic
      and -dynamic changes in critically ill patients lead to unpredictable plasma concentrations
      of the applied drugs. Research results of the last years with many quantified plasma
      concentrations in subtherapeutic levels yield to the recommendation of the
      Paul-Ehrlich-Society for an routines therapeutic drug monitoring of antibiotics in intensive
      care patients. These was implemented in January 2018 at Clinic for Anesthesiology at
      University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany for all intensive care patients as a routines
      procedure. The introduced study is a prospective evaluation of the TDM-program with regard to
      improvement opportunity, influencing factors and parallels to other studies.
