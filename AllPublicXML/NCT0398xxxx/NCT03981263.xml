  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in surgical techniques, approximately 30% of mastectomies are still
      performed. Definitively or temporarily, one of the alternatives to restore a volume in the
      bra is the external breast prosthesis. The main objective is to evaluate whether the
      &quot;custom-made&quot; MEAVANTI prosthesis improves the quality of life of patients who have had a
      mastectomy compared to the external standard prosthesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, breast cancer is a public health issue with around 59,000 new cases per year.
      Despite improved surgical techniques, there is still around 30% mastectomy performed every
      year. Definitively or temporarily, one of the alternatives to restore a volume in the bra is
      the use of external breast prosthesis. Currently, there are 3 silicone brands that are
      marketed and refunded. These standard prostheses take into account only the curve of the
      patients and not the weight of the remaining breast making adaptation difficult to all body
      types. The difference in breast weights can cause several disorders: postural, pain,
      discomfort, psychological impact on quality of life as well as medico-economic impact.
      MEAVANTI is an external breast prosthesis for custom calibration and personalization, which
      can prevent postural compensation and provide greater comfort.

      The main objective of this study is therefore to evaluate whether the MEAVANTI prosthesis
      improves the quality of life of patients who have undergone a mastectomy compared to the
      standard prosthesis (through the EORTC questionnaires - European Organization for Research
      and Treatment of Cancer). This study will be monocentric, cross-over (2 periods),
      prospective, open with a wash-out period of 15 days. The period of the study will be
      conducted over 13 months.

      The expected benefits can be major. The main benefit expected is the improvement of quality
      of life of the patients carrying the MEAVANTI breast prosthesis compared to those carrying
      the so-called standard prosthesis. A reduction in back and neck pain could also reduce the
      costs of patient management. In addition, this will demand referencing by the HAS of the
      custom-made prosthesis so that it is reimbursed in the same way as existing ones.

    <description>The experimental prosthesis is the MEAVANTI prosthesis (&quot;custom-made&quot; non-adherent prosthesis in silicone) which can be calibrated to 5 grams near the breast that remains after a mastectomy to create a visual symmetry but also a weight symmetry.
This prosthesis takes into account the curve of the breasts and the morphological details such as: skin color of the patients, size of the nipples, height of the nipples, shape of the breast.
The measurements of the patients will be taken using a 3D scanner (i.e. a scanner that corresponds to a 3d scanning and acquiring device (images), not irradiating), a scale and a colour chart.</description>
