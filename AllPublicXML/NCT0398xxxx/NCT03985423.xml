  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, life-threatening condition characterized
      by uncontrolled hyperinflammation which may develop on the background of several clinical
      conditions (e.g. autoimmune disease, infection, malignancy). Emapalumab (previously referred
      to as NI-0501) is a monoclonal antibody neutralizing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a key
      cytokine driving the inflammation and tissue damage seen in HLH. The purpose of this study is
      to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of emapalumab in adult patients with HLH.

      Study NI-0501-10 is an open-label, single arm, multicenter, Phase 2/3 interventional study.

      The study enrolls adult patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), specifically
      newly diagnosed patients with malignancy-associated HLH (M-HLH), and newly diagnosed or
      previously treated patients with non-malignancy-associated HLH.

          -  Fulfilment of 5 of the 8 HLH-2004 clinical criteria

          -  Patients diagnosed with malignancy-associated HLH must be treatment naïve; patients
             diagnosed with HLH driven by any other etiology or idiopathic can be either treatment
             naïve or treatment experienced

          -  Patients with non-malignancy-associated or idiopathic HLH who have already received
             conventional therapy for HLH must have failed prior treatment as per the treating
             physician`s judgement

          -  Informed consent signed by the patient or by the patient's legally authorized
             representative(s) (as required by local law)

          -  Current or scheduled administration of PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 inhibitors

          -  Life-expectancy associated with the underlying disease (triggering HLH) &lt; 3 months

          -  Ongoing participation in an investigational trial, or administration of any
             investigational treatment within 30 days

          -  History of hypersensitivity or allergy to any components of emapalumab

          -  Active mycobacteria, Histoplasma capsulatum, or Leishmania infections

          -  Receipt of a bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine within 12 weeks prior to Screening
