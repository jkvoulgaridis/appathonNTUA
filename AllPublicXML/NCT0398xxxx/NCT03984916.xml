  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The flavonoid hesperidin is present abundantly in citrus fruits and citrus juices. The
      results of numerous studies suggest that hesperidin perform several beneficial effects on
      health, including antitumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic and
      hypoglycemic effects as well as decreasing blood pressure.

      There are two isomers of hesperidin, -S and -R, being the predominant form in nature the
      isomer -S. However, currently commercialized hesperidin consists of a mixture of both isomers
      due to the extraction process of the hesperidin from natural sources.

      The presence of the rutin disaccharide conjugated to the hesperidin molecule is responsible
      that most of the ingested hesperidin is metabolized by bacteria in the colon through the
      enzymatic activity α-rhamnosidase, being this enzymatic activity the limiting step of the
      hydrolysis and absorption of hesperidin. It has been suggested that the low levels of this
      enzymatic activity in the gut microbiota is the cause of the low bioavailability of
      hesperidin and also, at least in part , of the high interindividual variability that exists
      in the absorption of this compound.

      The micronization process in order to decrease the size of the hesperidin particles is
      presented as a way to increase the bioavailability of hesperidin. Another way to increase the
      absorption of hesperidin that is proposed in this study is to increase the proportion of the
      isomer -S in the extracts of hesperidin, since being the isomer that mostly occurs in nature,
      the gut microbiota will have a greater capacity of metabolism for this isomer.

      On this basis the present hypothesis is posed: the administration of hesperidin formed mainly
      by the isomer -S and micronized, will present greater bioavailability than hesperidin formed
      by a mixture of the isomers -S and -R. In turn, the bioavailability of the hesperidin formed
      mainly by the isomer -S and micronized will present greater bioavailability than the mixture
      of the isomers -S and -R and micronized.

      The main objective of this study was to quantify the bioavailability of three extracts of
      hesperidin:

        -  Hesperidin extract with a mixture of the isomers -S and -R.

        -  Hesperidin extract with a mixture of the isomers -S and -R micronized.

        -  Hesperidin extract with the isomer -S micronized.

      It will be conducted a post-prandial, randomized, crossover, and double-blind nutritional
      intervention study.

      In a first phase, it will be done a pre-selection process with 30 male and female volunteers
      over 18 years of age. It will be determined hesperidin excreted levels in urine after the
      consumption of 500 mL of a homogeneous orange juice among all the participants. Sixteen
      participants will be selected preferably with an intermediate capacity of hesperidin
      absorption. The aim of this first phase is to obtain a lower variability in the results in
      the second phase of the study. Of the sixteen participants, six participants will start the
      study with the consumption of a hesperidin extract, five with the consumption of the second
      hesperidin extract and five with the consumption of the third hesperidin extract for, after
      one week washing period, exchange the hesperidin extracts between the three study groups, and
      finally repeat the exchange of hesperidin extracts after another week of washing period so
      that, in the total of the study, each participant had consumed the three hesperidin extracts.

      Participants will consume two capsules with 250 mg of extract each, being the total orange
      extract consumed 500 mg, with 450 mg of hesperidin (90%) and the rest (10%) substances coming
      from the orange in the process of extracting hesperidin.

      During the study there will be 5 visits, one selection (V0), one pre-inclusion (V-1) and 3
      study visits (V1, V2 and V3).
