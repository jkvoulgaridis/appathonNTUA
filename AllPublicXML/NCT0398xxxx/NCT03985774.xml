      The goal of this study is to evaluate the incidence of post procedure DW-MRI lesions
      (relative to baseline) and debris captured in the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS inline filter
      during a transcarotid stenting procedure.

      The ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS has received CE Mark and is commercially available in the
      European Union. The ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS may be used in conjunction with carotid artery
      stent approved for revascularization in patients with carotid disease in the context of this
      study.

      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial of the ENROUTE Transcarotid
      NPS in conjunction with all commercially approved carotid artery stents used for
      revascularization in patients with carotid disease.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the incidence of post procedure DW-MRI lesions
      (relative to baseline) and debris captured in the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS inline filter
      during a transcarotid stenting procedure.

      A patient is considered enrolled after:

        1. meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria,

        2. the transcarotid arterial sheath has entered into the patient's vasculature. Insertion
           of the venous sheath does not qualify a patient as enrolled.

      Patients who are screened but do not meet all study criteria are considered screen failures
      and may not be enrolled. Patients in whom an arterial sheath is placed but who do not meet
      all study entry criteria are considered enrolled.

      The Investigator is responsible for maintaining any information pertaining to the Ethics
      Committee review and approval as required by local law.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is symptomatic and has a history of stroke (minor or non-disabling), TIA
             and/or amaurosis fugax within 60 days of the procedure.

          -  Target vessel must meet diameter requirements for stent (refer to selected stent IFU
             for diameter requirements).
