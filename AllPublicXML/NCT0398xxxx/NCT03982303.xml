  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was a single-center, open-label, dose-increasing Phase I clinical study with
      subjects enrolled in patients with advanced solid tumors who failed standard treatment or who
      were unable to receive effective treatment. The trial is divided into two stages: dose
      escalation and dose extension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation:

      A total of 7 dosage groups were set at this stage, which were 5 mg/m2, 10 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2, 40
      mg/m2, 60 mg/m2, 90 mg/m2, and 120 mg/m2, respectively. Accelerated dosage titration was
      performed in the first 3 dose groups, 1 subject was enrolled in each group; the last 4 dose
      groups were perfromed into dosage groups by the principle of &quot;3+3&quot; dose increment rule, and
      the number of subjects enrolled in each group is 3 to 6 cases.

      Dose extension:

      According to the test results of the dose escalation phase, two extensions of MTD (tentative
      60 mg/m2, 90 mg/m2) were selected for the expansion trial. Each dose level was planned to
      enroll 6 subjects (12 in total), subjects were administered once every 3 weeks (1 treatment
      cycle every 3 weeks), and received 4 treatment cycles in a row for Hemay102. Safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and initial anti-tumor efficacy were
      evaluated.
