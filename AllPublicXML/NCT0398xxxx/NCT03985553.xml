  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project was to develop and pilot test a self-management program targeted
      toward individuals with Spinal Cord Injury/Disease (SCI/D) who are current parents or who are
      considering becoming parents. This Parenting Self-Management Program (PSMP) will allow
      parents to identify their goals for successful family participation and provide a structure
      for professionals to use when working with parents with SCI/D to best meet their needs. A
      draft PSMP was assembled by members of the research team. This draft was reviewed by
      experienced parents with SCI/D and professionals who work with individuals who have SCI/D
      through key informant interviews or focus groups. The feedback was used to modify the draft
      program and the PSMP was pilot tested with a group of 10 individuals with SCI/D who are new
      parents, newly injured or who want to improve their participation in parenting activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project used a self-management approach grounded in self-efficacy theory to increase
      parenting self-efficacy among persons with spinal cord injury/disease (SCI/D). Program
      content focused on skill building through opportunities to master techniques and strategies;
      role modeling, problem solving, decision making, goal setting, and provision of reliable
      information. The use of a self-management program may also place parents with SCI/D at ease
      in sharing needs, as it is not an expert model by which a professional is passing judgment on
      their ability to care for their children. Many parents with disabilities are hesitant to seek
      professional services for fear of negative consequences such as losing custody of their
      children. Developing a program that is conducted as a partnership whereby parents direct much
      of the pace and content may be considered less threatening and more beneficial to those who
      have experienced distrust of the healthcare system.

      There are no other self-management programs that specifically address the needs of parents
      with SCI/D. The project created a self-management program that was piloted in the St. Louis
      region and can be replicated across the country among other communities. While the national
      coordination center for families with disabilities, Through the Looking Glass, provides
      resource materials to parents across the country, they do not provide a structure for
      individual problem solving and to meet the needs of parents SCI/D on an individualized level.
      Providing a format for parents with SCI/D to successfully fulfill their parenting roles has a
      highly significant social implication; parents will be equipped to meet potential challenges
      and enjoy participation in their families. Limiting discrimination in the courts, seeking
      school accessibility, or simply decreasing pain while holding an infant are all worthy goals
      that could be achieved through a self-management parenting program.

      Project Aims

        1. To develop a four-week self-management program for parents with SCI/D to meet their
           needs in the parenting role and the needs of their families

        2. To aid parents with SCI/D in building the skills and resources needed to continue or
           begin parenting in a successful manner

        3. To disseminate the PSMP content to other regions, disability organizations, Paralyzed
           Veterans of America (PVA) chapters, healthcare organizations, and parenting groups to be
           replicated

        4. To build a sustainable format for meeting the needs of parents with SCI/D that can be
           replicated and continued across the U.S.

    <intervention_model_description>Parents/grandparents/potential parents with SCI/D had the opportunity to attend and participate in a 4 week self-management program once a week related to parenting with a disability. The self-management sessions lasted approximately 2 hours once a week and were led by an occupational therapist. There was no control group or alternate intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in participation using the Participation Survey- Mobility (PARTS-M)</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to first session of the PSMP group and 4 weeks after the initial session of the PSMP group.</time_frame>
    <description>The PARTS/M is a reliable and valid self-report survey that assesses the participation of people with mobility limitations in various life activities and the impact of common environmental factors on participation (Gray, Hollingsworth, Stark, &amp; Morgan, 2006). For the purposes of the PSMP, a modified version of the Parenting section of the PARTS/M was used. Participants were asked how often they participate in parenting activities, their evaluation of their participation (importance, choice, satisfaction, and control), the number and value of supports they may use, and the influence of pain and fatigue on their participation in parenting activities.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-efficacy using the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to first session of the PSMP group and 4 weeks after the initial session of the PSMP group.</time_frame>
    <description>The GSE was used to determine any influence of the program on participants' self-efficacy. Total score ranges from 10-40 with higher values indicating better outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants were provided a Parenting Self -Management Program booklet with the twenty-four fact sheets at the beginning of the four-week program on topics such as adaptive babycare techniques, advocacy in the courts, emergency planning, safety in the community, talking to children about disability, managing pain/fatigue, connecting to other parents with SCI/D, and wheelchair adjustment/management during and after pregnancy. Sessions included topic introduction, participant interaction, goal setting, resource utilization, and program evaluation. Participants were allowed to choose which resources they wanted and what tips to incorporate into their parenting roles. Participants were asked to develop a weekly goal to encourage achievement, allowing individuals to identify what they wanted or decided to do that could be related to parenting directly or indirectly, such as health and wellness goals that gave them more energy or strength to complete parenting tasks.</description>
