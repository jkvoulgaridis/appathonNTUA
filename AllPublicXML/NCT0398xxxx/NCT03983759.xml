  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy. Currently, there is no effective
      regimen for patients after the progression offirst-line chemotherapy. The prognosis of
      patients with extensive disease is very poor, and the improved therapeutic efficacy is
      urgently needed. Most patients with small cell lung cancer have a long history of smoking,
      and the tumor mutation burden is relatively high, which provides potential for immunological
      checkpoint inhibitors represented by PD-1 antibodies. A number of studies have shown that
      chemotherapy combined with adoptive cellular immunotherapy could prolong the survival of
      patients. This study is a clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of maintenance
      therapy with sintilimab after 4-6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy combined with adoptive
      cellular immunotherapy in patients with advanced small cell lung cancer.
