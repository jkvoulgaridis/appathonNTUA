  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, non-interventional, monocentric study aiming to collect standard
      of care imaging of patients treated with Iodine-131 for the determination of dosimetric
      studies.

      Data from this study will be collected as part of an European research project called
      MEDIRAD.

      The overall objectives of this project are to enhance the scientific bases and clinical
      practice of radiation protection in the medical field, and more specifically to develop and
      implement the tools necessary to establish the range of absorbed doses delivered to healthy
      organs in patients undergoing thyroid ablation and the threshold absorbed dose required for
      thyroid ablation. This will enable patient specific treatment planning that will minimize
      risk to the patient while ensuring a successful outcome and will facilitate development of a
      large scale epidemiological study of the effect of low absorbed doses from irradiation of
      normal organs with internal sources of radionuclides.

      Patients will be followed as part of their standard of care. Imaging (SPECT/CT (Single Photon
      Emission Computed Tomography-Computerized Tomography) and Whole Body scintigraphy) performed
      at 48 hours post Iodine-131 treatment will be collected. Measures of external gamma radiation
      will also be collected in the European database.
