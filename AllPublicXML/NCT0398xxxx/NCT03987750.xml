  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled study, in participants with PD who are on a stable regimen of dopaminergic
      medication and have at least mild levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Eligible participants will be
      randomized to one of three treatment groups to receive adjunctive daily treatment with either
      safinamide 100 mg, safinamide 150 mg or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Outcome will be assessed
      after 26 weeks of treatment.

      Trial participation will be up to a maximum duration of 32 weeks and will comprise:

        -  Screening period (up to 4 weeks) for screening assessments;

        -  Two weeks titration period: participants randomized to the 100 mg study arm will receive
           100 mg during Week 1 and throughout the rest of the study; participants randomized to
           the 150 mg study arm will receive 100 mg during Weeks 1 and 2 , and 150 mg from Week 3
           and throughout the rest of the study; participants randomized to the placebo arm will
           receive identical placebo tablets.

        -  Twenty-four weeks maintenance period during which patients receive their randomized
           treatment as an adjunct to their standard anti-PD medications, which should remain
           unaltered. End of treatment evaluations will be performed at the end of Week 26 or at
           early discontinuation

        -  A telephone follow-up call will be performed 2 weeks after the end of treatment to
           assess adverse events and concomitant medications
