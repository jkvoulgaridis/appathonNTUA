      This phase II trial studies how well binimetinib and palbociclib work compared to TAS-102 in
      treating patients with KRAS and NRAS mutation positive colorectal cancer that has spread to
      other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Binimetinib and palbociclib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as TAS-102, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving binimetinib and palbociclib may work better compared to TAS-102 alone in
      treating patients with colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) between those
      randomized to palbociclib/binimetinib and those randomized to trifluridine and tipiracil
      hydrochloride (TAS-102) in patients with refractory KRAS- or NRAS-mutant metastatic
      colorectal cancer (CRC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the overall response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria between those randomized to palbociclib/binimetinib and those
      randomized to TAS-102 in patients with refractory KRAS- or NRAS-mutant metastatic CRC.

      II. To compare the overall survival (OS) between those randomized to palbociclib/binimetinib
      and those randomized to TAS-102 in patients with refractory KRAS- or NRAS-mutant metastatic
      CRC.

      III. To determine the safety and tolerability of the recommended phase II dose of palbociclib
      in combination with binimetinib in patients with refractory KRAS- or NRAS-mutant metastatic
      CRC.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tumor mutational profiles that characterize groups of patients that
      predict for response or resistance to combination of palbociclib/binimetinib.

      II. To determine the correlation between circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and
      tumor response or resistance to therapy with palbociclib/binimetinib or TAS-102.

      III. To determine the association between Consensus Molecular Subtype based on gene
      expression profiling and response or resistance to combination of palbociclib/binimetinib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and
      palbociclib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride PO BID on days 1-5 and 8-12.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression may optionally crossover to Arm A.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30-37 days and then
      every 12 weeks for up to 24 months.

    <description>Disease progression will be determined based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and will be documented at each enrolling site with no central review planned. PFS will be compared between treatment arms using the stratified log rank test at one-sided level 0.05. Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the median PFS for each treatment arm, and Kaplan-Meier curves will be produced.</description>

    <description>Assessment of response data will be performed on the basis of definitions of responses according to RECIST version (v)1.1. Objective response is defined as a complete or partial response by RECIST v1.1. This will be reported as a proportion with a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion.</description>

          -  Any other co-morbid, systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in

                  allowed

          -  CROSSOVER EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Pregnant or nursing (lactating women), where pregnancy
             is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of

                  ligation &gt;= 42 days of re-registration. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone
                  level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential

          -  CROSSOVER EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Sexually active males

                  or CT) demonstrating no current evidence of progressive brain metastases at
                  re-registration

          -  CROSSOVER EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Impaired cardiovascular function or clinically
             significant cardiac diseases, including any of the following:

                  paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
