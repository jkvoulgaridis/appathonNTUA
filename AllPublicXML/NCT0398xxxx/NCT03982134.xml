  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find the dose of the study drug PDR001 that, when
      given in combination with the drug Panobinostat, results in the best outcomes for metastatic
      melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, non-randomized Phase Ib study combining PDR001 with HDAC inhibitor
      Panobinostat in patients with metastatic melanoma and NSCLC who have failed prior Anti PD1 or
      PD-L1 therapy.

      The primary purpose of this study is to find the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of
      Panobinostat in combination with PDR001. Standard 3+3 design will be used for dose escalation
      or de-escalation. Depending upon tolerability and dosing, the total number of participants
      may vary from 9-24. Initially patients will start from dose level '0' and there will be 1
      dose escalation level '1' and two de-escalation levels ('-1' and '-2'). The maximum number in
      each dose level will be 6.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 150 days after the last dose of PDR001. Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient.

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had over 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile age appropriate (e.g. generally 40-59 years), history of
                  vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flushes) in the absence of other medical
                  justification or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In
                  the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman
                  has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
                  child bearing potential.

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
             study treatment and for 150 days after stopping study treatment and should not father
             a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as
             well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the
             drug via seminal fluid.

          -  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (Carbamazepine, Modafinil, Rifampin,
             Rifabutin, Rifapentin, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital and St. John's wort) or strong
             inhibitors like Cimetidine, Grapefruit juice and Seville oranges as mentioned in
             appendix E. If patient can come off of these drugs and receive an alternative therapy
             then they will be eligible as far as time equals 4 half-lives of that medication has
             elapsed prior to starting protocol therapy.
