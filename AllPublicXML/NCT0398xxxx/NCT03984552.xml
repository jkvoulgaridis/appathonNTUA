  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy of the mother and of the newborn associated with alternative schemes
      of breastfeeding can reduce these transmission rates to 1%. The diagnosis of HIV infection in
      newborns is based on PCR for detection of viral genetic material, a procedure that is
      expensive and of complex logistics. Tests based on detection of antibodies are faster and
      cheaper but cannot distinguish infected child or maternal antibodies passed to the fetus
      through the placenta. Nevertheless, the so-called rapid tests have been implemented in the
      network of health services because of their simplicity and performance comparable to
      conventional tests. DPP HIV 1/2 test, produced by Bio-Manguinos/Fiocruz, usage is limited by
      the manufacturer to over 24 months of age children, though the guidelines control programs
      already recommend the use from 18 months in Brazil and 9 months in other countries. Data on
      the accuracy of the rapid test under 24 months of age are scarce. This proposal aims to
      assess the performance of rapid tests produced by Bio-Manguinhos in diagnostic protocols for
      HIV infection in children 9-24 months old, in order to obtain empirical data to support the
      current recommendations on rapid tests, particularly in countries with limited access to
      tests that require specialized laboratories. The validation of rapid HIV testing in other age
      groups is a requirement of the national regulatory authorities, and has important
      implications for programs to control HIV-AIDS in populations from countries with limited
      access to specialized laboratory resources. The use of the rapid test can also represent a
      significant reduction in costs, as it allows limiting the use of molecular tests to complex
      and expensive confirmation cases.

      It concerns a study with a sample composed of children born from HIV positive mothers, age
      between 9 and 24 months old, with confirmed or discarded infection for HIV determined by
      molecular testing. Samples from the volunteers will be subjected to rapid tests and
      serological and molecular reference tests.

      After obtaining consent from the child's guardian,a brief interview will take place with
      completing the questionnaire of inclusion in the research. Then, the collection of fluid in
      the oral cavity as well as the fingerstick puncture will be conducted for the HIV rapid tests
      procedures.

      The results of the rapid tests will be compared with the ones from the molecular testing and
      the concordance will be determined for each age group separately.

      The study has being conducted by four clinical research sites at Brazil, distributed in three
      different states, and a clinical research site at Tanzânia: Instituto Fernandes Figueira (IFF
      - Fiocruz) at Rio de Janeiro; Hospital Geral de Nova Iguaçu (HGNI) at Rio de Janeiro,
      Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) at Amazonas; Secretaria
      de Estado de Saúde Pública do Pará (URES - Materno Infantil - UREMIA) at Pará and National
      Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) at Tanga in Tanzania.

    <intervention_name>This was an observational study of medical devices (rapid tests) used for the HIV diagnosis in children up to 2 years</intervention_name>
    <description>These rapid tests are based on lateral flow immunochromatography technology, in which a nitrocellulose membrane is impregnated with the antigen of interest. The patient sample (blood, serum, plasma, oral fluid, etc.) is applied in this membrane which facilitates the interaction of antibodies in the sample with the antigens on the membrane. This reaction becomes visible to the naked eye thanks to a color developing revelator.
The entire testing process, from sample collection to result reading takes no more than 40 minutes and does not depend on laboratory facilities.</description>

      First, a sample of oral fluid for the RT DPP HIV 1/2 will be harvested.Then, the blood from
      the finger stick will be used to perform RT DPP HIV 1 / 2 ® and rapid imunoblot HIV 1/
      2(IB).The results of the rapid tests will be available in up to 30 minutes and will be
      recorded in specific forms for further analysis of concordance with the molecular results.
      The blood samples and parts of them (serum and plasma) collected in this study will be used
      only for the examinations foreseen in this research project and will be kept under the
      responsibility of the researcher Dr. Luiz Antonio Bastos Camacho in Bio-Manguinhos / Fundação
      Oswaldo Cruz for 10 years.
