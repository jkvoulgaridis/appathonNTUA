  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregiving is demanding and stressful. Caregivers of adults with heart failure (HF)
      report significant stress and poor self-care. Health coaching, a support intervention, may
      relieve stress and promote self-care in HF caregivers. Few studies have tested the
      cost-effectiveness of support interventions for caregivers. Even less is known about the
      effect of caregiver support interventions on HF outcomes. We have developed and pilot tested
      a virtual support intervention (ViCCY (&quot;Vicky&quot;)-Virtual Caregiver Coach for you), that we
      propose to evaluate among HF caregivers. Using randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, we
      will enroll informal HF caregivers with poor self-care (Health Self-Care Neglect scale
      score&gt;=2), randomizing them 1:1 to an intervention or control group. Both groups will receive
      standard care augmented with Health Information (HI) delivered through the Internet, but the
      ViCCY caregiver group will also receive 10 front-loaded coaching support sessions tailored to
      individual issues. The control group will have access to the same HI resources over the same
      interval, using the same Internet program, but without coaching support. At baseline and 3,
      6, 9, and 12 months, we will collect self-reported data on self-care, stress, coping, and
      health status. At 6 months, we will compare ViCCY to HI alone to assess intervention efficacy
      using intent-to-treat analysis. Our pilot data suggest that addition of support provided by
      the health coach will make ViCCY more efficacious than HI alone. A sample of 250 caregivers
      (125/arm) will provide &gt;90% power to detect significant differences between the groups on the
      primary outcome of self-care (Aim 1). We will collect quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and
      health care resource use in caregivers over 12 months to assess cost-effectiveness of ViCCY
      (Aim 2). To explore the effect of caregiver outcomes on HF patients' outcomes
      (hospitalization rates, hospital days, mortality rates, QALYs) over a 12-month period (Aim 3)
      and knowing that not all HF patients will participate, we will consent a subgroup of the HF
      patients cared for by these caregivers (at least 40 dyads). If shown to be efficacious and
      cost-effective, our virtual health coaching intervention can easily scaled to support
      millions of caregivers worldwide. This application addresses the NINR strategic plan and is
      directly responsive to PA-18-150.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, randomizing informal heart failure
      (HF) caregivers meeting our inclusion and exclusion criteria 1:1 to an intervention or
      control group. After collecting baseline data, we will block randomize the caregivers to
      achieve equal distribution of key variables in each condition. We will block randomize on
      caregiver sex (male/female) and relationship to patient (e.g., spouse) - factors shown to
      influence perceived caregiving burden and receptivity to intervention. The randomization
      sequence will be generated a priori by a statistician independent of the study investigators
      using a randomly permuted blocks algorithm to ensure equal distribution of these variables in
      each study arm. The Project Manager will notify the study staff and participants of their
      group assignment (intervention or control) by telephone, email or message, as preferred by
      the individual. Although balance in sample size can be achieved with block randomization, the
      groups may not be fully comparable on other factors. Initial comparison of the groups will
      allow us to control for important covariates in the analyses. Investigators and all staff
      involved in collecting assessment data will be blinded to group assignment until after the
      data are locked. The nurse providing the intervention and the caregiver participants will not
      be blinded. All baseline data will be collected prior to randomizing. Timing of follow-up
      assessments will be based on day of randomization.

      The study intervention will be provided to individual caregivers. All caregivers (both
      groups) will be provided with access to an Internet site with excellent health information
      (HI). In addition, we have developed and pilot tested a virtual support intervention (ViCCY
      [&quot;Vicky&quot;] - Virtual Caregiver Coach for You), that we will provide on tablet devices to
      caregivers in the intervention group. We will provide tablets to all the caregivers, assuring
      that they have wireless network access so they can access the Internet site providing HI
      content. Caregivers in the control group will receive only HI but caregivers in the
      intervention group will receive 10 front-loaded sessions of ViCCY over 6 months.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study is based on the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping. Stressful experiences such as caregiving demand - circumstances that give rise to real or perceived stress - are construed as person-environment transactions. Primary appraisal of demand involves assessment of its significance, which results in perceived burden. Secondary appraisal involves assessment of the resources available to cope with it. These appraisals lead to the coping effort. Without successful coping, self-care is poor, which decreases health status in caregivers. The virtual support intervention [ViCCY (&quot;Vicky&quot;) - Virtual Caregiver Coach for You] addresses both appraisal and coping.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale, a 14-item instrument that provides a global rating of an individual's belief in the severity and frequency of stressful experiences during the last month. The Perceived Stress Scale includes 14 items designed to assess symptoms of stress and global measures of the degree of stress experienced in the past month. Each item is scored from 0 (never) to 4 (very often), with total sum scores ranging from 0 to 56; higher scores indicate higher perceived stress. Cronbachs alpha of the scale ranges from 0.84 to 0.86, and was 0.91 for older African American and European American females.</description>

    <description>This 42-item questionnaire measures the use of five different coping styles: avoidance, problem-focused, seeking social support, self-blame, and wishful thinking. The original scale has been used widely since developed by Lazarus in 1985. The short version (30 items) uses a 4-point Likert-scale response format (0 = not used to 3 = used a great deal). Scores range from 0-90 with higher scores indicating greater coping. It is reliable (alpha 0.95) and has construct validity. This instrument has been used numerous times in studies with older adult caregivers.</description>

Each component score is standardized a 0-100 point scale. Reliability is varied samples is typically 0.80. Convergent and divergent validity have been demonstrated in various populations, including caregivers. A benefit of using the SF-36 is that it is one of the common data elements.</description>

    <description>Caregivers randomized to the intervention ViCCY will receive 10 front-loaded sessions of virtual health coaching by trained registered nurses over 6 months with content based on the theoretical framework (based on the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping) and prior research. Sessions are provided using tablets. Initially, sessions are weekly but the frequency decreases over time as needed. We help caregivers gain the knowledge and skills needed to achieve self-identified health goals through self-care using motivational interviewing. We focus on identifying personal values, solving problems, and transforming goals into action. ViCCY is standardized in a treatment manual. Because stress does not affect all people equally, the intervention is tailored to individual appraisals and the factors most likely to influence demand and perceived burden.</description>
