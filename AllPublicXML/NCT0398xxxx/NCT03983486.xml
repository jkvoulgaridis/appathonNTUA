  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pioneer study demonstrated a proof of concept for IS-FISH with the new ISX technology. This
      state of the art technology has been recently acquired by the CHU of Amiens. In the present
      study the investigators want to establish a workflow for simultaneous immunostaining and
      characterization of FISH cytogenetic pathological signals with the imaging flow cytometer
      ISX, such as chromosomic gains, losses and translocations in multiple myeloma (MM). The gold
      standard technology for the detection of prognostic cytogenetic aberrations in MM is a FISH
      analysis after bone marrow (BM) plasma cells sorting (PCS).2,3 In MM, plasma cells isolation
      is usually based on CD38 and/or CD138 expression. Cytogenetic risk stratification is guided
      by the detection of 4 chromosomal aberrations: TP53 and CDKN2C deletions, CKS1B gains and
      t(4;14) translocation. Thanks to ISX technology the investigators may avoid cumbersome task
      of cell sorting (outsourced service for our hospital) meanwhile measuring precisely and
      qualitatively aberrant FISH signals on a large amount of cells.

      In a first time (period of 6 months), the development will be performed on CD38 and/or CD138
      expressing cell lines. Regular FISH protocols will be finely tuned to fit immunophenotyping
      and cells in suspension constraints needed in IS-FISH. In a second time, the protocol will be
      applied to MM BM. Cells from BM aspiration will be processed and analysed on the ISX in
      Amiens. Based on last years local activity, this step is expected to last 2 years, so as to
      be able to obtain 5 samples from patients harbouring of each prototypical cytogenetic
      aberration above described. Inclusions will be guided by the results of PCS conducted before
      the first treatment initiation. Finally the results will be compared with PCS.

Development of the technique of the first period will be made in order to test :
the ability to measure FISH and immunostaining signals simultaneously
the ability to count a number of FISH spots consistent with ploidy (eg 1 X centromeric signal for men, 2 for women).</description>

    <description>Combination of immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and FISH in suspension (IS-FISH) may provide both cytogenetic and phenotypic information for a large number of cells in a single test. In this scope, a recent study demonstrated a proof of concept for IS-FISH to detect non pathological signals with the new ImageStream X technology (ISX).1</description>
