  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-site, interventional, non-comparative, single-arm trial to evaluate the safety of the
      Keeogo™ Dermoskeleton in subjects with hemiparesis due to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke affects thousands of individuals annually, leading to considerable physical impairment
      and functional disability. Gait is one of the most important activities of daily living
      affected in this patient population. Recent technological developments in passively powered
      dermoskeleton can create powerful adjunctive tools for rehabilitation and potentially
      accelerate functional recovery. Here, the investigators present the development and
      evaluation of a lower limb dermoskeleton, namely Keeogo™ (B-Temia), for use in rehabilitation
      institutions to assist individuals with hemiparesis due to stroke who are able to stand and
      initiate a step in performing ambulatory functions.

      Keeogo™ Dermoskeleton is a low-profile, assistive exoskeleton (or 'dermoskeleton') that
      orthotically fits to the lower limbs. Keeogo™ is worn on the user's lower body using a belt
      and contact areas attached around the thighs and calves.

    <description>Clinician and Patient Reported Outcomes (surveys) will be used to assess the effectiveness of the device in assisting gait. The surveys will rate subject performance in walking based on clinician observed deviations and subject perception of mobility limitation due to the stroke.
Device effectiveness will be measured based on statistical analysis of the survey data between conditions (baseline compared to device-use) Ratings by the surveys will be validated using instrumented walkway and image data collected during walking.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>30-Second Chair Stand Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of study completion for each site, estimated 3-5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects sit in the middle of chair and place hands on opposite shoulder crossed at wrists. Keeping feet flat on floor, back straight, arms against chest, subjects rise to full standing position when told &quot;go&quot; followed by sit down, the start position. This movement is repeated for as many times as possible for 30 seconds. Additionally, the test is repeated for a total of 5 cycles with short rest (≤ 90 seconds) between sets.
Patient and Clinician reported outcomes are assessed for this measure via a sit-to-stand-to-sit question on the survey given for the secondary effectiveness endpoint.</description>

    <description>Subjects start with both feet on the bottom landing then ascend and descend a set number of stairs as quickly as possible in a safe manner using a rail only if needed. Time is recorded from ascent through descent.
Patient and Clinician reported outcomes are assessed for this measure via a stair ascent/descent question on the survey given for the secondary effectiveness endpoint.</description>
