  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall, there are an estimated 98,000 children living with HIV in Kenya. Children who are
      initiated on ART in Kenya and other low resource settings face several challenges with
      ongoing care due to current limitations of paediatric HIV treatment services. High quality
      paediatric HIV care requires routine monitoring of clinical and virologic status, support for
      ART adherence, and patient outreach to optimize retention in care.

      The HIV Infant Tracking System (HITSystem) is a web-based, system-level intervention that has
      dramatically improved EID HIV-related outcomes in Kenya, Tanzania, and Malawi.

      The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the impact of HITSystem 3.0 on
      paediatric clinical outcomes, adherence, retention and viral suppression over 12 months among
      children in HIV care. Outcome measurements will be evaluated separately in children aged ≤2
      years and in those aged 3-16 years.

      Primary Outcomes

        1. The proportion of HIV infected children in each arm who are retained in HIV care at 12
           months. Retention will be defined as regular engagement with HIV care, as measured by
           having attended the last three scheduled monthly appointments on time (see section 3.3
           for further description).

        2. The proportion of HIV infected children who are virally suppressed (VL &lt;50) at the end
           of the 12-month follow-up period.

      The proposed trial design is an unblinded CRT with two arms: the HITSystem 3.0 Intervention
      vs. Standard of Care (SOC) as the control. The CRT will be implemented in 20 health
      facilities (10 intervention and 10 control) in Western Nyanza province in Kenya and will
      collect data from HIV-infected children aged ≤16 years. Outcomes will focus on ART retention,
      adherence and viral suppression.

      Outcomes will be assessed among all HIV positive children aged ≤16 years attending the trial
      facilities for HIV care at the start of the trial, or who are diagnosed as HIV positive
      during the first 12 months of the trial. Follow-up data will be collected on each child for
      12 months. Therefore, the total duration of the trial will be for 24 months.

      All HIV-positive children and their caregivers attending health facilities randomised to the
      intervention arm will be monitored by the HITSystem 3.0.

      The study will be conducted in Western Nyanza province, Kenya, which comprises six counties.

    <description>All HIV-positive children and their caregivers attending health facilities randomized to the HITSystem intervention arm will be monitored by the HITSystem. In the event that the child misses an appointment or a scheduled laboratory test, or the child's laboratory results suggest ART treatment failure, an automated SMS text message and alert will be generated in the HITSystem that will notify the child's health care provider. The child's caregiver will also receive a text message asking them to return to the clinic with the child. If the child is 16 years of age and considered an independent adolescent without a caregiver, the same process will be implemented, with the text messages being sent directly to the child. If the child's caregiver, or the independent adolescent, does not have a mobile phone, the health care provider will notify the community health worker (CHW) to trace the individual and visit them in their home.</description>

    <description>The HITSystem 3.0 is a web-based intervention that aims to improve pediatric ART retention and adherence, and viral suppression. The HITSystem 3.0 is accessed online through a computer, using mobile broadband modems that respond to a cellular signal. The primary components include: (1) action alerts to complete time-sensitive interventions; (2) real time communication of HIV PCR results to hospitals to reduce turn-around time; (3) continuous follow-up for timely ART initiation among HIV-infected infants; (4) promotion of retention in EID care via SMS text messaging and/or patient tracing; and (5) an automated and individualized SMS text messaging component to communicate with mothers. The HITSystem has a unique dashboard that proactively monitors time-sensitive interventions along the EID cascade of care, alerting clinics, laboratories and mothers when an intervention has been missed.</description>
