  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular disease and associated with risk of
      rupture, but also with a high cardiovascular (CV) event rate. A key difficulty in AAA is
      predicting these life-threatening complications, highlighting the need to explore the
      potential of novel techniques. Both progression of AAA and CV events are strongly linked to
      vascular health. In 2013, the SMART risk score is developed to calculate the risk of the
      patients for recurrent vascular events based on clinical characteristics. Recently, a novel,
      easy to perform, non-invasive test of endothelial function (the carotid artery reactivity
      (CAR) test), reflecting target organ damage, has recently been introduced. The CAR is a
      simple, quick (5-min), non-invasive test that uses ultrasound to examine the carotid artery
      in response to sympathetic stimulation by placing one hand in cold water. This test shows
      strong agreement with both coronary and aortic responses to sympathetic stimulation and
      predicted CV events in patients with peripheral arterial disease.

      The aim of this prospective 2-year follow-up study is to investigate the predictive capacity
      of the CAR-test in comparison to the SMART risk score for the development of cardiovascular
      events in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm who have not yet reached the treatment
      threshold. This could aid clinical decision making in the need for (surgical) intervention,
      but also alter (drug) treatment to reduce risk of cardiovascular events. Secondary objectives
      are to investigate the predictive capacity of the CAR-test for progression of the abdominal
      aortic aneurysm, and to evaluate QoL scores in patients under surveillance for AAA. The aim
      is to provide insight if these scores can help clinical decision making.

      The investigators will include 167 patients under surveillance for AAA who are all currently
      under the threshold for repair (i.e. AAA diameter 40-50 mm for men and 35-45 mm for women).
      Participants will be recruited from all collaborating hospitals (Radboudumc, Rijnstate, CWZ)
      after providing written informed consent. Additionally, AAA-patients under surveillance of
      general practitioners are eligible (and will be contacted through the hospital-links), since
      the nature of the tests allow for performing all tests at the general practitioners' office.

      In this observational, prospective study, a total of 167 patients under surveillance for an
      AAA, who are currently under threshold for repair (i.e. AAA diameter 40-50 mm for men and
      35-44 mm for women), will be included. Baseline patient characteristics will be registered,
      including traditional risk factors and CV-history. In addition to regular care of measuring
      AAA diameter progression (in mm/year), the investigators will perform the CAR-test (10-min)
      and non-invasive arterial stiffness measures (PWA and PWV with the SphygmoCor device (10-min)
      one time as baseline. Furthermore, the investigators will ask patients to complete a
      questionnaire about the quality of their life (Appendix 1). A second questionnaire tries to
      clarify the disease experience of the patients and can be found in Appendix 2. Both
      questionnaires will be asked to be completed at the start and the end of the study.
      Subsequently, the investigators will record major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)
      according to the International Classification of Disease-10. Registration of MACE will be
      performed using hospital-records and following international guidelines. Across a 2-year
      follow-up, by means of regular follow-up appointments, the investigators will examine AAA
      progression (in mm/year) and the ability of the CAR parameter and arterial stiffness
      parameters to predict CV-events.

    <description>The CAR test will be applied to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. This thermal stimulus is known to elevate blood pressure via sympathetic pathways, so it can be used to study the vascular response to sympathetic activation. The participant will submerge their left hand in a bucket of ice water (approximately 4 degrees celcius) for 3 minutes, which is reported to be sufficient to induce a maximal dilation in the common carotid artery. At baseline and every minute after the hand is submerged in ice water, the blood pressure will be measured to check whether a sympathetic stimulation is achieved.</description>

    <intervention_name>Arterial stiffness</intervention_name>
    <description>The SphygmoCor device will be used to non-invasively measure arterial stiffness parameters using applanation tonometry. For Pulse Wave Analyses (PWA), the radial waveform will be recorded. Approximately 10 waveforms are averaged, resulting in several non-invasive parameters:
Peripheral pressure parameters
Central and abdominal aneurysm pressure parameters (derived using a transfer function)
Cardiac output parameters (SEVR, ED)
Pulse wave velocity will be performed by recording the waveforms of the carotid and femoral artery sequentially. The travelled distance will be measured according to the current guidelines and entered in the program. The program will calculate the PWV based on 10 ECG triggered waveform of each artery.</description>
