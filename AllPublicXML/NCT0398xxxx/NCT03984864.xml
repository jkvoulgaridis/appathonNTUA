  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Low back pain, mainly nonspecific (NSLBP) is a major cause of pain and disability
      worldwide. Exercise therapy (ET) is considered as the first line treatment, and it is one of
      the treatment modalities most commonly used by physiotherapists. Yet, ET is reliant on the
      adherence of patients to its various components. Research has demonstrated a positive
      relationship between adherence to rehabilitation programs and recovery from a variety of
      musculoskeletal conditions. Therefore, factors that strengthen adherence to ET may increase
      its efficacy for NSLBP. Converging evidence from recent studies suggest that control and
      choice may increase adherence to various treatments.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of patient choice and
      preference on adherence and efficacy of exercise for recovery from NSLBP.

      Design: Matched case control study. Participants: Fifty subjects with chronic (&gt;3 months)
      NSLBP. Twenty-five participants will be allocated to exercise by preference group, and 25
      aged and gender controls will be allocated to exercise group.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Non-specific low back pain (pain or discomfort in the lumbosacral area, with or without
           symptoms to the lower extremities), diagnosed by general physician or orthopedic
           surgeon.

        2. Age 18-35

        3. Chronic pain (greater than 3 months' duration).

      Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Specific cause for LBP (rheumatic diseases, tumors, fractures, fibromyalgia, previous
           spinal surgery, pregnancy, low back pain after car or work accidents).

        2. Previous (last three years) ET treatment for NSLBP.

        3. Regularly performing exercise more than WHO's recommendation:

             -  150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or
                at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the
                week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity.

             -  Muscle-strengthening activities should be done involving major muscle groups on 2
                or more days a week.

      Procedure: After initial assessment, participants in the intervention group will be asked to
      choose 3-4 items from a list of 10 general exercises - intended for treatment of low back
      pain. Each matched participant in the control group will receive the same exercise (without
      the option to choose). Participants will be instructed to perform their exercises three times
      a week, for a period of four weeks (12 sessions total).

      Outcomes: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Henry-Eckert Performance Assessment Tool (HEPA)
      Both measurements will be taken on the first and last meeting. Additionally, each participant
      will fill a personal weekly exercise log (selecting between complete \ incomplete \ lack of
      execution) - sent by e-mail.

    <description>Patient-completed questionnaire consisted of 10 items which gives a subjective percentage score of level of function (disability) in activities of daily living in those rehabilitating from low back pain.
Each item consists of 6 statements scored from 0 to 5 (score of 0 indicates less disability).
The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible
0% -20%: Minimal disability
21%-40%: Moderate Disability
41%-60%: Severe Disability
61%-80%: Crippling back pain
81%-100%: These patients are either bed-bound or have an exaggeration of their symptoms Minimally clinical important difference (Johnsen et al. BMC Musculoskelet Disord. 2013) = 12.88, (sensitivity 88%, specificity 85%)</description>
