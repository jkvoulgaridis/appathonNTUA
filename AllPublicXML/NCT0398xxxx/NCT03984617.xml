  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attendances at an emergency department (ED) are often considered to depend on different
      factors such as moonlight, welfare checks, weather, and major sporting events. Data regarding
      effects of large sporting events on the workload of ED often assessed decreased patient
      volume, especially male use. Currently, no data are available on the effect of major
      televised sporting events on obstetrical visits. The aim of this study is to examine whether
      televised soccer games from a major sporting tournament, (Euro 2016) influence the level of
      attendance at an obstetrical ED and could have implications for women's welfare.

      In the summer of 2016, France hosted the largest European sporting event of the year 2016:
      the European Football Championships (Euro 2016). A total of 51 games were played over a
      month, bringing together the biggest European teams. An observational, retrospective study is
      conducted during this period on the number of emergency visits in a French tertiary Maternity
      hospital (Maternity of Nancy).
