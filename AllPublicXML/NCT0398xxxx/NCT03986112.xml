  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive patients have more hemodynamic instability during general anesthesia than do
      patients with NORMOTENSION. In this study, the investigators evaluated the usefulness of
      carotid ultrasound and inferior vena cervical ultrasound for predicting hypotension after
      induction of anesthesia in patients with hypertension.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carotid and venous ultrasonography is performed in a comfortable state. Corrected blood flow
      after carotid ultrasound and carotid artery blood flow rate were measured.

      After inferior vena cava sonography, using the embedded software, the collapsibility Index by
      measuring the largest and smallest diameter during the respiratory cycle will be obtained.

      After confirming baseline blood pressure and pulse rate, propofol 2 mg / kg is administered
      and remifentanil is maintained at 4.0 ng / mL using the Target Control System (TCI).

      Following the administration of rocuronium 1.0-1.2 mg / kg, and 1 minute and 30 seconds after
      BIS 60 or less, endotracheal intubation is performed using video laryngoscope.

      Blood pressure and heart rate are measured at prior to induction, 1 minute after the
      induction, immediately after intubation, and at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 minutes after intubation.

      Post-induction hypotension after anesthesia induction is considered as a decrease of 20% or
      more of the pre-anesthesia blood pressure or a mean arterial blood pressure of less than 60
      mmHg.

      In the event of hypotension in accordance with the above definition, repeated administration
      of ephedrine 4 mg or phenylephrine 50 mcg is used.
