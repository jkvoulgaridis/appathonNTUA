      RATIONALE:

      The combination of anti-angiogenic targeted therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been
      shown to further improve the pathologic response rate for HER2-negative breast cancer
      patients. Apatinib is a highly potent human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
      (VEGFR2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been independently developed in China, and it can
      exert anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting VEGFR2. It is unknown whether giving combination
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy together with apatinib is more effective in treating patients with
      nonmetastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.

      PURPOSE:

      To explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib added to weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin
      neoadjuvant therapy for HER-2 negative breast cancer patients
