      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) vs.
      valsartan on changes in NT-proBNP and outcomes, safety and tolerability in patients with
      HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 40%) who have been stabilized during
      hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure and initiated in-hospital or within 30

    <description>randomized in a 1:1 ratio: sacubitril/valsartan to valsartan for up to approximately 20 months of double-blind treatment.
Initial dose for patients randomized to sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) will be determined by patient's previous dose of ACEi/ARB immediately prior to hospital admission for acute decompensated heart failure. Study treatment will be titrated to the target dose of sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) 97/103 mg twice daily (Dose Level 3).
Patients will be required to take a total of two tablets twice daily (one tablet of active sacubitril/valsartan and one tablet of valsartan matching placebo pack).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to participation in the study

          2. Patients ≥40 years of age, male or female

          3. Currently hospitalized for or within 30 days following discharge of an acute
             decompensated HFpEF admission. Patients with a diagnosis of acute heart failure had to
             have symptoms and signs of fluid overload (i.e. jugular venous distention, edema or
             rales on auscultation or pulmonary congestion on chest x-ray). Eligible patients will
             be randomized no earlier than 36 hours and within 30 days post-discharge after
             presentation with acute HFpEF decompensation and meeting the following definitions of
             hemodynamic stability:

             In-hospital randomized patients will have been hemodynamically stable defined in this
             study as:

               1. SBP≥100mmHg for the preceding 6 hours prior to randomization; no symptomatic
                  hypotension

               2. No increase (intensification) in i.v. diuretic dose within last 6 hours prior to
                  randomization

               3. No i.v. inotropic drugs for 24 hours prior to randomization

               4. No i.v. vasodilators including nitrates within last 6 hours prior to
                  randomization

             Out-of-hospital randomization patients will have been hemodynamically stabilized
             defined in this study as:

               1. SBP ≥100mmHg; no symptomatic hypotension

               2. No increase (intensification and/or change to IV) in diuretic dose within last 24
                  hours prior to randomization

               3. No i.v. inotropic drugs for 24 hours prior to randomization

          4. HFpEF with most recent LVEF &gt;40% (within past 3 months)

          5. Elevated NT-proBNP or BNP at the time of screening (and within 72 hours from
             inhospital screening to out-of-hospital randomization, if applicable)

               1. Patients not in AF at the time of biomarker assessment: NT-proBNP ≥ 500pg/mL or
                  BNP ≥ 150 pg/mL; patients in AF at the time of biomarker assessment: NT-proBNP ≥
                  1000pg/mL or BNP ≥ 300 pg/mL

               2. Patients recruited in-hospital will be randomized based on the qualifying local
                  lab value in-hospital NT-proBNP or BNP value. In-hospital is the preferred method
                  of enrollment.

               3. Patients enrolled out-of-hospital can be randomized based on their NT-proBNP or
                  BNP value in the following way:

             if enrolling in out-of-hospital setting then need eligible screening/local
             NTproBNP/BNP within 72 hours of randomization. The test value could be from recent
             hospitalization if within 72 hours or would require (re)drawing NT-proBNP or BNP labs
             in out-of-hospital setting if the lab value is not already available within the last
             72 hours

          6. Has not taken an ACEi for 36 hours prior to randomization

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Any clinical event within the 90 days prior to randomization that could have reduced
             the LVEF (i.e., MI, CABG), unless an echo measurement was performed after the event
             confirming the LVEF to be &gt;40%

             hours prior to randomization

          4. Serum potassium &gt; 5.2 mEq/L at most recent assessment prior to randomization and
             within 24 hours prior to randomization
