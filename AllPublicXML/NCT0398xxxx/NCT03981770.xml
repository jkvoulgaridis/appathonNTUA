  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a case-controlled observational trial. Forty patients will be divided into 2
      groups (good or poor sleepers) depending on their first postoperative night Bispectral index
      data. Firstly, this study aims to characterise the lung microbiota in patients treated with
      thyroid surgery. Secondly, it aims to evaluate microbiota and its influence on plasma
      kynurenine.
