      The purpose of this study is to assess the preliminary efficacy and safety of KPL-914
      treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm pilot study to explore clinical and biochemical endpoints
      of pericarditis symptomatology and to collect data to assess inter- and intra-subject
      variability on both at-baseline and on-treatment parameters. This study consists of 5
      distinct Parts, and all subjects will be treated with once-weekly subcutaneously
      (SC)-administered injections of KPL-914.There is an optional 18-week extension period.

    <description>KPL-914 (rilonacept) will be provided in its commercially-available formulation as a lyophilized powder to be reconstituted for SC administration.
Adult subjects (≥ 18 years of age) KPL-914 will be administered as an initial loading dose of 320 mg SC, delivered as two subcutaneous injections of 160 mg SC each on Day 0, then 160 mg SC dosed once weekly for 5 subsequent weeks.
Pediatric subjects (6 to &lt;18 years of age) KPL-914 will be administered with an initial loading dose of 4.4 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 320 mg, delivered as two subcutaneous injections of 2.2 mg/kg each with a maximum single-injection volume of 2 mL.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has given consent (or assent, if applicable) and signed an Informed Consent Form (ICF)
             (or informed assent form, if applicable).

          -  Male or female, of any ethnic origin.

          -  6 to 75 years of age, inclusive.

          -  If used, has received NSAIDs, and/or colchicine and/or corticosteroids (in any
             combination) at stable dose levels for at least 7 days (although stable doses for a
             shorter period will be acceptable if in the opinion of the Investigator, in
             consultation with the Sponsor, a shorter period of stability is not anticipated to
             alter the baseline CRP values) and is anticipated to continue these concomitant
             medications at these dose levels for the duration of the active Treatment Period.

          -  If female of child-bearing potential, must be nonpregnant and nonlactating and must
             agree to use an effective method of contraception, e.g., hormonal contraception or
             double-barrier birth control.

          -  Is able to adequately maintain a medication diary.

          -  Agrees to refrain from making any new, major life-style changes that may affect
             pericarditis symptoms (e.g., starting a new diet or changing exercise pattern) from
             the time of signature of the ICF (or informed assent form, if applicable) to the
             End-of-Trial Visit.

        Parts 1, 2 and 4:

        Subjects eligible for Parts 1, 2 and 4 have to present during a symptomatic episode of RIP
        or post pericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) and a history of at least one pericarditis
        recurrence. They can be enrolled into Part 1 or 4 if the CRP value at screening is &gt;1
        mg/dL, and into Part 2 if a CRP ≤1 mg/dL (attributed to concomitant medications eg,
        corticosteroids), and there is an evidence of pericardial inflammation on cardiac MRI
        confirmed by the imaging core lab.

        Enrollment into Part 3 and 5:

        Subjects eligible for Part 3 of this study have to present with corticosteroid-dependent
        RIP or PPS and history of at least 2 pericarditis recurrences.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a diagnosis of pericarditis that was secondary to specific excluded etiologies,
             including tuberculous, neoplastic, or purulent etiologies, post-myocardial infarction
             (early or late), thoracic trauma, myocarditis, or systemic diseases including
             autoinflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             lupus erythematosus, etc.).

          -  Has a history of immunodepression, including a positive human immunodeficiency virus
             test result.

          -  Has received treatment within the 6-month period before dosing with any systemic
             immunosuppressants (other than, for example, corticosteroids or mycophenolate) which,
             in the opinion of the Investigator (in consultation with the Sponsor), may interfere
             with the study endpoints.

          -  Currently receiving other interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 blockers, janus-activating kinase
             (JAK) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.
