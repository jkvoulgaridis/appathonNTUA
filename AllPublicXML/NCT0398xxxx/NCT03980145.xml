  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The logistic advantages and advanced training capabilities of the G-EO System, as well as the
      benefits reported in other populations, support this strategy as a potentially potent
      rehabilitation tool for restoring and maintaining function in progressive Multiple Sclerosis
      (MS). This approach represents a paradigm shifting opportunity for improving current clinical
      practices for patients with progressive MS. If successful, this project will provide initial
      evidence for increasing patient access to the G-EO System, and this could be accomplished
      through &quot;regional technology centers&quot; using a rural health-delivery approach.

      There are several novel aspects of the proposed trial: (1) the examination of a novel gait
      rehabilitation stimulus (G-EO System) that could alter current clinical practices; (2) the
      focus on patients with progressive MS who have gait impairment (i.e., those who have received
      minimal research attention), which was recently described as the greatest therapeutic
      challenge facing the MS community; and (3) a study design that accounts for standard therapy.

      Specific Aims: The investigators designed a single-blinded, randomized pilot trial of
      electromechanically-assisted gait training using the G-EO System in patients with progressive
      MS with gait disability (EDSS=4.0-7.5).

      Specific Aim 1 will establish the safety and feasibility of gait training using the G-EO
      System.

      Specific Aim 2 will determine the efficacy of gait training using the G-EO System for
      improving mobility, symptomatic, quality of life, and participatory outcomes.

    <measure>Change in Modified Fatigue Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects perception of the their fatigue will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment and following study completion (at 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete a questionnaire evaluating their level of perceived fatigue. The scale includes an overall score and three subscales: physical, cognitive, and psychosocial. Total scores range from 0 to 84 while the physical subscale ranges from 0 to 36; cognitive subscale from 0 to 40; and psychosocial subscale from 0 to 8. For the total score and subscales a higher scores indicates greater fatigue. Decreases in total ans subscale scores over time indicate decreases in feelings of fatigue. Total and subscales are summed.</description>

    <measure>Change in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects perception of the their disability will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment and following study completion (at 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete a 29 item questionnaire evaluating their level of health-related quality of life. The higher the score the greater the impact MS is having on daily function. There are two subscales: physical scale (20 items) and psychological (9 items). Score is achieved by summing the scores for each of the two subscales and then converting the score to a 100 point scale. On the 100 point scale, 0 would indicate no impact of the disease on daily function and 100 would indicate the greatest possible impact.
Physical impact scale is calculated by subtracting the score from 20, multiplying by 100 and dividing by 80.
Psychological impact scale is calculated by subtracting the score from 9, multiplying by 100 and dividing by 36</description>

    <description>Subjects will complete a questionnaire evaluating their level of pain. There are 15 adjectives that describe the sensory (11 words) and affective (4 words) qualities of the patient's pain. The patient ranks each of the words on a categoric scale of &quot;none, mild, moderate, severe. Sensory and affective scores will be computed separately. Scores are created from a summary of the responses using an intensity scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe. The higher the score the more severe the pain is for each of the subscales.</description>

    <measure>Late-Life Disability Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects perception of the their functional ability using the total score and dimensional scores will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment and following study completion (at 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete a questionnaire evaluating their perceived level of disability. This tool assesses and responds to meaningful change in a persons disability (Ability to participate in life's activities). There is a 16 item disability component that is scored across two dimensions: frequency and limitation. Total scores and dimensional scores are created by summation and conversion to a 100 point scaled score. The instrument provides a table for converting the raw score to a scaled score. A higher score indicates greater functional ability and less disability.
Each dimension can be further assessed by analyzing domains. There are social and personal domains within the frequency dimension and instrumental and management domains within the limitations dimension. All domains are calculated as described before through summation and scale adjustment.</description>

    <measure>Late-Life Function Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects perception of the their functional ability using all three domains will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment and following study completion (at 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete a questionnaire evaluating their perceived level of function. This tool assesses and responds to meaningful change in a persons function (ability to execute discrete tasks). There is a 32 item functional component is comprised of three domains Upper Extremity, Basic Lower Extremity, Advanced Lower Extremity. Total score and each domain will be scored by summing and then converting to a 100 point scaled score. The instrument provides a table for converting the raw score to a scaled score. A higher score indicates greater functional ability.</description>

    <description>G-EO training: Using the G-EO System, participants will be secured with the appropriate sized harness and attached to an overhead body-weight support system, with feet secured to pressure sensitive footplates. Each session will begin with a 3-5 minute warm-up in the continuous passive mode (cadence ~40-45 steps/minute). The participant will then be transitioned into the adaptive training phase for practicing repetitive floor walking and stair climbing for up to 30 minutes. During this phase, the force produced by the robot is modulated to support the effort of the patient in producing a typical walking pattern.</description>

    <description>Electromechanically-assisted gait training addresses many of the limitations of therapist-assisted gait training and can be performed using either exoskeleton or end-effector devices. Exoskeleton devices involve programmable drives or passive elements which physically move the lower limbs, whereas, end-effector approaches involve driven footplates that have trajectories that simulate the stance and swing phases.13,14 The G-EO System (Reha Technology: Olten, Switzerland) is a novel end-effector gait training system that was developed for regaining mobility and independence in stroke survivors. This system involves minimal therapist and patient burden (e.g., quick set-up, single operate usage), there is the unique capacity for practicing walking and stair climbing movements, and the patient can receive real-time visual feedback.</description>
