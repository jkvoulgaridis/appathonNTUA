  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this community based participatory research project is to prevent
      obesity in 3-5 year old Alaska Native children in remote communities.

      Investigators will design and evaluate a culturally responsive, home-focused intervention,
      Tundra Gifts, that links early childhood education programming (i.e. Head Start) and federal
      food assistance programs (i.e. WIC and SNAP) with primary caregivers to support healthy
      eating and an active lifestyle using a cluster-randomized design. The intervention integrates
      behavior change theory with Indigenous traditional knowledge. Primary caregivers will attend
      monthly interactive education session, receive a monthly gift basket that includes resources
      and supplies to support behavior change at home and receive ongoing social support through a
      Facebook site. Investigators will also evaluate key process indicators of Tundra Gifts to
      understand the impact on outcomes of variations in persons and settings and to enhance the
      generalizability of findings.
