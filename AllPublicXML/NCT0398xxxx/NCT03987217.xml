      This trial studies how well resistance training with or without creatine monohydrate
      supplement works in improving body composition and health outcomes in patients with prostate
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Resistance training, with or without
      creatine monohydrate supplement, may help to improve feelings of tiredness and overall
      physical function in patients with prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the change in lean mass with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation + resistance
      training compared to resistance training alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate change in other body composition variables (i.e. fat mass, fat-free mass,
      percent body fat, appendicular lean mass) with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation +
      resistance training compared to resistance training alone.

      II. To evaluate the change in health outcomes associated with body composition (i.e. physical
      function, fatigue, insulin regulation) with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation + resistance
      training compared to resistance training alone.

      III. To examine associations between creatine supplementation use and changes in biomarkers
      linked with prostate cancer progression (prostate specific antigen [PSA] and inflammatory
      markers).

      IV. To evaluate the degree of adherence to the creatine supplementation protocol.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients complete Personal Optimism with Exercise Recovery (POWER) resistance
      training program sessions twice weekly over 30-60 minute each for 12 weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients complete POWER resistance training program sessions twice weekly over
      30-60 minutes each for 12 weeks and receive creatine monohydrate supplementation orally (PO)
      4 times daily during week 1, and then once daily (QD) during weeks 2-12.

FACIT-Fatigue Subscale Scoring Guidelines (Version 4)
Record answers in &quot;item response&quot; column. If missing, mark with an X
Perform reversals as indicated, and sum individual items to obtain a score.
Multiply the sum of the item scores by the number of items in the subscale, then divide by the number of items answered. This produces the subscale score.
The higher the score, the better the QOL.</description>
