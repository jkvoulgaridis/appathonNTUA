  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical evaluation is to evaluate the immediate and long-term (up to
      12 months) outcome of the MOTIV™ Bioresorbable Scaffold (Reva Medical) in a controlled
      prospective investigation for the treatment of patients with rest pain or minor tissue loss
      (CLI) due to the presence of lesions of max 40mm in length at the level of the below-the-knee
      arteries.

    <description>Clinically-driven (drop in 1 Rutherford Classification) target lesion revascularization (TLR) is defined as a repeat intervention to maintain or re-establish patency within the region of the treated arterial vessel plus 5mm proximal and distal to the device/PTA edge, at 1, 6 and 12-month follow-up.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month, 6 months and 12 months post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Major amputation is defined as amputation at or above the ankle, as opposed to minor amputation, being an amputation at or below metatarsal level, preserving functionality of the foot.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical success at follow-up is defined as an improvement of Rutherford classification at 1 day and 1, 6 and 12 month follow-up of one class or more as compared to the pre-procedural Rutherford Classification.</measure>
