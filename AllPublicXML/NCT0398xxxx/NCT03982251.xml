  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole body vibration (WBV) has been found to be useful in promoting bone health and muscle
      performance in older adults. To date, no study has examined the effects of different WBV
      frequencies on the properties of the muscle-bone unit in stroke patients. The overall aim of
      the proposed study is to compare the efficacy of different vibration frequencies on
      properties of the muscle function and bone turnover among people with chronic stroke.

      It is hypothesized that the higher-vibration frequency protocol will lead to significantly
      better outcomes related to the bone turnover and muscle function.
