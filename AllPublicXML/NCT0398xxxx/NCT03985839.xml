  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, PMCF study to evaluate the safety and performance of the
      MICRORAPTOR REGENESORB suture anchors, MICRORAPTOR Knotless REGENESORB suture anchors, and
      MICRORAPTOR Knotless PEEK suture anchors implanted in 300 subjects needing reattachment of
      soft tissue to bone.

      The purpose of this trial is to assess, by product, safety and performance post-market of the
      Microraptor Regenesorb, Microraptor Knotless Regenesorb, and Microraptor Knotless PEEK Suture
      Anchors. Approximately 18 sites (approximately 3 sites for study shoulder group and 3 sites
      for study hip group, per product) in the United States will participate in the study. This is
      an open-label study with consecutive enrollment. The study will continue for 24 months from
      the date that the last subject received the study treatment to the date that the last subject
      completes the study as planned. The study duration is planned for 36 months.

    <measure>ROWE shoulder score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ROWE score for shoulder instability is a 3-item instrument completed by the investigator or qualified, delegated study staff. Its questions address the categories of shoulder stability (0 to 50 points), motion (0 to 20 points), and function (0 to 30 points). Scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of 90-100 points indicating an excellent evaluation, 75-89 points indicating a good evaluation, 51-74 points indicating a fair evaluation, and =&lt; 50 points indicating a poor evaluation.</description>

    <measure>WOSI shoulder score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) is a subject completed instrument. Its categories include &quot;physical symptoms&quot; (10 items), &quot;sports, recreation, work&quot; (4 items), &quot;pain&quot; (4 items), &quot;lifestyle&quot; (4 items), and &quot;emotion&quot; (3 items), with each category scored from 0 to 100 using a visual analog scale. Overall scores range from 0 to 2100 with a score of 0 indicating better shoulder function and 2100 indicating worse shoulder function.</description>

    <measure>Constant-Murley Shoulder Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Constant-Murley Shoulder (CMS) scale assesses four aspects related to shoulder pathology; two subjective: pain and activities of daily living (ADL) and two objective: range of motion (ROM) and strength. The subjective components can receive up to 35 points and the objective 65, resulting in a possible maximum total score of 100 points (best function). Pain and ADL are answered by the subject; ROM and strength require a physical evaluation and are answered by the orthopaedic surgeon or the physiotherapist.</description>

    <description>Hip Outcome Score (HOS) was designed to assess the outcome of treatment intervention for individuals with acetabular tears who may be functioning throughout a wide range of abilities. It is a subject completed measure that consists of an &quot;Activities of Daily Living&quot; (ADL) subscale (17 scored items) and a &quot;Sports&quot; subscale (9 scored items) in which the response options are presented as 5-point Likert scales. Scores for each subscale range from 0% (least function) to 100% (most function).</description>

    <description>Modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) is a joint specific score that is completed by both the investigator or qualified, delegated study staff and the subject and consists of 10 items covering domains of pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), functional activities, absence of deformity (1 item, 0-4 points), and hip range of motion (2 items, 0-5 points). Scores range from 0 (worse disability) to 100 (less disability).</description>

             activities or follow directions during the healing period.

          -  Currently using tobacco products (cigarette, smokeless tobacco, ecigarettes, vaping
             etc.).

          -  Concurrent bilateral surgery.
