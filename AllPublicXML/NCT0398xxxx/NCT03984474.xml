  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective cohort study. The investigators evaluated the early, middle and long term
      effects of different surgical methods of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on knee
      function.

      In the evaluation, the investigators focused on the differences between different age groups,
      different genders and different basic motor states, the differences between early
      reconstruction and non-early reconstruction, and the differences in clinical outcomes of
      different surgical methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age 13-65 included. Only include isolated anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) rupture. Excluded
      revision surgery. Excluded bilateral ACL rupture. Excluded the contralateral ACL tear after
      surgery. 40 patients at least in each group.
