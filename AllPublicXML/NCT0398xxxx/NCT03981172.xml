  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previous studies have shown that obese and non-obese individuals respond
      differently to daily intake of snack food. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
      these differences are specific to high energy density snack foods. The investigators
      hypothesized that obese individuals would show an increase in motivation to obtain high
      energy density snack foods after two weeks of daily consumption, but that non-obese women and
      obese women consuming low energy density foods would have reduced motivation to consume snack
      foods after two weeks of daily consumption.
