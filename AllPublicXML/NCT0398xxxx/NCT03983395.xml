  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of single agent ISB1302 in subjects with HER2-positive
      metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with all known therapies known to confer
      clinical benefit.
