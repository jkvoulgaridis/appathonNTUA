  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the balance of sequential and integrated dual
      activity training in geriatric individuals, fear of falling and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the purpose, the number of 42 participants reached by the power analysis method was
      determined as 60 people considering the possible separations. 60 participants will be
      included in the study. Participants should not have any orthopedic, neurological and
      cognitive disabilities and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scale score should be 21
      or higher. Participants will be divided into two groups as random sequential and integrated
      dual activity groups.

      In the study sit-up, stand on one leg (eye open-closed), standing 30 sec stop (eye open
      closed stop), 10 m walk backward, sitting on top of the ball (eye open-closed), transfer of
      weight on the top-left, walking in straight line, 30 sec. stop on soft ground (eye
      open-close), balance training which does not force their efforts will be given in two groups.

      For the sequential dual activity group, immediately after these trainings, you should
      expected to find the letters Z in the mixed letters, search for the five words you read on
      the previous page, find the similarities between the concepts, find the letter in the given
      tables, derive the fruit names starting with the letter, count the days of the week etc.
      Attention, memory and arithmetic training will be given the ability to run. For the
      integrated dual activity group will be given similar cognitive tasks during simple balance
      training.

      The training program will be prolonged 8 weeks and 2 days per week for both groups.

      The assessment tests will perform and a quality of life questionnaire will conduct before and
      after the program. The assessments will be performed: MOCA, Berg Balance Scale, Normal and
      Cognitive Time Walking Test, Tinneti Fall Activity Scale, 10m Walking Rate and Cognitive Dual
      Activity Cost Calculation During Walk, Time Up and Go (TUG), WHOQOL-OLD Quality of Life
      Questionnaire.

      Although there are many studies to increase and measure the balance and physical capacity of
      geriatric individuals in the literature, there is no study comparing the benefits of
      sequential and integrated cognitive dual activity training.

      A major cause of morbidity and mortality is a fall injury in the elderly. Therefore,
      preventing falls in geriatrics and increasing the ability to balance is an important public
      health priority.

      Our study aims to benefit the public health, the reduction of health expenses of our country,
      the physiotherapists working with geriatric individuals and the literature.

    <intervention_model_description>In the study; sit-up, stand on one leg (eye open-closed), standing 30 sec stop (eye open closed stop), 10 m walk backward, sitting on top of the ball (eye open-closed), transfer of weight on the top-left, walking in straight line, 30 sec. stop on soft ground (eye open-close), balance training which does not force their efforts will be given in two groups.
Group 1: Sequential dual activity group, immediately after these trainings, you should expected to find the letters Z in the mixed letters, search for the five words you read on the previous page, find the similarities between the concepts, find the letter in the given tables, derive the fruit names starting with the letter, count the days of the week etc. Attention, memory and arithmetic training will be given the ability to run.
Group 2: Integrated dual activity group will be given similar cognitive tasks during simple balance training.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.</description>

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale (or BBS) is a widely used clinical test of a person's static and dynamic balance abilities, named after Katherine Berg, one of the developers. For functional balance tests, the BBS is generally considered to be the gold standard.
The test takes 15-20 minutes and comprises a set of 14 simple balance related tasks, ranging from standing up from a sitting position, to standing on one foot. The degree of success in achieving each task is given a score of zero (unable) to four (independent), and the final measure is the sum of all of the scores.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10 meters walking test</measure>
    <time_frame>max 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the time required to walk 10 meters. Administration time is usually less than 5 minutes. Performed using a &quot;flying start&quot;: the patient walks 14 meters and the time is measured for the intermediate 10 meters. The individual walks at their preferred walking speed.
During the 10-meter walk test, a cognitive task can be used to determine the effect of the cognitive task on motor performance, such as counting back from 100 to 2 by 2.</description>

    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale is a 10-item questionnaire designed to assess confidence in patients' ability to perform 10 daily tasks without falling as an indicator of how one's fear of falling impacts physical performance.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. Description of the Instrument. Patients are timed (in seconds) when performing the TUG—3 conditions 1. TUG alone-from sitting in a chair, stand up, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back, and sit down.. 2. TUG Cognitive-complete the task while counting backwards from a randomly selected number between 20 and 100.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Dual Activity Cost Calculation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Dual-task interference is quantified by calculating a dual-task effect for each of the two tasks. The traditional formula for evaluating the dual-task effect on a particular outcome of interest, e.g., gait speed or accuracy, is: DTE(%)= (DT-ST)/ST X 100</description>
