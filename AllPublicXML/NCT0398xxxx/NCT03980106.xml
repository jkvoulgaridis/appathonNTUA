  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a cross-over study to compare the effect of two different muscle energy techniques (MET)
      including post-isometric inhibition and reciprocal inhibition on the spinal reflex
      excitability. The study contains two experimental groups, while one group will receive
      post-isometric inhibition MET in the first stage and reciprocal inhibition MET in the second
      stage, the other group will receive reciprocal inhibition MET in the first stage and
      post-isometric inhibition MET in the second stage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reciprocal inhibition MET works based on the two mechanisms a) voluntary activation of
      agonist muscle that is simultaneously accompanied by the inhibition of the antagonist muscles
      or b) the activation of muscle spindle which causes a reflexive contraction in the agonist
      muscle (known as the stretch reflex) and relaxation of the antagonist muscles. By using this
      method, the activation of agonist muscles may inhibit or deactivate the antagonist muscles
      which may permit the therapist to introduce further ROM to the affected joint.

      The other method of MET is post-isometric relaxation which works based on the two mechanisms
      including; 1) activation of Golgi Tendon Organs (GTO) that located between the muscle belly
      and its tendon and 2) presetting muscle spindles by muscle contraction witch project
      information to the spinal cord via afferent type II fibers and through a complex central
      control systems, the spindle is preset to adjust the tone of the muscle. It seems that
      moderate isometric contraction of muscle may preset the muscle spindle and cause a
      post-isometric relaxation within the agonist muscles which now can be stretched further, and
      this may permit the therapist to introduce further ROM to the affected joint and help to
      improve joint mobilization.
