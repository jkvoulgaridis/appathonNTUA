  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For some patients in department psychiatric, isolation measures are put in place. But the
      measures is not pleasant for the patient or for the care team.

      That's why care team are trying to find ways to improve patient care, including asking them
      how they would like to be treated.

      One of the solutions is called the Joint Crisis Plan. A Joint Crisis Plan is a personalized
      procedure for a patient. It describes the attitude, the care, the measures in case of crisis
      with the patient and his family. Patients indicate their wishes regarding their care.
      However, there is no real scientific proof of the effectiveness of this Joint Crisis Plan,
      especially to reduce isolation measures.
