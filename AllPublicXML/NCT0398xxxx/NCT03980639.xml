  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are very few data on the safety of Biologic Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs
      (bDMARDs), especially abatacept which compared to Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) inhibitors
      has distinct mechanism of action. Abatacept is a recombinant fusion protein of human
      Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the Fc region of human immunoglobulin gamma-1
      (IgG1). This CTLA4-fusion protein blocks the signal of T cell activation by binding to CD80
      and CD86.

      Recently, the investigator's study found in a US cohort of 64,000 patients with Rheumatoid
      Arthritis (RA) a potential signal for a higher risk of cancer overall and particularly
      non-melanoma skin cancer with abatacept compared to other bDMARDs (article in press). These
      results were in accordance with another prospective cohort study of the public health care
      system in Sweden, showing an increased risk of NMSC in abatacept users compared with TNFα
      inhibitors. As these results warrant replication, the present study will assess whether
      abatacept is associated with an increased risk of reporting overall cancer and specific
      cancer, including breast, lung, lymphoma, cervical, melanoma and NMSC, compared to other
      bDMARDs.

      A case non-case study using Vigibase®, the World Health Organization Global Individual Case
      Safety Reports (ICSRs) database which includes more than 18 million reports forwarded to the
      WHO Uppsala Monitoring Center by national pharmacovigilance systems from over 130 countries
      around the world since 1967. Information on the adverse effects reported include patient
      demographics and medical relevant history, drugs recorded according to the WHO Drug
      dictionary and adverse drug reactions coded with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
      (MedDRA) terms will be perform.
