    <textblock>
      The aim of this proposed study is to translate the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension with
      Sodium (Na) Reduction for Chinese Canadian (DASHNa-CC), a classroom-based antihypertensive
      dietary educational intervention, to an innovative smartphone app (mDASHNa-CC) to enable
      Chinese Canadian seniors' access to this antihypertensive dietary intervention anytime,
      regardless of where they are.

    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form version two. The SF-36v2 required ten minutes to complete and consisted of 36 items and eight domains, which could be grouped into physical and mental component summaries. All domains were scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, wherein 0 represented the worst overall health status and 100 the best health status.</description>

    <description>All participants will (a) receive a general hypertension health education booklet from the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario;(b) be encouraged to see their family physicians or primary health care providers regarding their blood pressure status; those who do not have a primary health care provider will be referred to a walk-in clinic or a community health centre; and (c) have access to family physicians, tele-health, emergency care, hospital and other health care facilities in the Greater Toronto Area as required.</description>

    <description>In addition to usual care, those participants randomized to the intervention group will be offered use of the app.Then, they will load the app in their smartphones and be requested to review educational contents, conduct dietary self-assessment, and monitor blood pressure for 8 weeks.By the end of eight weeks post randomization, seniors will be prompted by phone using an audible alert to complete the app Evaluation Questionnaire on the smartphone, which ascertains likes and dislikes with the app.</description>
