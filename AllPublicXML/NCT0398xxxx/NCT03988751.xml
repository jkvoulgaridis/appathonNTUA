  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will investigate the feasibility of using the Wake Forest Real-time
      Location System (RTLS) in monitoring patient movement during their in-hospital postoperative
      recovery. The study will involve patients who have undergone surgery requiring inpatient
      admission to the 9CC surgical ward. Actual patient movement will be monitored during their
      postoperative recovery and compared with data recorded by the Wake Forest location system. In
      this small pilot study, a subgroup of participants will be randomized to two cohorts,
      continuous walking and interval walking. Tolerability of the varied walking intensity will be
      measured.

    <description>Characterize patient tolerability continuous vs interval 40m walk using rated perceived exertion (RPE) scale (1-10). RPE is a self-reported measure of exercise intensity with 10 being strenuous activity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate surgical patient discharge readiness using a questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire has 3 parts. 1) Self-Efficacy Survey which has a raw summed score ranging from 10-40 that is converted to a T-score. T scores are standard scores in which 50 represents the mean of the US general population (based on the 2010 Census) and 10 represents the general population standard deviation. For the NIH Toolbox Self-Efficacy Survey, higher scores are indicative of more general self-efficacy. Scores 1 SD or more below the mean (T ≤ 40) suggest low levels of general self-efficacy and scores 1 SD or more above the mean (T ≥ 60) suggest high levels of general self-efficacy. T-scores ≤ 40 may warrant heightened surveillance or concern. 2) Ambulatory Self-Confidence Questionnaire (Asano et al 2007) which measures ambulatory confidence on a 1-10 scale with 10 being very confident. 3) 5 specific questions measured on Likert scale (1-5) regarding readiness for discharge after surgery. Higher number indicating personal perception of ready for leaving hospital.</description>

    <description>The subject will walk a total distance of 40 meters. This distance will be divided into four intervals of 10 meters to equal the same measured distance as the continuous group. The subject will receive two minutes of rest between each interval and will be supported and coached to walk as fast as they can.</description>
