    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort study recruiting participants from the Shouldice Hospital. The study
      population consists of healthy patients electing to receive hernia surgery for a primary
      inguinal hernia on an inpatient basis. The goal of this study is to determine the incidence
      of hernia pain and its intensity as well as other related outcomes up to one year after
      primary unilateral inguinal hernia repair.
