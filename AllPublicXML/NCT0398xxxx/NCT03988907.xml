  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase I, 2-part, open-label, non-randomized study to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a multiple-dosing regimen of risdiplam (Part 1)
      and the effect of risdiplam on the PK of midazolam (Part 2) following oral administration in
      healthy adult male and female participants.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
