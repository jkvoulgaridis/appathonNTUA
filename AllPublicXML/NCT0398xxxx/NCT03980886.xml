      Single center observational and specimen banking study for children with eosinophilic
      esophagitis EoE to gauge natural history and inflammatory markers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with a diagnosis of EoE are recruited from Rady Children's Hospital Eosinophilic
      Gastrointestinal Disorders (EGID) during routine clinic and/or endoscopy visits.

      Medical information including clinical symptoms, endoscopy, histopathology, medical and
      surgical history, lab and imaging findings, are entered into a UCSD database at each clinic
      or endoscopy visit. Blood and biopsy specimens are procured and utilized for analysis of
      inflammatory molecules and for isolation of structural cells. This protocol continues our
      clinical database and sample collection in children with EoE. The database provides a cohort
      of EoE patients for studies of natural history, therapeutic response, and disease
      progression. In a relatively new disease of increasing incidence, these studies will provide
      information on disease progression and the clinical characteristics of patients who have
      varying disease phenotypes as well as the associations between clinical phenotypes, molecular
      changes, and disease course. The procurement and storage of tissue, cells, and serum samples
      provides a repository for studies of EoE-related molecules and peripheral markers in
      clinically phenotyped patients. In addition, the study of these esophageal cells will provide
      an in vitro model system for assessing the molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in
      EoE.
