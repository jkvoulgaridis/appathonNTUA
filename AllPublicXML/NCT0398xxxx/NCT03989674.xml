  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Singapore, the Ministry of Health has declared a &quot;War on Diabetes&quot; and major efforts will
      be made to develop and deploy programs to prevent diabetes. One of the cornerstones of
      diabetes management involves dietary modifications to reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia.
      However, implementation of a low GI diet is highly complex requiring the individual to choose
      foods from a long list which are primarily based on western consumption patterns. Many foods
      in the Asian diet, which largely consist of carbohydrates such as white rice, noodles and
      other flour based products, are not represented. An alternative solution will require
      innovative ways to alter commonly available food products that will not only help reduce
      postprandial glycaemia but also preserve the sensory characteristics of the foods to create a
      new generation of food products both functional and palatable. One such approach is the
      incorporation of plant compounds that lower the glucose absorption from foods. The aim of the
      project is to measure the GI of carbohydrate-based food with edible plant derived molecules.
      Natural, plant-derived anthocyanin will be incorporated into bread to produce low GI bread.
      Anthocyanins are well known for its anti-oxidant activity and recent studies reported that
      anthocyanins also had an inhibitory activity against digestive enzymes that break down
      carbohydrates. It can potentially inhibit amylase, and suppress the increase in postprandial
      glucose level from starch. Bread is a carbohydrate-rich product, which contains a high amount
      of rapidly digestible starch, and therefore many of them have a high GI. This study aims to
      determine the glycaemic effects of anthocyanin fortified bread. The effort is designed to
      enable and inform population interventions that will have an impact on the health of the
      population in a sustainable manner by introducing innovative foods into the food supply that
      are 'health promoting' based on rigorous human experiments and are acceptable to the public
      and other major stakeholders.

          -  Overtly healthy males or females, as determined by medical history, physical
             examination and laboratory results within normal reference range for the population or
