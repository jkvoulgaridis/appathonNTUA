    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation using a transcranial
      magnetic stimulation device for improvement of depressive symptoms and drinking behavior in
      individuals with alcohol dependence. In this open label study, all participants will receive
      accelerated theta-burst stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive procedure and an
      established technology. Research utilizing rTMS in patients with alcohol use disorder has
      shown some promising results. The limitations of this approach include the duration of the
      treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session). Recently, researchers have
      aggressively pursued modifying the treatment parameters, such as using accelerated
      intermittent theta-burst stimulation (aiTBS), to reduce treatment times with possible
      enhanced efficacy with some preliminary success. This study intends to further modify the
      parameters to create a more rapid form of the treatment and look at the change in
      neuroimaging biomarkers.

    <description>The Advanced Clinical Solutions Test of Premorbid Function (TOPF) is given to estimate an individual's premorbid cognitive and memory functioning. Although TOPF is not impervious to the effects of cognitive dysfunction, it appears to be less affected than other measures of intellectual and memory functioning. The TOPF is based on a reading paradigm, requiring the reading and pronunciation of words that have irregular grapheme-to-phoneme translation. It does not require comprehension or knowledge of word meaning.</description>
