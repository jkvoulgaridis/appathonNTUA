      This study involves the evaluation of a decision support tool, based on the patient version
      of the NCCN guidelines, for the non-small cell lung cancer patient population. The decision
      support tool is offered by a trained coordinator to the patient and then utilized during an
      initial consultation. Patients complete forms before and after the visit indicating their
      level of decisional conflict, satisfaction, and satisfaction with decision. Pre-determined
      indices of quality of care were also collected by the study team.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Decisional Conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Change in level of decisional conflict will be assessed by the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). Assessment will be completed before and after consultation. The DCS is a scale designed to measure patients' uncertainty in making health-related decisions, factors contributing to uncertainty, and patients' perceived effective decision-support. The DCS has 16 items and uses a five-point Likert scale for each item. The total score ranging from 0-64 is divided by 16 and then multiplied by 25 to calculate a final total score with 0 indicating low conflict and 100 indicating high conflict.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with Health Care Decision</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction will be assessed using the Patient Satisfaction with Health Care Decision (SWD) six-item scale. The SWD will be completed once after the consultation. The range of scoring on this instrument is 0-30, with 30 indicating the highest satisfaction with decision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Characterize Decisional Support Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' preferred style of decision making with their physician will be assessed using the Decision Making Preference Questionnaire (DMPQ). The DMPQ will be completed once before the consultation. The DMPQ consists of a single question with five choices, ranging from a preference to have the doctor make all of the decisions (passive) to the patient making all of the decisions themselves about their treatment (active) or the intermediate state of shared decision making. There are choices from 1-5 with 5 indicating the most active decision making preference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the FACT-L quality of life instrument, a 44-item self-report questionnaire that uses a five-point Likert scale. The FACT-L will be completed once before the consultation. The FACT-L is graded on a scale from 0-84 with a lung cancer subscale that ranges from 0-24 with the higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung Cancer Symptom Evaluation Score by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Lung Symptom Index (NFLSI-17)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' symptoms will be evaluated using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network- Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Lung Symptom Index (NFLSI-17), a 17-item patient-reported questionnaire that uses a five-point Likert scale and is scored from 0-68. It includes three subscales: Disease-Related Subscale, Treatment Side Effects, and Functional Well-Being. The NFLSI-17 will be completed once before the consultation.</description>

    <measure>Post Consultation Agreement Between Patient and Physician</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>By using a post-consultation questionnaire, we will determine the level of agreement between patient and physician with respect to treatments discussed and recommended, prognosis, and expected tolerance.</description>
