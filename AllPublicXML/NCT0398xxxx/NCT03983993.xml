  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well niraparib and panitumumab work in
      treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body.
      Niraparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, may help the body's
      immune system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving niraparib and panitumumab may work better in treating patients with colorectal
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the activity of the combination of niraparib with epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) inhibitor panitumumab in previously treated patients with rat sarcoma gene
      (RAS) wild type (WT) metastatic colorectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the toxicity profile of the combination of niraparib and panitumumab.

      II. Evaluate the activity of the combination of niraparib and panitumumab in previously
      treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and panitumumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 months for
      2 years, and then annually for up to 5 years.
