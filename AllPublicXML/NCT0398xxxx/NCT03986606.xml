  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1, ascending dose escalation study of PSB205 in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 of the
      study will be a dose escalation evaluation to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PSB205. This study purpose is to describe
      the safety and tolerability, to assess Pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity, and to
      preliminarily assess the anti-tumor activity of PSB205 in subjects with solid tumors. Part 2
      of the study will further evaluate the RP2D in 3 distinct tumor cohorts of approximately 12
      subjects each.

    <description>Part 1 (Dose escalation): PSB205 will be administered in sequential cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects each receiving 1 of 5 doses of PSB205 on day 1 of every 21-day cycle (3 weeks) via IV infusion using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is reached.
Part 2 (Dose Expansion): The clinical anti-tumor effects of PSB205 will be tested at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined during the dose-escalation phase in subjects from three different solid tumor cohorts.</description>
