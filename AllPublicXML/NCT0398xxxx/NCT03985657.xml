  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main thrust of the research is based on evidence that 1) there is a higher prevalence of
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and 2) that there could
      be an association between OSA and aortic dissection, the main cause of morbidity and
      mortality in this patient subset.

      The increased prevalence is thought to be due to increased collapsibility of the upper airway
      but this has not been characterized physiologically. Also, it is thought that the hemodynamic
      stress associated with OSA may contribute to aortic disease in MFS.

      In this project therefore, the investigators will estimate the closing pressure of the upper
      airway in MFS patients to determine susceptibility. The investigators will also examine the
      hemodynamic responses in periods of obstructed breathing and explore the relationship between
      these responses and aortic vascular parameters in MFS.

      Research Objective/Significance:

      The goal of this proposal is to 1) determine whether higher susceptibility for UAO during
      sleep (ranging from snoring to hypopneas and frank apneas) in MFS is partly mediated by
      increased critical closing pressure (Pcrit) of the upper airway and 2) to determine the
      effect of upper airway obstruction (UAO) on hemodynamics and aortic vascular properties in
      MFS. Hence insights gained from this protocol may explain the increased prevalence of Sleep
      Disordered Breathing (SDB) in MFS and how sleep apnea and snoring could worsen aortic disease
      and other cardiovascular problems in MFS. This knowledge may also extend to persons with
      similar connective tissue diseases like Loeys-Dietz syndrome, vascular type Ehlers-Danlos
      syndrome and Arterial tortuosity syndrome who may also have increased SDB prevalence.

      Specific Aim 1a: The investigators will determine susceptibility to upper airway obstruction
      (UAO) in MFS persons based on structural upper airway properties (Pcrit).

      Specific Aim 1b: The investigators will quantify overnight exposure to UAO estimated by both
      the apnea hypopnea index and a composite measure of pleural pressure swings in both MFS.

      Specific Aim 2a: To quantify the hemodynamic responses to UAO during sleep in persons with
      MFS.

      Specific Aim 2b: To provide exploratory data on the relationship between the hemodynamic
      response to UAO and aortic vascular properties in MFS persons.

      Primary Outcomes:

        -  Critical collapsing pressure (Pcrit) of the upper airway

        -  Overnight measure of hemodynamic stress (blood pressure, heart rate, pleural pressure
           swings)

        -  Apnea Hypopnea Index

      Secondary Outcomes:

        -  Changes in diurnal markers of a hemodynamic stress (augmentation index, reactive
           hyperemia index)

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be assigned to a Baseline polysomnography and CPAP polysomnography in a randomized fashion. Participants will then be switched to the second polysomnography within 14 days of the first. The baseline polysomnography represents the exposure to sleep disordered breathing and the CPAP polysomnography represents the relief of the exposure. Markers of hemodynamic stress will be assessed in the morning after both studies.</intervention_model_description>
