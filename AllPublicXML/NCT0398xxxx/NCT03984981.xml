      The aim of this study is to assess and survey the quality of the process required to diagnose
      brain death in adult patients. This study of adult patients diagnosed brain dead or suspected
      of having brain death on the ICUs at the University Hospital Basel will be purely
      observational.

    <description>the local brain death protocol ( = measurement tool) requires 1.) exclusion of the following conditions:
shock (mean arterial blood pressure &gt; 60 mmHg, lactate &lt; 4 mmol/l)
hypothermia (temperature &gt; 35Â°C)
severe acidosis (pH &gt; 7.3)
hyperosmolarity (osmolarity &lt; 320 mmol/l)
severe electrolyte disorders (sodium &gt; 125 mmol/l, phosphate &gt; 0.3 mmol/l)
hypoglycemia (glucose &gt; 4 mmol/l)
hyperammonemia (ammonia &lt; 60 mumol/l)
uremia (urea &lt; 25 mmol/l)
prolonged effects of medication (muscle relaxants, sedatives, recreational drugs)
severe hypothyreosis
2.) clinical examination confirming:
fixed pupils (dilated or mid-dilated bilaterally)
absent vestibulo-ocular reflex
absent corneal reflex bilaterally
no reaction to painful stimulus bilaterally
absence of cough and gag reflex
absence of spontaneous breathing (apnea test)</description>
