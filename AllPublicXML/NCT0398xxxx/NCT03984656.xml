  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pleural drainage under local anesthesia is a frequent practice in resuscitation, experienced
      as an unpleasant and painful event for patients. Pain management is an important issue for
      early rehabilitation, decrease hospitalisation's cost and shortening the length of stay in
      intensive care unit (ICU). A new type of locoregional anesthesia called Serratus plane block
      described by Blanco in 2013 showed a benefit in per and postoperative analgesia in thoracic
      surgery and carcinologic breast surgery, allowing a decrease in morphine use and an
      improvement of the patient's general satisfaction. Serratus plane block is a very effective
      technique in chest wall analgesia, easy and safe to perform, with few complications. No
      studies to date have evaluated this anesthetic practice in intensive care for pleural
      drainage. This technique could be used outside the operating room to improve the intensive
      care patients, who often have heavier pathologies and greater pain, such as patients with
      chest trauma or patients with cardiac or respiratory disease. The investigators would like to
      conduct a preliminary study of superiority in the CHU Amiens intensive care unit, to study
      the interest of the Serratus plane block in comparison with local anesthesia on the
      management of acute pain during pleural drainage.

    <description>The assessment of acute pain intensity will be done by numerical pain rating scale during plane-by-plane dissection of pleural drainage (H0). The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. The NPRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain.[3] The common format is a horizontal bar or line. Similar to the VAS, the NPRS is anchored by terms describing pain severity extremes. The most commonly used is the 11-item NPRS. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).</description>

    <description>The Serratus plane block is located at the level of the 5th rib, on the midaxillary line, on the drainage side, ultrasound guided. The block is performed with a 70 mm needle in the ultrasound plane, and the needle is directed postero-inferior, after visualization of the structures from the surface to the depth: dorsal muscle
anterior serratus large muscle (serratus anterior)
intercostal muscle
4th and 5th ribs
pleura A single injection of 30 mL of Ropivacaine 4.75 mg / mL is performed around the Serratus muscle.
An intravenous injection of 8 mg of Dexamethasone is added to prolong the duration of the block.</description>
