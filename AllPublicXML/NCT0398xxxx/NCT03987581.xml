  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol contributes to 88,000 deaths and costs an estimated $223 billion annually in the
      United States. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent in veterans. The positive
      public health impact of reducing heavy drinking among veterans with AUD would prevent
      significant medical morbidity and mortality. Contingency management (CM) is an intensive
      behavioral therapy that provides incentives to individuals for reducing substance use.
      Monitoring alcohol abstinence usually requires daily monitoring. Because of this difficulty,
      CM approaches for treatment of AUD are not currently available to people with AUD. Our group
      has developed a mobile smart-phone application that allows patients to video themselves using
      an alcohol breath monitor and transmit the encrypted data to a secure server. This innovation
      has made the use of CM for outpatient AUD treatment feasible. The aim of the current study is
      to evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of CM as an add-on to cognitive
      behavioral therapy for AUD. The trial will also explore the potential usefulness of a
      long-term abstinence incentive ontreatment utilization and alcohol outcomes. Proposed is a
      trial in which 140 veterans with AUD will be randomized to receive either CM as an add-on to
      evidence-based CBT or CBT alone. Veterans will also be randomized to one of two long-term
      incentive conditions (i.e., receipt of a monetary incentive for abstinence/low-risk drinking
      at 6- months vs. no incentive). This project aims to advance AUD treatment by 1) testing the
      effectiveness of a mobile health approach that makes CM for AUD feasible, and 2) providing
      highly needed cost-effectiveness data on the use of behavioral incentives as an adjunct to
      CBT for the treatment of AUD. These aims are designed to address two significant barriers to
      the implementation of CM for AUD.
