    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of mindfulness on physiological stress mechanisms implicated
      in externalizing behaviors and symptoms of affective and traumatic stress among urban
      adolescents. Program effects on stress physiology will be evaluated using pre- and post-tests
      of heart rate variability (HRV) during a stress task. Emotional and behavioral outcomes will
      be measured using student and teacher ratings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-income urban adolescents experience high rates of adversity and trauma exposure,
      increasing their risk for stress-related problems, including externalizing behaviors and
      affective and traumatic stress symptoms. These outcomes are associated with dysregulated
      physiological responses to stress, both in the laboratory and real-world contexts. The
      neuroplasticity that typifies adolescence heightens vulnerability to stress effects on
      various brain and body systems. On the other hand, the same neurodevelopmental features also
      suggest pathways for overcoming and altering stymied trajectories through targeted
      interventions that leverage the brain's plasticity. Thus, adolescence affords a window of
      opportunity to reinforce parasympathetic modulation of stress responses, enhancing capacities
      for emotion regulation and, in effect, protecting against the development of behavioral and
      affective problems.

      There is growing empirical support for the ability of mindfulness-based programs to improve
      stress management in adults, leading to improved well-being, coping and prosocial behavior.
      Evidence suggests that mindfulness influences homeostatic systems that modulate
      neurophysiological responses to stress in the service of emotion regulation. Indeed,
      neuroimaging studies in adults have established that mindfulness measurably improves brain
      function, demonstrating the alterability of these mechanisms. No such data have been
      collected for youth, nor have the psychophysiological mechanisms underlying mindfulness
      program effects for disadvantaged urban youth been rigorously evaluated. The proposed
      research thus has potential to substantively advance understanding of mindfulness mechanisms
      of effects and also to facilitate optimization of mindfulness programming so that it has
      maximum benefits for urban youth.

      This study evaluates the effects of mindfulness on physiological stress mechanisms implicated
      in externalizing behaviors and symptoms of affective and traumatic stress among urban
      adolescents. Program effects on stress physiology will be evaluated using pre- and post-tests
      of heart rate variability (HRV) during a stress task. Emotional and behavioral outcomes will
      be measured using student and teacher ratings.

    <description>HRV is a biomarker of neural regulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and reflects activity in the parasympathetic (PNS) division. HRV is perturbed by stress and can be altered long-term when adversity is prevalent. As such, it has been associated with symptoms of affective and traumatic stress disorders and externalizing behaviors. We will non-invasively monitor the reactivity of HRV using an earlobe sensor to index the PNS. Participants will complete the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST), which is a standard protocol for inducing moderate psychosocial stress in laboratory settings, and has been widely used with preadolescents and adolescents (Gunnar, Wewerka, Frenn, Long, &amp; Griggs, 2009; Kirschbaum, Pirke, &amp; Hellhammer, 1993). The protocol involves preparing and delivering a speech by the participant in the presence of an adult experimenter and while being videotaped. The trained research assistant is instructed to be as non-responsive as possible during the task.</description>

    <description>The Mind in Action is a mindfulness intervention developed by the Holistic Life Foundation (HLF), a Baltimore-based non-profit organization. The curriculum will be delivered over approximately 40 sessions and will follow HLF's typical program modifications for high school students (i.e., sustained focus on breath work and meditation). Each program session will include an initial exercise of focusing on the breath to center oneself, followed by the introduction and practice of different breathing techniques (e.g., rhythmic breathing) that enhance calmness and reduce physiological arousal, and concluding with a brief guided meditation. Instructors will describe benefits of the practices for health and stress management. Participants are given assignments between sessions to reinforce lessons (e.g., breathing exercises or periods of meditation).</description>

    <description>Adapted from the Glencoe Health Curriculum (McGraw Hill), Healthy Topics is designed to control for the effects of a positive adult, time and attention, a small group learning environment, engaged instruction, and interesting material. The Healthy Topics curriculum has been successfully implemented as an effective active control condition, with student engagement and participation comparable to the intervention arm. The curriculum includes information about nutrition, exercise, sleep, drug use, and other topics related to physical health.</description>
