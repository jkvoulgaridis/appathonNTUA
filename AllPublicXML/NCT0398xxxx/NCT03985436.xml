    <textblock>
      This project tests the feasibility a single session pain psychology class (TREK for Surgical
      Success) for patients undergoing spine surgery and compares outcomes in those who engage in
      the class to a historical group of similar patients undergoing usual care perioperatively. As
      of January 2020, the class option has been updated to include an online video module
      platform, to be used for patients unable to attend in person.

      The proposed study intends to utilize a psychobehavioral protocol from Darnall and colleagues
      to deliver a single session behavioral medicine for pain intervention for the spine surgery
      patient entitled &quot;TREK (Transform, Restore, Empower, Knowledge) for Surgical Success&quot; (TREK
      for SS). The intervention is based off of the above noted evidence based 2 hour pain
      psychology class that has been used in the chronic pain population and is also currently
      being tested in other surgical populations. Use of this established and evidenced based
      treatment for the proposed project enhances the treatment fidelity. The proposed project
      addresses questions in the literature such as the benefits of this class in an in-person or
      online format and its adaptability and effectiveness in the spine surgery population.

      The primary objective of the proposed project is to determine the feasibility of a single
      session digital behavioral medicine for pain intervention (TREK for SS) offered the
      perioperative period of lumbar spine surgery as measured by patient satisfaction and
      intervention acceptability ratings and retention rates. In this study the perioperative
      period is defined as a 8 week window straddling the surgery date. A secondary objective of
      the study is to gather preliminary data to support the efficacy of TREK for SS as measured by
      relevant post surgical outcomes compared to a group of historical controls who received usual
      care. Should this pilot study demonstrate effectiveness in lumbar spine surgery patients,
      there is the potential to study larger groups of patients and to integrate the class into the
      standard of care as a cost-effective intervention for the spine surgery population.
      Additionally, findings from this pilot study could substantiate the need for training in the
      class protocol across disciplines so that barriers to receiving pain psychology intervention
      can be minimized.

    <description>Back pain-related disability, The ODI is made up of 10 questions. Each question is scored from 0-5 (minimum to maximum).The point total from each section is summed and the then divided by the total number of questions answered and multiplied by 100 to create a percentage disability. The scores range from 0-100% with lower scores meaning less disability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Castastrophizing pre and post treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>before surgery and 12 weeks post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>13 item scale measuring pain catastrophizing; 5-point scales with the end points (0) not at all and (4) all the time. The PCS yields a total score and three subscale scores assessing rumination, magnification and helplessness. The PCS total score is computed by summing responses to all 13 items.
PCS total scores range from 0 - 52 with higher scores indicating higher catastrophizing</description>

    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-): 9-item depression questionnaire. Nine items, each of which is scored 0 to 3, providing a 0 to 27 severity score. Scores of 0-4 suggest no depression; Scores of 5-9 suggest mild depression; scores of 10-14 suggest moderate depression; scores of 15-19 suggest moderate-severe depression; scores of 20-27 suggest severe depression</description>

Participant's measures are reported as a transformed scale (or T-score). A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured</description>

    <description>This scale measures the construct of pain interference. Pain interference refers to the degree to which pain limits or interferes with an individual's physical, mental, and social activities.
