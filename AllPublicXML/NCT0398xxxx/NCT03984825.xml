  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-sequence, 1-way drug-drug interaction study to investigate the
      effect of GSK3640254 on the pharmacokinetics of a combination oral contraceptive containing
      ethinyl estradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG). Effective contraception for women infected
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is important in the prevention of unplanned
      pregnancies. The study will consist of a screening period of 28 days, check-in (Day -4), a
      run-in period and a treatment period. During the run-in period, subjects will be administered
      PortiaÂ® (0.03 milligrams [mg] EE/0.15 mg LNG) once daily on Days -3 to -1. Subjects will then
      be administered Portia once daily on Days 1 to 10 of treatment period A followed by
      administration of Portia once daily along with GSK3640254 200 mg on Days 11 to 21 of
      treatment period B. The duration of the study is approximately 8 weeks, including Screening
      and Run-in. Portia is a registered trademark of Teva Pharmaceuticals USA.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject, temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other important medical events that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed before.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be 18 to 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          -  Subjects who are healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified
             designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring (history and ECG).

          -  Body weight &gt;=45.0 kilograms (kg) (99 pounds [lbs]) and body mass index (BMI) within
             the range 18.5 to 31.0 kilograms per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive).

          -  Contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of
             contraception for those participating in clinical studies.

          -  Female subjects will be included.

          -  Subject must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Subject is a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) with intact ovarian function, as
             determined by medical history. Subjects must use Portia for the duration of the run-in
             and treatment periods.

          -  WOCBP must have been on an acceptable form of contraceptive for at least 28 days prior
             to start of study intervention. Acceptable forms of contraception prior to study
             intervention include the following: Intrauterine device or intrauterine system;
             Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive; Contraceptive vaginal ring;
             Percutaneous contraceptive patches (if used, the patch must be removed during study
             participation); Bilateral tubal occlusion; Male partner sterilization with
             documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and
             this male is the sole partner for that subject. The documentation on male sterility
             can come from the site personnel's review of subject's medical records, medical
             examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history interview provided by her or her
             partner.; Sexual abstinence.

          -  Subjects who have been on a stable regimen of an oral contraceptive for at least 3
             consecutive months must be without evidence of breakthrough bleeding or spotting.

          -  Subjects who have been taking oral contraceptives should continue their current
             regimen until check-in to the clinic for the run-in period. Subjects not currently
             taking an oral contraceptive are eligible, provided all other eligibility criteria are
             met.

          -  Subjects may proceed to the treatment period provided the toxicity profile during the
             run-in period with Portia is acceptable in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Subjects must agree to use an additional method of contraception from the following
             list of contraceptive methods for the run-in period, treatment period, and for 28 days
             after the last dose of study intervention: Non hormonal Intrauterine device; Bilateral
             tubal occlusion; Male partner sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to
             the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that
             subject. The documentation on male sterility can come from the site personnel's review

             atrioventricular block) which, in the opinion of the investigator or ViiV

          -  Exclusion criteria for screening ECG (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility
             determination): heart rate-&lt;50 or &gt;100 beats per minute and QTcF-&gt;450 milliseconds.
