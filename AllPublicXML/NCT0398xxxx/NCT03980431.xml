  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-labeled single-arm phase II diagnostic clinical trial to explore the
      safety and clinical value of FBY in suspected adult brain tumor patients. A single dose of
      0.15 mCi/kg FBY will be intravenously injected for PET examination. Quantitative features and
      visually-assessed imaging features will be extracted and used to analysis the PET images.
      Cranial MRI (with contrast enhancement) and whole body FDG-PET will also performed as
      diagnostic comparison with FBY. For patient who took surgery after multiple examination,
      histopathology, molecular pathology and LAT-1 immunohistochemistry will also be performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FBY is a new PET tracer derived from tyrosine, with the carboxyl group replaced by boron
      trifluoride, and is transferred across cell membrane through LAT-1. LAT-1 is a sodium
      independent amino acid transporter and is highly expressed in tumor cells. Considering the
      significant role in cancer development as well as in nutrient delivery, FBY could be a
      promising PET tracer to reflect altered metabolism in tumors.

      This study aim to observe the safety of FBY, and investigate the diagnostic, prognostic,
      predictive performance of FBY in the patient with suspected brain tumors. Patients who meet
      the eligibility criteria are included in clinical trials after fully communicating the
      condition, explaining the benefits and risks of clinical trials, clarifying the patient's
      willingness to include the clinical trial, and signing informed consent. The cohort number,
      FBY administrative dose, imaging protocols are decided based on the investigators'
      preliminary data. The diagnosis and post-examination treatment are based on the recommended
      guideline, combined with the subject's own situation for standardized diagnosis and
      treatment.
