  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to examine the diagnostic utility of a novel transmembrane surface
      sensor, and compare signals obtained with the transmembrane sensor to conventional needle EMG
      signals from healthy volunteers to those with documented neurologic pharyngeal muscle
      dysfunction (ALS and muscular dystrophy) and to those with severe OSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transmembrane electromyography (TM-EMG) may be a feasible and valid non-invasive EMG
      technique for detecting neuromuscular (NM) impairment. This study will assess whether, in
      healthy volunteers and participants with known obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other NM
      diseases involving the oropharynx, the same characteristic motor unit potentials obtained on
      conventional needle EMG (NEMG) can be obtained using a TM-EMG sensor. The purpose of this
      study is to demonstrate whether the TM-EMG sensor can provide the same diagnostic accuracy as
      the concentric needle electrode for the diagnosis of NM diseases. Having demonstrated
      diagnostic similarity of TM-EMG to NEMG, the secondary aim of this study is to confirm that
      NM disturbance of oropharyngeal striated muscles in participants with OSA can be elicited
      with the TM-EMG sensor.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, cohort, pilot study with blinded data analysis and two physician testers to assess intertester reliability and device usability. Volunteers will include healthy adults, participants with documented neurologic pharyngeal muscle dysfunction (ALS and muscular dystrophy), and participants with severe OSA. For each participant diagnostic properties of EMG studies will be assessed using a conventional needle and TM-EMG sensor in pharyngeal muscles.</intervention_model_description>
