      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect of GRF6021 on clinical recovery
      parameters in patients undergoing primary hip or knee arthroplasty.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind pilot study to investigate the effects
      of GRF6021, a 5% human plasma protein fraction administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, on
      intracellular signaling cascades in blood leukocytes in subjects undergoing primary hip or
      knee arthroplasty.

    <description>Time to a score of &lt; 18/60 on a subset of questions from the WOMAC, Physical Function Subscale. The WOMAC assesses pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.
This is an 11-point scale (0-10). The range for the Function subscale is 0-60 . The subscales are used independently and not summed. Higher scores = worse (Higher pain score = more pain; higher function score = more impairment)</description>

    <description>The WOMAC total is a sum of scores from the Pain, Stiffness and Function Subscales. The WOMAC assesses pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.
This is an 11-point scale (0-10). The range for the combined subscales is 0-240. (Higher total score = more pain, stiffness, and impairment)</description>

Range: 0-100 Lower = worse Eight subscales
vitality
physical functioning
bodily pain
general health perceptions
physical role functioning
emotional role functioning
social role functioning
