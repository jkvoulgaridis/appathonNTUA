  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to determine the feasibility of an Early Detection
      program that aims to: (i) identify college students at clinical high risk (CHR) of psychosis
      or with first episode psychosis (FEP), and (ii) efficiently link them to coordinated
      specialty care (CSC) services for a 2nd stage screen, a clinical assessment, and appropriate
      treatment. Preliminary estimates of effectiveness with respect to the intervention will also
      be provided.

    <intervention_model_description>A staggered intervention design will be implemented with three distinct stages. 1. Treatment as usual enhanced with a brief psychosis literacy training (45-60 minutes) for counselors at a university's student health counseling center (SHAC); 2. implementation of a screening tool for risk of psychosis; 3. Addition of a warm hand-off to Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC)</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Measured at 1 day (one time point only, which is upon admission to coordinated specialty care (CSC).)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured among those who meet criteria for first episode psychosis or clinical high risk by the Barriers to Seeking Psychological Help Scale (BSPHS). The self-report scale includes 17 items rated on a five point scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Responses corresponding to 5 subscales are summed and range from either 4 to 20 or 3 to 15 with higher scores indicative of higher perceived obstacles. The five subscales include: (1) fear of being stigmatized by society, (2) trust in the mental health professional, (3) difficulties in self-disclosure, (4) perceived devaluation, and, (5) lack of knowledge. See citation for further scoring information for subscales.</description>
