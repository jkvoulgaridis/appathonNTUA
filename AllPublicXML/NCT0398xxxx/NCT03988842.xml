  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the degree to which pulmonary embolism (clot) can be
      dissolved when treated with a very low dose of a systemic thrombolytic drug (clot buster)
      along with standard anticoagulant therapy as compared to the standard of care anticoagulant
      therapy alone.
