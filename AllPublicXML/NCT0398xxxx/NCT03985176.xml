    <textblock>
      Despite the advances in neurosurgical and -radiological techniques and intensive care, the
      mortality and morbidity rates in SAH have not changed in recent years. There is still only a
      limited understanding of the mechanisms of secondary insults causing brain injury after SAH,
      also called delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI).

      In this study, the investigators are exploring the use of quantifiable biomarkers from blood
      and continuous EEG monitoring as tools for the diagnostics of DCI. Additionally, the
      investigators are looking into other clinical variables (eg. pain, heart function) as factors
      of DCI.

    <textblock>
      Subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH) is a cause of long-term disability and death. Annually about
      1000 people in Finland suffer from SAH, their average age being under 50 years. SAH has a
      mortality rate of 12 % acutely and 40 % of patients die within a month from admission to
      hospital. In addition, 30 % of the surviving patients remain with neurological deficits. Most
      survivors of the primary insult suffer from a secondary injury during the first 2-3 weeks
      from the insult.
