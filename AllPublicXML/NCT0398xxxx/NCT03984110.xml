      In this study, we aim to compare the effects of combined use of intravitreal injections of
      Ozurdex every 3 months and monthly Eylea (aflibercept) to monthly intravitreal injections of
      aflibercept alone as measured by improvement in central subfield thickness from baseline at
      Week 48 in eyes with center-involving DME and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 or
      worse

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Type 1 or 2 diabetic patients

          2. At least 18 years of age, understands the language of the informed consent, and is
             willing and able to provide written informed consent before any study procedures

          3. Pseudophakic or phakic lens status with intact posterior lens capsule and/or Nd:YAG
             laser capsulotomy that in the investigator's opinion is not likely to permit
             dislocation of Ozurdex implant into the anterior chamber

          4. Center-involving DME &gt; 300 µm

          5. Baseline BCVA between 20/40 - 20/320

          6. Eyes with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≤ 21 and / or treatment with &lt; 2 topical
             IOP-lowering medications (eyes with history of previous angle -closure or similar
             conditions that have been successfully treated with either laser or surgical
             intervention are allowed as long as the visual fields and optic nerves have been
             stable for &gt; 1 year prior to study entry and the patient has been and can be safely
             dilated)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections including most viral
             diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, including active epithelial herpes simplex
             keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, mycobacterial infections, and
             fungal diseases.

          2. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of Eylea or Ozurdex

          3. Patient has suffered from a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the last 6
             months

          4. Patients using topical anti-inflammatory medication for the duration of the study

          5. Patients with ACIOL (Anterior Chamber Intraocular Lens) and rupture of the posterior
             lens capsule

          6. Prior panretinal photocoagulation or macular laser treatments within 90 days of
             screening

          7. Previous vitrectomy

          8. Any ocular condition that in the opinion of the investigator would not permit
             improvement of visual acuity with resolution of DME (e.g., foveal atrophy, pigment
             abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates and/or poor foveal architecture
             suggestive of photoreceptor loss)

          9. Patients with retinal diseases other than diabetes that can affect macular edema

         10. Eyes with a history of advanced glaucoma (optic nerve head change consistent with
             glaucoma damage and/or glaucomatous visual field loss), uncontrolled ocular
             hypertension (baseline IOP &gt; 21 mmHg despite use of ≥ 2 topical IOP-lowering
             medication)

         11. Eyes with a history of steroid response (i.e., increase of ≥ 5 mmHg IOP following
             topical steroid treatment)

         12. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding

         13. Patients who are unable to attend scheduled follow-up visits throughout the 24-week
             study

         14. Any intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment to study eye within 3 months prior to Day 1

         15. Use of systemic steroid, anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within 4 months prior to
             enrollment or anticipated use during the study (these drugs are prohibited from use
             during the study)

         16. History of any previous treatment in the study eye with an ocular corticosteroid
             implant (eg Iluvien, Ozurdex, Retisert)

         17. Has scarring from laser photocoagulation in the study eye that would compromise VA; or
             scarring or abnormality from other macular condition, in the investigator's medical
             judgement, would limit VA (such as an epiretinal membrane or macular hole)

         18. Has significant media opacity precluding evaluation of retina and vitreous in the
             study eye. This includes cataract that is felt to be a major contributor to reduced
             visual acuity and/or likely to undergo surgical repair within 3 months of
             randomization.

         19. Has any uncontrolled systemic disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             preclude participation in the study (eg, infection, uncontrolled elevated blood
             pressure, cardiovascular disease, poor glycemic control) or put the subject at risk
             due to study treatment or procedures

         20. Has had a myocardial infarction, other acute cardiac event requiring hospitalization,
             stroke, transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure
             within 1 month before enrollment
