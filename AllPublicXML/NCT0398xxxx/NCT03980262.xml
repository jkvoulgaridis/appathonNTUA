  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will address health disparities via a community-engaged approach in partnership
      with black churches. The long-term goals of this integrated project are to: 1) prevent and
      reduce childhood obesity through improved parenting practices and home environment related to
      obesity; 2) expand Extension capacity for community-engaged research and collaborative
      programming with faith-based organizations; 3) enhance Extension strategies for recruiting
      and training community volunteers to extend Extension reach; and 4) train future health
      professionals to provide culturally appropriate collaborative community-based health
      programs. The project will target the school-aged subset (ages 6-11, first through fifth
      grade) of the USDA target age range of ages 2-19. The 14-month randomized control trial
      design of the research component will generate new knowledge regarding effectiveness of a
      integrated family-based intervention enhanced with social and environmental (church) support
      to prevent obesity in school-aged children. The research design with a financial literacy
      active control condition and the primary nutrition and physical activity intervention being
      tested meets two needs expressed by the community partner and allows rigorous evaluation of
      both Extension programs. It is hypothesized that parents in the intervention group will have
      higher levels of self-efficacy for obesity-prevention behaviors, parenting practices related
      to food and physical activity, improved home food and physical activity. The long term impact
      is to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study follows a group-randomized design. Twenty-four churches will participate based on
      feasibility and logistical considerations demonstrated in previous work. Church leaders will
      agree to host the program, identify a church program coordinator to recruit participants and
      facilitate project implementation, and identify at least two volunteers willing to be trained
      to deliver the child curricula. Each church will be randomly assigned to treatment condition
      (HCHF+) or Money-Smart (active control) after baseline data collection. Churches will
      advertise the Empowering Healthy Families program to church members and to the community at
      large. The church coordinator will determine the most effective venues and strategies for
      advertising the program.

      Each church will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: 1) lifestyle and
      parenting intervention for parents with a complementary age-appropriate lifestyle curriculum
      for children and strategies to improve the church health environment (HCHF+); or 2) financial
      literacy curricula (Money Smart) for parents and children (active control). Randomization at
      the level of church takes advantage of social networking within churches. Consistent with
      preliminary research, Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), Social-Ecological Model (SEM) and
      principles of Community based participatory research (CBPR) and community engagement will
      guide the intervention research and will be reflected in all formative, process and outcome
      data collection and analyses. Key stakeholders will be involved in all aspects of the
      research.

      Partners include current partners Baptist General Convention of Virginia (BGCVA), Virginia
      Cooperative Extension's (VCE) Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) Program at Virginia Tech
      (VT) and Virginia State University (VSU, historically black state university), Virginia
      Tech's Center for Public Health Practice and Research (CPHPR) as well as new partners, the
      Family Nutrition Program (FNP) and 4-H Program at VT and VSU. Partner and Community
      Involvement in Project Partners and members of the target communities (state, regional and
      local BGCVA and FNP personnel, church members) will be involved in program planning,
      implementation, evaluation and sustainability as follows: Identifying strategies to address
      local strengths, resources, needs and characteristics; Refining strategies to maximize
      cultural sensitivity for the intervention and research participation, including informed
      consent documents; Refining strategies to recruit churches/church members and maximize
      participant retention; Refining program implementation and evaluation plans to maximize
      program and research fidelity and participation by churches and participants in the education
      program and data collection; Participating in qualitative data collection during formative
      and process evaluation; Identifying effective methods to share project outcomes with local
      and state stakeholders; and Identifying strategies to sustain and expand the program beyond
      the funding period.

      As for data analysis, for qualitative data, a thematic approach will be used to identify
      themes from semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. Audio files will be
      transcribed and transcripts will be reviewed and coded for emergent themes to be checked
      against field notes. A second researcher will review transcripts, field notes and themes and
      discrepancies will be rectified. For quantitative data, descriptive univariate analyses will
      be conducted on all study variables. Data will be checked for outliers, violations of
      normality and missing data. Predictors of drop-out and non-response will be explored to
      better understand any discernible systematic processes in play, taking advantage of the data
      collected until the last time point and demographic variables. If the missingness is found to
      be random and ignorable, multiple imputations will be used to deal with missing data, else,
      an intent-to-treat approach that make full use of available data in determining treatment
      effects will be used for all analyses. Scale scores will be calculated for all outcomes.
      Because each family (parent-child dyad) is nested within churches, and because there may be
      more than one parent or more than one child from each family in the program, the
      investigators will have the advantage of testing family-level effects as well as parent- or
      child-level effects. A three-level clustered longitudinal model with growth trajectories will
      be assessed. Quantitative and qualitative outcomes will be triangulated in order to identify
      the most significant influences on feasibility and sustainability of the interventions and
      intervention partnerships and on church capacity, readiness, and environment for engaging in
      health related programming.

    <measure>Change in Parental self-efficacy at 6- and 12-months: Self-efficacy for Obesity Prevention Related Behaviors instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in parental self-efficacy is measured over time with the 16 item Self-efficacy for Obesity Prevention Related Behaviors Instrument comprised of four validated subscales to assess parent's self-efficacy to help their child get recommended physical activity and fruits and vegetables, and to limit sugary drinks and fruit juice. Specifically, the four subscales are: physical activity (4 items), fruits and vegetables (4 items), sugary drinks (4 items), and fruit juice (4 items). Response options are: not sure, a little sure, sure, very sure, and extremely sure. Scores are summed for each subscale. Scores range from 4 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy (i.e. better outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Child self-efficacy at 6- and 12-months: 3-item response scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in child self-efficacy is measured over time using procedures validated with 5-10 year old children where pictures of healthy food and physical activity choices are paired with a 3-item response scale: (1) they could not make the healthful choices, (2) they could make the healthful choices sometimes, or (3) they could make the healthful choices all the time. Scores can either be summed or averaged with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy to make healthful choices (i.e. better outcome).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in parental feeding practices/self-regulatory behaviors at 6- and 12-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in parental feeding practices/self-regulatory behaviors is measured over time using the 31 item Child Feeding Questionnaire uses a 5-point Likert-type scales with responses across seven factor-based domains: perceived responsibility (3 items), perceived parent weight (4 items), perceived child weight (3 items), concern about child weight (3 items), restriction (8 items), pressure to eat (4 items), and monitoring (3 items). Response options vary for each subscale. Means are calculated for each domain. Scores range from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating higher levels of each domain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in parental supportive behaviors for children's physical activity at 6- and 12-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in supportive behaviors by parents to enable child physical activity is measured over time with 8 items from the Activity Support Scale (ASS). A 4-point response scale measures parent support for children's physical activity, family co-participation in physical activity, and parent encouragement of child outdoor play. Response options are the following: strongly disagree, disagree, agree, strongly agree.The scale has been shown to be sensitive to change related to a community-based intervention in a similar population as is targeted in the study. The mean is calculated, with possible scores ranging from 1 to 4. Higher scores indicate greater levels of support for physical activity (i.e. better outcome)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in home food and physical activity environment at 6- and 12-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in home food and physical activity environment is measured over time with the Healthy Children, Healthy Families Behavior Checklist (HCHF-BC) developed for use with low-income parents of 3- to 11-year old children. The checklist has demonstrated good reliability (test-retest r=0.83) and convergent validity (scores significantly correlated with validated measures of diet, parent modeling, physical activity and home environment). Six subscales measured are the following: fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy foods, soda, energy-dense foods, physical activity, and parenting practices. Response options for each item vary. For each individual item, higher values indicate higher frequency of the corresponding behavior. Authors of the instrument recommended computing mean across the items so that higher scores reflect more healthful practices - for this, behaviors or foods that reduced frequency is recommended, the checklist item should be reverse coded in the mean score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in parent nutrition behaviors at 6- and 12-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in parent nutrition behaviors is measured over time with the validated Block Alive Fat-Sugar-Fruit Vegetable Screener which includes 55 questions and takes about 10-12 minutes. There are two subscales: meat/snacks and fruits/vegetables. For meat and snacks, response options are the following: Once per month or less, 2-3 times per month, 1-2 times per week, 3-4 times per week, and 5 or more times per week. Scores are summed and range from 0 to 60, with higher scores representing greater meat/snack intake. For fruits and vegetables, response options are the following: less than once per week, about once per week, 2-3 times per week, 4-6 times per week, every day, 2 or more times per day. Scores are summed and range from 0 to 35, with higher scores representing greater fruit/vegetable intake.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in parent physical activity at 6- and 12-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in parent physical activity is measured over time with the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and mild activities are multiplied by nine, five, and three metabolic equivalents, respectively, and summed to form a measure of total leisure activity. Interpretation of the scoring is the following: 24 unites or more = Active, 14 - 23 = moderately active, Less than 14 unites = insufficiently Active/Sedentary.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in child nutrition at 6- and 12-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in child nutrition is measured over time using the After School Student Questionnaire (ASSQ), which includes questions about child food choices. Constructs measured include: dietary intake for the previous day (6 items), healthy dietary behaviors (6 items), food knowledge (10 items), nutrition knowledge (3 items), food intentions (8 items), and dietary self-efficacy (8 items). Response options vary for each item. For knowledge items, the percentage of correct responses are summed. Higher scores indicated greater knowledge (i.e. better outcome). For behavior and self-efficacy, mean or sum scores are calculated with higher scores indicating higher behavior frequency and high self-efficacy (i.e. better outcome)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in child sedentary behavior and physical activity at 6- and 12-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in child sedentary behavior and physical activity is measured over time using the After School Student Questionnaire (ASSQ), which includes questions about mild and moderate levels of physical activity and physical activity self-regulation. Specific subscales include: physical activity self-efficacy (4 items), participation in sports activities (2 items), and participation in sedentary activities (4 items). For physical activity subscales, sum scores are calculated with higher scores indicating higher frequency of the behavior and self-efficacy (i.e. better outcome). For sedentary behavior, sum scores are calculated with higher scores indicating higher sedentary behavior (i.e. worse outcome)</description>

    <measure>Change in Child and Parent Body Mass Index (BMI) at 6- and 12-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Child and Parent Body Mass Index (BMI) is measured over time without shoes to the nearest ¼ inch using a portable stadiometer. Weight will be measured in light clothing without shoes to the nearest 0.2 pound using a portable digital scale. BMI z-score is recommended for child obesity prevention research. BMI will be calculated from measured height and weight (kg/M2). The better outcome would to see a decrease in BMI for those overweight or obese.</description>
