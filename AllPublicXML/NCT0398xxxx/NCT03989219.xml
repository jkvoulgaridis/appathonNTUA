  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients found pulmonary nodules by CT screening by will be enrolled in this study
      prospectively. Plasma cfDNA sequencing of these patients will be used to diagnose and monitor
      benign and malignant pulmonary nodules.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study prospectively included patients with pulmonary nodules (0.5-3 cm) diagnosed by CT.
      Methylation of plasma cfDNA in these patients will be performed. Evaluation of benign and
      malignant diagnostic efficacy of cfDNA methylation in pulmonary nodules with definite
      pathological findings. Pulmonary nodules that temporarily not require invasive examination
      will be performed CT follow-up and dynamically monitored methylation changes of cfDNA. And
      the methylation changes were to establish a model for the diagnosis and monitor of benign and
      malignant pulmonary nodules.

               1. Patients diagnosed with malignant tumors in the past;

               2. This image suggests pulmonary nodules with hilar or mediastinal lymph node
                  enlargement；

               3. Pulmonary nodules are suspected of intrapulmonary metastasis of lung cancer or
                  other malignancies；

               4. Past diseases or conditions that affect plasma cfDNA content, such as rheumatoid
                  immunity and diseases of the blood system.
