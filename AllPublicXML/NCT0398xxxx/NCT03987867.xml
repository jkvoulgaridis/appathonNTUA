      pemetrexed injection 500mg/m2, d1; carboplatin injection AUC 5, d1; CIK cells venous
      re-transfusion &gt;=1x10^10, d14; Q3W, for 4 cycles. Then sintilimab and pemetrexed maintenance
      treatment for 2 years. In the squamous NSCLC, patients received sintilimab Injection (PD-1
      inhibitor) 200mg, d1; liposome paclitaxel injection 135mg/m2, d1; carboplatin injection AUC
      5, d1; CIK cells venous re-transfusion &gt;=1x10^10, d14; Q3W, for 4 cycles. Then sintilimab

             therapy (such as thyroxine, insulin, or physiological corticosteroid replacement
             therapy for adrenal or pituitary dysfunction) is not a systemic treatment.
