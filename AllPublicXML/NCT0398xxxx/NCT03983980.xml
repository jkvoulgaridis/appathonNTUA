  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind vehicle-controlled Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of topical tapinarof cream, 1% once daily for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in
      adults. Approximately 500 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis will be randomized 2:1 to
      receive either tapinarof cream, 1% or matching vehicle cream once daily for 12 weeks.

      This study is a 12-week double-blind, vehicle-controlled treatment study in which subjects
      will be randomized to receive tapinarof cream, 1% or vehicle cream once daily for 12 weeks.
      At the end of the 12-week study treatment, qualified subjects completing the study will have
      the option to enter a separate open-label, long-term safety and efficacy study for an
      additional 40 weeks of treatment with tapinarof cream, 1%. Subjects who do not enroll in the
      open-label long-term study will complete a follow-up visit approximately 4 weeks after end of
      treatment in this study (at Week 16).

    <measure>Proportion of subjects who achieve a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with a minimum 2-grade improvement from Baseline at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a subject's psoriasis at a given timepoint. It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness/elevation as guidelines. Higher PGA scores represent more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of subjects with ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from Baseline at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI scoring system is a widely-used standard clinical tool for assessing the severity of psoriasis that takes into account the overall severity of erythema (redness), induration (plaque thickness), and scale, and the extent of %Body Surface Area (BSA) affected with psoriasis. The 3 clinical signs are each graded on a 5-point scale (0 to 4) and the %BSA affected is scored on a 7-point scale (0 to 6) for each of the 4 specified body regions (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities). The individual scores are multiplied by a weighted factor for each body region; the sum of these scores gives the overall PASI score. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. PASI is a static assessment made without reference to previous scores.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of %BSA affected is an estimate of the percentage of total involved skin with psoriasis. For the purpose of clinical estimation, the total palmar surface of the subject's palm and digits may be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1% BSA. The %BSA affected by psoriasis will be evaluated (from 0% to 100%). %BSA is a static assessment made without reference to previous scores.</description>
