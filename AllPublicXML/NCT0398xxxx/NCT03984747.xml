    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective study designed to collect blood samples from transplant
      patients in order to improve Natera's method for determining allograft rejection status using
      the donor-derived cell-free DNA analysis, called Prospera.

      This is a multi-center prospective study designed to collect blood samples from transplant
      patients in order to improve Natera's method for determining allograft rejection status using
      the donor-derived cell-free DNA analysis, called Prospera.

      Subjects who have had an organ transplant, who present at the clinic for a standard of care
      visit or consent for an extra research blood samples to be taken by mobile phlebotomy, meet
      the study's eligibility criteria and are willing to participate in this research, will be
      consented and enrolled in this study.

      Subjects will provide at least one blood sample at study enrollment and up to three optional
      follow-up blood samples at future visits. Relevant medical data will also be collected for
      each patient enrolled.

      Urine samples may also be collected at the above described time-points.

      Up to 500 subjects over the age of 2 worldwide who meet the study eligibility criteria are
      expected to be enrolled in this study. The study includes adult, pregnant, and pediatric
      subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To develop an assay to detect allograft rejection status in transplant patients involving amplification of donor-derived cell-free DNA from donor recipient blood.</measure>
    <time_frame>1-3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of the assay developed in this study would be allograft rejection high risk or low risk. This assay result will be compared to the biopsy pathology report which assesses if the transplant organ is in a state of rejection, or not. We are also measuring the donor cell free DNA, which is presumably indicating of an organ being rejected or not. Alterations in the cut off of that donor derived cell free DNA level that is allocated to high risk of rejection will be explored. Sensitivity and specificity of our assay will be calculated as needed for the purpose of validating and improving our technology in detecting donor derived cfDNA from a transplant recipient's blood. No results will be reported to patients or their treating physicians.</description>
