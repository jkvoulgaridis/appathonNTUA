    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of an innovative point of service cancer genetics
      counseling delivery model for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients whom have received a
      referral for hereditary cancer genetic counseling and testing.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients/participants that undergo hereditary cancer genetic testing after the telehealth intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the number of participants who opt to undergo hereditary cancer genetic testing as a percentage of the total number of participants enrolled.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall participant satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be assessed with an adapted Genetic Counseling Satisfaction Scale (aGCSS). Each item is scored from 1- 5, with 1 being strongly disagree and 5 being agree strongly. The scores are added then divided by 5 to give a mean score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical decisional conflict score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional conflict will be assessed using the Decisional Conflict Scale (Sure Test Version). The 4 items are summed. Scores range from 0 (extremely high decisional conflict) to 4 (no decisional conflict). A score of less than or equal to 3 indicates decisional conflict.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall participant anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant anxiety will be assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-Anxiety scale). Each item is scored between 0- 3 with a total score between 0- 21 possible. Scores of 0-7 indicates normal; scores of 8-10 indicates borderline abnormal; scores of 11-21 indicates abnormal.</description>

    <description>After the informed consent is signed, the participant will watch a standardized video on the principles of genetic testing. At the end of the video, the provider will return to answer any remaining questions. The participant will receive pre- and post- surveys for evaluation of the delivery model.</description>
