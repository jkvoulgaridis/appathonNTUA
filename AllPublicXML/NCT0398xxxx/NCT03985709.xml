  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiome appears to be a significant contributor to musculoskeletal health and
      disease. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with
      prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. Genetic background, gender, dietary
      intake, and social factors are also important factors which contribute to the musculoskeletal
      health, as well as to the normal balance of intestinal microbiota. The link between gut
      microbiota and joint inflammation in murine models of arthritis has been established, and it
      is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated
      substantial alterations in the gut microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
      osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic inflammatory
      conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritides, psoriasis), which include
      decreased microbial diversity and lower abundances of bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes
      phylum that are known to have immunoregulatory properties.These new findings open important
      future horizons both for understanding disease pathophysiology and for developing novel
      biomarkers and treatment strategies. Further investigation into the mechanisms linking
      changes in the microbiome to alterations in bones and joints is necessary. Next Generation
      Sequencing, metatranscriptomic analysis, and metabolomic approaches may provide yet-greater
      insight and help further understand these mechanisms. To investigate gut microbiota change
      will be associated with the sintoms of knee and / or hip OA in italian patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects will have hip or knee OA according on radiographic findings
             (Kellgren-Lawrence scale ≥3). A physiatrist (physician) will establish the diagnosis
             of pain-OA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Psychiatric or neurological disorders, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or
             allergies or other ongoing illnesses (i.e., irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes,
             ulcerative colitis, etc.) or recent antibiotic treatment (i.e., &lt;3 months before the
             beginning of the study).

          -  Participants require treatment with aspirin &gt; 325 mg /day.

          -  Participants who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day were excluded.

          -  Participants will be excluded also if they score greater than 6 points on the Beck
             Depression Inventory (BDI) or more than 30 points in the State Trait Anxiety Inventory
             (STAI), dementia and not Italian speaking due to the high level of language skills
             required for questionnaires and quantitative sensory testing.

          -  Post-traumatic OA (e.g., fractures), congenital hip deformities, surgical
             interventions to the hip or knee, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, or degenerative or
             non-degenerative neurological conditions in which pain perception is altered will be
             excluded
