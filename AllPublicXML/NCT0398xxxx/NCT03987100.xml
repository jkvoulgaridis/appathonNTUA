  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of NEOPOPI is to conduct a population pharmacokinetic study of amoxicillin in
      neonates, in order to evaluate and optimize neonatal dose regimen.

      There will be no change to the medication treatment received by participants. An
      opportunistic pharmacokinetic sampling approach will be followed: samples will be scavenged
      from blood or cerebrospinal fluid drawn for routine biochemical tests. In this way, no
      additional invasive tests will be needed.

      -  Administration of the antibiotic according to the usual procedures for prescribing
           services: in particular, neither the indications nor the doses nor the methods of
           administration are fixed by the protocol

        -  Opportunistic sampling strategy: no biological samples are specifically collected for
           the purposes of the study (measurements of concentrations on &quot;bottoms&quot; or &quot;left-over&quot;
           samples); the performance of this non-invasive sampling strategy has been previously
           demonstrated in the neonatal population.

        -  Micro-analytical method (assay of concentrations on micro-volumes, of the order of 50μL)

        -  Population pharmacokinetic analysis

    <measure>Achievement rate of therapeutic efficacy target of amoxicillin</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Achievement rate of therapeutic efficacy target of amoxicillin (ie percentage of neonates in whom amoxicillin plasma concentration remains above the MIC of target organisms for more than 70% of the dose range). In accordance with the recommendations of the European Medicines Agency, the optimal dosage regimen is defined as leading to a probability of antibiotic therapy success of greater than or equal to 90%. Thus, it is necessary to determine the dosage regimen allowing the target of therapeutic efficacy to be reached (ie maintenance of the plasma concentration of amoxicillin greater than the MIC of the targeted microorganisms for more than 70% of the dose) in at least 90% of treated neonates.</description>

    <description>Collection of MICs of amoxicillin for isolated germs. For amoxicillin the antibacterial activity is time-dependent, the predictor of efficacy is the &quot;Time&gt; MIC&quot;: this is the percentage of the administration interval during which the concentration of the antibiotic remains higher than the MIC of target germs</description>
