  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparative effectiveness study using an individual-level randomized design along with a
      pragmatic, mixed-methods approach to compare two strategies (e.g. in-person supported care,
      technology-supported care) all of which include evidence-based components for delivering IBD
      and BH care. Quantitative (e.g. self-report, electronic health record, process) and
      qualitative (e.g., interviews) data will be collected across multiple time points during the
      study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a comparative effectiveness research (CER) study of two
      evidence-based, patient-centered approaches implemented within an existing Specialty Medical
      Home (SMH) model: TEAM, an in-person, multidisciplinary team-based approach delivered at
      point of care and TECH, a technology-based (digital therapeutics, and telehealth) approach
      delivered at the patient's convenience with the guidance of health coaches. Both are designed
      to support care for adult patients with complex, chronic health conditions and behavioral
      health (BH) disorders, and will be tested in three of the nation's largest and most
      established SMHs for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD serves as an exemplary chronic
      disease model where untreated BH issues have been associated with poor medical outcomes.
