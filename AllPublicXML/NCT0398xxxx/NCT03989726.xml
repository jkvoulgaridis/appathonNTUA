  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of high density voltage and
      fractionation map guided ablation compared to anatomy-based circumferential pulmonary vein
      Isolation in patients with atrial fibrillation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a test group includes those who undergoing atrial fibrillation(AF) ablation
      guided by high density voltage and fractionation map. A control group will be chosen from
      database of patients who underwent AF ablation between 2018-2019. A control group includes
      the same number of consecutive patients who underwent anatomy-based circumferential pulmonary
      vein (PV) isolation.

    <description>Complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE), voltage and fractionation map will be performed with a multielectrode mapping catheter.
The mapping should be performed in AF.
First, low-voltage zone is defined as an area with bipolar peak-to-peak voltage amplitudes &lt; 0.5mV.
A voltage-map guided segmental PV isolation is performed. Radiofrequency energy is applied in the antral regions of the PVs. High voltage zone over 0.5mV in the antral region is targeted. IF PV isolation in not achieved by voltage-guided segmental ablation, additional Lasso catheter guided segmental antral ablation is performed.
Radiofrequency energy is delivered at target sites for 15-30 sec guided by contact force, lesion size index (LSI) and local electrogram elimination.
If the patient is still in AF after PV isolation, additional fractionation map guided ablation is performed. The fractionation area within low voltage area (&lt;0.5mV) should be targeted.</description>
