  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare PK, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of SIBP-01 (Trastuzumab
      Biosimilar) in combination with Docetaxel and Carboplatin versus Herceptin® (CN-Trastuzumab)
      approved in the CN in combination with Docetaxel and Carboplatin in patients with operable
      HER2 positive, with early or locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. The hypothesis to
      be tested in this study is the tpCR of patients with Cycle 6 of SIBP-01 is similar to
      CN-approved trastuzumab, using a 90% bilateral confidence interval between 0.74 and 1.5.
