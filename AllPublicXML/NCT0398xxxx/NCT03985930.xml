      This is a multicenter, randomized, clinical trial comparing treatment as usual to distraction
      with video projection or virtual reality in the management of pediatric (&lt;6 years) pain
      associated with venipuncture, intramuscular injection, and vaccination.

      Background: Recent studies have shown that the use of virtual reality (VR) may be useful to
      provide distraction that attenuates pain in minimally invasive procedures in preschool
      children.

      Aim: Assess the effect on pain of distraction with virtual reality or video projections
      during procedures of venipuncture, administration of intramuscular medication and vaccination
      to children under 6 years of age.

      Method: This clinical trial will recruit patients under 6 years of age treated at
      participating medical centers in whom a painful procedure like vaccination, venipuncture or
      administration of intramuscular medication will be performed. The experimental group will
      consist of two subgroups which, in addition to treatment as usual, will be distracted using
      either video projections or virtual reality. Children in the experimental group between 12
      months and 3 years of age will be distracted using video projections, and those between 3 and
      6 years of age will be distracted using virtual reality content delivered through goggles.
      The control group will receive treatment as usual. The LLANTO pain scale will be used to
      measure different characteristics of pain. This scale has been validated in Colombia, and
      will be filled by two health professionals, one of which will perform the painful procedure.

      Expected results: To show that virtual reality or projector distraction are effective
      distraction tools in pain management for children subjected to painful procedures of
      venipuncture, intramuscular medication administration, and vaccination.

    <description>Children between the ages of 3 and 6 years will be distracted using virtual reality content delivered through goggles.
