  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare and evaluate two strategies of delivering PrEP and
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) treatment to people who inject drugs to determine the best method of
      providing care. Participants will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: on-site
      integrated care or off-site referral to specialized care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first strategy, the on-site integrated care model, provides opioid agonist therapy (OAT)
      clinics and harm reduction sites/syringe access programs (SAP) with the tools to offer HIV
      prevention and HCV treatment on-site. The second strategy, the off-site referrals to
      specialized care model, connects people who are at risk for contracting HIV with patient
      navigators who help them access available HIV prevention care and, if necessary, HCV
      treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>This trial is an open-label, multi-site, multi-center, randomized, controlled,superiority trial with two parallel treatment arms. The study is a type-1 hybrid effectiveness implementation study. Participants will be randomized to the on-site integrated care with adherence counselling treatment or the off-site referral to specialized care group with patient navigation in a 1:1 ratio using a permuted-block randomization scheme.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This trial is an open-label, un-blinded study. Given the pragmatic nature of the trial, participants, providers and research staff will not be blinded. Research and clinical staff will be blinded to the randomization procedure to prevent predictions about participant assignment.Research and clinical staff will initially be blinded to arm assignment to avoid bias, but after baseline the research and clinical staff will not be blinded.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>6-months post treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>HCV cure among the HCV positive strata will be compared between both treatment arms at six (6) months post treatment initiation. HCV cure is defined as initiating HCV treatment within six (6) months of being randomized and achieving sustained viral response 12 weeks (SVR-12) post-treatment. HCV treatment initiation will be measured using self-report and by assessing medical/drug dispensation records. SVR-12 will be measured by testing HCV-RNA negative 12 weeks after end of HCV treatment. If a participant initiates treatment within six (6) months of randomization but does not achieve SVR-12, they will not be counted as a success. Likewise, if a participant who is randomized as HCV positive achieves SVR-12 but did not initiate treatment within 6-months of randomization, they will not be counted as a success.</description>

    <description>HCV status will be determined by HCV-Ab testing, and if positive,HCV-RNA testing. New incidence of HCV will be defined as an HCV-Ab positive test results in participants who were HCV-Ab negative at a previous testing visit and HCV-Ab positive/HCV-RNA positive test results in participants who had previously tested HCV-Ab positive/HCV-RNA negative</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the on-site integrated care with adherence counselling arm will be prescribed pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (Truvada®) and, if indicated, Hepatitic C (HCV) treatment (Epclusa®) at the OAT clinic or SAP from which they were recruited. In addition to PrEP and, if indicated, HCV care, participants in the on-site integrated care arm will receive any required health care services as per local standard of care. Addiction treatment, OAT, and mental health services will be provided, if necessary and available. Participants recruited at syringe access programs (SAP) will be offered addiction counseling and treatment, including OAT when in the integrated care arm in addition to site standard of care.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Off-site Referral to Specialized Care with Patient Navigation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants randomized to the off-site referral to specialized care and patient navigation group will be linked to primary care for PrEP and, if necessary, HCV treatment by a patient navigator. Given the replicated success of the AntiRetroviral Treatment Access Study (ARTAS) intervention regarding linking HIV-infected individuals to HIV primary care, we adapted ARTAS to facilitate people who inject drugs linkage with PrEP and, if necessary, HCV treatment services. Participants in the off-site care arm will be prescribed PrEP and, if necessary, HCV treatment by their off-site physician. All necessary care will also be provided to participants by their off-site physician. Off-site physicians will be notified that if their patients are placed on a waiting list, unable to afford, or are otherwise unable to immediately access PrEP or HCV treatment, Truvada® and Epclusa® are available to participants of the M2HepPrEP study immediately and free of charge.</description>

    <intervention_name>ARTAS Adapted Patient Navigation</intervention_name>
    <description>Patient navigation will provided by trained patient navigators to participants randomized to the off-site referral to specialized care arm. Patient Navigators will actively coordinate and link participants to available clinics and community resources by scheduling appointments, arranging transportation, and assisting the participant with completing any paperwork that a clinic or service agent may require. The intervention will include up to five, 30-45 minute face-to-face meetings between the patient navigator and participant. These meetings will be tailored around each participant's needs. Additionally, the patient navigator assists the participant in identifying and utilizing informal and formal sources of support to move along the PrEP and/or HCV care continuum.The patient navigator will help the participant inform off-site physicians of the trial and of the availability of PrEP and HCV medication, should the physician and patient decide to initiate one or both treatments.</description>

    <intervention_name>Adherence Counseling</intervention_name>
    <description>Counseling for PrEP initiation and adherence and, if necessary, HCV treatment will be provided by the clinical counseling staff of the on-site integrated care arm. Adherence counseling will include, but not be limited to, the indications, advantages, and disadvantages (e.g. side effects) of PrEP and HCV treatment in order to help the participant with his/her decision. The counselor will provide any necessary information to the participants and help them to address health and social needs. If required, the counselor will help the patient and physician with insurance-related issues. Adherence counselling will be carried out in a motivational style. The intervention will include five 30-45 minute face-to-face meetings with the participant and the adherence counselor over 6 months.</description>
