      The study is a self-controlled study in which we will assess the safety and efficacy of Kate
      Farm Peptide 1.5 tube feeding in patients with gastroparesis, relative to their
      pre-enrollment tube feeding regimen.

      The study is a prospective self-controlled study in which we will assess the nutritional
      effects of Kate Farm Peptide 1.5 tube feeding in patients with gastroparesis, relative to
      their pre-enrollment tube feeding regimen.

      The duration of the study will be 12 weeks. We plan to recruit a total of 30 patients.
      Patients will undergo a baseline measurement of their height, weight, symptom burden, resting
      energy expenditure, inflammation, and microbiome. After study initiation, patient will
      undergo repeat testing at 1- and 3-months post-enrollment. Including the screening and
      baseline visits, there will be a total of 4 visits required to complete the study.
