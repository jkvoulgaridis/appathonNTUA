  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current treatment approaches for peripheral artery disease are largely unsatisfactory.
      Therefore, diseased tissue will be collected as well as patient-specific arterial geometries.
      The tissue will be tested microstructurally and mechanically to obtain data required to
      optimize treatment methods through in silico modeling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a severe cause of morbidity in patients. Common treatment
      approaches are too often still unsatisfactory. Angioplasty is commonly followed by
      restenosis, caused by overloading of the arterial tissue. This study is aimed at improving
      this treatment approach through the in silico simulation of arterial remodeling after balloon
      expansion. Such simulations require the input of a patient-specific geometry and the
      mechanical properties of (diseased) arterial tissue.

      Patients scheduled for an above knee lower limb amputation due to critical ischemia will be
      recruited in this study. After the surgery, the femoralis superficialis will be collected, as
      well as the CT or MR angiogram obtained before the surgery. The arterial tissue will be
      mechanically tested to obtain material properties and the medical image will be used to
      determine the arterial geometry. A correlation study will be carried out to explore the
      possibility of including a predictive simulation of the restenosis outcome of balloon
      angioplasty in the clinical practice.
