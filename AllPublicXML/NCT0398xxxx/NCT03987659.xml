  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apical periodontitis is a dental infection which develops around the root of a tooth and
      affects ~4-6% of the UK population. Current treatment strategies focus solely on removing
      bacteria from within the root canal space during Non-Surgical Root Canal Treatment (NSRCT).
      Despite radical improvements in techniques available to disinfect canals, over the last 2-3
      decades there has been no proportionate improvement in success rates, with ~20% of cases
      failing to demonstrate complete healing following NSRCT. Over time this has placed
      significant burden on public resources as evidenced by increased referrals to dental
      hospitals, extensive waiting lists and increased use of anti-microbials.

      It has long been known numerous bioactive molecules (dentine extracellular matrix components
      [dECM]) exist within the structure of the dentine. In a laboratory setting, they have
      demonstrated significant antibacterial properties and the ability to induce the functional
      processes of dental tissue repair. Through a different irrigation procedure, our group have
      optimised methods for releasing dECMs during NSRCT and hypothesise this intervention could
      potentially promote a reduction in inflammation, improve healing and lead to more favourable
      outcomes for patients suffering from apical periodontitis, a concept which has not yet been
      investigated. We propose to test this hypothesis at the Birmingham Dental Hospital by
      comparing clinical/radiographic signs of periradicular healing, and the molecular
      inflammatory response, in patients undergoing standard NSRCT (control arm) to those who
      having NSRCT with an irrigant regime that promotes release of dEMCs (intervention arm).

      Data generated from this randomised controlled pilot study will not only help us understand
      the process of healing following treatment of apical periodontitis at a molecular level, but
      also help us explore if there is therapeutic potential in enhancing dEMC release during
      NSRCT.

    <description>Clinical/radiographic information (i.e. absence of pain and resolution of swelling, pain on percussion / palpation and reduction in size of periradicular lesion) will be collected at baseline and again at a 12 month follow-up. Treatment success will be determined based on criteria outlined by the European Society of Endodontology (ESE) Quality Guidelines for NSRCT (2006). In these criteria, outcomes are defined as being &quot;favourable&quot; (absence of pain, swelling and other symptoms, no sinus tract, no loss of function and radiological evidence of a complete healing), &quot;uncertain&quot; (absence of pain, swelling and other symptoms, no sinus tract, no loss of function and radiographic evidence of some healing) and finally &quot;unfavourable&quot; (tooth associated with clinical signs and symptoms of infection such as pain and swelling, sinus tract, loss of function and no radiographic evidence of healing.</description>
