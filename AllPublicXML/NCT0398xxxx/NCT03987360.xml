      The past decade has been characterized by the involvement of Museums in individual health
      prevention and promotion by using art-based activities to improve quality of life and
      well-being. Visiting museum or over cultural and educational activity could be used for
      health prevention and promotion. For the development of appropriate educational and cultural
      activities, there is a need, first, to improve knowledge about social and health condition of
      older adult, and second to examine the effects of engagement in educational and social
      activity on incidence of health adverse events.
