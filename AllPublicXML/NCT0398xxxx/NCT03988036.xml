             embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred over slides. Newly obtained biopsies are
             preferred over archived tissue.

        Note: If submitting unstained cut slides, newly cut slides should be submitted to the
        testing laboratory within 14 days from the date slides are cut.

          -  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not

        During the screening phase, the following criteria must be confirmed for the participant to
        remain in the study for treatment allocation. (If these criteria are not met, the patient
        becomes a screening failure).

        Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the
        first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed
        and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication.

             first treatment allocation.

          -  Have a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening or performed in clinical
             routine within 6 weeks prior to first treatment allocation.
