        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as
             based on a complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP,
             PR), 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (inclusive)

          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

          -  Male subjects, or female subjects who meet any of the following criteria from the
             first administration of trial medication until 30 days after trial completion:

               -  Use of adequate contraception that does not contain hormones, i.e. nonhormonal
                  intrauterine device plus condom

               -  Sexually abstinent

               -  A vasectomised sexual partner (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to enrolment)

               -  Surgically sterilised (including hysterectomy)

               -  Postmenopausal, defined as at least 1 year of spontaneous amenorrhea (in
                  questionable cases a blood sample with levels of FSH above 40 U/L and estradiol
                  below 30 ng/L is confirmatory)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal
             and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  Further exclusion criteria apply

    <ipd_description>Clinical studies sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim, phases I to IV, interventional and non‐interventional, are in scope for sharing of the raw clinical study data and clinical study documents, except for the following exclusions:
1. studies in products where Boehringer Ingelheim is not the license holder; 2. studies regarding pharmaceutical formulations and associated analytical methods, and studies pertinent to pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials; 3. studies conducted in a single center or targeting rare diseases (because of limitations with anonymization).
