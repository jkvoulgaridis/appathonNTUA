      There has been increasing awareness regarding the risk of radiation exposure to patients and
      providers when performing procedures requiring fluoroscopic guidance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluoroscopy guidance is routinely used in many endoscopic procedures per standard-of-care
      practice and there is increasing effort to minimize the degree of radiation exposure to
      patients and providers during fluoroscopy usage. The current fluoroscopy machine used per
      standard-of-care practice at the Center for Interventional Endoscopy is the Eview machine
      (Omega Medical Imaging, Orlando, FL, USA). Recently, CA-100S technology (FluoroShield, Omega
      Medical Imaging) has been developed in an effort to further reduce the degree of radiation
      exposure to patients and provides. This technology is an additional component that can be
      fitted to the preexisting Eview fluoroscopy machine, in order to further filter radiation
      that has passed through the pre-existing machine. The investigators will be performing this
      study to determine the degree of radiation exposure to patients and providers when using the
      Eview fluoroscopy machine, with and without the FluoroShield radiation exposure reduction
      system.

      There has been increasing awareness regarding the risk of radiation exposure to patients and
      providers when performing procedures requiring fluoroscopic guidance. In a prior study, the
      Eview machine, which is currently used for fluoroscopy guidance at the Center for
      Interventional Endoscopy, was shown to decrease, but not completely eliminate, radiation
      exposure when compared to C-arm type of fluoroscopy machines (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI,
      USA). Recently, the FluoroShield technology (Omega Medical Imaging) has been developed in an
      effort to further reduce the degree of radiation exposure to patients and provides. This
      technology is an additional component that can be fitted to the preexisting Eview fluoroscopy
      machines, in order to further filter radiation that has passed through the pre-existing
      machine.
