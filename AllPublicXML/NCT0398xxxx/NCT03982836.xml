  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The digestive process begins in the mouth and follows in the stomach and intestine. In the
      stomach the food is mixed with the gastric juices forming the chyme. To mix the food with the
      gastric juice as well as to provide gastric emptying (GE), the movements of the stomach are
      of great importance. Intestinal transit time is understood of the combination of GE, small
      intestine transit and colon transit time. The composition of the diet (lipid and protein
      content) exerts a direct influence on intestinal transit time due to the stimulation of
      hormone secretion, cholecystokinin and gastrin, respectively, which act to decrease GE
      velocity. In this context, it is also observed an important influence of dietary fibers on
      the speed of GE. Despite all knowledge about dietary fibers, information on such compounds
      still has many controversies. Due to the difficulty of finding compounds that fit into only
      one specific category (viscous, fermentable or prebiotic) there is difficulty in establishing
      a concept that best defines what are dietary fibers. The CODEX Alimentarius Commission in
      2009 defined dietary fibers as carbohydrate polymers composed of ten or more monomer units of
      this macronutrient, which are not hydrolyzed by enzymes in the human intestine. Dietary
      fibers can be classified into insoluble and soluble according to the ability to bind to water
      molecules and form gels. Soluble fibers, especially those classified as prebiotic, in the
      intestine are fermented by bacteria giving rise to short chain fatty acids (SCFA). The SCFA
      stimulates the production and secretion of PYY and GLP-1 are associated with inhibition of
      gastric motility. Due to the importance of knowing the intestinal transit time, several
      methods have been developed, but scintigraphy is the gold standard technique for this
      analysis. Given the above and controversies present in the literature on the dietary fibers,
      there was a shortage of studies with the objective of evaluating the impact of different
      dietary fibers in intestinal transit time. This study shows relevant to help elucidate the
      behavior of different dietary fibers in intestinal transit time, offering data for correct
      and safe use of dietary fibers in various clinical situations. The hypothesis of this study
      is that the partially hydrolyzed guar gum delays the time of gastric emptying and intestinal
      transit, being this effect not observed for fructooligosaccharide

    <intervention_model_description>It is a cross-sectional study, where the volunteer should attend the study area on three different days with a minimum washout of 7 days, each day receiving a sandwich containing one of the modules studied in a randomized manner (Partially Hydrolyzed Guar Gum, Fructooligosaccharide or Maltodextrin) and will be instructed to ingest this sandwich in the maximum time of 10 minutes. The volunteers should on an 8-hour fast. Samples of blood will be collected in the fasting, 60 and 180 minutes after the injection of the sandwich for intestinal hormone dosage.</intervention_model_description>
