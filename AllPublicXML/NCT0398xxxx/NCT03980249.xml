      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the addition of carvedilol with standard of
      care treatment to determine if it will improve progression-free survival in the front line
      setting in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In addition, monitoring of
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
      (qRT-PCR) assay to correlate with the clinical findings.

      This is a pilot study to assess efficacy of the addition of a non-selective beta-blocker to
      standard of care treatment in the front-line setting of glioblastoma multiforme. And to also
      evaluate the level of peripheral glioma circulating tumor cells via TeleomeScan assay to
      correlate disease response determined by neuro-imaging.

      Peripheral blood samples will be collected at baseline, on day 1 of cycle 1 and then after on
      day 1 of cycle 4 and at the end of cycle 6 of adjuvant chemotherapy. in order to correlate
      the biological effects of treatment response. The investigators will evaluate the quantity of
      peripheral glioma circulating tumor cells and want to apply the information seen in the
      periphery to the status of the cancer on imaging studies.

      Subjects will start oral carvedilol at 6.25 mg orally twice daily and will evaluate the
      patient and vital status if they tolerate this dose at 1-2 weeks after initiation. If
      tolerated well, will increase the dose to the maximum anticipation of 12.5 mg orally twice
      daily. Treatment will proceed for 6 cycles and carvedilol will stop at the end of 6 cycles.
      Patients will be monitored with neuroimaging prior before chemoradiotherapy, before adjuvant
      temozolomide and every 2 months on adjuvant temozolomide. Following the completion of 6
      cycles of adjuvant therapy, patients will continue to receive neuroimaging on every 3 months'
      basis until disease progression based upon standard of care.
