  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world with high
      incidence and mortality. Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for HCC and is
      in high demand in China. However, recurrence of HCC among liver transplantation recipients is
      still a great challenge and threat to the survival of recipients. So it is of great
      significance to establish a non-invasive way to filter high liver transplantation recipient
      population before transplantation. Based on large scales of pre-treatment MR images, the
      investigator's study aims to establish a non-invasive radiomics method to filter high
      recurrent-risk liver transplantation recipient population. This study will contribute to the
      precise selection of HCC-related liver transplantation recipients.
