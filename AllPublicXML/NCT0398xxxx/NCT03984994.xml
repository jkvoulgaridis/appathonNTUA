  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with a loss of muscle mass, termed sarcopenia, that reduces mobility,
      decreases physical function and accelerates progression of other age-related disorders. This
      study is designed to determine whether increasing skeletal muscle capillarization through
      aerobic exercise will enhance muscular adaptations to strength training in older adults with
      sarcopenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia, or the aging-related loss of muscle mass, affects a large number of older adults.
      The presence of sarcopenia is associated with physical disability, poor quality of life, and
      all-cause mortality, in part because sarcopenic adults have low muscle skeletal muscle
      capillarization and may lack the adequate perfusion needed to maintain muscle mass and
      function. This study will test the effects of increasing skeletal muscle capillarization
      through aerobic exercise training on responses to resistance training in older adults.
      Eligible participants will be randomized to one of two groups, resistance training preceded
      by aerobic exercise training (AEX-RT), or resistance training followed by aerobic exercise
      training (RT-AEX). Participants in the AEX-RT group will undergo 3 months of aerobic exercise
      training to increase skeletal muscle capillarization, followed by 3 months of resistance
      training. Participants in the RT-AEX group will undergo 3 months of resistance training,
      followed by 3 months of aerobic exercise training. Before and after the interventions,
      participants will undergo assessments of muscle size, strength, and capillarization, as well
      as assessments of physical function.
