  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants between the ages of 19 and 70 who were initially diagnosed with venous
      thromboembolism and were accompanied by dyslipidemia (LDL&gt; = 100 mg / dl) were enrolled.

      Participants diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, pulmonary embolism CT, and peripheral B-mode
      ultrasound (B-mode ultrasound) Only participants who do not meet the exclusion criteria
      should be enrolled in the study.

      Once the participant is selected, the patient is informed of the study and receives the
      consent form.

      Participants who are eligible for all of the criteria and who do not qualify as exclusion
      criteria should be enrolled in the study and randomly enrolled in a 1: 1 dose of rosuvastatin
      20 mg once daily or equivalent. Participants who previously used statins have a wash-out
      period of two weeks or more Participants undergo a visit at 12 weeks after initiation of
      treatment. For fasting blood tests, patients visit on an empty stomach. Outpatient follow-up
      observes side effects after last visit and observes changes in vital signs and weight.

      After 24 weeks of treatment, the participant visits for efficacy evaluation. We performed
      body weight, vital signs and blood tests (WBC, hemoglobin, BUN, creatinine, CRP, D-dimer,
      fibrinogen, PAI-1, AST, ALT, CK, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL and LDL).

        1. Primary evaluation item: Improvement of venous insufficiency at 6 months

        2. Secondary evaluation items: Improvement of blood lipid concentration, inflammation and
           blood clotting at 6 months Comparison of numerical rate of change

        3. Tertiary evaluation items: recurrence of venous thrombosis
