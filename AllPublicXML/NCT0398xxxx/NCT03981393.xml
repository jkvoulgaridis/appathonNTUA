    <textblock>
      Clinical reasoning and recent data suggest that early use of venovenous extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure may confer a survival advantage.

      This retrospective propensity-matched study will assess whether patients who received VV ECMO
      &lt;48h from intubation for respiratory failure had differing outcomes to those who receieved
      delayed ECMO (defined as &gt;48h from intubation).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VV ECMO is increasingly used in refractory respiratory failure. Despite advances in lung
      protective ventilation strategies, patients who have severe respiratory failure often develop
      complications from mechanical ventilation, including volutrauma and barotrauma. ECMO allows
      gas exchange to occur extracorporeally and may reduce the potential burden of iatrogenic lung
      injury by allowing a reduction of volume and pressure support - a 'lung rest' strategy. It is
      theorised that earlier intitiation of ECMO may allow for better outcomes, as there will have
      been less time for iatrogenic lung injury to occur.

      The UK ECMO registry has been collected of patients treated under the NHS England
      commissioned respiratory ECMO service since 2011. This study has been previously registered
      and publication is intended shortly.

      Patients will be extracted from this registry if they received VV ECMO. Propensity matching
      scores will be created and patients will be stratified into groups of 'early' vs 'delayed'
      ECMO, based on their probability of being in either group.

      Patients who were cannulated &lt;48h from intubation will be matched with those who underwent
      delayed ECMO and compared on the primary outcome. This retrospective propensity-matched study
      will assess whether patients who received VV ECMO &lt;48h from intubation for respiratory
      failure had differing outcomes to those who receieved delayed ECMO (defined as &gt;48h from
      intubation).

        This is a prespecified secondary analysis of the UK ECMO registry. Inclusion criteria are
        ultimately at the discretion of each recruiting centre, but includes adult patients with
        potentially reversible acute respiratory failure without absolute contraindications to ECMO
        therapy.
