  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains at the moment a major public health problem.
      The figures currently report 37 million people infected with HIV worldwide, as well as 2
      million new infections every year, the majority of which are men who have sex with men (MSM).

      HIV research has accounted for more than 335,000 publications on PubMed since its first
      description in 1981. However, many questions remain unanswered, especially regarding the risk
      factors and protective factors, its transmission and acquisition, during sexual intercourse.
      By creating a background on PubMed with the keyword &quot;HIV&quot;, we can see that at the end of the
      80's, it was already established that male circumcision decreased the risk of transmission of
      HIV by 50 to 60%. Multiple hypotheses have been studied to justify this discovery, such as
      the reduction of micro-traumatisms, the modification of keratinization, the modification of
      penile anatomy induced by foreskin removal. In parallel, the rise of the study of the human
      microbiota, which refers to all microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi and
      parasites) living in a specific environment, the human body, and this in a healthy or
      pathological situation. There is evidence that the microbiota may be involved in the
      pathogenesis of various diseases and may play a major role in the homeostasis of the human
      body. This implication has also interested researchers in the field of HIV : the protective
      role of circumcision in the acquisition and transmission of HIV has therefore begun to be
      studied in terms of the modification of the penile microbiome.

      The first studies showed that circumcision had an impact on the abundance of bacteria present
      in the penis in humans, and modified the aerobic / anaerobic ratio in favor of the increase
      of aerobic bacteria. The first hypothesis was that circumcision played a protective role in
      the acquisition and transmission of HIV through a decrease in the diversity of the penile
      microbiota and in particular anaerobes.

      This discovery was disrupted by the emergence of studies tending to question a microbiota
      predisposing to the risk of HIV acquisition in both men and women.

      Indeed, it has been shown that certain bacteria (Prevotella, Dialister, ...) could favor the
      acquisition of the virus by the attraction in their wake of inflammation cells such as CD4
      and Langerhans cells which would facilitate by their presence. , the penetration of the
      virus. This hypothesis has been proven in studies of bacterial vaginosis, which is known to
      be a risk factor for HIV acquisition and transmission. In 2012, results showed that the loss
      of Lactobacillus, in favor of anaerobic increases such as Gardnerella, Atopobium, and
      Prevotella, increased this risk against the HIV virus. Similarly, 7 bacteria have recently
      been incriminated in this phenomenon of susceptibility to HIV acquisition (Parvimonas,
      Gemella asaccharolytica, Mycoplasma hominis, Leptotrichia / Sneathia, Eggerthellaspecies and
      Megasphaeraspecies).Being committed to the exploration of the human microbiota in particular
      by culture, we propose to extend the knowledge of balano-preputial furrow 's microbiota in
      patients infected by HIV or not and supported in department Infectious Diseases. It is in
      this context, that a preliminary study carried out at the IHU between January and July 2018
      made it possible to describe the existence of variability of the microbiota according to
      various criteria such as circumcision, HIV infection and sexual practices.
