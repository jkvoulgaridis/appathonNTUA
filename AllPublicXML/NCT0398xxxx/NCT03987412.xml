  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome and
      developing type 2 diabetes after delivery. It is well recognized that behavioral intervention
      is effective in preventing type 2 diabetes in high risk population. Recently, some studies
      showed that exercise, dietary and weight control reduced the risk of developing GDM in
      obese/over weight women or in women with GDM history. With the increasing use of smartphones,
      mobile applications (APPs) can be applied in the education and management of chronic
      diseases, including diabetes. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a multi-centered,
      two-armed, open-labeled, randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether early lifestyle
      intervention with a mobile APP can prevent the occurrence of GDM in pregnant women who are at
      high risk of this disease.

      The investigators hypothesis that behavioral intervention from the first trimester of
      pregnancy with mobile APP that incorporates nutrition, exercise and phycological support
      will:

        1. Reduce the risk of developing GDM in pregnant women with risks of GDM.

        2. Improve the pregnant women's adherence of behavioral intervention and their satisfaction
           of prenatal medical care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participates will be recruited from five research centers in the mainland of China. Pregnant
      women will be screened for risks of GDM at their first visit for prenatal care during their
      first trimester (less than 12 gestational weeks). Obstetricians will introduce the study to
      women who have one or more risk factors.

      Women who meet the eligibility criteria and who are willing to provide informed consent will
      be enrolled and randomized to behavioral intervention group and control group. Women in the
      behavioral intervention group will be educated about the risks of GDM, and then applied with
      a mobile APP that provides nutrition, exercise and phycological support starting from their
      first trimester. This behavioral support will be modified individually and continuously
      according to the pregnant women's feedback of their daily performance through the APP. Both
      groups will have regular prenatal care.

      During 24-28 gestational weeks, GDM will be diagnosed by a 75g oral glucose tolerance test
      (OGTT) according to the new World Health Organization criteria as fasting glucose level in
      fasting whole blood ≥5.1mmol/L, or 1-hour value ≥10.0mmol/l, or 2-hour value ≥8.5mmol/L.
      Investigators will compare the GDM risk in the two groups to evaluate whether behavioral
      intervention with mobile APP can reduce the risk of GDM in Chinese pregnant women who are at
      high risk of GDM. Participants' adherence with the behavioral intervention will be evaluated
      by analyzing the data collected by the APP, and participants' satisfaction of the prenatal
      care will be evaluated with questionnaires during 24-28 gestational weeks. Intervention with
      the APP will be stopped in the third trimester. All the participates will receive standard
      medical management until they give birth.

    <description>Participants' satisfaction of prenatal medical care will be evaluated with questionnaires. The questionnaire was designed by the investigators according to references (Stoyanov SR. JMIR Mhealth Uhealth, 2015, 1(3): e27. et al) named the &quot; Satisfaction Questionnaire of Behavioral Intervention to Prevent GDM&quot;. It includes 7 subscales. The final form of each subscale is a five-point scale (5 Strongly agree / 4 agree / 3 don't know / 2 disagree / 1 strongly disagree, modified from Likert Scale) which is used to allow the participants to express how much they agree or disagree with the satisfaction statement.
Convenience and feasibility of behavioral intervention
Effects of behavioral intervention
Behavioral intervention do not have adverse reactions
Ease use of APP
Good engagement of APP
High information quality of APP
The investigators serve well
Summarize each scale to compute a total score. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
