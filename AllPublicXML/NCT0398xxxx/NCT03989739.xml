  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical and cost-effectiveness analysis within a retrospective comparative study
      of RDP and LDP conducted at Sanchinarro University Hospital from 2011 to 2017. Outcome
      parameters included surgical and post-operative costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY),
      and incremental cost per QALY gained or the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). A
      sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to propagate the uncertainty of the estimations
      to the results of the model. The investigators use a multivariate and stochastic sensitivity
      analysis performed by 5000 Monte Carlo simulations. The cost-effectiveness plane was used to
      represent all pairs of solutions of the model.

        This study was carried out at the General Surgery Department of Sanchinarro University
        Hospital of Madrid.

        Details of the procedure have been described in a previous report and standardized in both
        groups. RDP was performed using a da Vinci Robotic Surgical System model Si and Xi
        (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) (8). All consecutive cases were conducted by the
        same group of 6 surgeons all with considerable experience in both laparoscopic and robotic
        approaches.

        Patients (aged over 18 years) with benign or malignant mass without evidence of major
        vessel involvement were included and assigned either to RDP or LDP, depending on the
        availability of the robot. The indication for resection was given in the context of a
        multidisciplinary institutional committee.
