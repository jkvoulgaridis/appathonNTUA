  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim at comparing the perceived clarity of personal values in men
      considering PSA screening using decision aids with no VCM versus an implicit VCM versus an
      explicit VCM. This study will add to the body of evidence on the role of decision aids to
      support health preference-sensitive choices and provide further insight on the impact of
      different methods for eliciting people's values embedded within a decision aid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PSA test to screen for prostate cancer is considered a preference sensitive decision, meaning
      it does not only depend on what is best from a medical point of view, but also on patient
      values. Decision aids are evidence-based tools which showed to help people feel clearer about
      their values, therefore it has been advocated that decision aids should contain a specific
      values clarification method (VCM). VCM may be either implicit or explicit but the evidence
      concerning the best method is scarce. We aim at comparing the perceived clarity of personal
      values in men considering PSA screening using decision aids with no VCM versus an implicit
      VCM versus an explicit VCM.
