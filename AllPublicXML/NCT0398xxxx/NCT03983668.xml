    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, phase I/II trial designed to find a CMP-001 dose
      that, in combination with pembrolizumab, has optimal clinical efficacy and acceptable
      toxicity for patients with relapsed and refractory lymphomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, combined Phase I/II clinical study of intratumoral
      administration of CMP-001 and intravenous administration of pembrolizumab in selected
      participants with lymphoma. The key study objective is to find a CMP-001 dose that in
      combination with pembrolizumab has optimal clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity.
      Dose-finding will be performed with an adaptive clinical trial design. Secondary study
      objectives include characterization of safety, pharmacodynamics, and assessment of
      anti-lymphoma activity.

          -  The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written
             informed consent for the trial prior to the initiation of any study procedures. The
             participant must be capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements.

          -  Have measurable disease based on Cheson 2007 (Cheson, et al 2007). Lesions situated in

             mandated by local health authority.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
