  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development and internal validation of an easy-to-use tool for clinical pain assessment. The
      tool has to be applicable in any clinical practice and without the need for expensive and
      complicated hospital tools to identify the source of persistent pain after the treatment of
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      An adequate selection of physiotherapy treatment for persistent pain after the treatment of
      cancer, depends highly on the mechanism of the pain.

      Pain can arise from a damaged nerve or tissue (skin, lymphatic system...). But when pain
      becomes chronic, alterations to the central nervous system can occur, as regulations of the
      facilitating and inhibiting mechanisms. These alterations may cause central sensitization
      pain. The body is now sensitized and cannot distinct harmful from harmless stimuli.

      Each type of pain requires a specific treatment, therefore identification of the pain
      mechanism is crucial. Up till now, expensive and complex tests were performed in a hospital
      setting to determine if a patient suffers from neuropathic, nociceptive or central
      sensitization pain. This study aims for developping an assessment tool that does not require
      expensive devices but can be easily performed by any physiotherapist, within the timeframe of
      a standard consultation.
