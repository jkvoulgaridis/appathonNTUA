  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscles atrophy and weakness are common in intensive care units, their origin is
      multifactorial. Passive then active mobilization with cyclo-ergometer have shown to improve
      functional abilities and limit muscle weakness among intensive care unit patients. Electrical
      muscle stimulation should limit the atrophy and muscle weakness in intensive care unit
      associated with early mobilization.

      This study aims to compare the association early cyclo-ergometer mobilization with electrical
      muscle stimulation versus cyclo-ergometer mobilization only to prevent muscle atrophy and
      weakness in intensive care unit.
