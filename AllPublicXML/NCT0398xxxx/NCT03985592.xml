  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 1% of the Canadian population dies every year. When people die, their bereaved family
      members (FMs) normally experience grief that diminishes over time and without serious
      psychological or medical impairment. However, some FMs experience a severe grief reaction
      (SGR) with intense symptoms and impairment lasting months or years; this is more common among
      FMs of those who die in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Many bereaved FMs would like to have
      bereavement support, and many ICU organizations identify bereavement support as a clinical
      and research priority, yet few ICUs provide routine support.

      In order to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a complex support intervention for
      bereaved FMs, the investigators will pilot a multi-component bereavement intervention through
      a mixed-methods study. Methods will include a series of semi-structured interviews,
      questionnaires and narrative therapy sessions. The target population for this study is both
      ICU clinical staff (e.g. physicians, registered nurses [RN], allied health professionals) and
      FMs of relatives who died in the ICU. The intervention is premised on a robust series of
      educational modules aimed at increasing ICU staff members' knowledge of and level of comfort
      with bereavement support ICU FMs.

      In a previous study, the investigators have established that SGRs can be predicted using
      screening tools early after the loss, and that ICU-based clinicians are eager to provide
      bereavement support. There are effective treatments for SGRs once they have been diagnosed
      after 6 months, but this can mean many months of suffering for the FM. In this project, the
      investigators plan to develop and test the feasibility of an early bereavement support
      program that follows bereaved FMs after a loss, provides information and support, and uses
      effective therapies aimed at preventing the development of a SGR.

    <textblock>
      Almost 1% of the population dies annually. When people die, it is normal for their bereaved
      family members (FMs) to experience grief. This grief usually diminishes, but in some cases
      FMs suffer from severe grief reaction (SGR) with intense yearning or separation distress, as
      well as emotional, cognitive and functional impairment lasting months or years. SGRs are
      distinct from other psychiatric illness that is directly linked with declining health,
      increased use of healthcare resources, and even death. ICU deaths are associated with a
      higher incidence of SGR2 - symptoms of psychiatric illness and have been reported in 34-67%
      of surviving FMs with 22% experiencing significant social distress.

      As grieving death is an expected human response, SGRs cannot be diagnosed until &gt;6 months
      after a loss, but the investigators found that a SGR at 6 months can be accurately predicted
      by screening tests 3 months after a death. Early identification provides opportunity for
      early intervention with the hope of preventing or reducing the severity of SGRs. There are
      effective treatments for established SGRs (i.e. &gt;6 months post-death), including
      psychotherapy tailored to SGR. This therapy works through 3 mechanisms: (1) by encouraging
      exposure to reminders and situations that the FM is avoiding, (2) restructuring through
      reconstructing an understanding of the loss and grief experience, and (3) behavioural
      activation to re-establish social interaction. Some ICU-based support interventions
      administered pre-death are effective in reducing psychological morbidity, while others have
      shown no effect or even harm.

      Many bereaved FMs would appreciate bereavement support, and ICU organizations have identified
      bereavement support as a clinical and research priority. Yet few ICUs have devoted resources
      toward bereavement screening or support. Our previous multi-centre study found that only 16%
      of Canadian ICU clinicians follow up with FMs after a death, and bereaved FMs rarely, if
      ever, report being contacted after the death of their loved one. Few ICU clinicians have
      received formal training in bereavement support and many report &quot;not knowing what to say&quot; in
      response to strong emotions.

      Currently, less than half of Canadian ICU clinicians (physicians and registered nurses [RN])
      are comfortable providing any form of bereavement support to FMs at the time of death, and
      fewer than 18% perceive that FMs may have social or informational needs following a death.
      Similarly, FMs are often unwilling or unable to access bereavement support even when
      resources are available with over half of eligible participants decline participation in
      ICU-based bereavement interventions.

      Single interventions are not effective for preventing SGRs in unselected populations of
      bereaved FMs (thought may benefit high-risk populations). Thus our pilot project will combine
      several promising scalable and low-resource interventions in a &quot;bundle&quot;, to improve the
      chances of meeting these needs and overcoming these barriers. As a research-based
      intervention, this study will examine the feasibility of implementing measures to reduce SGRs
      while also determining the best methods to address the social and educational needs of
      clinicians and FM.

    <intervention_model_description>The multi-component intervention aims to evaluate the feasibility as well as success of imparting educational knowledge and applied techniques to ICU clinicians (physicians and RNs) on how to support bereaved FMs. The overall purpose of the intervention is to optimize preemptive strategies in reducing SGRs in FMs. To determine the effectiveness of this intervention a series of standardized and validated measures of wellbeing will be given to FMs after the typical bereavement period ends. The intervention is designed to be implementable in any ICU setting across Canada and potentially abroad.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>ICU-based clinicians (e.g. physicians and RNs) are ideally situated to provide support for FMs experiencing acute grief at the time of death particularly because of pre-established therapeutic relationships. However, ICU clinician-related barriers to bereavement support for FMs identified in our previous studies included lack of comfort, skill and knowledge regarding bereavement needs and support. To address this barrier, in partnership with Canadian Virtual Hospice (CVH), we are developing and will deliver bilingual educational material aimed at improving the knowledge, skill and comfort of ICU-based clinicians providing acute grief and bereavement support. CVH established a pan-Canadian team of grief experts to develop four evidence-based, interactive online learning modules for ICU-based clinicians. The modules are specific to the ICU context and are grounded in the lived experience of FMs and clinicians who experience death in the ICU.</description>

    <description>To address the need for normalization and education around bereavement, we will use an award-winning scalable, web-based resource offered by CVH (MyGrief.ca). The nine learning modules cover anticipatory loss and grief for the bereft. Topics include exploring the nature of relationships between survivors and the ill/deceased, challenging family dynamics, managing grief triggers and self-care.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Meeting with the care team to address unmet needs</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Our observational studies indicated that the most common need reported by bereaved FMs was the desire to meet with the care team to review events during the ICU stay and particularly the events that led to death, and that this was the type of support that ICU clinicians were most comfortable providing. At the same time, 52-58% of bereaved FMs would want support for social issues (e.g. transportation, making financial arrangements), and this is an area in which clinicians have been found to be uncomfortable providing support. The purpose of this meeting is to (1) clarify misunderstandings and to help the FM explore their grief and reconstruct their experience with the loss (&quot;meaning-making&quot;); and (2) identify unmet social needs and arrange support. Participating clinicians will be able to use knowledge and insight from the CVH educational modules (from component #1) in this meeting.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Identifying FMs at high risk of SGRs</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>At 10-12 weeks post-death, we will contact FMs and administer the Inventory of Complicated Grief-Revised (ICG-r), Brief Grief Questionnaire (BGQ)34, Impact of Events Scale - Revised (IES-r), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Bereavement Dependency Scale (BDS). If these results suggest a 10% or greater risk of developing Complicated Grief (CG), we will offer and encourage the FM to participate in a 1-2 hour narrative exploration of their grief and bereavement experience. Narrative interventions require specialized resources and are less scalable than components #1 and #2, but the results of Barnato et al., as well as the response to our qualitative interviews, suggest that this intervention may be helpful for selected FMs. Narrative interventions have been shown to reduce healthcare utilization and improve subjective health following a traumatic experience.</description>
