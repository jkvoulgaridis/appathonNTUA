  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this prospective, observational cohort study are to determine the feasibility of
      implementing paclitaxel therapeutic drug monitoring for cancer patients and explore the
      relationship between paclitaxel drug exposure and the development of neuropathic symptoms.

      This trial studies if paclitaxel can be consistently measured in the blood of patients with
      solid tumors undergoing paclitaxel treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Nerve damage is one of the
      most common and severe side effects of paclitaxel. The ability to consistently measure
      paclitaxel in the blood may allow doctors to control the dose of paclitaxel, so that enough
      chemotherapy is given to kill the cancer, but the side effect of nerve damage is reduced.

      Primary Objective:

      • Determine the feasibility of monitoring paclitaxel serum drug levels in patients with a
      solid tumor (e.g. lung, breast, and gynecologic cancers) for which Paclitaxel is the standard
      of care.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Compare Paclitaxel serum drug levels among patients with differing degrees of
           chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.

        -  Compare mitochondrial function within circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells
           among patients with differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at
           the end of Paclitaxel treatment.

        -  Compare the ability of pulsed electromagnetic field to modulate immune cells of
           individuals experiencing differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
           at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.

A completed Paclitaxel infusion is defined as each dose of Paclitaxel that is completed in its entirety.
