    <textblock>
      This study was designed to identify high platelet reactivity (HPR) who might have in-stent
      thrombosis in unruptured aneurysm with intracranial stent placement with light transmittance
      platelet aggregometry (LTA). For HPR patients, higher ischemic stroke rate maybe occurred,
      and we hypothesis that dose adjustment of aspirin and clopidogrel based on LTA monitoring
      maybe reduces the rate of ischemic stroke compared to a standard strategy after intracranial
      stent implantation at early periprocedural period and 1 month follow-up period.

      For the patients of unruptured intracranial aneurysms with stent placement, standard
      antiplatelet therapy (100mg aspirin + 75mg clopidogrel) is considered to be the most
      effective antiplatelet regimen in reducing ischemic complications. However, despite the use
      of standard antiplatelet therapy, a number of patients continue to have ischemic events. A
      hypothesis is that high platelet reactivity (HPR) patients identified by platelet function
      test have higher ratio of the ischemic events, and dose adjustment of HPR patients reduces
      the rate of the ischemic complications at early periprocedural period and follow-up period.

      Objectives: The study aim to evaluated the superiority of the strategy of platelet function
      test(Monitoring Arm) with the modified strategy in HPR patients compared to the standard
      strategy (Conventional Arm) whether reduce the primary endpoint after intracranial stent
      implantation at early periprocedural period (7 days) and 1 months follow-up period.
