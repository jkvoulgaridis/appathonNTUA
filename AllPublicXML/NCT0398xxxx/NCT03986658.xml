  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by at least one basic symptom occurring
      nearly every day for at least two weeks, for most of each day and an additional minimum of
      three symptoms that also are present nearly every day for at least two weeks. The common
      symptoms are sadness or ahedonia, i.e., a loss of pleasure in daily life. The additional
      required symptoms may be a change in weight (either gain or loss, without planning to do so),
      inability to sleep or increased sleep beyond the person's normal patterns, physical agitation
      or marked slowness in movement, loss of energy or fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or
      excessive guilt, inability to concentrate or make decisions, recurrent thoughts of death or
      thoughts of suicide. The symptom must cause dysfunction and must be different than the
      person's normal baseline level of function. Although MDD was initially thought to be an adult
      disorder, it has now been well described in adolescents.

      MDD criteria for diagnosing adults is the same for adolescents, however, young people may
      present a bit differently in that they may be more irritable rather than being consistently
      sad. The lifetime prevalence of MDD in adolescents is 11% and recent data indicate that the
      12-month prevalence increased from 8.7% in 2011 to 11% in 2014. If untreated, MDD can derail
      normal development, become chronic, and result in suicide. MDD is also associated with poor
      lifetime outcomes, such as, reoccurrence of MDD, higher rates of suicide, development of
      substance use disorders, and difficulties in social, work and physical health domains.
      Effective treatment consisting of a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication and/or
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), administered as
      early as possible, is optimal. Unfortunately, treating adolescent MDD is not easy. Although
      much progress has been made, 30-40% of adolescents will not respond to the gold standard of
      care.

      Clinical researchers define treatment-resistant adolescent MDD as having failed adequate
      trials of an antidepressant medication, CBT or both. Those who do not respond have higher
      rates of suicide, poorer school achievement, and increased substance abuse disorders. Current
      recommendations for these individuals involve changing medications, adding medications of
      different categories, and adding CBT or IPT if not previously done. However, the success rate
      with these additional treatments can still leave 40% of youth non-responsive to one line of
      treatment also non-responsive to additional pharmacological/psychotherapeutic interventions.
      Several non-pharmacologic interventions have been used in adults, such as electroconvulsive
      therapy (ECT), vagus nerve stimulation, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS). Extreme approaches like ECT are only approved for adolescents when someone has not
      responded to multiple medication trials, failed at least one psychotherapy, or has severe MDD
      or bipolar disorder with psychosis.

      rTMS is a promising intervention for adults and adolescents with major depressive disorder.
      Conventional rTMS has been limited to sine biphasic electromagnetic pulses with underwhelming
      clinical outcomes. NeuroQore has developed the First Dawn rTMS system, world's first and only
      rTMS system that can sustain a new form of electromagnetic pulse for therapeutic application.
      Safety and pilot studies with First Dawn have been conducted on healthy volunteers (N = 12)
      and adult patients with TRD (N = 20). Please see
      https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02667041 for more details on this completed pilot
      study.

    <measure>Changes in self-reported MDD symptoms. Measured with the Child Depression Inventory-2 (CDI-2).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 4 days, 7 days and 101 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Depression Inventory-2 takes 20 minutes to administer and is the most extensively used self-rated depression scale for children. The 27 items on the assessment are grouped into five major factor areas and is for children and youth up to the age of 17 years. Young people rate themselves based on how they feel and think, with each statement being rated from 0 to 2, with a range of scores from 0-54. A score of &gt;20 is indicative of depression. Higher scores indicate increased depression. This scale has no sub-scales.</description>

    <measure>Changes in clinician rated MDD symptoms. Measured with the Child Depression Rating Scale- Revised (CDRS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 4 days, 7 days and 101 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised has 17 items, is for 6-18 year-olds, and takes 20-30 minutes to administer. This scale has items ranging from 1 to 5 or 1 to 7 (possible total score from 17 to 113) and is rated by a clinician. It is the most widely used rating scale for assessing severity of depression and changes in depressive symptoms for clinical research trials. A score of &gt;40 is indicative of depression, whereas a score of &lt;28 is used to define remission. Higher scores represent increased depression. There are no sub-scales for this measure.</description>

    <measure>Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 4 days, 7 days and 101 days.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is the most widely used measure of social and psychiatric functioning for children aged 4-17 years. The Children's Global Assessment Scale is a single rating scale with a range of scores from 1 to 100, rated by the interviewer, synthesizing all sources of information at the end of intake. Higher scores indicate better function (12). It takes 1 minute to administer and assesses the adolescent's functioning within the past month of their life. We will adapt it to days or weeks, as below. This measure has no sub-scales.</description>

    <measure>Side Effects Profile. Measured with the rTMS Side Effect Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, after each of the four days of treatment, 11 days, 101 days.</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is a Likert rating scale scored set of items about headache, neck pain, hearing changes, impaired cognition, trouble concentrating, acute mood changes, and other general symptoms. It will assess the side effects severity, relationship to intervention and additional notes for clinician. The severity ratings will range from 1 (Absent) to 4 (Severe). Relationship to the rTMS ratings will range from 1 (None) to 5 (Definitive).</description>

    <measure>Changes in mental status. Measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 11 days, 101 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination examines functions including registration (repeating named prompts), attention and calculation, recall, language, ability to follow simple commands and orientation. It takes 5-10 minutes to administer and each task has a score with a maximum of 30 points total. A score of 24 or higher purports to identify individuals who are cognitively intact. Higher scores indicate better mental function. This measure has no sub-scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in short-term verbal memory. Measured with the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised (HLVT-R).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 4, 11 days, 101 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised takes 15 minutes to administer and is a brief verbal learning and memory test with six alternative forms. Each form contains 12 nouns, four words each from one of three semantic categories, to be learned over the course of the three learning tasks. Correct responses across these 3 learning trials are summed for the Total Recall score (range 0-36). After a 20-25 minute delay, free recall of the words is again attempted. The Delayed Recall score is the correct responses on that trial (range 0-12). Two more scores are calculated: Retention and Recognition Discrimination index. Retention is calculated as (Delayed Recall/higher score Trials 2 or 3) x 100. Recognition is calculated as the number of hits - number of false positives. For all scores, higher values indicate better performance, except false positive errors, which is the opposite.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant experience. Measured with the Multi-Care Institute for Research and Innovation Research Participant Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>101 days</time_frame>
    <description>We will adapt the Multi-Care Institute for Research and Innovation Research Participant Satisfaction Questionnaire for adolescents. The questionnaire includes 7 questions related to the study, 27 questions on a 5-point Likert scale (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree), two ranking questions, three free-text responses options, four demographic questions for a total of 45 questions. This measure was developed to assess the experience of participants in clinical trials. Likert scale questions will be evaluated with a &quot;top box&quot; score (the percentage of respondents who selected strongly agree for each question) and a Six Sigma percentile rank procedure. Free recall questions will be reviewed from a quality improvement perspective and to receive feedback for future trials.</description>
