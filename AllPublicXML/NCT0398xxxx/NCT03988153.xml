  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotic contained milk formula (PMF) intervention for 10 weeks considerably improves
      gastrointestinal function by modulating fecal movement, intestinal microflora as well as
      decrease cholesterol and thus help in the management of hypercholesterolemia.

      Current randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind was designed to assess the effect of
      probiotic contained milk formula (PMF) on lipid profile and intestinal function in healthy
      mild hypercholesterolemic subjects. Totally forty healthy mild hypercholesterolemic subjects
      (180-220 mg/dL) were randomly chosen and divided into two groups as placebo or experimental
      group. All the subjects were requested to drink either PMF (experimental) or skimmed milk
      drink formula-Placebo (30 gm mixed with 200 mL of water) for 10 weeks and continued by 2
      weeks of the follow-up period. Supplementation of PMF for 10 weeks significantly improved (p&lt;
      0.05) the fecal weight, fecal movement (decreased fecal GI passing time) by improving
      intestinal microflora (increasing beneficial bacterial species like Lactobacillus,
      Bifidobacterium spp) and Lag time of LDL oxidation. In addition, intake of PMF substantially
      reduced (p&lt; 0.05) the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-c) and thus showcasing its cardioprotective efficacy. Therefore PMF is
      recommended for the management of hypercholesterolemia.
