  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized unblinded single-centre trial. The main hypothesis of the study was
      that pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy reduces the incidence of delayed gastric
      emptying . Patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy were randomized to undergo one of two
      types of surgical technique: pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy versus stardard
      pancreatoduodenectomy with antrectomy. The primary endpoint was the incidence and severity of
      delayed gastric emptying. Secondary endpoints were postoperative morbidity and mortality,
      length of hospital stay, and nutritional status and quality of life.

      This was a randomized unblinded single-centre trial without masked evaluation of the main
      outcome.The authors decided to compare pancreatoduodenectomy with antrectomy versus
      pancreatoduodenectomy with pyloric preservation. The primary aim of this randomized clinical
      trial was to determine whether pancreatoduodenectomy with pyloric preservation is associated
      with a lower incidence and severity of delayed gastric emptying. Secondary endpoints were
      postoperative complications, postoperative mortality and duration of hospital stay. Patients
      undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy were randomized to undergo one of two types of gastroenteric
      anastomosis for reconstruction. Analytical parameters such as C-reactive protein, prealbumin,
      and albumin; as well as anthropometric measures (mean) as preoperative arm circumference mean
      and tricipital skinfold mean were registered preoperatively, at 5th week, and at 6th mounth.
      Scintigraphic study had performed following a specific protocol for gastric emptying. At the
      end, quality of life was also analized with a quality of life questionnaire (QLPAN26)
      preoperativelly and postoperatively.
