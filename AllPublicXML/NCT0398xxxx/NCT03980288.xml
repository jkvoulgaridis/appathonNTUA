  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I open-label, single and multiple infusion, dose escalation/cohort expansion
      study to evaluate the safety, cell pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T
      cells, infused intravenously in subjects who have been diagnosed with GPC3 positive advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma and refractory or intolerant to current standard systemic treatment.

      Primary objectives:

      •To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAR-GPC3 T cells infused intravenously at
      escalating doses in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the cellular pharmacokinetics of CAR-GPC3 T cells

        -  To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of infusion of CAR-GPC3 T cells

        -  To investigate the preliminary efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells in the treatment of advanced
           hepatocellular carcinoma
