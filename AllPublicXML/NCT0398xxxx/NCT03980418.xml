  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The semiconductor (cadmium-zinc-telluride, CZT) cameras significantly increase detection
      sensitivity in Single Photon Emission Computer Tomoscintigraphy (SPECT)(1) . The clinical
      routine applications of these cameras are today mainly limited to myocardial tomoscintigraphy
      with CZT dedicated cameras. Several studies whose one was done in CHRU of Nancy, made it
      possible to demonstrate a good diagnosis agreement between conventional cameras and
      semiconductor cameras in this indication, with better image quality obtained with
      semiconductor cameras (2). Today, so-called &quot;wide field&quot; semiconductor cameras are available
      in the clinic and allow for any type of SPECT examination. A comparative study between
      conventional and semiconductor cameras has been conducted for bone scintigraphy, and shows
      diagnostic superiority with this new type of camera (3).

      In addition, the new VERITON-CT ™ (Spectrum Dynamics Medical) camera has 12 mobile CZT-based
      detectors positioned around the patient allowing tomographic acquisitions and focusing the
      acquisition on the organ studied. This camera has a sensitivity of detection higher than that
      of conventional cameras and thus reduces the activity injected into the patient and / or the
      recording time.

      To date, no study has compared the two types of cameras in nuclear neurology and in
      particular, for the SPECT DaTSCAN ™ imaging of the pre-synaptic dopaminergic pathway.

      The DaTSCAN ™ exam is used in clinical routine:

        1. for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or related diseases when in doubt with an
           essential tremor (4) or

        2. if there is suspicion of Lewy body disease, if in doubt with Alzheimer's disease (5).

      If the interpretation of DaTSCAN ™ exam is first visual, the quantification may increase
      accuracy diagnosis (6). Also, the database creation specific to each type of camera is
      recommended(7).

      The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnosically relevant informations and the
      quantitative analysis provided by the DaTSCAN™ SPECT, recorded on the conventional camera and
      recorded on the semiconductor camera VERITON-CT™

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study is monocentric, interventional, non randomized, with minimal riks and
      contraints.

      All patients going to the nuclear medicine department for a DaSCAN exam will be able to
      participate in this study if they understood the study informations gived by the physician
      and if they signed the inform consent.

      In first, the patients will have the DaTSCAN™ SPECT on the conventional camera and after,
      they will have the DaTSCAN™ SPECT on the VERITON-CT™ camera with two records: one in focus
      striatum mode and the second in focus brain mode.

      The attenuation correction will be made with the computer tomography (CT) recorded in the
      same time than SPECT (SPECT/CT)
