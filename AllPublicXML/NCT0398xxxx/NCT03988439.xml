      This study is to evaluate the safety, the systemic exposure, and the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression potential for topically applied IDP-118
      lotion in pediatric participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is 4 to 16 years 11 months of age at time of informed consent/assent obtained.

          -  Verbal and written informed consent/assent obtained from the participant and/or parent
             or legal guardian.

          -  Has a clinical diagnosis of psoriasis at Screening and Baseline with an Investigator's
             Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 or 4. The face, scalp, axillae, and intertriginous
             areas are to be excluded in this assessment, if psoriasis is present.

          -  Has an area of plaque psoriasis appropriate for topical treatment that involves a BSA
             of at least 10% at Screening and Baseline. The face, scalp, axillae, and
             intertriginous areas are to be excluded in this calculation.

          -  Is willing and able to avoid prolonged exposure of the treatment area to ultraviolet
             radiation (natural and artificial) for the duration of the study.

          -  Is in good general adrenal health, as determined by a 30-minute postcosyntropin
             stimulation serum cortisol level that is &gt;18 μg/dL at the Screening visit.

          -  Females of childbearing potential and females who are pre-menses (9 years and older)
             must be willing to practice effective contraception for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a history of adrenal disease.

          -  Presents with any concurrent skin condition that could interfere with the evaluation
             of the treatment areas, as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Is pregnant, nursing an infant, or planning a pregnancy during the study period.

          -  Has received treatment with any investigational drug or device within 60 days or 5
             drug half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to baseline or is concurrently
             participating in another clinical study with an investigational drug or device.

          -  Received treatment with a topical antipsoriatic drug product other than
             corticosteroids within 14 days prior to the Baseline visit and/or treatment containing
             corticosteroids within 28 days prior to the screening HPA axis stimulation test.

          -  Has a history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any of the study drug
             constituents.

          -  Is considered by the Investigator, for any other reason, to be an unsuitable candidate
             for the study.
