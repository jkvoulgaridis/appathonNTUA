  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a relationship between aerobic fitness and survival both with and without surgery.
      Some patients can improve their aerobic fitness with a structured exercise programme but
      currently it is not know how much this could change predicted survival for patients with an
      abdominal aortic aneurysm, or how long this change can be maintained. Survival can be
      predicted after planned abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery using physical fitness
      measured with a cardiopulmonary exercise test. The researchers have validated this in a
      published peer reviewed multicentre study. In this study the patient's fitness will be
      measured before and after a structured exercise programme and assess if there is any change
      in their predicted survival. The primary objective of the study is to measure the change in
      predicted survival for abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery after a structured exercise
      programme. In addition the patients are asked to complete the following questionnaires:-
      EQ-5D-5L, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) before and after the exercise
      programme.

      The UK has a national AAA screening programme. At the age of 65 men are offered a one off
      ultrasound test to look for a AAA. If their abdominal aorta is &gt; 5.5 cm they are referred to
      a Vascular Surgeon. If the patients abdominal aorta is between 3 cm and 5.4 cm they are
      offered further ultrasound scans to monitor the size of their aorta. This is a surveillance
      programme. In addition men who have an AAA between 3 cm and 5.4 cm that is detected by an
      ultrasound scan, CT or MRI performed as part of an investigation for another clinical problem
      are added to the surveillance programme.

      In Torbay and South Devon men in the AAA surveillance programme are referred for a
      Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test when the AAA reaches 4.5 cm as part of standard clinical
      practice. This takes place in the Pre assessment Clinic in Torbay Hospital and is performed
      by a Consultant Anaesthetist. If the patient is able to safely perform the Cardiopulmonary
      Exercise Test they will be identified as potential participants by the Consultant
      Anaesthetist.

    <description>We can predict survival after planned abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery using physical fitness measured with a cardiopulmonary exercise test, age and comorbidities. We have validated this in a published peer reviewed multicentre study. We will measure patient's fitness before and after a structured exercise programme and assess if there is any change in their predicted survival. The primary objective of the study is to measure the change in predicted survival for abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery after a structured exercise programme.</description>

Participants will be offered three sessions per week of aerobic interval exercise on a cycle ergometer over nine weeks. Exercise programmes will be tailored to each patient, taking previous level of activity, mobility and any barriers to exercise into consideration.
Following this:
Participants will be encouraged to comply with current physical activity recommendations: 150 min of moderate intensity aerobic exercise per week (brisk walking / cycling). They will also be sign posted to local exercise facilities.</description>
