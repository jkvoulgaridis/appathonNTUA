  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a recognized factor affecting implant complication rates, including
      peri-implantitis and peri-implant bone loss, and the apico-coronal position of implants seems
      interfere on the conditions of peri-implant tissues. However, the influence of the vertical
      implant position in type 2 diabetics (T2DM) is unclear. This split-mouth randomized
      controlled trial evaluated the impact of implants of machined-collar placed at crestal level
      or supracrestally in T2DM rehabilitated with implant-retained overdentures on the clinical,
      tomographic and immunoinflammatory peri-implant outcomes after implant loading.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considering the outcomes achieved with implants with machined-collar inserted supracrestally,
      it would be relevant to investigate whether this therapeutic strategy could be considered as
      a more effective approach in the rehabilitation with dental implants of individuals with type
      2 DM, since these patients may be more disposed to peri-implant changes, both from the point
      of view of marginal bone remodeling as related to local variations in immunoinflammatory
      response. Thus, the propose of this split-mouth randomized controlled trial was to compare
      the impact of crestal level or supracrestally implant platform in T2DM rehabilitated with
      implant-retained overdentures on the clinical, tomographic and immunoinflammatory
      peri-implant outcomes after implant loading.

    <description>Surgeries to dental implant placement were performed. All patients received 3.5 mm diameter dental implants - surface blasted with TiO2 particles and machined collar of 1mm - in the interforaminal region of the mandible. The surgical sequence followed the protocol described by the implant company.A two stages protocol was used and the prostheses were placed at 4 months.The prosthetic retention system used in rehabilitation with overdentures was the O'ring and the capture of this component was done directly in the patient's mouth. After 7 and 14 days, the patients returned to occlusal adjustments and verification of prosthetic adaptation. The prostheses were made entirely of acrylic resin without metallic reinforcement and the antagonist of the patients were total edentulous and rehabilitated with muco-supported prostheses.</description>
