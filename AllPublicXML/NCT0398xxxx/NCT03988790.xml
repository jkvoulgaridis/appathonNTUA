  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the change in the composition of Volatil Organic Compounds (VOC) in
      patients treated by monoclonal antibody for severe asthma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least one in two patients treated by monoclonal antibody for severe asthma doesn't have
      satisfying result after 6 months of treatment.

      The evaluation of the answer, and even better the answer prediction, are fundamental issues
      for medico-economic plan as part of these innovative therapeutics.

      The interest of the use of VOC as diagnostic or prognostic tool in patients with tumoral
      thoracic pathology or bronchial or pulmonary vascular diseases has been demonstrated.

      VOC analysis will be performed using two different techniques: electronic nose and masse
      spectrometry. At each visit, in addition to the usual assessment, patients will have two
      non-invasives collections of exhaled air, one for electronic nose analysis and one for masse
      spectrometry analysis.
