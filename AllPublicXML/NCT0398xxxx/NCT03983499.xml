    <textblock>
      The Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D) study, is a randomized
      controlled trial testing the effectiveness of an integrated behavioral health and primary
      care chronic care disease management intervention for low income Latino patients with type-2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that have 2 or more chronic health conditions. LUNA-D focuses on
      diabetes management and behavioral health care integration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LUNA-D proposes to test the ability of a fully integrated behavioral health and primary care
      diabetes management intervention in a federally-qualified community health care setting to
      improve multiple clinical and behavioral outcomes. LUNA-D will recruit non-insulin using
      adult type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with two or more chronic diseases. Half will
      be randomized to the Special Intervention (SI) arm and half to the Usual Care (UC) arm. The
      SI is an intensive intervention including fully integrated clinical visits with a medical
      provider (MP) co-located with a behavioral health counselor (BHC) and peer-led evidence-based
      group health education sessions and proactive care coordination. Usual Care is represented by
      passive appointments with the primary care physician and passive referrals to behavioral
      health and traditional health education. Biological measurements will be taken at baseline,
      3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months to detect changes in glycemic control. Clinical lab measures,
      medication adherence, weight, health behaviors and psychosocial measures will also be
      obtained across the study.

    <description>The special intervention (SI) arm addresses glycemic control, medication adherence, control of modifiable CVD risk factors, health behavior change, and psychosocial and cultural barriers to self-management. The SI arm consists of a collaborative care team approach with four main elements including: 1) Specialized clinical care by a medical provider; 2) Specialized behavioral health care by a behavioral health provider; 3) Group-based chronic disease self-management education by peer-leaders; 4) Intensive, proactive care coordination facilitated by a patient registry and electronic health records.</description>

    <description>The components of the Special Intervention (SI) integrated design are: 1) Co-location of the clinical team; 2) Shared medical plan; 3) Clinical visits with a medical provider for management of chronic medical conditions; 4) Visits with behavioral health provider for management of psychosocial chronic conditions; 5) Care coordination; 6) Six group-health education classes and two booster sessions led by a promotora. Participants in the SI arm meet with the integrated care team in the context of a regular medical visit primarily to focus on clinical/biological aspects of the chronic medical conditions (diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, etc.)</description>
