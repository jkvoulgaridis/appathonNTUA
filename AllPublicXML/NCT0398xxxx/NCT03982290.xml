  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) comprises a complex group of disorders of neuronal
      development characterized by social and communication impairment along with presence of
      repetitive and restrictive behaviors. Emerging evidences support the gut-brain axis and
      further microbiota-gut-brain axis. Elevated prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction
      in individuals with ASD suggested that targeting gut may benefit patients with ASD.
      Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) was reported to be a psychobiotic in several animal
      studies which modulated the levels of neurotransmitters in different brain areas. The current
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to investigate the psychophysiological
      effects of PS128 in preschool children with ASD.
