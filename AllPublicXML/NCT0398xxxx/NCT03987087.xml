      This randomized phase II study compare survival outcomes and toxicity of malignant pleural
      effusion stage IV non small-cell lung cancer patients Intrapleural infusion chemotherapy in
      combination with concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) VS not combination with

      Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication of stage IV NSCLC. MPE caused by
      lung cancer accounts for about 1/3. According to statistics, the number of MPE cases per year
      in the United States exceeds 150,000. At the same time, with the development of
      three-dimensional radiotherapy technology, the wide application of comprehensive treatment
      concept, and the understanding of the relationship between different metastatic state and
      survival of stage IV NSCLC, prospective and retrospective studies have confirmed that
      systemic therapy combined with primary tumor three-dimensional radiation Treatment is more
      conducive to improving symptoms and prolonging survival than medication alone. Retrospective
      results and prospective findings have been reported from the single center of the study group
      [Chinese Journal of Radiation Oncology, 2011, sixth issue and the first issue of 2012],
      taking local three-dimensional radical radiotherapy for chemotherapy, two Complementary
      technological advantages can significantly prolong survival and improve quality of life,
      enabling some patients to achieve long-term survival. However, most of the above studies
      excluded patients with malignant pleural effusion. For stage IV NSCLC of malignant pleural
      effusion, whether the primary tumor radiotherapy can bring survival benefits, has not yet
      formed a unified norm and conclusion, and needs further development. the study.
