      Patients with prediabetes and moderate-to-severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). To determine
      the recruitment yields from electronic medical record (EMR) vs the general community. To
      assess the adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy among patients with
      prediabetes and moderate-to-severe OSA.

    <time_frame>1 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have PAP usage monitored with the ResMed AirView Remote Monitoring system. An intervention will be required when PAP adherence decreases or if any other issues are identified that require a face-to-face visit. A phone contact or in-person visit will be scheduled if the following findings observed for ≥3 consecutive nights:
Suboptimal adherence (&lt; 5 hours per night);
Mean leak is high (&gt; 20 L/min); or treatment is not optimal (AHI ≥ 5 events/h)
Each participant will have a follow-up visit ~ 7 days after starting PAP therapy</description>

    <description>All enrolled participants will have participants' PAP usage monitored by Fusion Health using the ResMed AirView Remote Monitoring system. Fusion Health will provide individual care for each participant by monitoring daily PAP usage by all study participants. This assessment ensures routine follow-up of PAP adherence during the study. The responsibility for patient care during the study, however, will fall on clinical site staff with any needed assistance by the Fusion Health staff. An intervention will be required when PAP adherence decreases or if any other issues are identified that require a face-to-face visit.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Lifestyle Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>A lifestyle intervention program adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Study participants will start lifestyle intervention on the day of initiating PAP therapy. The 3-month program will be followed: Patient-facing Online Platform: The program will be accessible to study participant via the Web or a Web application available for the Android and iOS devices. Behavioral Weight Loss Goals and Lessons: The program begins with an introductory session that presents the basic goals for the program followed by 12 weekly multimedia lessons. Submission of self-monitoring data: Participants will submit daily weight, caloric intake, and physical activity minutes at least weekly to the study website for 12 weeks. Automated Feedback: In response to the self-monitoring data, participants receive a weekly automated message that compares participants' self-reported values to participants' goals for weekly and overall weight loss, caloric intake, and physical activity minutes.</description>
