  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plant stanols are known to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, studies have
      suggested that these compounds also influence the immune system. Asthmatic responses are
      predominantly T helper (Th)2 cell dependent, while plant stanols were previously found to
      activate Th1 cells and shift the immune response away from the Th2 cell dominant asthmatic
      response. The question now is whether this also translates into a reduction of clinical
      symptoms in asthma patients.The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate clinical
      benefits of prolonged consumption of plant stanols (delivered via plant stanol esters) in
      asthma patients. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the mechanisms via which plant
      stanols modulate the immune system and to evaluate the effects of plant stanol ester
      consumption on cardiovascular (CVD) risk parameters.

    <description>The ACQ consists of seven questions: five questions are on asthma related symptoms, one on medication use and one on the FEV1. Participants are asked to score their symptoms and medication use of the past week on a scale from zero to six. The score of the ACQ is the average score on the seven questions. A score of zero means that asthma is fully controlled; a score of six means that asthma is severely uncontrolled. The minimal clinically important difference is 0.5. The ACQ has been validated and is widely use in research and clinical settings.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with allergic asthma (GINA step 2) which is in a stable phase at the moment
             of inclusion (defined as no changes in asthma control and lung function in (at least)
             the past three months)

          -  Have been treated with low dose ICS for at least one year

          -  Aged 18-70 years old

          -  BMI between 20 and 35 kg/m2
