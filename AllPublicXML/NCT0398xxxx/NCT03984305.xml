  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate whether people whose PD symptoms are
      uncontrolled who are managed with the aid of objective measurement and use of target ranges
      have improved PD symptoms and outcomes as compared to individuals treated using only standard
      of care (medical history, neurological examination).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate treating uncontrolled patients with
      Parkinson's Disease (PwP) to a target range as suggested by expert review papers. The study
      aims to evaluate clinical patient outcomes, quality of life measures and health care
      utilization of those patients specifically treated to a target range when using the PKG data
      in the clinical management of Parkinson's disease (PD) in routine clinical care (treatment
      group) compared to those managed with medical history and clinical evaluation alone (control
      group) performed by a neurologist experienced in PD management. Both groups will be
      recommended to undergo medication changes until they reach a &quot;controlled state&quot; that is
      determined by either the clinician using standard of care (SOC) (PKG- Group) or using PKG
      based targets and SOC assessments (PKG+ Group).
