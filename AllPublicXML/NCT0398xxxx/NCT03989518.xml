  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imaginal exposure is a widely used psychological treatment technique. Imaginal extinction is
      an experimental analogue of imaginal exposure, that allows the study of this treatment
      technique under controlled circumstances (Agren, Bj√∂rkstrand, &amp; Fredrikson, 2017). During
      imaginal extinction, experimentally induced fear is diminished through repeated exposure to
      mental imagery of the feared (conditioned) stimulus. However, it is not known to what extent
      fear reduction depends on the mental imagery produced during this procedure. A better
      understanding of the mechanisms driving the effects of imaginal exposure and the factors
      moderating fear reduction could have significant clinical utility, by suggesting
      mechanistically informed ways to improve this treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study takes part over three consecutive days, with fear conditioning to visual stimuli on
      day 1, imaginal extinction on day 2, and a fear reinstatement procedure, again to visual
      stimuli, on day 3. Skin conductance is used to measure fear responses.

      Participants' are randomized to receive conditioning, extinction and reinstatement with
      either complex or simple stimuli. During imaginal extinction, imagery of each experimental
      stimulus is prompted through different verbal instructions.

    <description>Day 3 (48 h after day1). Participants are exposed to the same stimuli used during fear conditioning (day 1) and imaginal extinction (day 2). Two unsignaled shocks are delivered at the beginning of the experiment, prior to the presentation of the first visual stimulus. No further shocks are delivered. This procedure allows the study of long term effects of imaginal extinction.</description>
