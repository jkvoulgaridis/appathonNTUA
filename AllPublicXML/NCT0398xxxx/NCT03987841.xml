  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a single-arm pilot study of an integrated mindfulness-based stress reduction
      (MBSR)/diabetes self-management education (DSME) intervention in a small group of
      participants, low-income adults with type 2 diabetes and diabetes distress. We will evaluate
      the preliminary efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will comprise components of MBSR and DSME and will be delivered in a group
      setting with 12 weekly sessions followed by monthly spaced reminders for 3 months for a total
      duration of 6 months. We anticipate enrollment of 30 participants, who will be adults with
      poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and elevated diabetes distress recruited from Cooper Green
      Mercy Health Systems, a safety-net health system serving residents of Jefferson County,
      Alabama. A trained masters-level interventionist will deliver the integrated intervention.
      The aim of the intervention is to reduce diabetes distress and improve glycemic control.

      Participants will be assessed at baseline and 6-months. We will assess the preliminary
      efficacy of the intervention through pre/post evaluation of diabetes distress, diabetes
      self-management behaviors, and glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c. Additionally,
      we will assess acceptability of the intervention through follow-up qualitative,
      semi-structured interviews of intervention participants; the feasibility of intervention
      delivery will be assessed using process measures.

    <description>Measured by the diabetes distress scale (DDS), a 17-item self-report measure, assessing domains of emotional burden, physician-related distress, regimen-related distress, and interpersonal distress. The questionnaire will be administered to participants in English by a trained interviewer. The mean item score yields a possible score from 1 to 6; a score of &lt;2 indicates little/no distress, 2 to 2.9 moderate distress, and ≥3 high distress.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have a point-of-care A1C measured; A1C will be obtained by trained study personnel using finger-stick testing with the A1C Now+20 Test Kit (PTS diagnostics). A1C reports a % glycated hemoglobin level; a higher score indicates higher average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months. An A1C greater than or equal to 7.5% indicates poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.</description>

    <measure>Diabetes self-management behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA), a 10-item self-report measure that assesses diet (4-items), exercise (2-items), blood-glucose testing (2-items), and foot care (2-items). An example item is &quot;How many of the last seven days have you followed a healthful eating plan?&quot; Participants respond based on their self-care experience for the preceding week, from 0 to 7 indicating the number of days the participant performed the behavior. Each subscale is scored separately and scores are not combined. For each subscale, the score is the mean item score (i.e. mean number of days the activity was performed, range 0-7). A higher score indicates higher adherence to the self-care behavior. The questionnaire will be administered to participants in English by a trained interviewer.</description>

    <description>Acceptability will be assessed by conducting qualitative, semi-structured interviews with participants at the conclusion of the intervention. The interviews will gather participants' perspectives on the following: assessment of intervention content, perceived positive or negative effects, appropriateness of intervention duration and frequency, barriers to engagement, suggestions to improve the intervention, and overall satisfaction. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed. A combined inductive/deductive approach will be used for qualitative analysis, to identify themes reported by participants.</description>
