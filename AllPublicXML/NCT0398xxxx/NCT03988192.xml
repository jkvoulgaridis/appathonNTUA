  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of volatile organic compounds (VOC) detected in exhaled air or in sweat, is an
      innovative research area for respiratory diseases. The volatolomic analysis can be done
      either by the technique of the mass spectrometry which allows the identification of each VOC
      in the exhaled air or by the technique of electronic nose, simpler and faster, which provides
      an idea of the general profile of the VOC without identifying them. The VOC have shown their
      interest in some situations, such as diagnostic or prognostic tool in patients followed for
      thoracic tumorous pathology or bronchial or pulmonary vascular diseases.

      Immunotherapy is a new therapeutic approach used in non small cell lung cancer in a late
      stage.

      VOC analysis could allow to identify biomarkers of early response to immunotherapy. The study
      of VOC could help in the optimisation of immunotherapy prescription in lung cancer.
