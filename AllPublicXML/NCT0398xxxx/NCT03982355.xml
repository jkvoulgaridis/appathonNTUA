      Laboratory based study in which novel tissue oxygenation probe with the potential provide
      novel means for assessing response to cancer treatment will be developed and validated.

    <textblock>
      Tumour hypoxia is feature common to most solid tumours, with significant implications in
      tumour aggressiveness, metastatic potential and response to therapy. Tumour oxygenation
      monitoring is likely, therefore, to provide a valuable adjunct in risk stratification and
      treatment response monitoring.

      Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) utilises the differing absorption of oxygenated as
      compared to deoxygenated haemoglobin to provide an accurate measure of tissue oxygenation.

      This project aims to develop and validate a tissue oxygenation probe for cancer monitoring.
      Using the clinical paradigms of rectal and breast cancer, anonymised MRIs of cancer sufferers
      will guide simulations of tissue optical properties to develop a DRS probe. The 3D
      reconstructed sans will then be used to 3D print tissue phantom models on which the DRS probe
      will be validated against reference bench top analysers.
