    <description>Patients will receive the vaccine on a 28-day cycle. It will be given weekly (+/- 3 days) during Cycle 1 (i.e., C1D1, C1D8, C1D15, C1D22) as a priming phase followed by booster injections on Day 1 (+/- 7 days) of each subsequent cycle (i.e., C2D1, C3D1, etc.). Vaccine administration will continue indefinitely until development of intolerance or disease progression in the case of fatal high grade neoplasms. Otherwise, vaccination will continue until intolerance or one year for non-fatal tumors. Additionally, patients with non-fatal tumors who complete one year of vaccinations and have stable disease will be given the option of resuming vaccinations if they develop subsequent progression.</description>

               -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy is permitted provided dosing is minimal based on
                  age 0.1mg/kg/day with a max of 4mg daily (dexamethasone or equivalent) on the day
                  of vaccine administration.

               -  Bevacizumab will be allowed if given for symptomatic control of vasogenic edema
                  and to avoid high dose of corticosteroids at the discretion of the treating
                  physician.

               -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or

             injection sites (deltoid region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably
             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art.

          -  Therapeutic or traumatic metal implant in the skin or muscle of either deltoid region.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or
