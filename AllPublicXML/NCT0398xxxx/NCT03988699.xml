      This study requires one year of participation with at least 21 visits to Mayo Clinic in
      Rochester MN for device programming and audiometric testing. The device is implanted during
      an outpatient surgery. Participants may keep the study device after participation is
      complete.

    <description>Measured by subjects meeting at least two of three measurements of tinnitus severity: Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) improvement by greater than 7 points using a 25-item self-assessment questionnaire with possible answers of Yes (4 points), Sometimes (2 points), and No (0 points) or Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) improvement by greater than 13 points using a 25-item self-report questionnaire on a scale of 0 to 10 with a maximum possible score of 250 or Tinnitus visual analog scale improvement by greater than 15 points using a self-reported scale consisting of a 10 cm line with verbal descriptors (word anchors) at each end to express the extremes of the symptom; 0 mm designates no pain and 100 mm designates the greatest imaginable severity of pain.</description>
