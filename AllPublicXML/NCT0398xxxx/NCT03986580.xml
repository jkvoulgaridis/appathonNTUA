  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, single-arm, multicenter study is to confirm the efficacy of
      the BarricaidÂ® when used as an adjunct to a primary lumbar limited discectomy, to limited
      discectomy alone, with regard to preventing reherniation and the recurrence of pain or
      dysfunction in a US population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm case series will enroll 75 patients at select US (approximately 8-10) sites.
      Patients that are scheduled for a single-level L4-S1 discectomy and who meet the
      pre-operative eligibility criteria will be considered for study participation. Patients that
      meet all intraoperative criteria will be enrolled into the study and treated with lumbar
      discectomy and additional annular closure device implantation. All enrolled subjects will be
      followed for at least 12 months.
