  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigators studied the impact of severe stress (in this case any event or illness
      leading to a necessity of critical care) on telomere length.

      Telomeres length analysis were determined from 2 blood samples, the initial sample drawn in
      the first 72 hours after hospitalization and the second after not &lt; 5 or &gt; 14 days. For
      patients discharged before day 5, a repeat sample was drawn and analyzed on the discharge
      day. The blood sample processing was as follows: 5 ml of blood was collected and the red
      blood cells (RBC) were lysed using the RBC lysis solution (Biological Industries, Beit
      Haemek, Israel). Isolation of genomic DNA was performed by using the DNA isolation kit for
      mammalian blood (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Briefly, DNA was isolated by the salting out
      procedure, washed and precipitated by isopropanol. The DNA was resuspended in polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) grade water. The DNA concentration was measured by using the NanoDrop
      device (Thermo Fisher, USA).

      DNA samples were analyzed for telomere length according to the method of Cawthon (2009) [20]
      with slight modifications. Each DNA sample was analyzed by two sets of primers detailed
      below, one for telomere length analysis and one for a reference gene analysis (human
      hemoglobin). The primers were diluted to 100µM in PCR grade water and then to 10µM. DNA
      samples were diluted to 2.5 ng/µl in PCR grade water. The primers sequences are shown below:

      Reaction PCR were processed as follows:

      50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 5 min, a single cycle of 94°C for 15 sec, 49°C for 15 sec; 40 cycles
      of: 94°C for 15sec, 62°C for 10 sec and a final stage of: 74°C for 15 sec. All reactions were
      performed using the Step One device (ABI, USA).
