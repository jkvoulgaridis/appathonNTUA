  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases. Asthma is characterized by chronic airway
      inflammation and associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow
      obstruction. The variability of airway obstruction is triggered by different factors that
      lead to a variety of different asthma phenotypes and subtypes. The various classification
      options for asthma (e.g. severity, by the predominantly existing inflammation or according to
      triggers), reflect its heterogeneity.

      Despite improved therapeutic methods, the prevalence and morbidity of asthma has increased
      worldwide in the last years. Asthma is a serious and growing global health problem with
      around 300 million people affected, independent of age or sex. Estimated 250'000 people die
      prematurely each year due to their asthma.

      Based on the SAPALDIA-study, the prevalence of Asthma in Switzerland is approximately 2-8%.
      Asthma is considered as a major factor in healthcare cost with up to CHF 1.2 billion per
      year. Asthma is not only a financial burden to a system; it affects the individual Quality of
      life negatively. Often health care professionals and patients underestimate the severity of
      the disease and overestimate asthma control. Severe asthma should not be equated with
      uncontrolled asthma. To reach a satisfying asthma control numerous factors need to be taken
      into consideration. Severe asthma is often associated with a high risk of frequent, severe
      exacerbations, which can even lead to death.

      Several severe asthma cohorts and registries already exists and are reported in the
      literature. The aim of such registries is in general data collection and a better
      understanding of the disease. So far, most epidemiological studies on severe asthma are
      cross-sectional with no follow up measures. Only a few studies did repeated measures using
      the same methods.

      Approximately 5% of all Asthma Patients suffers from severe asthma. These patients require
      systematic assessment and specialist care in dedicated respiratory centres. These centres
      have a key role in improving the outcome for severe asthma patients. At the same time they
      act as gatekeepers to ensure appropriate access to new, expensive therapies, this includes
      antibody treatment and interventional methods such as thermoplasty. These treatments require
      careful monitoring. It is important to ensure that they are given to the right population.
      Special assessment to monitor the efficacy and to prevent inappropriate prescribing, exposure
      of patients to unnecessary risks and excessive costs is indicated.

      For all the mentioned reasons a Swiss Severe Asthma Register and a collaboration with an
      already existing register is needed to prospectively collect data about severe asthma in
      Switzerland.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to establish a clinical register for patients with severe asthma.
      Since the number of patients with severe asthma at a single center is usually low, it will be
      important to collect data in a multi-center system to optimize the diagnostic evaluation and
      treatment of patients with severe asthma. So far, there is little reliable information about
      the frequency, phenotype and therapy of patients with severe asthma. The construction of a
      clinical register should close this gap. The primary objective is to show changes in symptoms
      control during follow up period and at study end by using the Asthma Control Test (ACT).
      Secondary endpoints are to collect data to better understand asthma's natural history in
      patients with severe asthma. The examination will be based on the assessment of the
      parameters specified under &quot;outcomes&quot;.

      Patients presenting to participating study center (pulmonologists in private practice or in
      pulmonary departments in hospital within Switzerland) with severe asthma will be asked to
      take part in this study when corresponding to the eligibility criteria. All patients with
      severe asthma will be included in the register only after detailed information and written
      consent. After four months (for specific therapies) and after 12 months, patients should be
      re-evaluated for up to 15 years. These follow-up data will also be recorded in the register.
      During the follow-up visits, the same parameters will be collected as during the initial
      Baselineexamination (some parameters will be omitted, for example, therapy received or
      requested for the defined period of the last 12 months, etc.). Severe asthma patients
      receiving a new specific therapy, e.g. obtained with antibodies, but who cannot be included
      in the register with the complete parameter profile due to time or capacity reasons of the
      centers, should be recorded at least with defined basic data and a reduced number of
      parameters in the register. These parameters include according to the specific asthma
      approved specific therapies, socio-demographic data, lung function values, laboratory values,
      parameters of asthma control, smoking status and add-on- therapy. This should make it
      possible to record a subgroup of severe asthmatics that are suitable for antibody therapy and
      at the same time offer the attending physician the opportunity to adequately document these
      complex and expensive therapies by recording the defined parameters. In these patients, an
      evaluation of the therapy response should be carried out after four months and documented in
      the register. Thereafter, there is an annual follow-up. At any time, these patients can be
      transferred to the full version of the register by entering the missing parameters. Patients
      for whom only the basic data is available (basic version) as well as patients with complete
      parameter profile in the register are kept in the same database and can be evaluated
      together. In general, no register-specific examinations will be carried out, but only
      parameters anyway recorded routinely.

      Since this is a cohort study, no sample size calculation can be calculated. Evaluations are
      carried out continuously. The collective of the data should be described by descriptive
      statistics concerning the basic data as well as the data of the function diagnostics.
      Subentities of severe asthma should be identified by a cluster analysis.
