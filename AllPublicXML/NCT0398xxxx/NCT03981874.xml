  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroborreliosis (NB) is the second most frequent manifestation of Lyme disease. Painful
      meningoradiculitis is the most common neurologic manifestation in adults while facial nerve
      palsy (FP) and lymphocytic meningitis is predominant in children. FP is a common reason for
      pediatric consultation and FP due to Lyme borreliosis (LB) represents about 50% of the
      child's FP in an endemic area.

      The action to be taken is not formally defined for a child consulting for FP in a Lyme
      disease endemic area.

      The new recommendations of the High Authority of Health of June 2018 recommend to carry out a
      blood serology in first intention, in search of a NB in a child consulting for a peripheral
      facial paralysis. If this is positive, a lumbar puncture will be performed in search of
      meningitis. In the case of negative serology, a close clinical surveillance and sometimes
      serological control is necessary, in order to reassess the diagnosis. In adult
      recommendations, a lumbar puncture is performed first in any patient consulting for facial
      paralysis in LB endemic area.

      The main objective of this study was to describe the clinical and biological characteristics
      of pediatric NB with FP. Others objectives were to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic
      behavior of a child consulting at university hospital for a facial nerve palsy, to compare
      the initial gravity of facial nerve palsy, the duration of the paralysis and sequels
      depending on the diagnosis and treatment initiated.
