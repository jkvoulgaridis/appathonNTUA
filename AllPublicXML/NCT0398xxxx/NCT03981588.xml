    <textblock>
      CARTIER (Cardiotoxicity in the elderly) is a prospective cohort study of newly diagnosed
      elderly cancer patients equal or greater than 65 years of age conduced in one tertiary center
      (Hospital Universitario de Salamanca at Spain. The study is academically funded in its
      integrity by The Instituto de Salud Carlos III (Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and
      Universities). The investigators of the study are the only responsible for the study design,
      data collection, and data interpretation. All study participants provide written informed
      consent. All enrolled patients will undergo serial surveys, 6-minutes walking test (6MWT),
      electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, blood samples, CMR, physical examinations and
      multidisciplinary clinical evaluations; before each chemotherapy cycle and at 3, 6, 9 and 12
      months, 3 years and 5 years after finalization of chemotherapy, except for MRI that will be
      performed before 1st, 3rd, 5th cycles and at 3, 6, 9,12 months, 3 years and 5 years after
      chemotherapy ending

      Surveys completion and examinations will be obtained at the same day: within 72 hours before
      each cycle of treatment or at 3, 6, 9, 12 months, 3 years and 5 years' follow-up after ending
      the whole antitumoral course of treatment. A fully dedicated research nurse will play a vital
      role in ensuring that the study run smoothly and that all participants will be safe and fully
      informed. Questionnaires completion and quality of life assessment will initially be
      performed followed by the 6MWT. Participants blood pressure measurement, electrocardiogram
      and echocardiogram will be then taken &gt;30 minutes after finishing the walking test. Blood
      sample extraction will be performed after echocardiography to finalize with cardiac magnetic
      resonance. A complete medical history, physical examination and evaluation of these
      examinations for each participant will be performed by a cardiologist at the cardio-oncology
      unit, where prevention and treatment protocols for cardiotoxicity will be applied and
      discussed in a multidisciplinary way with referral oncologists and hematologists before every
      cycle of treatment and after course of antitumoral ending follow-up.
