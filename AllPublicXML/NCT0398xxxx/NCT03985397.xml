      Aims and objectives The aim of this study was to determine whether planned discharge training
      given by the nurse has an impact on beliefs about cardiovascular disease risk factors
      knowledge level, compliance to drug therapy, compliance to diet and self- monitoring in
      patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

      Background: Increasing frequency of AMI, discharge of patients without discharge training
      cause recurrence of the disease and death.

      Design: This study was done experimentally randomized controlled. Methods: The sample of the
      study includes 100 patients who were hospitalized due to AMI between September 2016 and
      December 2017 in coronary intensive care unit and cardiology department. The patients were
      divided into two groups according to random sampling method: intervention (n = 50) and
      control (n = 50) groups. Planned discharge training was given to the intervention group. Two
      interviews were conducted with each group with a one month break. The data of the research
      were collected by using the Patient Information Form, Beliefs about Medication Compliance
      Scale (BMCS), Beliefs about Dietary Compliance Scale (BDCS) and Beliefs about Self-Monitoring
      Scale (BSMS) and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Knowledge Level (CARRF-KL) Scale.

      Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality in all populations
      nowadays. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is considered to be the first cause of all deaths in
      the world. In 2017, 31% of the worldwide deaths (17.7 million) were caused by cardiovascular
      diseases. 80% of cardiovascular diseases are related to myocardial infarction (MI). It is
      thought that deaths due to cardiovascular diseases will reach 23.6 million in 2030.

      Myocardial infarction is an irreversible heart muscle necrosis caused by prolonged ischemia.
      There are many factors that are effective in the formation of acute myocardial infarction
      (AMI). It is significant to know these factors that pose a risk to protection from this
      disease. Some of the risk factors can be changed and others include factors that are not
      possible to change. Risk factors that cannot be changed include individual features which are
      impossible to change; gender, age, family history, and presence of ACS in the history,
      biochemical or physiological features. In addition, risk factors that can be changed include
      obesity, low HDL-cholesterol level, high blood pressure, thrombogenic factors,
      hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, high plasma cholesterol, high plasma triglyceride level,
      stress, cholesterol-rich and high-calorie eating habits, smoking, consuming excess alcohol
      and sedentary life.

      In patients with myocardial infarction, the mortality rate was 10% in the first years and 5%
      in the following years. Nurses play a significant role in the development, maintenance and
      prevention of diseases. Individuals with cardiovascular diseases should be given appropriate
      training before being discharged from the hospital. Training plan in patient/family education
      should be planned according to individual's readiness to learn, learning needs, education
      levels and previous experiences.

      In the context of an effective training: in addition to basic information such as giving
      necessary information about the disease, cardiovascular risk factors and ways to reduce them,
      the importance of life change (drug use, healthy nourishment, smoking cessation, physical
      activity, etc.), regular policlinic control and guidance to cardiac rehabilitation program;
      information to meet the basic needs of the individual (return to work after MI, sexual life,
      housework, travel, driving, etc.) should be included. It is stated that the healing processes
      of the patients who are given discharge training have accelerated, and the number of
      recurrent applications to the hospital/policlinic has decreased and accordingly the patient
      care costs have decreased and the quality of care has increased.

    <measure>Beliefs about Medication Compliance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>There are 12 sub-dimensions of the scale, namely benefit and disability; Items 1, 2, 7, 10, 11 measure the person's perception of benefit and items 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12 measure the perception of obstacles. A higher score in the benefit subscale indicates that the perceived benefit is greater with behavior. The high score on the obstacles subscale shows that the subject perceives more of the obstacles when performing a behavior. The minimum total score of the scale is 12 and the maximum total score is 60.</description>

    <measure>Beliefs about Dietary Compliance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a five-point Likert-type scale and consists of 12 items. There are two sub-dimensions: utility and obstacle. The first sub-dimension measures the individual's perception of benefit (items 1-5, 11, 12), and the second sub-dimension measures the perception of obstacles (items 6-10). The minimum total score of the scale is 12 and the maximum total score is 60.</description>

    <measure>Beliefs about Self-Monitoring Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Beliefs about Individual Follow-up Scale is a five-point Likert-type scale consisting of 18 items. There are two sub-dimensions: utility and obstacle. The benefits subscale (items 3, 5, 11, 15-17) showed that benefits were perceived more with higher scores; The high score in the obstacle subscale (items 1, 2, 4, 6-10, 12-14, 18) shows that the subject perceives more obstacles in conducting a behavior. The minimum total score of the scale is 18 and the maximum total score is 90.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Knowledge Level Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 28 items. The first four of these items are the characteristics of cardiovascular diseases, 15 items are risk factors (5, 6, 9-12, 14, 18-20, 23-25, 27, 28 items), nine items (7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 26) question the outcome of changes in risk behavior.
The items in the scale are given as a complete sentence which can be true or false and they are asked to answer &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot; or iy I do not know &quot;. Each correct answer is given 1 point. Twenty-two questions are scored straight and six questions (11, 12, 16, 17, 24, 26) are scored in the opposite direction. The highest total score that can be obtained from the scale is 28.</description>
