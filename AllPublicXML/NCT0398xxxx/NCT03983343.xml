  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of a perineal tears during labor is 70 to 90%, while in 96% of the cases it's a
      minor perineal tear (grade 1). In about 3% to 4% the perineal tear is major and involve the
      external (grade 3) and the internal anal sphincter (grade 4). Episiotomy, which is considered
      an iatrogenic grade 2 tear, is performed in about 12% of vaginal deliveries.

      Complications related to perineal tears include bleeding, the most common, that may lead to
      the development of vaginal or perineal hematoma. Additionally, local infection can develop
      and complicate the recovery from the injury. In rare cases, abscesses may occur and in rarer
      cases necrotizing fasciitis or recto-vaginal fistula may also evolve.

      The &quot;gold standard&quot; method for repairing perineal tears is to use absorbable (preferably
      fast-absorbing) sutures. Grade 1 tears that do not bleed and do not disrupt the anatomical
      structure of the perineum usually do not require repair. Grade 2 tears are usually sewn in a
      continuous absorbent suture and less in the form of single stitches.

      The use of adhesive glue to repair skin injuries began 20 years ago and the main adhesive
      used is dermabond® (Ethicon Inc. octyl-2-cyanoacrilate). The use of glue is faster and lead
      to less pain than the use of stitches or staples. It can be used for a variety of large or
      small, traumatic or iatrogenic wounds, with a cosmetic result, infection rate, and dehiscence
      rate similar to those achieved by stitches or staples.

      In light of this, the investigators intend to conduct a randomized trial that will examine
      the advantages and disadvantages of the use of glue compared to the traditional sutures for
      closure of the skin in perineal tears grade 1 and 2 and episiotomies after vaginal delivery.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the use of adhesive glue to close the skin in perineal
      tears grade 1 and 2 (including episiotomy), will be faster and associated with less pain
      compared to the traditional suturing method, without a significant difference in the rate of
      complications.

      Trial design: Randomized controlled trial.

      Objectives: To examine the effect of adhesive glue compared to fast-absorbable running
      sutures on pain sensation following repairing perineal skin in cases of tears grade 1 and 2.

      Trial population: Women delivering vaginally at Emek Medical Center, and experience a
      spontaneous perineal tear, grade 1 or 2, or episiotomy.

      Trial course:

      Eligible patients will be asked to participate in this trial before perineal tear repair.
      Following providing an explanation about the trial, patients will be asked to provide written
      informed consent to participate in the trial.

      The patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio:

        1. Suturing the perineal skin of the perineum using fast-absorbable running sutures (Vicryl
           Rapide 3-0)

        2. Closing the perineal skin using adhesive glue- dermabond®. Other than skin closure, both
           groups will be treated similarly according to standard protocol used for perineal tear
           repair.

      Sample size In order to detect a reduction of 20% in the VAS (visual analogue pain score)
      within 2 hours of the procedure between the groups [from 40% to 20% in the running sutures
      and glue groups, respectively) with a level of significance of 95% (α = 0.05 - two tailed)
      and a power of 80% (β = 0.2) a sample size of 182 women (91 per group) is needed.

Closing the perineal skin using adhesive glue- dermabond®. Other than skin closure, both groups will be treated similarly according to standard protocol used for perineal tear repair. In both groups, the walls of the vagina, the perineal muscles and the subcutaneous tissue will be repaired and approximated using the standard method, i.e. with running sutures using Vicryl Rapid Stitch 2-0.</intervention_model_description>
