      This study evaluated the effectiveness of two manual toothbrushes, the T-shaped toothbrush
      (Denson™, Malaysia) and a conventional toothbrush (Kid's Soft Toothbrush, Colgate) in
      removing plaque and maintaining gingival health among 8-10-year old children.

      Brushing demonstration was provided at baseline and reinforced at 2 weeks and 1 month
      interval.Plaque scores and gingival scores were measured at 2 weeks and 1 month and 3 months

    <textblock>
      T-shaped toothbrush (Denson™, Malaysia) was introduced that is designed to efficiently clean
      and reduce gingival inflammation. Unlike most common conventional manual toothbrush, this new
      toothbrush was designed to employ a vertical motion on all tooth surfaces which simulates the
      natural up and down movement of the hand, suggesting that this makes the brushing process to
      be more controlled and stable.

      One hundred and ten participants were assigned randomly to conventional toothbrush (Kid's
      Soft Toothbrush, Colgate) as a control group, while another half were assigned the T-shaped
      toothbrush (Denson™, Malaysia) as an experimental group.

      Gingival status was scored using the Loe and Silness Gingival Index 25. The amount of plaque
      was scored using the modified Quigley and Hein Plaque Index (TQHI) 26. Both indices were
      recorded at 6 sites around all the teeth (mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiopalatal,
      midpalatal, distopalatal). All teeth were included except teeth with prosthetic crowns or
      cervical restorations.

      One hundred children completed the study.

    <description>Plaque score measurement performed at baseline, after 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months.
Plaque score measurement (amount of plaque) was recorded on both the buccal and lingual sides of all teeth using the modified Quigley and Hein Plaque Index (Turesky et al., 1970) {0-no plaque present, 1- separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin, 2- a thin, continous band of plaque at the cervical margin, 3- a band of plaque wider than 1mm but covering less than 1/3 of the surface, 4- plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of the surface, 5- plaque covering more than 2/3 of the surface}. Each tooth was scored in six areas: mesiofacial, midfacial, distofacial, mesiolingual, midlingual and distolingual. The minimum and maximum score per tooth was 0 and 30. The scores for each participant was summed and divided by the total number of measurements (number of teeth scored multiplied by six). Higher scores indicated worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Gingival status</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gingival status measurement performed at baseline, after 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months.
Gingival status (gingival inflammation) was scored using the Loe and Silness (Loe &amp; Silness, 1963) {0-absence of inflammation, 1- mild inflammation, 2- moderate inflammation, 3- severe inflammation}. Each tooth was scored in six areas: mesiofacial, midfacial, distofacial, mesiolingual, midlingual and distolingual. The minimum and maximum score per tooth was 0 and 18. The scores for each participant was calculated by adding all the individual plaque scores and dividing this sum by the total number of measurements (number of teeth scored multiplied by six). Higher scores indicated worse outcome</description>
