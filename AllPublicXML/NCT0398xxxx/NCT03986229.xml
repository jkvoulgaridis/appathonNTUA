  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown the existence of a proprioceptive deficit in patients with Ehlers Danlos
      Syndrome (EDS) (genetic pathology of connective tissue with hypermobility, multifactor joint
      instability). A study dating from 2010 showed a qualitative improvement in disability when
      wearing compression garments (CG) in this pathology, particularly in the fields of
      proprioception and balance.

      The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect of CG on standing static balance in
      patients with EDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of CG on standing static balance in patients with EDS, this study is a
      pilot study, carried out according to a cross-over scheme of type AB/BA.

      Each patient will benefit from 2 posturological evaluations, namely without CG (treatment A)
      and with CG (treatment B). Patients will be randomly assigned to 2 groups: the AB or BA
      sequence will be randomized for each patient.

      For each evaluation, a measurement with eyes open and eyes closed will be performed.

      A clinical balance assessment by the Berg test will be performed for each of the conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  EDS patients over 18 years of age walking around without technical assistance.

          -  Patients will need to be diagnosed both during the interview (presence of a family
             history, hypermobility and joint instability that has been evolving for years) and
             with a guide for analysis from EDS to AP-HP.

          -  Beighton's score must be 5/9 or higher.

          -  Free from any other pathology likely to have an impact on the balance.

          -  Patient with a CG as part of his or her management of the EDS

          -  Sufficient understanding to understand the objectives of the study and give consent.

          -  Patient affiliated or benefiting from a social security scheme

          -  Allergies to one of the components (Polyamide and Elastane) of the CG

          -  Recent compression garments less than 6 months old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient under guardianship, curators, justice protection.

          -  Comorbidity likely to influence balance.

          -  Significant pain (assessed by the patient) induced by the use of CG.

          -  Any acute event requires the postponement of the assessment to ensure that the
             patient's progress is in the usual conditions.

          -  Any acute pathology having an impact on the musculoskeletal system and/or general
             condition.

          -  Pregnancy/breastfeeding

          -  Compression garments over 6 months old.
