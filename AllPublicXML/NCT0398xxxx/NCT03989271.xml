    <textblock>
      This study determines whether quercetin supplementation reduces the inflammation and
      oxidative stress markers in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is small
      study with 8 subjects receive quercetin 2000 mg/day and 4 subjects receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disorder and affects
      millions of people globally. Although the exact mechanisms of pathogenesis of this disease
      are not well-understood, the general consensus is that oxidative stress and inflammation
      induced by exposure to cigarette smoke or other environmental or occupational hazards are
      responsible for development of COPD. Therefore, therapies aimed at decreasing oxidative
      stress and inflammation constitutes an important component of treating COPD.

      The current pharmacological therapies may provide temporary symptom relief, reduce acute
      exacerbations and hospitalizations, but are associated with side effects. Therefore
      complementary method of treatment with potentially fewer side effects and relatively
      well-tolerated provide promising alternative. One such compound is quercetin, which is plant
      polyphenol and is present in variety of foods that we consume. Quercetin has potent
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in
      a preclinical model of COPD. Quercetin exerts it antioxidant properties not only by
      neutralizing free radical species, but also by enhancing the expression of antioxidant
      enzymes. Similarly, quercetin inhibits various protein and lipid kinases by competing for
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding sites thus reducing the inflammatory pathways.
