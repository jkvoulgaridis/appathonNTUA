  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of a memory retraining
      program and a processing speed program in a spinal cord injured (SCI) population. The study
      is designed to research how well different types of techniques can help people with SCI
      improve in areas where they might have difficulties such as memory or processing speed, (time
      it takes to process information provided).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the currently proposed randomized clinical trial are to (1) apply a
      treatment protocol for Processing Speed and Learning and memory impairments, well-validated
      in other neurological populations, to individuals with SCI with objectively observable
      deficits in these areas and document efficacy on standard neuropsychological testing; (2)
      assess the effectiveness of the interventions in persons with SCI utilizing global measures
      of everyday life; (3) evaluate the long-term benefit of treatment. Prior to enrollment in the
      study protocol, all potential subjects will undergo a 2-part screening: (1) an initial
      screening examination via telephone during which basic information will be gathered and (2) a
      detailed, in-person screening that will be completed on if the subject passes the initial
      screen. Individuals must meet full screening criteria to be eligible for participation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  I am between the ages of 18 and 75 years old.

          -  I have a spinal cord injury with the level of injury between C1-T12.

          -  I am non-ambulatory (I use a wheelchair as my primary means of getting around).

             until my current illness or infection is successfully treated.

          -  I have any neurological condition other than SCI (Alzheimer's disease, dementia,
             stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, etc.).

             function).

          -  My vision is impaired- more than 20/60 in worst eye (with prescription eyewear).

          -  I have been taking steroids, benzodiazepines, or certain neuroleptics within past
