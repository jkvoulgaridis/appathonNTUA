  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep ocean mineral water has been shown to improve exercise phenotypes in human and animal
      models. However, there is yet to be an investigation of Algae species such as Lithothamnion
      that absorb and concentrate these minerals. Therefore, the AAP trial will investigate the
      effect of water soluble Lithothamnion species on exhaustive exercise-induced blood lactate
      accumulation, recovery and power output in trained cyclists.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The potential for naturally derived combinations of marine minerals to improve exercise
      performance is growing throughout the scientific literature and has physiologically plausible
      mechanisms, likely through the diverse molecular and enzymatic actions of individual (or
      combinations of) minerals (such as Calcium and Magnesium).

      Despite the biological potential, there is little consciences whether mineral supplementation
      can improving markers of, and exercise performance. One recent investigation of deep ocean
      mineral water (high in marine minerals) showed that when consumed prior to exercise, blood
      lactate response improved with hyperthermal running and is supported in animal models -
      however, this is not supported elsewhere in humans. Nonetheless, others have shown, in human
      models, that deep ocean mineral water may improve exercise recovery, aerobic exercise
      performance, improve lower leg power output and hydration status compared to either placebo
      or sports drink. Furthermore, animal models support these plausibilities with improved
      mitochondrial biogenesis, biomolecules of exercises performance, cardiovascular hemodynamics,
      inflammatory cytokine responses to exercise and overall exercise adaptation.

      As ocean minerals are absorbed by marine organisms, Algae species such as Lithothamnion have
      higher concentrations of the same ocean minerals but structured differently at the nano scale
      and thus may have the potential to be more effective at improving exercise phenotypes.
      Therefore, the proposed exploratory RCT will investigate the effects of water soluble
      Lithothamnion species on exhaustive exercise-induced lactate accumulation, recovery and power
      output in trained cyclists, compared to a placebo.

    <description>Lithothamnion species is rich in calcium, magnesium (Mg) and 72 other trace elements absorbed from sea-water during the organisms life. Mineral-rich 'fronds' break off from the living organism, fall to the ocean floor and are harvested (AquaminF). The mineral extract in soluble form contains ~13.1% Calcium, ~1.04% Magnesium and measurable levels of 72 other trace minerals. Following or prior to a washout period (crossover intervention), participants will consume the Aquamin Soluble equivalent of 1000mg Calcium in 250 ml of orange flavored water for a 7 day loading period.</description>
