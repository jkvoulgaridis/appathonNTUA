  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect data to support the development and validation of a
      machine learning model for the automatic detection, prediction and monitoring of labour,
      through the use of a wearable sensor (Bloomlife sensor) that can be easily used at home.

      Women participating in the study will be asked to regularly record data with the Bloomlife
      sensor, from inclusion in the study until delivery. In addition, clinical information related
      to their pregnancy and delivery will be collected.

    <description>Women use the Bloomlife sensor to collect data throughout their pregnancy. The collected data is stored locally in the device, but it is not used to provide any feedback to the patients or to the clinical team. Therefore the use of the device doesn't have an impact on clinical decision making and patients' care.</description>
