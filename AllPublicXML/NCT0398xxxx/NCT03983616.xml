  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the frequency and severity of invasive pneumococcal infections and questions about the
      place of VPC-13 in the prevention of pneumococcal infections in adults based on the presence
      of risk factors, current laboratory surveillance should be supplemented with data on the
      clinical features of adult invasive pneumococcal infections (IPI) cases. In particular it is
      necessary to collect for these cases, the clinical forms, the severity and the existence of
      risk factors and to make the link between these characteristics and those strains of
      pneumococci responsible for the IPI in particular, their serotype. The follow-up of the
      evolution of the cases according to the presence of risk factors, their clinical form and
      their serotype coverage (vaccine strain or not) must to guide recommendations for adult
      VPC-13 and to monitor the effects of VPC-13 vaccination recommendations. These effects are
      indirect, linked to the effect of vaccination of children with VPC-13 since 2010, which
      modifies the serotypes responsible for infections in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients,
      and the direct effects of possible use of the conjugate vaccine in adults (according to the
      recommendations that will be given by the Vaccination Technical Committee of the High Council
      of Public Health). The project is based on the existing network of 23 Regional Pneumococcal
      Observatories (ORP) located in metropolitan France and the network of infectious diseases by
      completing the microbiological collection of strains of pneumococci isolated from invasive
      infections in adults by a clinical collection in hospitals or voluntary clinics where the
      laboratory participates in the ORP. Given the establishment in 2012 of an adult bacterial
      meningitis observatory, to which the ORP are associated, this project does not include the
      surveillance of pneumococcal meningitis in adults.
