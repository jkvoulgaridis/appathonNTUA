  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this arm of the study is to find the best way to give patients this
      investigational product and determine if it can treat advanced melanoma by stimulating the
      immune system. PV-001-DV is an attenuated (weakened) strain of dengue virus developed as a
      potential preventative vaccine for dengue fever by the US Army as Dengue Virus-1 #45AZ5. This
      is the first time PV-001-DV will be given to patients with melanoma. Up to 4 dose levels of
      PV-001-DV will tested in this arm. PV-001-DV (at the lowest dose) will be given to a group of
      3 people. As each dose level is found to be safe, it will be given to another other 3 people
      at the next higher dose level, for a total of up to 10 people in this study. Investigators
      will monitor patients carefully for any harmful side effects. The side effects in people
      cannot be completely known ahead of time.

      Patients must be progressing after having completed prior therapy with a PD-1 / PD-L1
      antagonist alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4. If the patient is positive for BRAF, the
      patient must have progressed on at least one BRAF inhibitor in addition to a PD-1 / PD-L1
      inhibitor alone or in combination with CTLA-4 for metastatic melanoma.

      Patients will have a prescribed amount of PV-001-DV injected into one of their melanoma
      tumors. Scans will be performed during the study at different times to see if their tumors
      have changed in size. Patients will also have their blood and small samples of tumors tested
      for changes to the immune system. After 365 days, the trial will be completed for that
      patient.
