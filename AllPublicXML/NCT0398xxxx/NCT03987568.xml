  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to measure the hypoxia (low oxygen condition) in
      prostate cancers and its effect in survival. In this study, investigators will assess hypoxia
      by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and create a hypoxia score. Investigators will study the
      hypoxia score and how it correlates (if any) to the disease aggressiveness as well as its
      effect on the treatment outcomes.

      Primary Objective(s):

        -  To assess hypoxia in primary prostate tumors by magnetic resonance imaging.

        -  To correlate hypoxic score with disease aggressiveness (proliferation biomarkers'
           expression).

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To correlate hypoxic score with ExoHypoxic concentration in plasma of same patient.

        -  To correlate hypoxic score with fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The minimum age for this study is men 40 years and older. Prostate cancer mainly
             affects men over the age of 40.

          -  Patients with Caucasian and African American race

          -  Patients with pathology-proven prostate cancer (Gleason 6 or higher)

          -  Patients who have not yet undergone therapy (systemic drugs, radiation, or
             prostatectomy)

          -  Patients who will have a radical prostatectomy as standard of care.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an IRB-approved informed consent
             document (either directly or via a legally authorized representative).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have already received some form of treatment or are not planning to
             undergo radical prostatectomy for treatment.

          -  Patients with any other cancer along with prostate cancer.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
