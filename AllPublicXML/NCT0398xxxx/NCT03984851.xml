    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the commonest procedures performed in otolaryngology and one of its
      major complications is post-tonsillectomy bleeding.

      The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Surgicel without bipolar cautery in
      achieving primary hemostasis in tonsillectomy. The patient that were enrolled in this
      retrospective study were patients who underwent tonsillectomy and achieved hemostasis either
      by Surgicel (group A) or bipolar cautery (group B). Our results showed that there was no
      statistical significant difference between the two techniques in terms of post-operative
      bleeding events.

      Tonsillectomy is one of the commonest procedures performed in otolaryngology and one of its
      major complications is post-tonsillectomy bleeding.

      The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Surgicel without bipolar cautery in
      achieving primary hemostasis in tonsillectomy.

      The study was a retrospective cohort in three tertiary care centers in xxxx, from January
      2016 to August 2018. All patients underwent at least tonsillectomy, with a proportion
      undergoing additional adenoidectomy, myringotomy, or tube insertion as indicated, were
      enrolled in the study. Patients were stratified to 2 groups according to the surgeons
      preference for the hemostasis technique, one was subjected to cold dissection tonsillectomy
      and achieved hemostasis via the application of Surgicel to the surgical site, and the other
      underwent cold dissection tonsillectomy and attained hemostasis through bipolar cautery.

    <description>a retrospective cohort study. Two groups were assigned, the first under the care of the author [AA], in which patients of his group underwent cold dissection tonsillectomy and achieved hemostasis via surgicel (without bipolar cautery). While group B patients (consisted of 2 surgeons) underwent cold dissection tonsillectomy and attained hemostasis with bipolar cautery. The main outcome that was pursued was postoperative tonsillectomy bleeding</description>
