  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator believes that injecting Copaxone into tumors will help participants immune
      system fight cancer. This has been studied in mice and has shown encouraging results.
      Copaxone is a safe medication currently used to treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and has very
      few side effects. To be considered for this trial a tumor must be easy to be injected and
      must be at least the size of a pea. Participants will be closely monitored for any side
      effects. Tissue from before surgery will be compared to tissue after the treatment and
      surgery to be checked for immune response and anti-tumor effects.
