  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of receiving a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is recognized to
      induce behavioral responses that can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Five specific areas
      of concern have been identified, including: 1) failure to plan for future decline, decreased
      compliance and interaction with medical care providers, 3) decreased confidence and reduced
      social engagement, 4) increased physical limitations and 5) decreased medication compliance.
      In this pilot study, participants with MCI and their study partners will participate in
      behavioral interventions (primarily training workshops and classes) targeting each of these
      five areas of potential maladaptive behaviors.

    <textblock>
      Following the approval of an application reviewed by the University's Institutional Review
      Board, the researcher will evaluate the intervention using a complimentary mixed methods
      approach. The study will consist of a single-site platform trial examining the intervention
      group. There are many benefits to using a platform trial approach. First, using a platform
      trial allows the 18 participants to explore different arms of the intervention. Second, the
      platform design will allow us to also determine the effects of the interventions on patient
      help-seeking and adherence behavior in real-world care is critical to estimates of
      cost-effectiveness. As one of the specific aims of this study is to determine user feedback
      about modifying behaviors from various interventions, as opposed to determining which
      intervention is most effective, a platform trial will accomplish this.
