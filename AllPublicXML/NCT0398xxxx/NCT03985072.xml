    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase 1 Open-label Two-stage, Safety and Tolerability Study with Cancer
      Type-specific Cohorts, Evaluating Subcutaneous Administration of Andes-1537 for Injection in
      Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors that are Refractory to Standard Therapy or For Which No
      Standard Therapy Is Available. Patients with unresectable solid tumors that are refractory or
      have failed standard therapy and are deemed non-eligible or intolerant to further therapy or
      for which no standard therapy is available will be included in 6 cancer type-specific
      parallel cohorts. The following tumor types will be evaluated for potential inclusion in each
      cancer type-specific cohort: gallbladder &amp; biliary tract carcinoma; cervical carcinoma;
      colorectal carcinoma; gastric carcinoma; pancreatic carcinoma; and clear cell renal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screening, 9 patients in each cancer type-specific cohort (gallbladder &amp; biliary tract
      carcinoma; cervical carcinoma; colorectal carcinoma; gastric carcinoma; pancreatic carcinoma;
      and clear cell renal cancer) will enter stage 1. These patients will receive a dose of 400 mg
      of Andes-1537 twice a week (BIW) for continuous cycles of 4 weeks that will be repeated until
      the patients presents drug toxicity requiring treatment discontinuation or disease
      progression. The safety and tolerability evaluation will be continuous during the study. The
      efficacy evaluation will be done by analysis of the clinical objective response rate (ORR) by
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria after patients complete
      the first two cycles (8 weeks). Thereafter, clinical ORR will be assessed every 8 weeks.
      Additionally, tumor-cell activity assessment will be performed in biopsy samples after the
      patients complete the first 2 cycles (8 weeks). Tumor markers assessment according to the
      type of tumor will be evaluated every 2 cycles and at the end of study (EOS) visit. As
      predefined, and according with the decision of the Study Safety and Steering Committee, in
      those cohorts where minimal clinical response criteria were met, 15 additional patients will
      be recruited (total of 24 patients per cohort) for stage 2 of the study. Patients included in
      stage 2 will receive the same treatment regimen described for stage 1 and will be followed
      until the patients present disease progression or drug toxicity requiring treatment
      discontinuation. Patients included in stage 2 will receive the same follow-up as patients in
      stage 1.

                  therapy is not available. Standard therapy may include two treatment lines of a
                  tyrosine kinase inhibitor or a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor
                  and/or Nivolumab or other immunotherapy treatment.

          7. Have adequate organ function, confirmed by the following laboratory values obtained ≤
             3 days prior to the first treatment:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L

               -  Aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) ≥ 2.5 ×
                  upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 × ULN

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN (patients with Creatinine &gt; 1,5 x ULN may be
                  considered to participate if estimated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 60
                  mL/min)

               -  Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 ULN if
                  not on anticoagulation therapy (patients receiving anticoagulation therapy must
                  be in the therapeutic range and stable for ≥ 4 weeks prior to study entry)

          8. Patients with accessible tumor tissue, susceptible to biopsies through procedures such
             as colonoscopy, endoscopy, endocervical biopsy (among others), are required to provide
             consent for two biopsies throughout the study, to analyze tumor biomarkers. The first
             tumor biopsy will be performed in these patients in a timeframe of 28 days prior to
             the initial administration of the investigational product Andes-1537. Alternatively,
             pathological archived material may be used, if the biopsy was collected within a
             period of two months prior to initiation of treatment and with no anti-cancer
             treatment performed since the collection date. The second biopsy will be performed
             after 2 cycles (8 weeks) of treatment. If no archival material is available, and only
             one lesion is amenable for biopsy (and is the only target lesion), the Medical Monitor
             should be consulted for subject eligibility. Tumor biopsies and tumor archival
             material must be suitable for biomarker assessment as described in the Laboratory
             Manual.

          9. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             and be using adequate contraception (defined below) prior to study entry and must
             agree to continue to use adequate contraception from study entry through at least 6
             months after discontinuation of study drug. Note: Options for adequate contraception
             with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year include: tubal ligation, male sterilization,
             hormonal implants, established proper use of combined oral or injected hormonal
             contraceptives, and certain intrauterine devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g.,
             two barrier methods such as a condom and cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year. Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use
             of a spermicide. Abstinence is acceptable only if it is in line with the preferred and
             usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception. Should a female patient or a female partner of a male patient become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in the study or within 6
             months following discontinuation of the study drug, the patient should inform the
             investigator immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:
