      Hypothesis: Guanfacine (GUA) (3mg/day) will reduce drug craving, improve cognitive
      flexibility and result in associated lower drug use in women with substance use disorder
      (SUD) in an outpatient clinical setting.

      This study proposes to extend previous Phase I experimental work to address the following
      specific aims: (1) assess GUA's target engagement of drug craving and cognitive flexibility
      in a laboratory challenge session and in a 10-week outpatient clinical study, (2) demonstrate
      target validation by showing that reduced drug craving and improved cognitive flexibility
      will predict lower drug use outcomes during the 10-week clinical trial in SUD women, and
      finally, (3) evaluate data replication and scalability of GUA target effects across two
      clinical sites (Yale and SUNY-Stony Brook).
