    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of peripheral nerve stimulation on alcohol craving and
      consumption in participants with alcohol use disorder (AUD). This is a pilot investigation in
      which all participants will receive the active treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major public health concern, affecting over 16 million
      Americans. Peripheral nerve stimulation via acupuncture has been shown to directly decrease
      alcohol craving and self-administration. TheraNova has developed the Empower Neuromodulation
      System, a non-invasive, portable transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device
      intended to stimulate peripheral nerves for the treatment of AUD. In this study, we will
      conduct a cross-over, home-use study in participants with AUD. Participants will have a
      one-week control period with no treatment followed by two weeks of twice daily treatment with
      the Empower device. We will evaluate endpoints for safety and effectiveness.
