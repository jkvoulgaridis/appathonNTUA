  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of rifampin or efavirenz on
      the PK, safety, and tolerability of single doses of fedratinib in healthy subjects. Each
      study part will consist of a nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, open-label design. The study
      parts can be run in any order or in parallel. Subjects may participate in one part only. For
      each part, subjects will participate as follows:

        -  Screening

        -  Treatment period (includes baseline)

        -  Follow-up telephone call (4 days [± 2 days] after discharge) During the study, blood
           samples will be collected at prespecified times for PK. Subject safety will be monitored
           throughout the study.

          1. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to
             any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted.

          2. Subject must be willing and able to communicate with the investigator and to adhere to
             the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          3. Subject must be a male or female of any race from ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years of age at the
             time of signing the informed Consent Form (ICF).

          4. Female subjects NOT of childbearing potential must:

             a. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper
             documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or postmenopausal (defined
             as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening, with a follicle-stimulating
             hormone [FSH] level in the post-menopausal range according to the laboratory used at
             Screening).

          5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must:

               1. Have a negative pregnancy test as verified by the investigator at Screening and
                  Baseline (prior to starting study treatment). She must agree to ongoing pregnancy
                  testing during the course of the study, as applicable, and after end of study
                  treatment. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence from
                  heterosexual contact.

               2. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to
                  use, and be able to comply with, any one of the following highly effective
                  contraception methods without interruption, beginning at least 14 days prior to
                  starting investigational product (IP), during the study treatment, and for at
                  least 30 days after the last dose of IP:

                    -  Intrauterine device (IUD; non-hormonal only); tubal ligation; or a partner
                       with a vasectomy. The chosen form of birth control must be effective by the
                       time the subject receives the first dose of IP.

          6. Male subjects must:

             a. Practice true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a
             monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to use a barrier method
             of birth control (condoms not made from natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms are
             recommended]) during sexual contact with a pregnant female or FCBP while receiving
             study treatment, during any dose interruptions, and for at least 30 days after the
             last dose of IP, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

          7. Must have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 33 kg/m2 at screening.

          8. Must be healthy, as determined by the investigator on the basis of medical history,
             physical examination (PE), clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and 12-lead
             ECG at screening and check-in (Day -1), as applicable:

             Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin
             must be at or below the upper limit of the reference range, on or before check-in (Day
             -1). Other clinical laboratory results must be either within normal range or deemed
             not clinically significant by the investigator. Any out of range lab tests may be
             repeated up to one time during the screening period and up to one time at check-in per
             Investigator discretion to confirm eligibility.

          9. Must be afebrile (febrile is defined as ≥ 38°C or 100.3°F).

         10. Supine systolic blood pressure (BP) must be in the range of 90 to 140 mmHg
             (inclusive), supine diastolic BP must be in the range of 50 to 90 mmHg (inclusive),
             and pulse rate must be in the range of 40 to 100 bpm (inclusive) at screening. Repeat
             vital signs may be measured at investigator discretion.

         11. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG at screening; male subjects
             must have a corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) value ≤ 430 msec
             and females must have a QTcF value ≤ 450 msec. An ECG may be repeated up to two times,
             and the average of the QTcF values will be used to determine subject eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. History (ie, within 3 years) of any clinically significant neurological, GI, hepatic,
             renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, hematological,
             dermatological, psychological, or other major disorders as determined by the
             investigator.

          2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, that places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study or
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study (congenital nonhemolytic
             hyperbilirubinemia [eg, Gilbert's syndrome] is not acceptable).

          3. Subject has prior history of Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE).

          4. Subject has signs or symptoms of WE (eg, severe ataxia, ocular paralysis, or
             cerebellar signs) without documented exclusion of WE by thiamine level and brain MRI.

          5. Subject has thiamine deficiency, defined as thiamine levels in whole blood below
             normal range according to institutional standard.

          6. Subject has active tuberculosis or another disease caused by mycobacteria.

          7. Use of any prescribed systemic or topical medication, including vaccines, within 30
             days of the first dose administration (with the exception of any odansetron
             administered for purposes of this study).

          8. Use of any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral
             supplements and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration
             (with the exception of acetaminophen up to 2 grams/day for no more than 3 consecutive
             days to treat minor illness or headache [per Investigator judgment]).

          9. Use of any metabolic enzyme inhibitors or inducers that would affect the relevant
             drugs within 30 days of the first dose administration unless determined by the
             investigator that there will be no impact on the study integrity or subject safety.
             The Indiana University &quot;P450 Drug Interaction Table&quot; should be used to determine
             inhibitors and/or inducers of metabolic enzymes. The sponsor should be contacted for
             questions about potential drug-drug interactions and exclusions/prohibitions when
             necessary.

             reflecting consumption of illicit drugs.

         14. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM) within 2 years
             before dosing or positive alcohol screen.

             hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus at screening or have a positive result to the test
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at screening. Subjects whose results
             are compatible with prior immunization (including natural and vaccination) against
             hepatitis B may be included at the discretion of the investigator.
