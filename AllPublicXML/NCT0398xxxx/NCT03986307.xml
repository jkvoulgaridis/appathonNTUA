  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly are supplemented with either Omega-3 (3 x 1.1g per day) or placebo (corn oil) during
      14 weeks. The last 12 weeks, supplementation is combined with resistance exercise training
      (3x per week) focusing on upper leg strength. In the present project, the investigators study
      whether differences in muscle strength and/or muscle mass between conditions can be explained
      by omega-3-induced effects on systemic or muscle inflammatory signaling, or differences in
      muscle molecular signaling.

    <masking_description>Subjects are a priori randomized to one of both conditions. Both groups undergo an identical intervention, but receive different supplements (although appearance-matched).
