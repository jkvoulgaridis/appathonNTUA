    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-site run-in phase (six subjects) followed by a multicenter
      continuation phase (114 subjects), Phase IV study. Eligible subjects will be receiving
      CPX-351 as their usual medical care administered according to FDA approval, as a condition
      for participation.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized study of a non-drug intervention in subjects receiving
      CPX-351 as their usual medical care administered according to its FDA approval. The study
      intervention is the application of a prescribed outpatient care model, including a nurse
      teacher educational program and quality of life surveys for both subjects and caregivers, in
      subjects who meet medical and logistical criteria. Induction therapy and medical follow-up
      are performed without prophylactic admission to an inpatient facility.

          4. Total bilirubin ≤ 3 mg/dL.

          5. Creatinine clearance &gt; 30mL/min by Cockcroft/Gault equation.

          6. Normal cardiac function, as assessed by ejection fraction via. MUGA or echocardiogram.

          7. Total WBC of ≤ 20,000/uL on peripheral blood assessment.

          8. No evidence of active, uncontrolled infection.

          9. No evidence of clinically significant disseminated intervascular coagulation (DIC)

         10. No clinically significant abnormalities in core vital signs like heart rate, blood
             pressure or oxygenation which require inpatient evaluation or monitoring.

         11. In the opinion of the enrolling physician, the subject is not at risk for clinically
             significant tumor lysis syndrome based on clinical assessment, CBC (complete blood
             count), CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel), uric acid, and LDH.

         12. In the opinion of the enrolling physician, no medical conditions that preclude the
             subject or the primary caregiver from transportation to and from the outpatient
             clinical care facility.
