  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to collect preliminary data for a larger, multicenter clinical trial
      proposal. The study will examine two strategies commonly used to treat preterm infants
      diagnosed with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The PDA closes after birth for most term
      infants, but in many preterm infants, it remains open (patent). A PDA may present a
      complication for a number of short-term problems faced by preterm infants. Longer-term issues
      include the development of pulmonary hypertension and changes in the size and performance of
      the heart. There is ongoing debate as to whether or not the PDA requires intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants diagnosed with a hemodynamically-significant patent ductus arteriosus (HSPDA)
      will be included. Specific criteria will be followed to determine if a patent ductus
      arteriosus (PDA) is &quot;hemodynamically significant&quot;. Infants will be randomized to two
      different approaches for management of the PDA. The first will be catheter-based closure
      (intervention) and the second will be conservative management (non-intervention). Both
      procedures are standard practice at many institutions, including Nationwide Children's
      Hospital. Infants randomized to receive intervention will undergo a procedure in which a
      catheter is used to place an FDA-approved device within the PDA, to close it (like a plug).
      Infants randomized to the conservative management (non-intervention) group will be permitted
      time to see if the PDA closes on its own, naturally. However, if the PDA remains open and
      intervention is deemed medically necessary, they will also undergo the catheter closure
      procedure.

    <description>Infants randomized to this group will be treated to reduce the symptoms of a hemodynamically-significant patent ductus arteriosus (HSPDA), in the hopes that over time the HSPDA will become reduced in size (to the point of no longer meeting criteria for being &quot;hemodynamically significant&quot;) or close naturally. Infants in this group with declining health status attributable to a PDA which meet qualifying criteria may receive catheter closure (intervention) if deemed medically necessary.</description>
