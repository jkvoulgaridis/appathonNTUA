      This study will include the subjects who enrolled in DACAB trial (NCT02201771) to observe
      clinical outcomes 5 years after coronary artery bypass grafting（CABG）.

      The primary objective is to observe the occurrence of major adverse clinical events (a
      composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and coronary
      revascularization) among 3 groups in DACAB trial within 5 years after CABG.

      The secondary objectives are to observe the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events
      (a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke);
      all-cause death; cardiovascular death; non-fatal myocardial infarction; non-fatal stroke;
      coronary revascularization; grafts patency rate among 3 groups in previous DACAB trial within
      5 years after CABG.

      This study is designed to observe clinical outcomes 5 years after CABG in subjects enrolled
      in DACAB trial.

      After completing 12-month treatment from DACAB trial, investigators would not make any
      interventions or impact on subjects' therapeutic strategy. Aspirin monotherapy would be given
      to subjects according to the current guidelines. However, other antiplatelet regimens might
      be given for subjects by their attending physician based on the subject's individual
      condition. Subjects would spontaneously undergo regular laboratory test , electrocardiogram
      (ECG), ultrasound cardiography (UCG), coronary computed tomographic angiography(CCTA) or
      coronary angiography(CAG) and clinical follow-up according to clinical need and their
      individual condition. At 5-year (± 3 month) after CABG, a face-to-face visit is scheduled to
      be performed to collect the occurrence of clinical events, including types and time of
      events.

      So this study is a non-interventional, observational study.
