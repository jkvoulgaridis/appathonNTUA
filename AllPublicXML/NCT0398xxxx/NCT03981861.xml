  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in adolescent females
      and also one of the most complex. Patients experience an exaggerated ovarian/adrenal androgen
      production in response to physiologic and supra-physiologic elevations in insulin. The
      hormonal dysregulation is not only associated with acne, hirsutism, and menstrual
      irregularity, but also with perpetuated insulin resistance, central adiposity, and clinical
      depression.

      In the proposed study, we aim to treat a hormonally and metabolically well-defined group of
      adolescent girls with PCOS with a combination of two pharmacological agents: metformin
      (insulin sensitizer) and spironolactone (anti-androgen) for 6 months. Although
      hyperandrogenism is a fundamental component of PCOS and responsible for the perpetuation of
      insulin resistance, adiposity and anovulation, there are few pediatric studies that have
      examined the benefits of treating both insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism
      simultaneously. Preliminary studies in adults, however, suggest synergistic effect of both
      spironolactone and metformin (spiro-met) with near normalization of the metabolic and
      ovulatory dysfunction. Therefore, we hypothesize that spiro-met will improve adolescent
      metabolism, body composition, ovarian morphology/function. We anticipate that our study will
      generate key pilot data for further randomized, double blind placebo controlled trials using
      both agents.

      We also plan to examine functional brain MRI before and after the spiro-met intervention.
      This will allow us to inspect the effects of the hyperinsulinemic/androgenic hormonal milieu
      in PCOS on structural and functional brain MRI. We hypothesis, that the hormonal environment
      in PCOS affects centers of appetite and mood.
