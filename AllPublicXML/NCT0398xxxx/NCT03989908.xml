  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, microfluidics was applied in the creation of low-GI food gel made from
      non-traditional ingredients like alginate and soy protein isolate. This method is previously
      tested to produce lower glycaemic response than normal noodle and pasta.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has confirmed that a food's glycemic effect cannot be accurately predicted from the
      type and amount of carbohydrates it contains, as the rate at which the carbohydrates is
      digested and released into the bloodstream is influenced by many factors such as the food's
      physical form, its fat, protein and fibre content, and the chemical structure of its
      carbohydrates. For these reasons, it is possible to produce food from the same group with
      different effects on blood glucose. Consumption of low GI food has shown to improve glycemic
      control, lipid profile and reduce systemic inflammation. However, there are few dietary
      intervention studies attempting to change the GI of food by changing the staple
      carbohydrates. In this study, microfluidics was applied in the creation of low-GI food gel
      made from non-traditional ingredients like alginate and soy protein isolate. This method is
      previously tested to produce lower glycaemic response than normal noodle and pasta. With
      noodles being one of the staples to many Singaporeans, food gels formed using functional
      ingredients derived from food sources offer a lower GI alternative to the conventional noodle
      and pasta without affecting the people dietary preference.

    <description>A visual analogue scale (VAS) will be presented to the participants at 0, min, 30 min, 60 min , 90 min and 120 min, to indicate how they feel in response to 4 given statements by marking an &quot;X&quot; on a 100-mm line.
At time T=12 min, palatability of the treatment was assessed by five characteristics, from bad (0 mm) to good (100 mm). These characteristics were visual appeal, smell, taste, texture, and overall pleasantness of the meal given. Scores were determined by measuring the distance (in mm) from the let starting point of the line to the intersection of the &quot;X&quot;. Subjects did not discuss their ratings.The primary outcome was area under the curve (AUC) for responses on the VAS calculated using the trapezoidal rule.</description>
