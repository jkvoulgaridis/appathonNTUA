  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total prostatic cystectomy with enterocystoplasty is the most extensive urological surgical
      procedure and one with the highest complication rate, especially infectious complication. The
      mortality rate remains substantial (2 to 5%).

      Examination of hundreds of TPCs made every year in the Urology Department of Foch Hospital,
      shows that nosocomial urinary infection is constant, especially when the TPC is followed by
      the constitution of an ileal bladder replacement.

      This is due to the intervention itself and duration of postoperative urinary cathéters
      (ureteral and bladder). This leads to increase surveillance and antibiotic treatment, given
      the risks of declared infection in this context.

      Detailed analysis of the last 20 TPCs with enterocystoplasty showed the presence of germs in
      significant numbers, in all cases.

      Urell® (also sold under the Trademark Ellura®) contains a cranberry juice extract with a high
      content of bioactive, soluble Proanthocyanidins (PACs) . The daily dose is 36 mg total PACs
      measured by the DMAC/A2 method. The PACs prevent uropathogenic E.col bacteria from adhering
      to uroepithelial cells . Their long term use does not create any resistance of the bacteria.

      The excellent prophylactic effet of Urell® had been previously observed in the same Center
      under different conditions.

      Therefore a further demonstration was justified, of the prophylactic efficacy of Urell® in
      the perioperative setting of total prostato-cystectomy with substitute enterocytoplasty,
      where the slightest urinary infection, symptomatic or not, prolongs hospitalization and
      requires antibiotic treatment because of its harmful and sometimes major consequences.
