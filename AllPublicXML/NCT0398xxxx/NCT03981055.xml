  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to understand the mechanism and to test whether transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) combined with transcranial ultrasound (TUS) (tDCS+TUS) combined with
      physical therapy (PT) will induce significant therapeutic effects in postural instability in
      Parkinson's disease (PT) patients. The investigators designed a double-blinded, placebo
      controlled, randomized study to investigate the effects of 2 weeks of TDCS+TUS on postural
      instability in PD patients receiving PT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for Parkinson's Disease (PD), including pharmacological (levodopa) and
      surgical (DBS) methods, have limited impact on postural instability. Physical therapy (PT)
      for PD is becoming increasingly used as a means to induce benefits on patient balance.
      However, limits in efficacy and consistency still exist. In this study, the investigators
      will test the effects of TDCS+TUS combined with PT on postural instability of PD patients.
