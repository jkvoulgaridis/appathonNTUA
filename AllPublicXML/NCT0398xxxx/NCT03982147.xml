  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients who have had a stroke, memory problems are common. Some patients with memory
      problems improve over the first year after stroke, but recovery is unpredictable. The
      STRATEGIC study assesses patients with recent stroke and follows them up after one year. The
      study uses cognitive testing and advanced MRI to understand the brain's mechanism for
      recovery from memory problems and to identify factors that may predict later recovery.

    <textblock>
      Memory breakdown in older age is a major challenge for medical research, with an increasing
      burden in personal, societal and fiscal terms. Stroke is an important cause. Memory depends
      on widespread networks in the brain which are bound together by white matter connections,
      which essentially act as the wiring of brain networks. This project uses a technique called
      diffusion tensor MRI to investigate these connections and their relationship to brain
      function and patterns of memory impairment after stroke.

      Previous research showed that a tract called the fornix was most important in the healthy
      brain and in ageing. However, in individuals at an early stage of memory decline alternative
      pathways became disproportionately more important. This led to the idea that individuals with
      early memory decline might be especially vulnerable to injury to these alternative tracts
      from stroke. The purpose of this project is to test this idea.

      The project focuses on patients with recent stroke. Participants undergo MRI, including
      diffusion tensor MRI, and in-depth testing of memory and other cognitive functions. The
      pattern of damage to temporal lobe connections in the brain will be assessed and related to
      the impact of brain infarction on memory. Analysis will determine how undamaged tracts
      contribute to recovery over one year. Finally, cutting edge computational image analysis
      techniques will be applied to try and predict memory profile in more detail and extract
      maximum information about prognosis from brain images.

    <measure>Backward digit span score at 30-90 days</measure>
    <time_frame>30-90 days after stroke.</time_frame>
    <description>The digit span test measures working memory and is taken from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV. In the test participants must repeat a sequence of digits. Sequences are repeated at increasing length until the participant makes two errors at the same length. The test comprises two parts. In the first, participants repeat sequences is the order given; in the second they repeat sequences in reverse order. This outcome measure takes the total correct responses in reverse order. Sequence lengths are between two and seven digits, with to sequences of each length, giving a maximum score of 12.</description>

    <measure>Process Dissociation Procedure (PDP) familiarity score at 30-90 days</measure>
    <time_frame>30-90 days after stroke</time_frame>
    <description>The PDP is a word memory test. Participants first read out loud a set of words. They are then presented with incomplete words and must fill in the missing letters. In one part of the test, participants must use one of the remembered words whenever possible. In the other part of the test, they must avoid the remembered words. The two parts are designed to dissociate two types of memory: familiarity and recollection. Familiarity is the unconscious remembering of a word because it was previously seen, which is an advantage when including the words, but a disadvantage when avoiding them. Recollection is the conscious remembering of a word and the context where it was encountered. This is an advantage in both parts of the test. The scores in each part of the test are combined to compute scores for familiarity and recollection, each in percent.</description>
