  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many chronic stroke survivors have poor walking balance, contributing to an increased risk of
      falls and fear of falling. One factor contributing to these balance deficits is a reduced
      ability to place the feet appropriately when walking. This study investigates whether
      enhancing the sensory information available to chronic stroke survivors while they walk
      improves their foot placement accuracy and balance.

      The objective of this project is to test a method of providing real-time augmentation of hip
      proprioceptive feedback during post-stroke walking. The sensory information available to
      participants will be augmented by providing vibration of the hip abductor musculature that is
      scaled to the near-real-time mechanical state of their body. The central hypothesis is that
      augmented proprioception will improve participants' perception of their body's motion, thus
      increasing the mechanics-dependent modulation of step width, an important gait stabilization
      strategy. This clinical trial will establish the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a
      rehabilitation intervention centered on repeated exposure to sensory augmentation during
      gait. Specifically, participants in the experimental group will complete training sessions
      twice a week for four weeks in which they receive sensory augmentation during ~30 minutes of
      treadmill walking. Participants in the activity-matched control group will perform the same
      task, except the hip vibration will be randomly delivered, not linked to the body's actual
      mechanical state. Changes in walking balance and foot placement accuracy will be quantified
      over the course of the intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to either an Experimental (n=22) or Control (n=22) group. These groups will differ only in terms of how vibration is delivered to the hip musculature during training sessions. In the Experimental group, vibration magnitude will be controlled by the real-time mechanical state of the user's body. In the Control group, vibration magnitude will be randomly varied.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary effectiveness measure will be the change in participants' gait stabilization strategy over the course of the 4-week intervention. This will be quantified as the partial correlation between paretic step width and mediolateral pelvis displacement at the start of the step over a 2-minute period of walking. The investigators will calculate the change in this metric from initial (Week 0) assessment session to the final (Week 4) assessment session.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete 8 training sessions over 4 weeks, in which they walk on a treadmill at their self-selected speed. During training sessions, the magnitude of the vibration delivered over the hip abductor musculature will scale with the mechanical state of the pelvis at the start of each step. For example, if the step begins with the pelvis far mediolaterally from the stance foot, the swing leg hip abductors will receive strong vibration. If instead the step begins with the pelvis close mediolaterally to the stance foot, the stance hip abductors will receive strong vibration.</description>
