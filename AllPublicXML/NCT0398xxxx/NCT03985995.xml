      This study is to investigate the effect of CBD on acute pain in healthy volunteers in a
      well-established acute pain model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no studies investigating Cannabidiol (CBD) in an acute pain model in human beings.
      This is however of great clinical value because:

        1. Patients are often treated insufficiently with the commonly used analgesics in acute
           pain therapy or the available selection of analgesics is limited by their
           contraindications and side-effects.

        2. CBD could be an option to optimize pain therapy if the pain relief is not satisfactory.

        3. CBD in contrast to ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has only few side effects and due to a
           possible dose reduction of other analgesics patients might benefit from a better
           side-effect profile.

      This study is to investigate the effect of CBD on acute pain in healthy volunteers in a
      well-established acute pain model.

    <measure>Change in pain (numeric rating scale (NRS): 0 = no pain and 10 = maximum tolerable pain)</measure>
    <time_frame>pain will be assessed every 10 minutes using the NRS from minute 70 to 130</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain for 60 min (from minute 70 to 130) after inducing defined pain in an experimental setting (Koppert model). 2 microdialysis catheters are inserted into intradermal surface of forearm and attached to a constant current stimulator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in area of hyperalgesia (cm)</measure>
    <time_frame>from minute 70 to 130</time_frame>
    <description>Change in area of hyperalgesia (from minute 70 to 130) after inducing a defined pain in an experimental setting (Koppert model). Immediately after every pain rating the area of pinprick hyperalgesia is determined using a 256 MilliNewton (mN) von Frey Filament. The von Frey Filament will be moved towards the site of stimulation in 0.5 cm increments until the subject reports increased pain sensations from the von Frey filament (hyperalgesia). To create an area from these linear measurements, the assumption is made, that this field has the shape of an ellipse. The area is calculated using the formula 1/4πD·d.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in area of allodynia (cm)</measure>
    <time_frame>from minute 70 to 130</time_frame>
    <description>Change in area of allodynia (from minute 70 to 130) after inducing a defined pain in an experimental setting (Koppert model). Immediately after every pain rating the area of allodynia is determined using a dry cotton swab. The Cotton swab will be moved towards the site of stimulation in 0.5 cm increments until the subject reports an unpleasant &quot;rougher&quot; sensation from the cotton swab (allodynia). To create an area from these linear measurements, the assumption is made, that this field has the shape of an ellipse. The area is calculated using the formula 1/4πD·d.</description>
