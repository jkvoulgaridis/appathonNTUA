  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Birth weight (BW) is higher after frozen embryo transfer (FET) than after fresh embryo
      replacement. No study has compared the BW of siblings conceived using the same oocyte/embryo
      cohort. The aim of this study was to determine whether the freezing-thawing procedure is
      involved in such difference.

        sibling pairs where fresh embryo replacement resulting in a singleton live birth was
        followed by transfer of one or two frozen embryos from the same cohort that resulted in a
        singleton live birth, between May 2007 and June 2015.

        Twin pregnancies and stillbirths were excluded. If the BW of at least one sibling was
        unknown, the pair was not included in the study
