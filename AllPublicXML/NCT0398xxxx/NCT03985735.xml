  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a case-controlled observational trial. Sixty patients will be divided into 2
      groups (good or poor sleepers) depending on their first postoperative night Bispectral index
      data. Firstly, this study aims to characterise the gut and lung microbiota in patients with
      lung cancer treated with surgery. Secondly, it aims to evaluate microbiota and its influence
      on plasma kynurenine.

    <description>For maintenance of propofol anesthesia, total intravenous anesthesia was administered by using propofol (Fresenius Kabi, Austria GmbH) at a plasma target concentration (Marsh pharmacokinetic model software) of 2.5-4 μg/ml. Remifentanil (0.2-0.5 μg/kg/min) was given to all patients during the operation. Additional cisatracurium （0.05 mg/kg）and fentanyl (30-50 μg at the end of surgery) were used as needed, in accordance with the clinical requirements.</description>
