  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and possible effectiveness of deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens in children with autism spectrum disorder and
      treatment-refractory, repetitive self-injurious behavior. Six (6) patients will be recruited
      and enrolled in this pilot study and study duration for each patient will be one (1) year.
      All will undergo surgical implantation of the Medtronic DBS system and will receive
      stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (2 electrodes per patient).This will be an open,
      non-blinded, non-randomized, pilot, phase I trial.Expected study duration is 36 months.

    <measure>Changes in repetitive behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R; Bodfish, Symons, Parker &amp; Lewis, 2000) will be used to measure changes in repetitive behaviour pre and post intervention. The following sub-scales will be used:
Steretyped behaviour subscale
Self-injurious behaviour subscale
Compulsive behaviour subscale
Ritualistic behaviour subscale
Sameness behaviour subscale
Restricted behaviour subscale
All subscales are scored from 0-3 as follows:
0 = behaviour does not occur
behaviour occurs and is a mild problem
behaviour occurs and is a moderate problem
behaviour occurs and is a severe problem Where a higher number indicates increased repetitive behaviour.
Subscores are totaled and then an overall score is calculated.
Measure will be completed at baseline (pre-surgery), weekly from weeks 2-6 post-surgery, bi-weekly from weeks 7-10 post surgery, monthly from weeks 11-51 post-surgery, and 1 year post surgery.</description>

    <description>The Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury (ISAS; Klonsky &amp; Olino, 2008) will be used to measure changes in self-injurious behaviour pre and post intervention. The scale is scored from 0-2 as follows:
0= not relevant
somewhat relevant
very relavant Where a higher number indicates increased self-injurious behaviour. Questions are scored and totaled.
Measure will be completed at baseline (pre-surgery), weekly from weeks 2-6 post-surgery, bi-weekly from weeks 7-10 post surgery, monthly from weeks 11-51 post-surgery, and 1 year post surgery.</description>

    <measure>Changes in abberant behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (Aman, Singh, Stewart &amp; Field, 1985) will be used to measure changes in the extent that abberant behaviour is a problem pre and post intervention. The scale is scored from 0-3 as follows:
0= not at all a problem
the behaviour is a problem but slight in degree
the problem is moderately serious
the problem is severe in degree Where the higher number indicates the behaviour is problematic. Questions are scored and totaled.
Measure will be completed at baseline (pre-surgery), weekly from weeks 2-6 post-surgery, bi-weekly from weeks 7-10 post surgery, monthly from weeks 11-51 post-surgery, and 1 year post surgery.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS; Goodman, Price, Rasmussen,1989) will be used to measure changes in the amount of interference of unwanted ideas, images, or impulses pre and post intervention. The scale is scored from 0-4, where 0 represents minimal interference and 4 represents substantial interference. Questions are scored and totaled.
Measure will be completed at baseline (pre-surgery), weekly from weeks 2-6 post-surgery, bi-weekly from weeks 7-10 post surgery, monthly from weeks 11-51 post-surgery, and 1 year post surgery.</description>

    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL v. 4.0) will be used to measure changes in self-reported quality of life pre and post intervention. The statements are scored from 0-4 as follows:
0= it is never a problem
1 = it is almost never a problem 2= it is sometimes a problem 3 = it is often a problem 4= it is almost always a problem Where a higher score indicates the statement is a problem. All items are scored and totaled.
Measure will be completed at baseline (pre-surgery), weekly from weeks 2-6 post-surgery, bi-weekly from weeks 7-10 post surgery, monthly from weeks 11-51 post-surgery, and 1 year post surgery.</description>

    <measure>Changes in physical brain abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>MR images will be analyzed pre and post intervention for the following to assess physical abnormalities of the brain, including type (focal cortical dysplasia, tumor, hippocampal sclerosis, hypothalamic hamartoma, gliosis, brain atrophy), side of abnormalities (left/right/ bilateral), and location (frontal, temporal, sylvian, parietal, occipital, multilobar).
MRI data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks post-surgery, and 1 year post-surgery.</description>

    <measure>Changes in metabolic brain abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>FDG-PET scans will be analyzed to measure changes in neurometabolism pre and post intervention, specifically indications of hypermetabolism in the frontal lobes, hippocampus, and lentiform nucleus.
FDG-PET data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks post-surgery, and 1 year post-surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Changes in activity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in activity pre and post intervention will be measured using the Actiwatch Spectrum, Phillips Respironics, Bend, OR. Actigraphy is the continuous measurement of an individual's movement. Actigraph data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks post-surgery, and 1 year post-surgery. Actigraph data will be analyzed using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Measures analyzed will be maximum and minimum value amplitudes, peak to peak, variance, entropy fast fourier transform, discrete cosine function, z-transform, bispectrum.</description>

             conditions that will result in significant risk from a surgical procedure.
