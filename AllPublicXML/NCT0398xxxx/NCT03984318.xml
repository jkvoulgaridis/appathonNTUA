  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prospect of effective immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with cancer is now a
      clinical reality thanks to the approval of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically blocking
      immune checkpoints or ligands such as CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1. However, these drugs can also
      induce inflammatory and/or auto-immune complications (Immune-related Adverse Events; IrAE).
      IrAE can affect all tissues and sometimes irreversibly. IrAE may be severe or fatal in the
      absence of timely and adequate care with anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids) or more specific
      immunosuppressants. Thus, IrAE are a new type of toxicities in oncology and represent one of
      the major limitations for the development of immunotherapy combination therapies. These IrAE
      are yet unpredictable. Indeed, the induction of immunity relies on the host's immune status
      and it differs from one patient to another and so far nobody has identified the underlying
      mechanisms responsible for irAE outbreaks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18

          -  Patients with either liquid (hematological) or solid malignancy, in any line of
             treatment.

          -  Patients treated with an immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint targeted monoclonal
             antibody (mainly anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4 monotherapies and combinations)

          -  Patient should understand, sign, and date the written informed consent form prior to
             any protocol-specific procedures performed. Patient should be able and willing to
             comply with study visits and procedures as per protocol.

          -  Patients must be affiliated to a social security system or beneficiary of the same

          -  Patient able to read and write French

          -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine β-HCG pregnancy
             test within 14 days prior to initiation of treatment

          -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective
             method of birth control supplemented by a barrier method during the trial and for the
             duration planned in the SmPC or the study protocol after the last administration of
             each immunotherapy

          -  Sexually active males patients must agree to use condom during the study and for the
             duration planned in the SmPC or the study protocol after the last administration of
             each immunotherapy. Also, it is recommended their women of childbearing potential
             partner use a highly effective method of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients treated with immunotherapies that do not contain at least one
             immunomodulatory drug targeted against a co inhibitory checkpoint molecule

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          -  Patient under guardianship or deprived of his liberty by a judicial or administrative
             decision or incapable of giving its consent
