  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Stem cell or bone marrow transplants can cure or control blood cancers. Sometimes the donor
      cells see the recipient s body as foreign. This can cause complications. A high dose of the
      drug cyclophosphamide (PTCy) can help reduce these risks. Researchers want to see if a lower
      dose of PTCy can have the same benefits.

      Objective:

      To see if a lower dose of PTCy will help people with blood cancers have a more successful
      transplant and fewer side effects.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 15-65 with leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma that is not curable with
      standard therapy and is at high risk of returning without transplant, and their healthy adult
      relatives

      Design:

      Transplant participants will be screened with:

      Blood, urine, breathing, and heart tests

      Scans

      Chest x-ray

      Bone marrow samples: A needle inserted into the participant s pelvis will remove marrow and a
      bone fragment.

      Transplant recipients will stay at the hospital and be prepped with chemotherapy over 6 days
      for the transplant. They will get stem cells through a catheter in the chest or neck. They
      will get the cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. They will stay in the hospital about 4 more
      weeks. They will have blood transfusions. They will have frequent blood tests and 2 bone
      marrow samples within 1 year after the transplant.

      Donor participants will be screened with:

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Chest x-ray

      Scans

      Donor participants will have bone marrow taken from their pelvis or stem cells taken from
      their blood. For the blood donation, blood will be taken from a vein in one arm, move through
      a machine to remove white blood cells, and be returned through a vein in the other arm.

      Participation will last up to 5 years....

      Background:

        -  Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) reduces rates of severe acute and chronic
           graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
           (HCT) and safely facilitates human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical HCT

        -  When clinically translated, the dose (50 mg/kg) and timing (days +3 and +4) of PTCy used
           were partly extrapolated from murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched skin
           allografting models and were partly empirical

        -  In both MHC-haploidentical and MHC-disparate murine HCT models, a dose of 25 mg/kg/day
           was superior to 50 mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4 in terms of GVHD severity and mortality

        -  In the MHC-haploidentical HCT model, a dose of 25 mg/kg on day +4 was equivalent to 25
           mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4

        -  In addition to better GVHD prevention, lower dosing of PTCy is associated with less
           broad reduction of T-cell numbers after PTCy

      Objective:

      -Determine whether a dose of PTCy 25 mg/kg on day +3 and +4 or on day +4 only can maintain
      adequate protection against grade III-IV acute GVHD.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed hematologic malignancy with standard
           indication for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation including one of the
           following:

             -  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of intermediate or adverse risk disease by the 2017
                European LeukemiaNet criteria in first morphologic complete remission

             -  AML of any risk in second or subsequent morphologic complete remission

             -  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or subsequent complete remission

             -  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with minimal residual disease detected after
                first line therapy and/or adverse genetics

             -  Myelodysplastic syndrome of intermediate or higher score by the Revised
                International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R)

             -  Primary myelofibrosis of intermediate-2 or higher risk by the Dynamic International
                Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS)

             -  Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

             -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia resistant to or intolerant of greater than or equal to
                3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors or with prior history of accelerated phase or blast
                crisis

             -  B-cell lymphoma including Hodgkin lymphoma that has relapsed within 1 year of
                completion of primary treatment

             -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia with 17p deletion and/or unmutated IgHV or refractory
                to or intolerant of both BTK and PI3K inhibitors

             -  Mature T or NK neoplasms as defined in the WHO guidelines of sufficient type and
                severity for allogeneic HCT based on the Prognostic Index for T- cell lymphoma
                (PIT) score of low-intermediate risk or higher or on recently published clinical
                practice guidelines

             -  Hematologic malignancy of dendritic cell or histiocytic cell type

             -  Multiple myeloma, stage III, relapsing after therapy with both a proteasome
                inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD)

        -  Age 15-65.

        -  At least one potentially suitable HLA-haploidentical donor.

        -  Karnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 60

        -  Adequate organ function

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single-center, non-randomized, phase I/II study

        -  All patients will receive myeloablative conditioning, HLA-haploidentical bone marrow
           HCT, and GVHD prophylaxis with PTCy, MMF, and sirolimus.

        -  A small pilot of 5 evaluable patients will receive the standard PTCy 50 mg/kg on days
           +3/+4 to obtain a limited amount of comparative pharmacokinetic and T-cell
           immunophenotyping and repertoire data

        -  Then the study will proceed to a small, two-level [1) 25 mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4, 2)
           25 mg/kg on day +4 only] phase I dose de-escalation study based on the standard 3+3
           approach

        -  Patients will be evaluated for development of grade III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) at day +60
           as the dose-limiting toxicity and phase II will proceed with the shorter duration of the
           days of treatment (+3/+4 or +4) which is associated with 0-1 of 6 patients with grade
           III- IV aGVHD at day +60

        -  Simon optimal two-stage phase II trial design, to rule out excess grade III-IV acute
           GVHD with this decreased PTCy exposure, will be used in the phase II portion of the
           study which will enroll an additional 14 patients to see if this lower PTCy exposure is
           associated with a similar rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD as is expected with 50 mg/kg
           on days +3/+4

                  the upper limit of normal.

          -  Myeloablative conditioning is toxic to the developing human fetus and is teratogenic.
             For this reason, the following measures apply:

               -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
                  study entry and for at least one year post-transplant.

               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
                  partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
                  immediately.

               -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to
                  enrollment.

          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative to understand and the
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Pediatric patients (&lt;18 years
             of age) will provide assent, and the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) will provide
             informed consent.

          -  Subjects requiring standard therapies to prepare for HCT should be referred in
             remission if possible. However, these diseases are often aggressive and require swift
             evaluation for HCT while concurrently attempting to establish disease control through
             the administration of standard therapies. If ongoing therapy for the underlying
             disease outside of the NIH is not in the best interest of the subject according to the
             clinical judgment of the PI, then the subject may receive up to 2 cycles of standard
             treatment for his/her underlying hematologic malignancy as a bridge to HCT on this
             protocol, prior to starting the research phase of the study. The subject must have a
             Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60% at the start of the first
             cycle to proceed. If it becomes apparent that the subject will not be able to proceed
             to HCT, then he/she must come off study. Subjects receiving standard therapy will be
             told about the therapy, associated risks, potential benefits, alternatives to the
             proposed therapy, and the availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere,
             outside of a research protocol.

             as measured by HLA typing and family tree

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document; medically fit and willing to donate

          -  An HLA-matched-sibling donor who is available and willing to donate bone marrow. Note:
             The patient must have access to HCT using this donor for this to be an exclusion
             criterion.

          -  Pregnant women or women who intend to become pregnant during the study are excluded
             because myeloablative conditioning is toxic to the developing fetus with the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

          -  The potential for some of the study medications to be transmissible via breast milk of
             nursing mothers is unknown. Because there is unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding must be
             discontinued.

          -  Active malignancy of non-hematopoietic type (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers)
             which is: metastatic, or relapsed/refractory to treatment, or locally advanced and not
             amenable to curative treatment, or limited disease treated with curative intent
             treatment within the last 2 years. This excludes non-melanoma skin cancers.

          -  The severity of the hematologic malignancy does not warrant the potential toxicity of
             myeloablative allogeneic HCT as judged by the PI.

        Exclusion Criteria - Related Donor

          -  Donors must not be pregnant. Donors of childbearing potential must use an effective
             method of contraception, including one or more of the following: intrauterine device,
             hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy,
             partner s vasectomy, barrier methods (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or
             abstinence from the day of signing consent through day +60 of the recipient s HCT.

          -  Donor to which the recipient has donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies and adequate
             reduction of recipient anti-HLA alloantibodies cannot be attempted or, if attempted,
             cannot be successfully achieved.

          -  History of a psychiatric disorder which in the opinion of the PI may compromise
             compliance with the transplant protocol or which does not allow for appropriate
             informed consent.

          -  Other medical constraints that in the opinion of the PI constitute exclusion. Donors
             will be asked in the consent to refrain from certain activities prior to and during
             participation (e.g., foreign travel, tattoos); however, these do not automatically
             exclude the donor and will be reviewed by the PI.
