    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effecacy of acupoint GB26 based acupuncture treatment in patients
      with chronic low back pain. Half of the participants will partake in a 2-week acupuncture
      intervention, while the other half will receive a placebo treatment. The investigators
      hypothesize that acupuncture on GB26 reduces disability and pain more than the control
      intervention.

    <measure>Change in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline NRS score at 1 weeks, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS will ask patients to rate their pain intensity on an 11-point scale where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates worst imaginable pain</description>

    <measure>Change in Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (OLDPDQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline NRS score at 1 weeks, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The OLDPDQ score is considered the 'gold standard' of low back functional outcome tools. The questionnaire is composed of ten sections (addressing pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life and travelling); for each section the possible score is 5 and, thus, the total possible score is 50. The final score is calculated as [(sum of individual scores) / 50] *100 (%), and is interpreted as minimal disability (0% to 20%), moderate disability (21% to 40%), severe disability (41% to 60%), crippled (61% to 80%) or patients are either bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms (81% to 100%).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (both male and female) with non-specific low back pain for more than three
             months.

          -  Age range: between 20 and 60 years.

          -  Willingness of the patient to participate in the study, and written informed consent
             signed and personally dated by the patient.

          -  Chronic non-specific low back pain clinically diagnosed as repeated lumbar sourness
             and swelling pain or a chronic progressive process, accompanied by (i) X-ray
             examination to exclude lumbar vertebrate fractures, spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis
             and severe osteoporosis, and/or (ii) MRI with normal signal or low nucleus pulposus
             signal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 20 or greater than 60 years

          -  Specific causes of back pain (e.g., cancer, fractures, spinal stenosis, infections)

          -  Complicated back problems (e.g., prior back surgery, medico-legal issues)

          -  Possible contraindications for acupuncture (e.g., coagulation disorders, cardiac
             pacemakers, pregnancy, seizure disorder), and conditions that might confound treatment
             effects or interpretation of results (e.g., severe fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis)

          -  Conditions making treatment difficult (e.g., paralysis, psychoses, or other severe
             psychiatric problems based on the judgment of a physician investigator and/or a T
             score &gt;60 on the psychological assessments performed during Session 1)

          -  Prior acupuncture treatment for back pain; 1 year minimum for any other condition.

          -  The intent to undergo surgery during the time of involvement in the study.

          -  History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the judgment of a
             physician investigator, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened
             potential for adverse outcome (e.g., asthma, claustrophobia)

          -  Presence of any contraindications to MRI scanning (e.g., cardiac pacemaker, metal
             implants, fear of closed spaces, pregnancy)

          -  Active substance abuse disorders within the last 24 months, based on subject
             self-report

          -  Radicular knee pain extending below the knee
