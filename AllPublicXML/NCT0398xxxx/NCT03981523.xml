      Chagas disease (CD) is an endemic zoonotic disease with a significant global impact. Current
      approved treatments for CD (benznidazole (BZN) and nifurtimox (NFX)) were developed in the
      1970s with regimens and dosing intervals derived from decades-old patient series and with
      very limited direct comparisons. Treatment recommendations vary significantly from country to
      country and the comparative evidence-base with the current treatment regimens is limited.

      The reported efficacy of both drugs in patients with T. cruzi infection is variable and
      depends on the disease stage, the drug dose, the age of patients, and the infecting T. cruzi
      strain or genotype. Due to a therapeutic failure of at least 20% after 12 months in chronic
      patients and the high rate of adverse events, together with the recent data that suggest that
      we may be overdosing patients, we propose to test new dosing regimens of these two old
      compounds.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Lowering the frequency of drug dosing of BZN and NFX, the plasma drug levels of the
           drugs within the therapeutic range will be maintained.

        -  The duration of treatment with BZN or NFX may be related to the effectiveness of these
           drugs.

        -  Blood levels of the proposed biomarkers will significantly diminish or became negative
           after a relatively short interval after treatment.

    <textblock>
      Chagas disease (CD) is an endemic zoonotic disease caused by the protozoan parasite, T.
      cruzi. It affects 8-10 million people in Latin America and is a worldwide public health issue
      due to migratory flows. CD has a significant economic impact. Recently, a study showed that
      the global costs for CD are US$7-19 billion per year, similar or even higher to those of
      other important diseases such as rotavirus infection or cervical cancer. Treatment of chronic
      CD (CCD) has been hampered, unlike other illnesses, by the paramount importance given to the
      autoimmune theory of the disease that prevailed for many years. As a result, several
      generations of health professionals were trained in the belief that CCD had no treatment. As
      a consequence, currently, most (&gt;99%) chronically infected people are still not treated with
      specific antiparasitic drugs, and the research and development for new, more effective drugs
      was overlooked for many years, until very recently. Nowadays, the key role of the parasite
      persistence in the pathophysiology of CD is recognized, as well as the need for specific
      treatment.

      Current approved specific treatments for CD include nifurtimox (NFX) and benznidazole (BZN)
      and the recommended dosing regimens are 5 mg/Kg/day divided into two doses (2.5 mg/Kg b.i.d)
      given for 60 days for BZN, and 8 mg/Kg divided into three equal daily doses (2.7 mg/Kg
      t.i.d.) given for 90 days for NFX. The efficacy of both drugs in patients with T. cruzi
      infection is highly variable and depends on the disease stage, the drug dose, the age of
      patients, and the infecting T. cruzi strain or genotype. Moreover, the high rate of adverse
      events hampers their standard use in the field. Recent studies show that at the current doses
      of both drugs, more than 70% of patients suffer mild/moderate reactions and around 10-27%
      experience serious ones, forcing patients to stop the treatment and take appropriate
      medications for the adverse events. Data on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BZN and NFX are
      limited and there are no recent data on PK of NFX in adults with chronic CD. Moreover, due to
      a lack of early BMKs of therapeutic efficacy, the true efficacy of these drugs remains
      unknown. Seroconversion using conventional serology (CS) is often long-term (~10-20 years) or
      incomplete, and a reduction in T. cruzi-specific antibody titers often takes many years,
      rendering the evaluation of response to treatment insensitive and lengthy, and therefore
      impractical in clinical settings. The need for new, safer, and more efficacious drugs against
      T. cruzi as well as early BMKS of therapeutic efficacy are the major challenges in the
      treatment of CD, particularly in chronic adults.

      With this project, the investigators aim to achieve specific knowledge about the safety and
      efficacy of new dosing regimens for BZN and NFX. The proposed new regimens for these drugs
      are based on recent data that suggest that with half of the dosing frequency the levels of
      BZN can be maintained in the therapeutic range of this drug, which could conceivably reduce
      the appearance of adverse events while maintaining antiparasitic efficacy. At the same time,
      the investigators plan to evaluate whether the drug efficacy will be maintained if the
      investigators reduce the length of treatment with BZN or NFX to 30 or 15 days. Furthermore,
      the investigators also plan to evaluate whether the efficacy of the treatment with BZN or NFX
      is improved by increasing its duration to 90 days and to evaluate novel potential BMKs of
      response to specific treatment and eventual parasitological cure in CCD patients. The
      information obtained in this study would also allow for better-designed clinical trials with
      drug combinations, in which NFX and BZN will have a central role.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is a binary 'cured' (success), 'not-cured' (failure) variable based on a total of eight RT-PCR time points from end-of-treatment (EOT) until 36 months of follow-up. Each of the timepoints includes a total of 3 sequential RT-PCR examinations on blood samples collected during one visit. For a patient to be considered &quot;cured&quot;, a total of 24 negative RT-PCR results should be documented.
Blood samples to be collected over 7 days at EOT (15, 30 or 90 days), and at 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months of follow-up (with a window period of +/- 7 days from 4 to 12 months and +/- 14 days from 18 to 36 months).</description>

    <description>Evaluate changes over time in parasitemia as measured by RT-PCR. The unit for the RT-PCR is parasite equivalents/milliliter of blood (Par. Eq./mL). The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for the RT-PCR assay is 0.69 and 1.5 Par. Eq./mL blood, respectively.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be drawn to depict the time-to-reappearance of parasitemia for patients who have cleared parasitemia at EOT (as such this is a time-to-relapse for 'success' patients) across treatment groups. A discrete-time survival model will be used to analyze this event time data.</description>

    <description>Evaluate changes over time in the non-conventional serology biomarker (BMK) &quot;Lytic Anti-α-Gal Antibodies&quot; and incidence of negative seroconversion for it, as measured by chemiluminescent (CL)-ELISA using T. cruzi tGPI-mucins as antigens. CL-ELISA unit is the Titer (T). T is the ratio of the relative luminescence units (RLU) of the tested serum to the cutoff value (CV). The CV is calculated by defining the upper prediction limit (as standard deviation, SD), multiplied by a factor according to the number of negative controls (NC) and a confidence interval of 99.5%. For each test plate in which six NC are included, the CV is defined as the NC mean plus 4.355 times the SD. A serum sample is positive when T = or &gt;1.000; negative when T = or &lt; 0.900; and inconclusive when T &gt; 0.900, &lt; 1.000.

Therapeutic efficacy will imply a continuous and substantial drop in the reactivity after treatment. A substantial decrease has to be at least 40% compared with the reactivity at T0 (before treatment).

The unit of the aptamer assay is relative fluorescence unit (RFU). A Signal to Cutoff (S/CO) ratio is calculated for each clinical specimen by dividing the RFU value of the test sample by the cutoff (CO). The CO is the highest RFU value obtained from the endemic control specimens included in each run. The S/CO of a positive control included in the same run must meet pre-established acceptance criteria to be valid. A specimen with an S/CO &gt; 1.0 is interpreted as positive for the presence of the BMK (=infected). A specimen with an S/CO &lt; 1 is interpreted as negative (=non-infected).
Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) will define how this BMK affects binary outcomes of parasite clearance. The BMK variable will be included in the model, with repeated measures.</description>

               1. Excessive exertion in at least 25% of bowel movements

               2. Hard stools in at least 25% of stools (type 1-2 of Bristol)

               3. Feeling of incomplete evacuation in at least 25% of bowel movements

               4. Feeling of obstruction or anorectal block in at least 25% of bowel movements

               5. Manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation in at least 25% of bowel movements

               6. Less than 3 complete spontaneous stools per week

                    -  Criteria must be met for at least the last three months and symptoms must
                       have been started for at least six months before diagnosis.

          4. Hypersensitivity to the active substances (BZN or NFX) or to the excipient.

          5. Previous diagnosis of porphyria.

          6. Any other acute or chronic health conditions that in the opinion of the PI, may
             interfere with the efficacy and/or safety evaluation of the study drug.

          7. Formal contraindication to BZN or NFX.

          8. Any concomitant or anticipated use of drugs that are contraindicated with the use of
             BZN or NFX.

          9. Individuals currently known to abuse alcohol and/or drugs. Furthermore, if throughout
             the course of the study the team becomes aware that a participant is using
             drugs/alcohol that participant will be excluded from the treatment but will continue
             with the follow-up visits. The study manual outlines how abuse and dependence will be
             measured for this study.

         10. Pregnancy. Females of childbearing potential will be required to complete a pregnancy
             test prior to enrollment and throughout the course of treatment.

         11. Women in reproductive age must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, must
             not be breastfeeding, and consistently use and/or have partner consistently use a
             highly effective contraceptive method during the entire treatment phase of the trial.

         12. Transaminases (alanine aminotransferase-ALT and aspartate aminotransferase- AST). AST
             must be within the normal range, within an acceptable margin of 25% above the upper
             limit of normality for both, according to the insert of the biochemical kit being used
             in this study.

         13. Creatinine must be within an acceptable range, within an acceptable margin of 10%
             above the upper limit of normality, according to the insert of the biochemical kit
             being used. The normal ranges of transaminases (ALT and AST) and creatinine are
             defined by the inserts of the commercial biochemical kits selected to be used in the
             present study. All treatment centers (Chagas Platforms in Cochabamba, Sucre, and
             Tarija) are going to use the same biochemical kits. The participating clinical
             laboratories at the Platforms (in Cochabamba, Sucre, and Tarija) will use the Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v.5.0;
             ttps://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcae_v5_quick
             _reference_5x7.pdf).

         14. Total bilirubin must be within the normal range, within an acceptable margin of 15%
             above the upper limit of normality for both sexes, according to the insert of the
             biochemical kit being used in this study.

         15. For other standard exclusion criteria, a detailed explanation for each criterion is
             provided in the Manual of Operations and Procedures (MOP).
