      This study is an real-world, multicenter, case control study about comparing pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin Efficacy and safety of epirubicin in neoadjuvant and adjuvant
      chemotherapy for breast cancer. As this trial is a retrospective real-world study,
      investigator have given patients the dose of trial drugs based on real-world principles of
      diagnosis and treatment and their clinical experience. This trial only collects and analyzes
      patients' clinical medications, and does not interfere with patients' real-world diagnosis
      and treatment. A total of 1050 breast cancer patients are collecting from seven centers. 200
      cases in neoadjuvant and 850 cases in adjuvant group. The follow-up examinations and
      assessment of the subjects were followed by real-world medical treatment routines and the
      visits were completed according to the routine of treatment. Related check and assessments
      and collect the following data: follow-up 3years or until the disease recurs (whichever
      occurs first). Adverse events: remission or stability of adverse events caused by follow-up
      to treatment in the adjuvant treatment group, follow-up for 3 years or until recurrence of
      the disease in the neoadjuvant treatment group (whichever first occurred).
