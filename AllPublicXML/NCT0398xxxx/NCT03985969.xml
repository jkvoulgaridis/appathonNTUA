  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The enzyme responsible for the conversion of elafibranor into its active metabolite, GFT1007,
      has not been formally identified, but it is believed to have similar characteristics to an
      α,β-ketoalkene reductase previously identified in rat liver cytosol. In vitro studies in
      human liver cytosol fractions have shown that indomethacin inhibits the enzyme responsible of
      the transformation of elafibranor into GFT1007. As a result, indomethacin was included in the
      list of prohibited co-medications in all clinical trials with elafibranor, and a formal
      Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) clinical study is being conducted to elucidate the effect of
      indomethacin on elafibranor pharmacokinetics.

             (≥20mmHg) or DBP (≥10mmHg) within three minutes when changing from the supine to the
             standing position;

          6. Blood donation (including in the frame of a clinical trial) within 2 months before

         10. Any medication that may interfere with study medications absorption, distribution,
             metabolism or excretion or could lead to induction or inhibition of microsomial
             enzymes within 3 months prior to first administration;

         11. Any drug intake (except paracetamol 3g/d) during the last month prior to inclusion;
