  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center exploratory study in subjects suffering from chronic refractory pain
      to identify cellular, molecular and protein biomarkers within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

      The study aims to identify any form of correlation between biological content of CSF and
      pain/treatment success. The study population include individuals suffering from chronic pain
      which has not been effectively treated with pharmacological treatment, medical intervention
      or alternative non-invasive treatments who have been scheduled for spinal cord stimulation.

      This is a single centre exploratory study in individuals suffering from chronic refractory
      pain to identify cellular, molecular and protein biomarkers within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

      The investigators aim to identify any form of correlation between biological content of CSF
      and pain/ spinal cord stimulator (SCS) therapy success. `

      CSF will be sampled before and after SCS therapy, the samples will be analysed to explore and
      identify biomarkers that are potentially relevant to the chronic pain conditions

      . All eligible participants who are enrolled in the study will undergo screening assessment.
      Specifically, assessments will include pain scores assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),
      quality of life as assessed by the EQ-5D, disability as assessed by the Oswestry Disability
      Index (ODI), quality of sleep as assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Pain
      sensation as assessed by Pain Map and neuropathic pain as assessed by Douleu Neuropathique 4
      (DN4).

      During trial implant participants will have CSF sample taken using lumbar puncture technique.

      Following collection CSF sample will be analysed to Identify potential biomarkers.

      All participants will return to the clinic 14 (± 7) days following the procedure to assess
      the outcome of their SCS trial and complete assessments which include Pain Map, Pain VAS, DN4
      , PSQI , ODI , EQ-5D and Patients Global Impression of Change (PGIC).

      Following this participants will be followed up for end of study visit. The second CSF sample
      will be taken at this visit using lumbar puncture technique. At this visit participants will
      further be asked to complete assessments including Pain Map, Pain VAS, DN4 , PSQI , ODI
      ,EQ-5D and PGIC.

    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) used to assess improvements in pain. It is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line which is 10 centimeters (100mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one which is no pain and the other worst imaginable pain. Lower scores denote a better outcome.

    <description>The participant is placed lateral or sitting position. Fluoroscopy may be used to guide sampling. Full aseptic technique is used throughout.
The skin is prepared with either 2% chlorhexidine/70% alcohol or iodine. 1% lidocaine is used for skin local anesthesia an entry point is identified, this may be done using fluoroscopy. This will be at the lowest intervertebral foramina interspace to minimize the risk of spinal cord injury. A small amount to head up tilt will be allowed to optimize CSF flow.
Sampling is done using a &quot;needle through needle&quot; technique. An epidural needle is used to identify the epidural space using loss of resistance to saline technique. A spinal needle (26G) is then passed through the epidural needle into the subarachnoid space. Correct entry is noted once CSF is noted in the needle hub and 5 ml taken. This sample is then sent off for analysis.
Once the CSF is sampled, the needle is removed and pressure applied to the skin entry point.</description>
