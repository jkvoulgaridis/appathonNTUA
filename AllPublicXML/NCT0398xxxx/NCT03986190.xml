    <description>Adolescents will self-report their physical activity using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). A summed score of recreational and transport activities in units of minutes for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels during a typical week will be calculated using the WHO scoring guide.</description>

    <description>Adolescents will self-report their sedentary behavior (hours/week) on a usual weekday and weekend day separately using the Sedentary Behaviors Scale. Response options range from none to 4 or more hours. A composite score of sedentary hour/week will be calculated.</description>

    <description>Parent-adolescent dyads will log in to a secured website for a total of eight weeks. The intervention will be delivered primarily through smartphones and will include didactic content on healthy lifestyle behaviors (for parents/adolescents), family behavior change content for setting weekly goals and self-monitoring health behaviors (for parents/adolescents), and positive parenting content (for parents only), all of which are being developed in accordance with participant feedback based on formative intervention development work. In addition, and to increase participant compliance/reduce attrition often observed in digital health interventions, human support (&quot;supportive accountability&quot;) will be provided. Specifically, each family will be assigned a &quot;coach&quot; who will use video conferencing software to engage in a 15-30 minute conversation with parents regarding their family's progress periodically throughout the intervention period.</description>
