  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between ANI and pain scores
      and the correlation of ANI and anxiety scores in communicative patients in palliative care.

      The chosen event with a risk of pain and/or anxiety is the first bed bath after admission.
      The secondary objectives aim to identify ANI score thresholds which would be predictive of
      pain and/or anxiety and to figure out some individual factors influencing ANI scores.

    <textblock>
      Pain and anxiety assessments are still challenges for palliative care teams. Anxiolytics and
      painkillers are the usual tools but sometimes the symptoms and so the drugs to deliver are
      difficult to distinguish. For patients with maintained communication abilities, pain
      self-assessment using Visual Analogic Scores are the gold standard. Could pain assessment be
      optimised thanks to ANI? ANI is used in anaesthesiology and intensive care. The ANI system is
      based on the analysis of intra-cardiac variability. Based as an electrocardiograph with two
      electrodes on the patient's chest, it measures the balance between
      sympathetic/parasympathetic tones leading to a pain score. This score is predictive of pain
      occurrence, leading to an early analgesic treatment and a better control of pain with less
      quantity of drugs. However, some studies reported that anxiety and emotions could influence
      ANI pain score.

      To test this hypothesis in palliative care field, this study compares pain and anxiety VAS to
      ANI scores before, during and after the bed bath.

    <description>ANI scores, pain VAS and anxiety VAS scores are the basic measures which will allow the needed calculations.
Significant results will be :
the correlation rate of ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) scores and pain Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) scores
the correlation rate of ANI scores and anxiety scores After a descriptive study of collected variables, the correlation rates between ANI scores and VAS scores will be calculated. Linear regression or mixt gamma will be used to assess the intra-individual variability (random effect). The effect of individual variables on the ANI scores will be tested (age, sex, diseases, medications) Considering 3 as the significant VAS threshold, ROC curves and Younden indice will be used to identify ANI scores leading to prediction of pain and/or anxiety.</description>
