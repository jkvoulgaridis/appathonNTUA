  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is a complex biopsychosocial disorder often precipitated or aggravated by neck
      movements or sustained neck postures. More than 80 % of individuals experience neck pain and
      neck associated disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 4-week
      active exercising program in patients with chronic neck pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While neck pain can be severely disabling and costly, treatment options have shown moderate
      evidence of effectiveness. The optimal physiotherapy intervention is currently unclear.
      Consequently, more research in this area combining different techniques in patients with a
      specific clinical profile is needed. It has been previously shown that participants prefer
      self-care measures for the management of neck pain. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the effects of a 4-week active exercising program in patients with chronic neck pain.
