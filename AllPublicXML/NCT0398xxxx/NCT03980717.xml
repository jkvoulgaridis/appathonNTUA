  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs when the diaphragm fails to fully fuse and
      leaves a portal through which abdominal structures can migrate into the thorax. In the more
      severe cases, the abdominal structures remain in the thoracic cavity and compromise the
      development of the lungs. Infants born with this defect have a decreased capacity for gas
      exchange; mortality rates after birth have been reported between 40-60%. Now that CDH can be
      accurately diagnosed by mid-gestation, a number of strategies have been developed to repair
      the hernia and promote lung tissue development.

      Fetal tracheal occlusion (FETO), using a fetoscopically delivered and removed balloon device,
      has been used to temporarily occlude the trachea and increase lung distension in CDH to allow
      the lungs to develop and has been shown to increase survival at birth. The role of FETO in
      the resolution of pulmonary hypertension in fetuses with severe left- and right- sided CDH
      remains unclear. Our recent observation that FETO is associated with a higher proportion of
      infants who resolve their pulmonary hypertension by the age of 1 year as compared with those
      who have not had FETO, is based on a retrospective cohort study, which, as with any such
      design, has some intrinsic limitations. Thus, a prospective cohort study that is
      appropriately powered to confirm or disprove this encouraging observation is needed. If our
      preliminary observation is confirmed, resolution of PH by the age of 1 year could be added to
      the benefits of the FETO procedure in severe left and right-sided CDH cases.

      The investigators will perform 40 FETO procedures on fetuses diagnosed prenatally with severe
      right- or left-sided CDH, and outcome data will be compared with that of a control group of
      severe right- or left-sided CDH who will not undergo the FETO procedure because of medical or
      social issues. Because the prevalence of left-sided CDH is higher than right-side CDH, the
      investigators will perform 25 FETO procedures in left sided CDH and 15 in right-sided CDH,
      and these outcomes will be compared to a cohort of 40 non FETO cases.

      Enrollment

      Women carrying a fetus with severe CDH and a normal karyotype will undergo routine clinical
      evaluation. The fetus will be 28+0/7 to 31+6/7 weeks of gestational age and have severe CDH.
      These patients will have ultrasound and/or MRI evaluation to rule out other anomalies,
      calculation of the LHR from ultrasound measurements, calculation of observed/expected total
      lung volume and percentage of liver herniation from fetal MRI studies, echocardiography, and
      detailed obstetric/perinatal consultation. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be
      extensively counseled, and those who wish to participate will provide written, informed
      consent for the study.

      Procedure

      The procedure will be performed under spinal anesthesia or local anesthesia with intravenous
      sedation. The technique of fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion has been described. Using
      standard technique, a cannula will be inserted into the amniotic cavity and a fetoscope or
      flexible operating endoscope will be passed through the cannula into the amniotic fluid. If,
      upon evaluation, the fetal trachea cannot be entered as described above, the uterus will be
      accessed through an incision in the belly (called a laparotomy). A laparotomy is a surgical
      technique tin which an incision is made in the abdomen. After the incision has been made, the
      uterus will be temporarily repositioned externally. The baby will then be accessed using the
      fetoscope and ultrasound, as described above. The laparotomy will only be performed if the
      baby cannot be reached and repositioned to a more favorable one by doing external maneuvers
      (called external version) for the FETO procedure.

      The scope will be guided into the fetal larynx, and then through the fetal vocal cords with
      the aid of both direct vision through the scope and cross-sectional ultrasonographic
      visualization. A detachable latex balloon will be placed in the fetal trachea midway between
      the carina and the vocal cords. The balloon will be inflated with isosmotic contrast material
      so that it fills the fetal trachea.

      Postoperative

      The mothers will be discharged once stable. Serial measurements of sonographic lung volume
      and LHR will begin within 24-48 hours following surgery and continue weekly by targeted
      ultrasound evaluation. Amniotic fluid level and membrane status will also be monitored at
      weekly intervals. Comprehensive ultrasonography for fetal growth will be performed every four
      weeks (+/- 1 wk). All discharged patients will stay within 30 minutes of TCH to permit
      standardized postoperative management and emergent retrieval of the balloon in the event of
      preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes prior to the scheduled removal.

      After the FETO surgery, prior to leaving the hospital, the mother will be given a medical
      alert bracelet identifying her as a patient with a baby with blocked airways. She will be
      encouraged to wear the bracelet at all times so that in case of emergency, she and others
      will know who to contact. She will also be given a pamphlet with instructions for medical
      personnel describing how to remove the balloon in case of an emergency. She should carry it
      with her at all times.

      Balloon retrieval will be planned for no later than 36+6/7 weeks, at the discretion of the
      FETO center. The patient will need to commit to remaining in 30 minutes of Texas Children's
      Hospital Pavilion for Women until the balloon is retrieved. In the event of a patient
      relocating after having the balloon placed, despite having committed to remain in the area
      during consent process, she will be asked to return for the removal. Every effort to make
      arrangements for her to be managed by the nearest center capable of an EXIT procedure or
      balloon retrieval will be made.

      After removal of the balloon, patients will have the choice of delivering at Texas Children's
      Hospital - Women's Pavilion with the CDH managed and repaired at TCH, or returning to their
      obstetrician for delivery with subsequent repair of the CDH by the pediatric surgeons at
      their referring facility. Given the severity of the CDH, the baby will need to be delivered
      in a facility that has the capability of immediate pediatric surgery services.

      The investigators will need to monitor the baby at regular intervals (at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, 1 year, and 2 years) after delivery to see how well the baby is breathing and how
      well the baby is developing. These check - ups may be at Texas Children's Hospital - Pavilion
      for Women or can be coordinated with doctors from the hospital of the participant's choosing.

      If the child continues care at another institution, the investigators will attempt to follow
      up with a review of the child's medical records.
