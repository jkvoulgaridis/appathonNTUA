    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab in participants with
      active polymyositis (PM)/dermatomyositis (DM) despite receiving 1 or more standard-of-care
      treatments (for example, glucocorticoids and/or immunomodulators).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who achieve Minimal Improvement in International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Total Improvement Score (IMACS TIS) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Minimal improvement is defined as IMACS TIS greater than or equal to (&gt;=)20 in participants with polymyositis (PM)/ dermatomyositis (DM). The criteria use the 6 IMACS core set measures: Global Activity-VAS, Patient Global Activity-VAS, MMT-8, Muscle Enzymes, Extramuscular Assessment (MDAAT), and Functional Assessment (HAQ-DI). The absolute percentage change in each measure with varying weights is combined to obtain a Total Improvement Score (TIS) on a scale of 0 to 100. Higher score indicates greater improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Functional Index-2 (FI-2) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in functional Index-2 at Week 24 will be reported. The FI-2 is a functional outcome developed for participants with adult PM or DM to assess muscle endurance in 7 muscle groups. Each muscle group is scored as the number of correctly performed repetitions with 60 or 120 maximal number of repetitions depending on muscle group. The FI-2 is performed unilaterally, preferably on the participant's dominant side for muscle groups of shoulder, hip, and step test. The FI-2 has been validated as to content and construct validity and intra- and interrater reliability. The score ranges from 0-60 or 0-120 depending on the muscle group. Higher score indicates better muscle endurance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Experience Disease Worsening Through Week 24 Based on Consensus Criteria for Worsening</measure>
    <time_frame>Through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who experience disease worsening through Week 24 based on consensus criteria for worsening will be reported. Criteria for disease worsening in a clinical trial were based on international consensus guideline developed by the IMACS. The worsening of disease is defined as 1 of the following criteria: Worsening of the Physician Global Activity by greater than or equal to (&gt;=2) centimeter (cm) on a 10-cm VAS and worsening of findings of MMT-8 by &gt;= 20 percent (%) from baseline; worsening of MDAAT-global extramuscular organ disease activity (a composite of constitutional, cutaneous, skeletal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and cardiac activity) by &gt;=2 cm on a 10-cm VAS from baseline; worsening of any 3 of 6 IMACS core set activity measures by &gt;= 30% from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Manual Muscle Testing (MMT)-8 Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in MMT-8 score at Week 24 will be reported. Manual Muscle Testing is a partially validated tool to assess muscle strength. MMT-8 score ranges from 0-80, where maximal score is sum of scores from 8 muscle groups and each muscle group is scored on a 0 to 10-point scale. Higher score indicates greater muscle strength, that is, less impairment of muscle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Physician Global Activity-Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in physician global activity-VAS Score at Week 24 will be reported. Physician Global Activity is a partially validated tool to measure the global evaluation by the physician of the participant's overall disease activity at the time of assessment using a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm= no evidence of disease activity and 10 cm= extremely active or severe disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Extramuscular Assessment (Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool [MDAAT]-Extramuscular Global Assessment) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in extramuscular assessment (myositis disease activity assessment tool [MDAAT]-Extramuscular Global Assessment) Score at Week 24 will be reported. MDAAT is scored on a 10 cm scale ranging from 0-10 cm where, 0 cm = absent and 10 cm = maximum disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Muscle Enzymes at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in muscle enzyme like creatine kinase [CK], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and aldolase) at Week 24 measured as units/liter will be reported.</description>
