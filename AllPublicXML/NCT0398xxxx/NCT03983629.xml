    <textblock>
      Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia is a heterogeneous inherited disease. Hyperplasic
      erythropoiesis is ineffective and associated with morphological abnormalities of some of the
      erythroblasts that form the basis of cytological classification. The cumulative incidence is
      not very clear, but varies between countries from 0.08 million in Scandinavia to 2.6
      cases/million inhabitants in Italy where it appears to be the most reported.

      The common manifestation is moderate chronic congenital anemia. This anaemia is either
      normocytic or discreetly macrocytic, non-regenerative or inappropriate regarding anaemia,
      contrasting with signs of hemolysis with moderate unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Diagnosis
      is usually made in the pediatric period, but because of the great heterogeneity, the
      diagnosis sometimes may be delayed. Splenomegaly and jaundice are mostly present. Secondary
      hemochromatosis is common in the absence of transfusion due to hyper-intestinal absorption of
      iron induced by the dyserythropoiesis.

      The transmission mode for Type I and II is autosomal recessive, while it is autosomal
      dominant or sporadic for Type III.

      Several clinical questions remain concerning this disease :

        -  the median survival of patients is not well known, neither the causes of death

        -  benefit/risk of splenectomy

        -  iron overload quantification and consequences

      The idea is to stablish a French registry of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia in order to
      help to understand the correlation between phenotype and genotype of this disease.
