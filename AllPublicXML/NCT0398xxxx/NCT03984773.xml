  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effect of a
      health system initiative using machine learning algorithms and behavioral nudges to prompt
      oncologists to have serious illness conversations with patients at high-risk of short-term
      mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer often undergo costly therapy and acute care utilization that is
      discordant with their wishes, particularly at the end of life. Early serious illness
      conversations (SIC) improve goal-concordant care, and accurate prognostication is critical to
      inform the timing and content of these discussions. This study will use a stepped-wedge,
      cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effect of a health system initiative using machine
      learning algorithms and behavioral nudges to prompt oncologists to have serious illness
      conversations with patients at high-risk of short-term mortality. Oncology practices will be
      randomly assigned in sequential four-week blocks to receive the intervention.

    <description>Oncology practices will be randomly assigned to receive an intervention, in which individual clinicians will receive a weekly audit email detailing how many serious illness conversations (SIC) they have had compared to the recommended level, and a link to a list of their patients scheduled in clinic next week at high risk of short-term mortality as identified by a mortality prediction algorithm. Clinicians will have the chance to review the opt-out list and pre-commit to a serious illness conversation with appropriate patients. Clinicians will receive nudge on the day of the patient visit via text message reminding them of their pre-commitment to conduct a serious illness conversation.</description>
