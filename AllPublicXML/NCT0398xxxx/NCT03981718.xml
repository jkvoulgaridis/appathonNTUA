    <time_frame>12 months, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in BREAST-Q patient-reported questionnaire to assess quality of life and patient satisfaction by using questions pertaining to the function and participation in activities after fat grafting. Subjects are asked to answer 16 questions on how often they experienced each symptom, using a score of 1 to 5, where 1 was none of the time and 5 was very often. Answers from these questions were combined to provide a total physical well-being score (for a total possible range of 16-80). Lower scores reflected fewer symptoms and higher satisfaction where higher scores reflected more symptoms and less satisfaction.</description>
