  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive biases have been found to be possible causal and vulnerability factors for
      depression. There is empirical evidence on the presence of negative emotional biases in
      interpretation in people with depressive symptoms. A whole new area of research, called
      Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM), is focused on targeting negative cognitive emotional
      biases to investigate its impact on clinical symptoms. A recent meta-analysis has shown that
      this type of programs are effective in reducing cognitive biases but there is still
      controversy on their clinical value to reduce symptoms. The purpose of the study is to create
      a brief online intervention aimed to reduce negative emotional cognitive biases present in
      depression and to analyze its impact on clinical symptoms and well-being.

      More specifically, the intervention is framed within the area of CBM but it is rooted on
      techniques and change procedures used in cognitive-behavioral therapies. While original CBM
      studies train participants to change cognitive biases in an automatic manner, by forcing
      individuals to find positive outcomes to ambiguous scenarios, this new intervention focuses
      on teaching participants the meaning of emotional cognitive biases and how to modify them by
      using an effortful type of processing (i.e., looking for adaptive alternative interpretations
      to ambiguous stories).

      The study has been design to overcome some of the limitations that have been pointed out in
      this emerging research area. Firstly, although there are recent efforts to understand how
      interpretation, attention and memory cognitive biases may be related, it is still not clear
      how they interact with each other. For this purpose, some authors have pointed out the need
      to use longitudinal data to see how one process may affect each other over time. Secondly,
      different systematic reviews and meta-analyses have investigated the moderating role of
      variables that may be affecting the heterogeneity of results found in CBM interventions.
      Mental imagery has been found to be a useful tool to help participants in their changing
      process, while there is no preferred number of sessions for these interventions. This study
      will help shed some light into this factors by using mental imagery during four sessions
      online.

    <time_frame>Change from the first assesment (the day before starting the intervention) to the second assessment (the day after completing the intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>The task presents 20 scrambled sentences with 6 words each. Participants are asked to construct a sentence using 5 of the 6 words.

Participants are told that one of the jars is going to be selected and one bead is going to be taken out and returned to it in each trial. Participants have to decide which jar is being used based on the number of positive and negative adjectives that are taken in each trial. The number of beads viewed before reaching a decision is an index of jumping to conclusion bias.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will be exposed to a brief online program aimed at the modification of negative emotional cognitive biases. The program consists of an introduction and four 1-hour sessions, in video format. In each session, participants are required to complete some open questions and scales about the type of cognitive bias addressed in each session. All sessions are structured in four parts: 1) description and examples of some specific cognitive biases; 2) information about negative consequences of each bias; 3) explanation of adaptive strategies to modify cognitive biases (i.e., the four-questions approach used in standard Cognitive behavioral therapy); and 4) use of some practices to familiarize participants with the use of those strategies.</description>
