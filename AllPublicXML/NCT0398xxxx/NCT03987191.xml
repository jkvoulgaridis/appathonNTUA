  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled, two arms, investigator initiated, intervention study is aimed to
      examine an investigational approach in contrast to the clinical standard of 1:1 dose basal
      insulin conversion in an attempt to lower the incidence and/or duration of hyperglycemia
      after transition from insulin pump to multiple daily injections in adults with type 1
      diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Second generation long acting insulin, insulin degludec, has been shown to improve glycemic
      control and reduce hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes and insulin treated type 2
      diabetes. However, it takes about 48 hours before glycemic benefits are noticeable.
      Therefore, transition from insulin pump to multiple daily injection using insulin degludec is
      associated with hyperglycemia during first 48 hours of transition. Considering this, this
      study proposes to evaluate an investigational strategy to improve glycemic control during
      transition from insulin pump to multiple daily injections using insulin degludec and insulin
      aspart.

    <description>The primary outcome will be time spent in CGM glucose &gt;180 mg/dL (hyperglycemia) during 7days of randomization period between two groups. The differences in CGM metrics will be examined using student t-test and Linear regression analysis will be used to examine outcomes by treatment group while adjusting for potential residual confounders if any. The analysis will be conducted as an intention-to-treat analysis</description>
