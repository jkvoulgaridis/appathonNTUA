    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      eltrombopag in Chinese subjects with refractory or relapsed severe aplastic anemia (SAA).
      Treatment with eltrombopag will be started at 25 mg/day and increased by 25 mg/day every 2
      weeks according to the platelet count up to 150 mg/day. The hematological response rate will
      be assessed at 3, 6 months and 1 year after starting the study treatment (Week 13, 26 and
      52).
