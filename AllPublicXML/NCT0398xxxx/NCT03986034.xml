    <textblock>
      Background:

      The drug venetoclax treats chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Researchers want to find
      better treatments for CLL. To do that, they need to learn how the drug affects CLL cancer
      cells and the immune system.

      Objective:

      To learn about genetic changes that happen during treatment of CLL with venetoclax.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older with relapsed or refractory CLL after at least 1 prior therapy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol.

      In Phase 1, participants will get venetoclax free of charge through the NIH. Venetoclax is
      started at a low dose. The dose will be increased every week until participants reach their
      maximum tolerable dose. This usually take about 5 weeks. Participants will visit the NIH at
      least once per week. Visits will be about 4 hours. They may have to stay in the hospital to
      be observed.

      In Phase 2, participants will continue to get the drug through their local cancer doctor and
      their health insurance. Patients will also visit the NIH every 6 months, or if their disease
      progresses.

      At the NIH participants will have regular health assessments. These will include physical
      exams and a review of the medicines they are taking. They will talk about how they are
      feeling.

      The study included the following tests:

      Blood draws

      CT scans: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body (maximum 3 per
      year)

      Bone marrow biopsies: A small amount of marrow will be taken out of the participant s hip
      bone with a needle.

      Optional lymph node biopsies: A small piece of the participant s tissue will be taken out
      with a needle.

      The study will last at least 2 years.

      This study aims to study the clonal dynamics and kinetics of response during the ramp-up
      phase of venetoclax in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      Key Eligibility Criteria:

        1. Diagnosis of CLL/SLL (treatment naive or relapsed/refractory)

        2. Must have designated hematologist/oncologist who has agreed to assume care and continue
           venetoclax after the ramp-up phase is complete

        3. Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        4. ECOG 0-2

      Design:

      Patients with CLL/SLL will enroll on the study. Subjects will be treated at the NIH Clinical
      Center for the duration of the ramp-up phase of venetoclax. After the ramp-up phase is
      complete, subjects will be transitioned to the care of their local hematologist/oncologist
      and receive venetoclax monotherapy or in combination with other agent(s) at the discretion of
      the treating oncologist. Subjects will have the option to follow-up at the NIH every 6 months
      (from initiation of venetoclax) and at (suspected) progression.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      -Determine the proportion of subjects with clonal shift during the ramp-up phase of
      venetoclax

      Secondary Objective:

      -Determine response kinetics of venetoclax therapy in the peripheral blood, lymph nodes and
      bone marrow

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  Assess relationship between clonal shifts and minimal residual disease (MRD) status,
           progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)

        -  Assess immunologic changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow during venetoclax
           treatment

        -  Assess circulating-tumor DNA in response to treatment during venetoclax treatment

                  transfusions, IVIG, growth factor support, etc.) to avoid severe cytopenias prior
                  to and during therapy with venetoclax.
