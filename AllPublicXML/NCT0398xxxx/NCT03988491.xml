      Background: Renal replacement therapy remains a challenge in the developing world in terms of
      inadequate facilities, equipment and personnel, inadequate of renal registries and limited
      published literature.

      Objectives: This study will identify predictors of mortality, identify common causes of
      infection and hospitalization, their incidences, prevalence and time-to-event analysis and
      analyze short and long-term survival of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on
      hemodialysis in two hemodialysis centers in Dodoma, Tanzania. Furthermore, this study will
      establish a registry to be called, Tanzania Registry for Chronic Renal Failure (TRCRF).

      Methodology: This will be a prospective-observational study (Patient registry). It will be
      conducted in a Tanzania, a developing world country, involving two hemodialysis centers
      namely Benjamin Mkapa Hospital and UDOM Health center, both affiliated with University of
      Dodoma. Data will be collected by accessing patients' records receiving hemodialysis due to
      ESRD in the two centers from September 2019 to September 2024. Patients' demographics,
      medical history, investigation findings, and hemodialysis adequacy will be extracted as
      independent outcomes while outcome (i.e. Death) during the follow-up will be extracted as a
      primary dependent outcome. Binary logistic regression will be applied to come up with
      statistically significant predictors of deaths. Other outcomes will be incidences, prevalence
      and time-to-event analysis of common causes of infection and re-hospitalization. Kaplan-Meier
      survival curves will be constructed from statistically significant predictors of deaths and
      patients' survival at 1, 3 and 5 years will be illustrated.

      Background

      End-stage renal disease:

      End-stage renal disease is the eighteenth cause of deaths worldwide. Despite fairly stable
      incidences, the prevalence of End-stage renal disease on renal replacement therapy has
      doubled from 1990 to 2010 and the toll is expected to rise further in the coming decade
      raising global health concerns. These findings are in line with reported increase in global
      burden of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, the two diseases accounting for majority of
      etiologies for End-stage renal disease. The number of diabetes patients worldwide is
      projected to be 300 million by the year 2025 from 135 million reported in 1995. By 170%, this
      increase is projected to be more in the developing world as compared to 42% expected increase
      in the developed world. Approximately a billion people every year are diagnosed with
      hypertension and approximately 7.1 million dies from its complications including
      cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and End-stage renal disease.

      Renal replacement therapy:

      Regardless of etiology, patients with ESRD would need renal replacement therapy (RRT) such as
      hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplant. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis
      account for initial modalities of renal replacement therapies before renal transplantation is
      opted. It is predicted that a decade from now the number of patients on Renal Replacement
      Therapy (RRT) to be 5439 million worldwide. Of three modalities, renal transplantation is
      reported to be superior in terms of patients' survival and quality of life. Despite kidney
      transplant's superiority, hemodialysis is a widely utilized of three renal replacement
      therapy modalities. It is estimated that of all patients who received RRT in 2008,
      eighty-nine percent (89%) received hemodialysis. Despite the decrease reported, a decrease in
      the population of ESRD on peritoneal dialysis in developed countries, the number had doubled
      in a ten year period by the year 2008 in developing countries.

      Patients' survival on renal replacement therapy:

      Despite revolutionizing End-stage renal disease treatment, complications associated with
      renal replacement therapy and patients' quality of lives worth consideration. Cardiovascular
      diseases and infections account for major causes of deaths directly associated with dialyzes,
      while immunosuppression and comorbidities accounting for major causes of deaths in ESRD
      patients undergone renal transplant. Other factors predicting mortality are reported to range
      from demographic factors, comorbidities, ESRD etiology, and nutritional status to biochemical
      indices. Caucasians and patients below 45 years have better survival outcomes. Ongoing
      evidence of inflammation, increased cardiac enzymes, extreme potassium levels, low hemoglobin
      levels, inadequate dialysis, and lower BMI are associated with poor survival outcomes.

      RRT challenges in developing countries:

      Access to renal replacement therapies is by far different in developing from developed world.
      About 80% of ESRD patients receiving renal replacement therapy worldwide are in developed
      countries only, meaning it covers only about 12% of the world's population. Though not
      impossible, provision of renal replacement therapy in developing countries is challenging.
      The challenges can range from patient's factors like high costs and poor health-seeking
      behavior, low budget allocated in non-communicable diseases to technological complexity out
      of reach of developing countries. To better clarify the challenges, these challenges are
      categorized into three levels of factors i.e. patient's factors; Healthcare and policy and
      policy factors; and renal registries.

      Patient' factors: Adding to limited coverage of health insurance services, financially
      constrained patients who constitute a large population of people in developing countries,
      find it overwhelming to afford high costs of RRT. Furthermore, poor health-seeking behaviors,
      patients' remoteness, traditional and religious beliefs hinder RRT provision. Literatures
      report, about 30% of adults are unaware of having hypertension, more than 40% of people with
      hypertension have not initiated treatment, while 70% of hypertensive patients have not had
      their hypertension controlled. Also, in some countries, renal transplantation is less often
      because kidney donation is considered against religious or traditional beliefs.

      Healthcare system factors: In most developing countries, renal replacement therapies are
      centralized in that, they are provided at tertiary referral hospitals which are few for the
      population they serve, unlike in developed world where satellite hospitals reduce patients
      load in tertiary hospitals. In Tanzania for instance, unevenly distributed three public and
      nine private dialysis offering hospitals serving over fifty-five million residents. In
      central Tanzania, the first renal replacement facility, UDOM hemodialysis unit was
      established in 2013, the first renal transplant was done in 2018, collaborating with BMH, and
      only one kidney transplants have been done ever since. Furthermore, developing countries are
      still struggling vaccinating, controlling spread and managing past and newly emerging
      communicable diseases. Increasing incidences and prevalence of non-communicable diseases like
      ESRD further cripple and deem healthcare budget inadequate.

      Renal registries: Only a few African countries have established and organized renal
      registries. Majority of countries have not had or have failed to maintain them due to a
      number of reasons including financial constraints. This hinders auditing of treatment and
      quality of care delivery, as well as limiting sources of information and data for researches.
      This has led developing countries into depending on information and data obtained from
      developed countries to make major health decisions. International comparisons of data on ESRD
      patients and renal replacement therapy may not be correct in terms of validity due to
      differences in acceptance of the treatment, patients' demographics, socioeconomic burdens,
      and national health care policies.

      Research Problem:

      Incidences and prevalence of ESRD have increased in developing countries including,
      Sub-Saharan African countries. Of different RRT modalities utilized, hemodialysis accounts
      for majority. Unlike in developed countries, inadequate renal health facilities, equipment
      and personnel, insufficient health budget allocation, lack of renal registries and few
      published literature regarding hemodialysis in developing countries hinder provision of
      hemodialysis to ESRD patients. Furthermore, patient's factors like hemodialysis-treatment
      costs, poor health-seeking behavior, traditional beliefs and residency remoteness, further
      cripple renal replacement therapy provision. Taking Tanzania into account, no renal registry
      is currently available in the country, leave alone not having any published literature in the
      region to report short and long-term survival analysis for ESRD patients on maintenance
      hemodialysis.

      Data collection and procedure:

      Patients' information regarding demographics, medical history, physical examination, causes
      of ESRD, laboratory findings, imaging results, dialysis adequacy and follow-up will be sought
      from electronic and physical patients' files. Other information not captured by patients'
      hospital-record files, will be collected separately by the researcher using a
      separately-designed form. All data will be recorded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and
      stored in a registry-office computer as well as a backup in OneDrive cloud storage.

      Data Variables:

      This study will have dependent and independent variables. The main dependent variable will be
      death status, classified as nominal (i.e. dead or alive). Other dependent variables were
      infection (i.e. nominal), hospitalization (i.e. nominal) and time-to-event (i.e. continuous).

      Independent variables consisted of both nominal and continuous. These were Age, Sex,
      ethnicity, smoking status, marital status, education level, health insurance type, residence,
      comorbidities, employment status, amount of income, duration of illness prior to referral,
      initial pulse rate, initial blood pressure, BMI, waist-hip circumference ratio and definitive
      diagnosis. Other were, initial values of Hemoglobin level, total white blood count, platelets
      level, thyroid stimulating hormone, serum thyroxine, serum triiodothyronine, serum
      electrolytes (i.e. potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, inorganic phosphates,
      CO2-combining power and anion gap), random blood glucose, Liver function tests (Alanine
      aminotransferases, Aspartate aminotransferases, Total serum protein, serum albumin, Total
      bilirubin and direct bilirubin and Alkaline phosphatase), muscle enzymes (myoglobin, lactate
      dehydrogenase and creatine-kinase), urinalysis (albuminuria, proteinuria, urine-pH,
      glucosuria, urine sedimentation and 24-hours urine protein). Moreover, initial results for
      inflammation indices (procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and
      hypersensitive C-reactive protein), coagulation indices (prothrombin activity, prothrombin
      time, international normalized ratio, activated partial prothrombin time, thrombin time and
      d-dimer), lipid profile (low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein,
      lipoprotein-alpha, triglycerides and total cholesterol). Finally, chronic kidney disease
      stage, type of dialysis catheter and dialysis adequacy will further be recorded.

      Bias Management:

      Bias in this study will be addressed in two levels; study level and outcome level.

      Potential source of bias foreseen is regarding to patients record system. UDOM hemodialysis
      unit utilizes both electronic (newly established) and physical-paper files, meaning every
      patient will have two records. To eliminate typing errors during feeding data in to the
      electronic system, a registry-officer will extract data from physical-paper files followed by
      crosschecking with electronic database by a second registry-officer, for completeness.

      To improve data collection accuracy and efficiency, the two dedicated registry-officers will
      receive one-month training prior to official opening of participants enrollment.

      To minimize reporting biases, STROBE checklist-tool (Strengthening the Reporting of
      Observational studies in Epidemiology) customized for cohort and case-control studies, will
      be used in the report write-up of this study.

      To minimize publication biases, this protocol is anticipated to be registered to
      https://clinicaltrials.gov/ , prior to enrollment of participants.

      Data analysis:

      Statistical analysis will be done according to the objectives in question. Firstly,
      predictors of deaths will be identified by binary logistic regression, using death status as
      dependent variable and demographics, medical history, clinical picture and dialysis adequacy
      as independent variables. Comparisons will be made by odds ratio between predictors and
      results tested for statistical significance, at 95% using independent t-test. Computer
      software SPSS will be used. Independent variables showing significant statistical
      significance to be predicting deaths, will be utilized to construct survival curves by
      Kaplan-Meier. Survival at 1, 3 and 5 years will be deducted from Kaplan-Meier curves and
      reported. Computer software SAS will be used here.

      A descriptive analysis will be conducted to depict common causes of infection and
      re-hospitalization, their incidences and prevalence. Time-to-event analysis for first
      infection and rehospitalization will be constructed using Kaplan-Maier survival curves.
      Time-to-event comparison between common causes of infections and rehospitalization will be
      compared using log-rank test. All statistical analyses will be done by a computer software
      SPSS, using 95% level of significance.
