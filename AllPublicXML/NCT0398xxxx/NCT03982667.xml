  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that PCT guidance can reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment
      for patients with bacterial infections in the ICU, without compromising the safety outcomes.
      However PCT is known to be more costly than standard biomarkers that commonly use in our ICU
      setup. This remain the main challenge for us whether by monitoring the PCT level, it can
      reduce both the duration of antibiotic simultaneously reduce the total cost of the treatment
      for the patients. A local study addressing efficacy, safety and cost analysis of PCT-guided
      antibiotic therapy in severe pneumonia patients is therefore warranted. Until the results
      from a local study become available, the utility of PCT to guide antibiotic duration in our
      patient population cannot be recommended.

    <textblock>
      Pneumonia remains one of the major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill
      patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) worldwide. In Malaysia, according to the Malaysian
      Registry of Intensive Care 2016, pneumonia was among the four (5.7%) most common diagnosis
      leading to admission to ICU. In many scenario, pneumonia associated with severe sepsis either
      as single source of sepsis or in combination with other source of infection which carry
      mortality mortality reported 53.4% 1. Timely, appropriate and adequate antibiotic therapy is
      of paramount importance in the critically ill patients with severe pneumonia. However, overly
      long antibiotic treatment is undesirable because of side effects, increasing antibiotic
      resistance2 and financial burden to patient and Malaysia Healthcare.

      Antibiotic remain the main weapon to combat pneumonia. Nevertheless, rampant use of
      antibiotic without specific indicator is vain. Hence, with the latest technology, physicians
      not only rely on clinical improvement but also specific biomarkers for resolution of sepsis
      which might assist the ICU physicians in making decisions on antibiotic therapy on an
      individual basis.

      Commonest used biomarkers for this purpose include leucocyte count and C-reactive protein
      (CRP). These biomarkers are sensitive but not specific. Procalcitonin (PCT) however has been
      advocated as a biomarker with a better specificity and sensitivity for diagnosis and
      follow-up of severe bacterial infections.

      PCT is the prohormone of calcitonin. It consists of about 116 amino-acids. The locus of
      formation in classical pathway is the C-cells of the thyroid. In case of bacterial infection,
      PCT is formed in all tissues via an alternative pathway. Linscheid et al. 2004 described, in
      case of bacterial infection two mechanisms of synthesis are at work. At first
      cytokine-stimulated adherent monocytes release PCT in low quantities. This synthesis is
      limited. But it plays an important role in the initiation of PCT synthesis in storage tissues
      of humans. This PCT burst is initiated in all storage tissues (&gt;18h). PCT is a perfect tool
      to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections (e.g. Gendrel et al. 1999). This is
      why in septic patients extremely high concentrations of PCT were found in the plasma (about
      100,000-fold of the physiological concentration in healthy subjects).

    <time_frame>3 to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Most of the antiobiotic duration is about 5 - 14 days. In Ventilated Associated Pneumonia, the duration of antibiotic treatment is difficult to stop since the patient stil in intensive care unit due to multiple factors. Therefore the use of PCT guided might be useful.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Malaysia Sepsis Mortality rate is nearly 50%. This could be because of higher APACHE score. In PCT guided group, the antibiotic might be stop earlier if clinically indicated. Therefore, the rate of patient die in this group is very important to assess the safety of using this point of care PCT in ICU.</description>

    <description>By stopping antibiotics earlier, the is possibility risk of recurrent infection if the source of infection is not adequately treated. Therefore the number of recurrence infection is required in PCT group to assess the safety of using PCT guided antibiotic in ICU</description>

    <description>For patients randomly assigned to the PCT-guided group, measurements of serum PCT concentrations (Day 1, 3, 7, and 9) will be taken and made available to the attending physicians. This means 3 ml of whole blood will be sampled from the arterial line of the patients for each measurement the serum PCT in plain tubes. The samples will be immediately assayed for the PCT measurement using the available device and the results will be ready in next 30 minutes after running the system.</description>

    <description>In the PCT-guided group, the study protocol encourages to stop the prescribed antibiotics if PCT concentration decrease by 80% or more of its peak value (or if PCT concentration is ≥0·25 and &lt;0·5 μg/L), and strongly encourage to stop the prescribed antibiotics when it reaches a value of &lt; 0·25 μg/L. The attending physician is free to decide whether to continue antibiotic treatment in patients who reach these thresholds. Reasons for non-adherence will be recorded. Antibiotics in the standard-of-care group will be stopped according to local or national guidelines and according to the discretion of attending physicians. Patients will be followed-up until hospital discharge.</description>
