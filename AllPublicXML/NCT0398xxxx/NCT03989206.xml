        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who may benefit from study participation in the opinion of the investigator
             and had participated in a prior nemolizumab study for AD

          2. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree either to be strictly abstinent
             throughout the study and for 12 weeks after the last study drug injection, or to use
             an effective and approved method of contraception throughout the study and for 12
             weeks after the last study drug injection.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who, during their participation in a prior nemolizumab study, experienced an
             AE which in the opinion of the investigator could indicate that continued treatment
             with nemolizumab may present an unreasonable risk for the subject.

          2. Pregnant women, breastfeeding women, or women planning a pregnancy during the clinical
             study.

          3. Body weight &lt; 30 kg

          4. Cutaneous infection within 1 week or any infection requiring treatment with oral or
             parenteral antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitics, or antifungals within 1 week

          5. History of hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) to an immunoglobulin product
             (plasma-derived or recombinant, eg, monoclonal antibody)

          6. Any clinically significant issue, based investigator judgement
