  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial. Subject population is adult patients with
      Hunner-type interstitial cystitis. The objective of this study is to compare the therapeutic
      effect between the two surgical modality; TUF (transurethral fulguration of the Hunner
      lesion) versus TUF+HD(addition of bladder hydrodistension prior to transurethral fulguration
      of the Hunner lesion).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subject patients are randomly allocated to 1:1 ratio using Permuted block randomization. For
      TUF group, only fulguration on the Hunner lesion is performed. For TUF+HD group
      hydrodistension is performed for 8 minutes at pressure of 80cmH2O, and then fulguration on
      the Hunner lesion is performed. Therapeutic effect is evaluated using Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS) pain score, O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis questionnaire (IC-Q), Pelvic pain
      urgency/frequency patient symptom scale (PUF), frequency volume chart parameters, EQ-5D
      Health Questionnaire, Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-sf), Patient Global Assessment
      (PGA) at the point of 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after operation. During the observational period,
      subject patients are not provided with any additional medical, physical or surgical treatment
      for symptom relief. Subject patient who complains of symptom requiring medical, physical or
      surgical intervention during the study period, is dropped from the study. Comparison of
      therapeutic efficacy between the two groups is performed using independent two sample t-test.

    <description>Primary end-point is inter-group difference of VAS pain score at postoperative one month. Analysis is performed based on independent two sample t-test. ; About the VAS pain score -'VAS' is abbreviation of 'Visual Analogue Scale'. For evaluation of pain, we use 'Visual Analogue Scale' which has a range from 0 to 10 points.
The score increases depending on the severity of the pain symptoms.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is a tool for brief evaluation of subject's health status. The EQ-5D questionnaire has five dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each item has three-level; having no problems, having some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number. The 5-digit number is finally converted to a single summary index by a specific formula.</description>
