  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the major risk factor for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). One of the
      main limitations in the clinical approach to VCI is that, by the time that it is manifested,
      it might be too late to reverse the neurodegenerative process. Thus, early identification of
      predictive signs of later dementia is demanding for management of hypertensive patients
      (HT).This aim claims for new methods that compute in a cloud all possible data sources coming
      from patients (brain imaging, cognitive profile, clinical data), to extract discriminative
      aggregate biomarkers. Thus, this study aims at: 1) characterizing the predictive potential of
      an aggregate biomarker for dementia in HT, based on brain imaging, clinical and cognitive
      assessment; 2) evaluating the impact of blood pressure variability, besides
      systolic/diastolic blood pressure, on the progression of the aggregate biomarker; 3)
      assessing whether specific classes of antihypertensive drugs differently affect the
      progression of the aggregate biomarker. In order to do this, this study proposes to evaluate
      advanced brain imaging and cognitive profile in a cohort of hypertensive patients, at
      baseline and after a 1 year follow up, to identify an innovative signature for the
      development of cognitive dysfunction in hypertension. In particular, the effects of blood
      pressure variability and of different classes of antihypertensive drugs will be evaluated.
