  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improved understanding of the long-time healthcare utilisation of childhood cancer survivors
      is relevant as it can be seen as a proxy for the population's morbidity.

      The investigators will conduct a historic population-based matched cohort study using Danish
      nationwide registry data. Eligible children are children 1.0-17.9 years diagnosed with Acute
      lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in Denmark from 1994 till 2016. The primary outcome is yearly
      contact rates to primary healthcare.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most frequent single form of cancer in children
      accounting for 40-45 new cases every year in Denmark. Over the past decades, advances in
      treatment have led to an increasing number of children who survive cancer and more than 80%
      of children with ALL now become long-term survivors. This means a growing population of
      childhood ALL survivors. In survivors, the cancer itself and treatment late-effects can lead
      to ongoing health care use.

      Register studies of long-term survivors of childhood cancer have shown an increased risk of
      hospitalisation compared to the general population. It is mentioned in many of the studies
      that contact rates could be underestimated when looking at hospital contacts only.

      The literature about non-hospital-based contacts with a doctor in childhood cancer survivors
      is scarce.
