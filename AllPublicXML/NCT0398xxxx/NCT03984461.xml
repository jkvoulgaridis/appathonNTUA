      lipoaspirate and/or bone marrow aspirate in osteoarthritis of major joints, and to compare

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the combined use of platelet-rich
      plasma (PRP) with lipoaspirate and/or bone marrow aspirate in osteoarthritis of major joints,
      and to compare the outcomes achieved using three combinations: PRP plus lipoaspirate, PRP
      plus bone marrow aspirate, and PRP plus both lipoaspirate and bone marrow aspirate.

      A total of 240 participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: Group
      A will receive PRP plus lipoaspirate, Group B will receive PRP plus bone marrow aspirate, and
      Group C will receive tri-partite therapy of PRP + lipoaspirate + bone marrow aspirate which
      allows for 80 in each group. The combination of biologic materials will be injected in to an
      arthritic joint.

    <measure>Changes from baseline through to end of study for the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>The VAS will be measured at baseline (week 1) through to the end of the study (week 104). To test for improvement, comparisons to baseline will be made at 6 months (week 26,) 12 months (week 52) and 24 months (week 104).</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scales (VAS) are psychometric measuring instruments designed to document the characteristics of disease-related symptom severity in individual patients and use this to achieve a rapid (statistically measurable and reproducible) classification of symptom severity. This scale measures ranges from 0 whereby the patient has no discomfort or distress to 10 where the patient has agonizing pain and is in unbearable distress. (0 - None, 1, 2 - Annoying, 3, 4 - Uncomfortable, 5, 6 - Dreadful, 7, 8 - Horrible, 9, 10 - Agonizing). The patient can place an x anywhere on the continuum between 0-10 based on their level of discomfort . We will then measure the scale using a ruler to the tenth of a point. The VAS scale will be completed at each visits 2-7. Comparisons will be made from baseline to end of study to determine the overall improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline through to the end of study for the Short Form 12 item version 2 (SF12-v2)</measure>
    <time_frame>The SF12-v2 will be measured at baseline (week 1) through to the end of the study (week 104). To test for improvement, comparisons to baseline will be made at 6 months (week 26,) 12 months (week 52) and 24 months (week 104).</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a validated and widely used twelve question health survey used to assess health related quality of life from the patients perspective. The SF12-v2 items are scored so that a higher score means a better health. For example, the functioning items are scored so that a higher score represents better functioning, whereby pain items scored so that a high score indicates freedom from pain. The SF12-v2 will be completed at each visits 2-7. Comparisons will be made from baseline to end of study to determine the overall improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison to evaluate the degree of change among treatment arms (Group A, Group B and Group C) from baseline visit through to end of study.</measure>
    <time_frame>The VAS will be measured at baseline (week 1) through to the end of the study (week 104). To test for improvement, comparisons to baseline will be made at 6 months (week 26,) 12 months (week 52) and 24 months (week 104).</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the variations among the three treatment arms (lipoapirate [group A], bone marrow aspirate [group B], and lipoasiprate and bone marrow aspirate [group c] we will use the overall average of the VAS for each group. It is the investigator's hypothesis that we anticipate that group c might have a superior outcome to either group A or group B.</description>
