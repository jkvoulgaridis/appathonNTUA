    <textblock>
      Maintaining the condylar position after bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSO) is
      one of the most important aspects in terms of condylar function ,.An altered condylar
      position can cause internal derangement of the joint, loss of the mandibular angle, increased
      risk of relapse, condyle sagging, and impaired masticatory function.

      In previous years, a great deal of attention has been paid to maintaining the preoperative
      condylar position during orthognathic surgery. Numerous condylar positioning methods have
      been reported and could be divided into manual/empirical methods, conventional methods ,
      navigation, and sonographic monitoring, Computer guided methods which is more accurate than
      other methods

      unpredictable condylar position after orthognathic surgery, will lead to malocclusion,
      derangement of the condylar surface, condylar resorption, condylar sag, distraction of the
      condyles from the fosse. In previous years, several authors had been adopted several
      techniques to maintain the preoperative condylar position during orthognathic surgery.
      Numerous condylar positioning methods have been reported which could be divided into
      conventional techniques (manual maneuvers or aiding tools), Extra and intra oral navigational
      techniques , surgeons had been utilized these techniques in condylar repositiong after BSSO
      but it was time and effort consuming and sometimes it was inaccurate. the aim for conducting
      the research is accurate positioning of condyle three dimensionally to minimize effort and
      operating time of surgery .
