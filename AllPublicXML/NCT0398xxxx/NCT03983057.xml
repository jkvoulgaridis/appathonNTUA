  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor. Current guidelines recommend FOLFIRINOX
      or modified-FOLFIRINOX as the first-line chemotherapeutic regimen. Studies have shown that
      immunotherapy with Anti-PD-1 antibody can effectively increase the response rate and prolong
      patient survival in a number of cancer diseases. Here investigators intend to compare the
      therapeutic effects of modified-FOLFIRINOX alone and the combination of modified-FOLFIRINOX
      and Anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators chose borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients.
      The planned treatment was given to the participants after randomization. Response rate,
      recurrence-free survival, overall survival, drugs related side effects and other endpoints
      events were recorded and analyzed, to assess the combination treatment with
      modified-FOLFIRINOX and Anti-PD-1 antibody could or couldn't benefit the patients with
      borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
