  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and credibility of a
      mindfulness-based dance/movement therapy(M-DMT)protocol; to assess and improve methodological
      procedures for conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) test of M-DMT; and to
      demonstrate proof of principle by gathering information about the process of change between
      M-DMT and a control condition.

      This is the first study to address the potential of M-DMT as a creative, non-opioid
      intervention for chronic back pain. Therefore, the findings of this study will provide
      important methodological and protocol data and substantive pilot data necessary for the next
      phase of this line of research, namely a fully powered RCT to evaluate efficacy and treatment
      mechanisms of action. Data obtained as part of this study will be instrumental for informing
      the systematic evaluation of M-DMT for chronic back pain care.
