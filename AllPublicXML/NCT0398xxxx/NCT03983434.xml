  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the relationship between the bile acids, short chain
      fatty acids and bacteria within the intestines. The hypothesis is that changes in the
      bacterial composition of the stool are associated with the differences in bile acids and
      short chain fatty acids in patients having irritable bowel syndrome compared to healthy
      individuals.

      The Study involves 3 visits and will in include 3 types of subjects - those who have
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and those
      who have no IBS symptoms or diagnosis.

      Visit 1

        -  Volunteers will read and sign this informed consent after all questions about the study
           have been answered

        -  This is a screening visit and we may determine that volunteers ineligible to continue to
           participate in the study.

        -  Volunteers will have a medical history taken including demographics, history of symptoms
           and illness

        -  Volunteers will be asked about all medications

        -  A physical exam will be performed by the physician.

        -  Vital signs will be measured.

        -  Urine Pregnancy test may be done for woman in the reproductive age range.

        -  Eligible participants will be provided with a take-home lasagna meal.

        -  Participants will be given instructions and supplies for collection, storage and
           transportation of stool for the next visit.

        -  Participants will be provided with instructions for a low fiber, high fat diet which
           should be consumed for 2 days before stool collection and during the 2 days of stool
           collection. Instructions will also come with materials to allow participants to record
           diet intake during these 4 days.

        -  Participants will be provided a bowel pattern diary to record bowel symptoms over the
           course of the study

      Day 1: this may be the same as Visit 1 or it may be a different day. It will depend upon the
      day that participants can make it back to the clinic for the Day 5 visit.

      Day 2-4 (at home):

        -  Participants record stool symptoms and patterns in a diary daily starting from Day 2 to
           Day 5.

        -  During this time, participants will be instructed to consume a low fiber diet, avoid
           alcohol, and start a 4-day 100 g fat diet.

        -  On the evening before Day 5, a standardized, completely digestible, and non-fermentable
           meal (lasagna) will be consumed which will be provided to you on Day 1.

        -  Participants will collect stool at home on Day 4 and 5 and store as per instructions
           provided on Visit 1. They will

      Day 5 (Visit 2):

        -  Participants return to the clinic on Day 5 after an overnight fast.

        -  You will receive a standard breakfast and lasanga meal with 10 g inulin (Orafti®) powder
           and 200 mL of water.

        -  Take-home meals will be provided (white bread sandwich with ham or cheese) to be
           consumed at 4 and 8 hours after breakfast.

      Day 6 (Visit 3):

        -  Participants will return to the clinic in order to return stool collections and the
           daily diaries.

        -  Participants may also submit diaries by fax or email.

      Sample Collection: Stool samples will be collected from all participants after study
      initiation. Samples will be collected during the last 2 days of a 4-day low fiber, 100 g fat
      diet. Stool will be refrigerated by participants and brought to the laboratory on ice within
      4 days of collection. Once received, stool specimens will be homogenized and split into 4
      samples for fecal microbial, fecal SCFA, fecal inulin, and fecal bile acid analysis and
      immediately frozen at -80ο Celsius.

        The target study population will be patients with IBS (both diarrhea- and
        constipation-predominant) and healthy controls. Participants may be identified by review of

        Registry, and by public advertisement. Participants may also be identified and invited
