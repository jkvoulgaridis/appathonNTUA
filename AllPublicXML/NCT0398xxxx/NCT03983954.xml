  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation (Phase 1b) and cohort expansions (Phase 2) study to assess the
      safety and tolerability of a combination of Nap with durvalumab in subjects with selected
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1b, open-label, multicenter (n=3), prospective, dose-finding and MTD cohort
      expansion study, will accrue patients with previously treated solid tumors known with high
      likelihood of 5T4 antigen expression on tumor cells.

      Patients in the dose-escalation part will be treated with the combination of Nap and
      durvalumab using a fixed dose of durvalumab and the 3+3 design for Nap dose escalations. The
      (Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Nap for the combination treatment will be established based
      on Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) occurring during the first cycle of the treatment. The
      dose escalation part will be followed by a MTD expansion part, in which 10-15 patients will
      be treated with the same combination however using the established MTD of Nap. This MTD
      expansion cohort will accrue patients with the same tumor types as in the escalation part,
      but with a requirement of measurable disease. This expansion cohort will help assess the
      biologic activity of the combination and to gain some preliminary insights on its potential
      antitumor activity.

      The following solid tumors known to have &gt; 80% probability of 5T4 expression and thus may be
      included in both the dose escalation phase and the MTD expansion: breast cancer, epithelial
      ovarian cancer, cervical and endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal and urothelial
      cancer, head and neck, mesothelioma, melanoma, hepatic carcinoma, prostate cancer, and
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy is acceptable.

      Five dose levels of Nap are planned: 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 µg/kg/dose given as an intravenous
      (I.V.) bolus injection daily on the first 4 consecutive days of the 21-day cycle, for a total
      of 3 treatment cycles (Days 1-4, 22-25, and 43-46). In parallel, durvalumab (1120 mg, IV, 1-
      1.5 hours after completion of the administration of Nap) will be administered on the second
      day of each 21-day cycle. After cycle 3, patients will continue to receive durvalumab alone
      at a dose of 1500 mg delivered once every 28 days, until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity for a maximum of up to 24 months.Each subsequent cohort will only be opened after
      all patients in the preceding cohort completed the first cycle of treatment and &lt;2
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported.

      MTD expansion cohort: In the MTD expansion cohort, treatment with the combination of Nap and
      durvalumab will be given for the first 3 treatment cycles at the same schedule described
      above but using the determined MTD of Nap and the same fixed dose of durvalumab. Additional
      treatment cycles with this combination beyond cycle 3 may be authorized by the Sponsor based
      on the pharmacokinetic findings in the dose escalation part of the study.

      Patients in this cohort will be required to provide a fresh biopsy sample on Day 4 of Cycle
      1, which will be assessed for tumor biomarkers and tumor gene microenvironment expression.

      Follow-up:

        -  Safety reporting will be collected for up to 90 days following administration of the
           last study dose, even in patients receiving subsequent anticancer therapy in the
           interval.

        -  Tumor evaluations (CT/MRI) will be performed every 63 ± 7 days, regardless of treatment
           delays. Scans will be evaluated using the RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST guidelines.

        -  Serologic and cellular immune biomarkers will be evaluated at the beginning and end of
           Cycles 1-3, as well as on Day 8 of Cycle 1.

         21. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the
             first dose of IP (Investigational Product). Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions
             for palliative intent is acceptable.

         22. Patients who have received prior anti-PD-1, anti PD-L1 or anti CTLA-4:

               -  Must not have experienced a toxicity that led to permanent discontinuation of
                  prior immunotherapy.

               -  All AEs while receiving prior immunotherapy must have completely resolved or
                  resolved to baseline prior to screening for this study.

               -  Must not have experienced a Grade ≥3 immune-related AE or an immune-related
                  neurologic or ocular AE of any grade while receiving prior immunotherapy. Note:
                  Patients with an endocrine AE of Grade ≤2 are permitted to enroll if they are
                  stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic.

               -  Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppression other than
                  corticosteroids for the management of an AE, not have experienced recurrence of
                  an AE if re-challenged, and not currently require maintenance doses of &gt;10 mg
                  prednisone or equivalent per day.
