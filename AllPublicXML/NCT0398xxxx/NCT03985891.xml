    <textblock>
      Colon cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies, and colorectal cancer ranks the fifth
      leading cause of tumor-related mortality in China. FOLFOX is the recommended adjuvant/
      neoadjuvant treatment for advanced colon cancer. JS001, as the first Chinese produced
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has been approved by CFDA. This study aims to assess the
      safety and efficacy of JS001 in combination with FOLFOX as adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment for
      patients with locally advanced colon cancer.

      Colon cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies, and colorectal cancer ranks the fifth
      leading cause of tumor-related mortality in China. FOLFOX is the recommended adjuvant/
      neoadjuvant treatment for advanced colon cancer and it can improve the R0 resection rate, as
      well as reduce recurrence rate, but the overall responding rate is limited. Currently, immune
      checkpoint blocked (ICB) emerges as a promising approach in early colon cancer. JS001, as the
      first Chinese produced anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has been approved by CFDA in melanoma.
      This study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients who meet the
      enrollment criteria will receive FOLFOX (Q2W) and JS001 (3mg/kg, Q2W) or only FOLFOX for
      neoadjuvant treatment 6 cycles in pre-operation and same treatment after operation, a total
      of six months. The assessment will be conducted in the 6th week and 13th week from the
      initiation date in the first cycle. The patients will be followed up for 5 years. The pCR
      rate, rCR rate, ORR, DFS, OS and Safety will be compared. This study aims to assess the
      safety and efficacy of JS001 in combination with FOLFOX as adjuvant/ neoadjuvant treatment
      for patients with locally advanced colon cancer.
