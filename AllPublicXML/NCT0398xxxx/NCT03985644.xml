    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is an optimal radical therapy for selected patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma. Hangzhou criteria could safely and effectively expand Milan criteria with expanded
      population and comparable survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Hangzhou
      criteria in a multi-center cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of
      cancer-related deaths worldwide. Among all the liver cancer cases, hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) constitutes 75-85%. Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for HCC and
      is in high demand in China. The advent of Milan criteria has helped to select the recipients
      reasonably. However, the organ allocation system driven by the Milan criteria seemed to be
      too strict so that many centers worldwide have expanded the criteria in the aspects of
      morphological features, histopathology and biomarkers. Hangzhou criteria introduce the
      covariables of histopathologic grading and α-fetoprotein (AFP) into the selection of
      recipients for the first time. Based on the multi-center HCC patient cohort undergoing
      transplantation, this study aims to characterize an ideal candidate selecting system beyond
      the Milan criteria.

        Patients aged ≥18 years and &lt;=75 with HCC who underwent a primary whole or split liver
        transplant from a deceased donor were eligible for enrollment at the time of transplant.
        All of patients were histologically confirmed HCC by postoperative pathological examination
        in the participating centers. The donor-to-recipient arrangements all conformed to the
        principle of ABO compatibility. Key exclusion criteria were incomplete follow-up, missing
        essential data for analysis (tumor size, number, differentiation grade, α-fetoprotein
        (AFP)) or vascular invasion according to radiological criteria, and excludes those with
        perioperative mortality (&lt;30 days)
