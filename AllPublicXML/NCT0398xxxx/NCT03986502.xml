  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a financial navigation intervention works in improving financial
      and clinical outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma. Financial toxicity is a term used to summarize cancer-related financial
      hardship, including both the material (e.g. debt) and psychological (e.g. anxiety about
      costs) aspects. Cancer patients who experience financial toxicity are at greater risk for
      treatment non-adherence, poorer quality of life, and worse survival. Caregivers also share in
      this experience of financial toxicity and often spend money on food, medications, and other
      patient needs in addition to taking time off from work to provide logistical, emotional, and
      medical support. Financial navigation interventions that address the shared household
      financial concerns of patients and their caregivers may not only improve the patient outcomes
      but also improve caregiver burden, quality of life, and ability to perform caregiver roles
      more effectively.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (FINANCIAL NAVIGATION PROGRAM): Patients and caregivers watch a web-based financial
      literacy video and receive information about financial counseling, direct medical cost and
      healthcare coverage assistance, and indirect and non-medical cost assistance.

      ARM II (USUAL CARE): Patients and caregivers participate in usual clinic procedures and
      utilize any available clinic or community-based financial resources.

    <measure>Patient quality of life: European Quality of Life (EuroQOL) EQ-5D index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using Composite score from the European Quality of Life (EuroQOL) EQ-5D index. The proportion of patients in each arm who experience improved, unchanged, or worsened EQ-5D scores from baseline to 3 (and 6) months will be compared using Fisher's exact test. Mean score changes from baseline will be compared using two group t tests. A multivariate linear regression model, with worsening score as the dependent variable and study arm (intervention vs. control) as the independent variable will be performed, adjusting for covariates.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective financial distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity-Patient Reported Outcome Measure. Mean scores (and standard deviations) at 3 and 6 months will be compared between intervention and control patients and caregivers using two sample t tests. Additionally, will explore the extent to which subjective financial distress correlates with financial hardship by comparing mean scores in those who experience financial hardship in each study arm versus those who do not.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative assessment of usual care and intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Usual care arm dyads will be surveyed about availability (or lack), access to, and use of financial assistance via the clinic and community. Intervention arm dyads will be surveyed about availability and use of financial assistance from the clinic, community, and navigation partners. Will evaluate Consumer Education and Training Services (CENTS)'s and Patient Advocate Foundation (PAF)'s documentation and characterize the interventions made on behalf of dyads in subgroups categorized by age, gender, income, and financial fragility. We will review all unresolved issues reported by CENTS and PAF and describe the frequency and type by subgroup. We will describe dyads' use of clinic and community-based financial assistance resources in both study arms across subgroups, noting barriers to access if present.</description>

    <description>Will determine the proportion of caregivers in each arm who experience improved, unchanged, or worsened Caregiver Oncology Quality of Life Questionnaire (CarGOQoL) scores (composite and sub-score) from baseline to 3 (and 6) months and compare using Fisher's exact test. Mean score changes will be compared using two group t tests. A multivariate linear regression model, with worsening score as the dependent variable and study arm as the independent variable will be performed, adjusting for covariates.</description>
