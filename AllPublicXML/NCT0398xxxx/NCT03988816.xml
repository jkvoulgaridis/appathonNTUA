  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although relatively common, bronchiectasis is considered an orphan disease as there is little
      evidence for adequate treatment, most of the therapeutic options are extrapolated from
      studies with patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis
      (CF). Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids should be used as a therapeutic test and
      maintained if there is improvement of symptoms or lung function. There is no evidence to
      justify the use of mucolytic agents for these patients. The treatment with greater evidence
      is the use of macrolides, especially azithromycin. A meta-analysis published in 2014 showed
      that there was a reduction in the number of exacerbations, an improvement in the quality of
      life and a reduction in the decrease in FEV1. However, studies have shown conflicting results
      regarding quality of life and pulmonary function.

      Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor with an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro and
      in vivo due to the inhibition of cyclic adenosine monopostat breakdown (cAMP) to its inactive
      phosphodiesterase form. As this enzyme is expressed in high concentrations in leukocytes and
      other inflammatory cells responsible for the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases such as COPD,
      it has been studied and used for this disease. COPD is characterized by a chronic
      inflammatory process of the airways, predominantly neutrophils and high levels of
      proinflammatory cytokines related to this cell, such as interleukin-8, neutrophil elastase,
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and E-selectin. The REACT study showed that roflumilast
      prevents moderate and severe infectious exacerbations in addition to improved lung function
      in patients with COPD who continue to exacerbate despite the use of combined bronchodilator
      and inhaled corticosteroid therapy.

      Since bronchiectasis and COPD are chronic inflammatory diseases, they present similar
      inflammatory processes, with neutrophil as the main inflammatory cell, it is expected that
      the use of roflumilast also has an anti-inflammatory effect in bronchiectasis. In addition,
      since bronchiectasis is a disease with poor evidence for pharmacological treatment, it is
      necessary to search for new therapeutic possibilities.
