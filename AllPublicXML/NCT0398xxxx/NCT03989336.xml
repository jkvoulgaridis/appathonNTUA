  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological cancer and the 5th leading cause of cancer
      death in women. Platinum chemotherapy has been widely adopted as a standard treatment for
      advanced ovarian cancer, the response rates in patients with relapsed/refractory ovarian
      cancer is unacceptably low. PD-1 blockade has been developed to a new class of cancer
      immunotherapy that could restore an adequate immunosurveillance against the neoplasm and
      enhance T-cell-mediated anticancer immune responses. Manganese has been confirmed to activate
      antigen-presenting cells and function as mucosal immunoadjuvants in pre-clinical studies.
      This two-arm, phase I/II study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of combined
      therapy of anti-PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy with or without Manganese priming.
