  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In women undergoing laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy which is less harmfull on the ovarian
      reserve (electrocoagulation or suturing).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to determine which hemostatic procedure (hemostatic suture
      or electrocautery) may be less harmful after laparoscopic cystectomy, based on the longterm
      status of the ovarian reserve.

    <masking_description>Allocation and concealment will be done by sequentially sealed opaque envelopes. 60 envelopes will be numbered serially from 1 to 60, 30 envelopes will contain the letter c and the other 30 will contain the letter S.
In each envelope, the corresponding letter which donates the allocated group will be put according to the randomization table and them all envelopes will be closed and put in one box. When the first patient arrives, the first envelope will be opened and the patient will be allocated according to the letter inside.</masking_description>

    <description>The sutures will be performed with intracorporeal knots using 2-0 polyglican absorbable sutures (Vicryl; Ethicon Inc., New Jersey, USA). Suture is performed using needle holders for the closure of ovarian parenchyma and controlling bleeding. Bleeding from ovarian hilus will only resolve by suturing.
The running suture starting from central area, around the ovarian hilus to peripheral tissue, will be performed with intraovarian knots to re-approximate the edges to achieve satisfying hemostasis. Knots will not be detectable on the ovarian surface for prevention of adhesion. Mean time for hemostasis of ovary was recorded in a form. The cyst wall will be removed from the abdomen by means of an endobag. All resected cyst walls will be sent to the pathology laboratory, to confirm the histopathology of endometriosis.</description>
