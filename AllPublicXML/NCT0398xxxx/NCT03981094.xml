    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are to characterize the PK of BMS-986278 after
      administration of a single dose of BMS-986278 alone or in combination with pirfenidone, as
      well as to characterize the PK of pirfenidone after administration of a single dose of
      pirfenidone alone or in combination with BMS-986278
