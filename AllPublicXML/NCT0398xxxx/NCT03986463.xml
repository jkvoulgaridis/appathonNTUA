  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observation study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      starting either cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy. It will assess changes in
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the days following the initiation of treatment, as well as
      longitudinal monitoring, to assess the dynamics and value of ctDNA in stage III-IV NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of three cohorts of patients initiating a new treatment for their NSCLC.
      The cohorts of (1) patients starting concurrent chemotherapy and radiation for stage III
      NSCLC (2) patients with advanced NSCLC starting cytotoxic chemotherapy (with or without
      pembrolizumab) (3) patients with advanced NSCLC starting palliative radiation therapy. This
      study aims to study the changes in ctDNA levels following a new treatment in lung cancer
      patients and to explore if the diagnostic utility of ctDNA testing is improved immediately
      following treatment when tumour cells are actively dying. It will also examine the changes in
      ctDNA levels and mutational analysis longitudinally.
