  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate the evaluate to use of a drug/radiopharmaceutical called
      Gallium-68 PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) for use in PET/MRI evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot proof-of-concept single-center study. Primary Objective Using
      surgical histopathology as the reference standard, the investigators intend to achieve the
      following objectives in adult subjects with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) undergoing
      surgical resection or transplant:

        1. To demonstrate the feasibility of 68Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI for imaging patients with HCC

        2. To estimate the sensitivity of SUVmax on PSMA PET for identification of LI-RADSÂ® 5
           (definitely HCC) observations or biopsy proven HCC(s).

        3. To perform a Radiology-Pathology correlation of PSMA uptake at PET with HCC tumor PSMA
           immunostaining, tumor pathology features, and signal and enhancement characteristics at
           MRI
