    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether patients with breast cancer who are being
      treated with non-anthracycline trastuzumab therapy can safely be monitored for heart related
      side effects less often than usual.

        A member of the patient's treatment team, the protocol investigator, or research team at
        MSK will identify potential research participants. The preliminary screen of eligibility
        will be confirmation of the diagnosis of HER2-positive breast cancer. A member of the
        treatment team will discuss the study and the possibility of enrollment in the study with
        potential subjects that meet this eligibility criterion. The study will be conducted at the
        Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center of MSK as well as at the regional MSK network sites.
        Recruitment at both main and regional network sites will ensure the enrollment of diverse
        populations of different ages, races, and ethnic groups onto the study. Patients will then
        be consented to the study.

        In most cases, the initial contact with the prospective subject will be conducted either by
        the treatment team, investigator or the research staff working in consultation with the
        treatment team.
