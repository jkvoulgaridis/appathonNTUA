      This study evaluates the effectiveness of brushing and flossing sequence in the control of
      dental plaque and gingival inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is the disease of the supporting dental tissues like alveolar
      bone,periodontal ligament cementum and gingiva. The most common form is plaque-induced
      gingivitis . Bleeding on gingival probing is one of the hallmarks of gingival
      inflammation.The removal of dental plaque is the most crucial action for preventing and
      treating gingival inflammation. Toothbrush along with toothpaste are still the most reliable
      means of plaque control. However, cleaning should be thorough and performed at regular
      intervals.

      Toothbrush has a limited ability to reach all the areas around the tooth. Inter-dental areas
      are prone for plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation. Dental floss is one of the most
      effective tool in addition to tooth brush to remove inter-dental plaque. The sequence of
      using toothbrush and dental floss may influence the removal of dental plaque and consequently
      reducing the bleeding on probing of gingiva. There is conflicting evidence in the literature.
      The hypothesis of this study is that the sequence of brushing and flossing will not influence
      control of plaque control and gingival inflammation.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be selected by random sampling and allocated to Two Arms: Arm-I - Brushing first and Flossing later (BF), Arm II- Flossing first and brushing later (FB) after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The participants in BF group will Brush first using Colgate® tooth brush for a 2-week period. and then floss with Colgate® dental floss using Spool method for a 2-week period. This is followed by a one week wash out period After this cross over is done in which participants will change the sequence to FB wherein they will floss first and brush later.
The participants in FB group will floss first with Colgate® dental floss and brush later using Colgate® tooth brush for a 2-week period. This is followed by a one week wash out period.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean BPI Index Scores at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding on probing (BOP) is an objective indicator of inflammation. BPI (Bleeding Point Index) is a validated index used to measure BOP. BOP is determined at the buccal, lingual and proximal surfaces of all teeth using BPI scores. BPI scores are measured at baseline and 2 weeks, followed by a wash out period of one week. BPI score is measured again at baseline and 2 weeks after cross over in intervention. Change in BPI scores will give the estimation of effect of the intervention. BPI score- minimum value is 0% and Maximum is 100% of bleeding surfaces in each individual patient with teeth. A positive error means that the predicted value is larger than the true value, and a negative error means that the predicted value is less than the true value. The mean error should be close to zero. Sometimes it will be negative or positive depending on the population.. Higher mean score is poor outcome. However, higher reduction in mean score compared to baseline is better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean RMNPI Index Score at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index(RMNPI) is a self validated tool to assess dental plaque accumulation on the teeth surfaces. RMNPI scores are used to assess change in plaque scores at baseline and at the end of 2 weeks .This will be followed by a 1 week wash out period. Then there is a cross over in the intervention. RMNPI scores are measured again from Baseline and 2 weeks. Maximum number of surfaces examined are 504 per person. A Minimum value of 0 and maximum value of 1 can be calculated in each patient.
Higher mean score is a worse outcome. However,higher percent reduction in mean score when compared to baseline is better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean BPI Index Scores at 2 Weeks</title>
        <description>Bleeding on probing (BOP) is an objective indicator of inflammation. BPI (Bleeding Point Index) is a validated index used to measure BOP. BOP is determined at the buccal, lingual and proximal surfaces of all teeth using BPI scores. BPI scores are measured at baseline and 2 weeks, followed by a wash out period of one week. BPI score is measured again at baseline and 2 weeks after cross over in intervention. Change in BPI scores will give the estimation of effect of the intervention. BPI score- minimum value is 0% and Maximum is 100% of bleeding surfaces in each individual patient with teeth. A positive error means that the predicted value is larger than the true value, and a negative error means that the predicted value is less than the true value. The mean error should be close to zero. Sometimes it will be negative or positive depending on the population.. Higher mean score is poor outcome. However, higher reduction in mean score compared to baseline is better outcome.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>There was no article with available to calculate sample size. Hence we conducted the pilot study among 30 participants. We recalculated the sample size from mean and SE of our study. It was estimated to be 40.</limitations_and_caveats>
