  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing worldwide and in France, including among young
      children.

      Type 1 diabetes has consequences for integration in community, especially on the management
      of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, mealtimes, participation in sporting activities and school
      trips.

      This works' purpose is to describe obstacles and difficulties to the integration in community
      before primary school (day care center, childminder, and nursery school) of a complete sample
      of children with type 1 diabetes followed in the Diabetology Department of Lyon Pediatric
      Hospital, at the start of the school year 2018-2019. The investigating team will carry out a
      descriptive study, using different questionnaires addressed to the professionals (nursery
      school directors, day care nursery directors, childminders, school doctors, pediatricians and
      doctors of child and maternal protection centers) and to the parents of children with type 1
      diabetes. These different questionnaires will help to take into account different points of
      view, in order to identify all the obstacles to integration of children with type 1 diabetes
      in community.

      Through this work, secondary information actions through training and/or information leaflets
      will be carried out in order to facilitate the reception of these children in the community.
