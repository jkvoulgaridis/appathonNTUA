      Identify the cutaneous microbiota on a cutaneous lesion (cellulite, wound, rash, etc.) on a
      swab, biopsies or abscess puncture and on &quot;healthy&quot; skin on a skin swab performed for
      cutaneous mapping to search for staphylococcal deposits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cellulite is characterized by inflammation and an alleged infection of the skin and
      subcutaneous tissues. Previous studies have shown a low yield of samples such as biopsy and
      needle aspiration of the order of 16%. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus
      and Streptococcus pyogenes.

      Conventional cultivation has limitations such as the lack of detection of fastidious
      microorganisms, or the use of antibiotics. Molecular diagnostic methods, such as detection of
      16S ribosomal DNA followed by amplification and pyrosequencing, have been used to overcome
      the limitations of microbial culture.

      In a recent study, the authors investigated the causes of acute cellulitis without performing
      drainage but skin biopsies from the infected site and another non-infected site by
      quantitative PCR, pyrosequencing, and conventional culture. PCR identified
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus methicillin in approximately 30% -40% of cases with similar
      frequency in infected and uninfected sites. In another study R. felis was found in not only
      bedsores, but also, swabs taken from healthy skin, as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae, S.
      aureus and Streptococcus group A. Being engaged in the exploration of the human microbiota
      especially by culture we propose to extend the knowledge of this skin microbiota in patients
      hospitalized in Infectious Disease services.
