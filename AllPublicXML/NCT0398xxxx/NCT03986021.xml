      Background:

      Most adult women with irregular periods of unknown cause report symptoms dating back to early
      adolescence. This study aims to learn how girls periods change in the 2 years after their
      first period. This will help researchers learn what healthy puberty looks like and how they
      can spot signs of hormone problems early on.

      Objective:

      To learn how long it takes girls to develop regular menstrual cycles after their first
      period.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy girls ages 8-14 who either (1) haven t had their first period but show signs of
      puberty, such as breast development and hair in the genital area; or (2) had their first
      period in the past 6 months

      Design:

      A parent or guardian must allow their daughter to participate. They must attend all study
      visits with her.

      Participants will first be screened by phone. Those who qualify will be screened in person.
      They will have a physical exam. They will give blood and urine samples. They will have an
      ultrasound of their abdomen. They will fill out questionnaires. They will sit in a BOD POD
      for 6 minutes: This is an egg-shaped machine that takes body measurements.

      Participants will have sets of visits at home or at the clinic about every 6 months. The
      number of visits in each set will depend on their menstrual cycle. Then they will have a
      final visit. Visits will include repeats of the screening tests.

      At home, participants will collect their urine daily to measure hormones. They will keep a
      diary of their periods.

      The study will last about 2 years.

    <textblock>
      The broad goal of these studies is to determine the physiologic and pathophysiologic
      underpinnings of irregular menstrual cycles among adolescents in the early post-menarchal
      period. Irregular menstruation affects &gt; 2.5 million reproductive-age women in the US each
      year1. Most adult women with oligomenorrhea of unknown etiology reporting symptoms dating
      back to early adolescence. While a period of cycle irregularity is well-described in the
      first few years after menarche, a lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms of normal
      reproductive axis development in the post-menarchal female has hampered our ability to
      distinguish abnormal from normal developmental trajectories. Moreover, the commonly held
      belief that menstrual irregularity among teenage girls is normal has also delayed detection
      of pathology in reproductive development, precluding institution of early preventative
      strategies to curtail future reproductive morbidity.

    <description>We hypothesize that the temporal sequence of reproductive maturation will consist of anovulatory cycles (representing a time of unopposed estrogen exposure), ovulatory cycles with a short luteal phase (estrogen with low progesterone exposure), and finally, ovulatory cycles with a normal luteal phase length (estrogen action fully counterbalanced by progesterone action).</description>
