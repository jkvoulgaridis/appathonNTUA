  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of all adult women suffer with Urinary incontinence (UI), this is more common in
      athletes.

      UI is considered to be due to weak pelvic floor muscles. Standard advice encourages strength
      and endurance training; however, assessment of pelvic floor muscles can sometimes reveal
      overactive or tight tissues.

      Evidence suggests athletes have stronger pelvic floors than non-athletes. If the pelvic floor
      is overactive, general advice regarding pelvic floor strengthening will not improve UI, and
      may make it worse.

      This study will explore the feasibility of conducting a larger trial to identify cost
      effectiveness and benefits of treating athletes with physiotherapy and how this might differ
      from current practice.

      15 -20 athletic women will complete questionnaires regarding their UI and its effects on
      them. They will receive physiotherapy; the assessment will include a history and internal
      examination of their pelvic floor. This will inform a tailored rehabilitation program.

      Interviews will be conducted with some of these women to explore their response to the
      intervention. Interviews with health professionals will establish current practice for this
      patient group.

      The results will tell us how likely it is for athletes to volunteer and take part in a future
      study and which outcomes are useful.

      Aims: The investigator's overall purpose is to conduct an RCT to determine whether one to one
      physiotherapy can improve the symptoms of urinary incontinence (UI) in a group of athletic
      women. This feasibility study will enable us to ascertain the viability of conducting a
      definitive appropriately powered trial.

      Research protocol: The research design is a mixed methods study with three distinct but
      related phases.

      Phase 1: 6-8 local health care professionals (GPs, nurses and physiotherapists) will be
      recruited for interview to explore current management practices of urinary incontinence (UI)
      in primary care.

      Phase 2: 15-20 sporting or athletic women who self- report symptoms of UI will be recruited
      from the local sporting community. Each will undergo individual subjective and objective
      assessments in order to establish history, symptoms and pelvic floor muscle function. The
      intervention will be then be tailored from these assessments and agreed between each
      individual and the specialist physiotherapist. It will include guided exercise within the
      clinic and a regular home exercise plan, in keeping with typical pelvic health regimes for
      pelvic floor muscle (PFM) dysfunction.

      Phase 3: 6-8 participants from phase 2 will be invited to take part in a qualitative
      interview in order to gain more in-depth understanding of UI. Purposeful selection will
      account for age, sporting activity and severity of symptoms. The interviews will be to
      explore the effects of UI on their quality of life, their participation in sport and exercise
      and the acceptability of the intervention.

      Measurable end points: 6 months from recruitment of the last participant in phase 2 will be
      considered to be the end point of the study.
