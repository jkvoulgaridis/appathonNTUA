  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to identify the physical and dietary profile of adult women
      presenting constitutional leanness (CL), comparatively with normal-weight peers and
      BMI-matched women with anorexia nervosa. After an evaluation of their daily energy intake,
      physical activity level, body composition, aerobic capacities and muscle strength, women from
      the normal weight and CL groups will be asked to realized laboratory sessions to evaluate
      their energy intake and appetite feelings responses to acute exercise

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body composition (using X-ray absorptiometry), muscle strength (biodex), daily energy intake
      (dietary record), food preferences (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire) and physical
      activity level (GT3X accelerometers) will be assessed among women with constitutional
      leanness normal weight women and women with anorexia nervosa. The CT and NW groups will then
      be asked to randomly realized three experimental session: i) a rest session with an fixed
      lunch meal; a rest session with an ad libitum meal ; iii) an exercise session with an ad
      libitum meal. Their ad libitum energy intake will be assessed during the two last sessions.
      Appetite feelings will be assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in response to
      the lunch will also be assessed.
