  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data literature lacks of evidence concerning the variation of the nutritional status in
      patients undergoing hip surgery, thus preventing an effective application a nutritional
      support program. It is therefore necessary to start identifying the clinical steps
      (pre-operative and post-operative) that may be defined as critical control points for
      malnutrition. The observation should foresee the identification of nutritional status
      indicators, such as weight, hemoglobin, albumin, food intake, and others that might affect a
      proper recovery. This study aims to investigate the prognostic nutritional factors that might
      influence clinical outcomes, and their variation in relation to hospitalization and
      rehabilitation periods.

      Data literature lacks of evidence concerning the variation of the nutritional status in
      patients undergoing hip surgery, thus preventing an effective application a nutritional
      support program. It is therefore necessary to start identifying the clinical steps
      (pre-operative and post-operative) that may be defined as critical control points for
      malnutrition. Patients undergoing hip surgery would be enrolled before the surgical operation
      and would be evaluated three times: preoperative, postoperative, and after discharge. The
      observation should foresee the identification of nutritional status indicators, such as
      weight, hemoglobin, albumin, food intake, and others that might affect a proper recovery.
      This study aims to investigate the prognostic nutritional factors that might influence
      clinical outcomes, and their variation in relation to hospitalization and rehabilitation
      periods.

    <measure>Change from baseline level of hemoglobin at 14 days after surgical operation</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the surgical operation, after 3 days, after 14 days.</time_frame>
    <description>One of the main decision-making factors that guide the clinician to discharge the patient is the hemoglobin level. The association between preoperative hemoglobin and hemoglobin at discharge was already observed in past orthopedic cohorts, with a loss of 3.3 g/dl being considered clinically relevant. Patients with a better nutritional status may have a reduced fall in hemoglobin after the surgical operation.</description>
