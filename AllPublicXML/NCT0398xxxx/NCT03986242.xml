    <textblock>
      Delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is an acute micro-trauma or inflammatory response
      experienced in the most runners; and, it concurrently impairs athletic performance and may
      increase the risk of sports injury. Alleviating the symptoms of DOMS strategies are various;
      however, the specific recovery way remains unconcluded. Furthermore, few studies have
      investigated the effects of vibrating roller on alleviating the symptoms of DOMS and
      understand the biochemical changes in response to recovery of athletic performance.
      Therefore, this study hypothesizes that vibration rolling (VR) could provide a
      self-myofascial release. Meanwhile, vibration exercise could transmit vibration to specific
      muscle groups to decrease inflammation in corresponding to reduce muscular pain. Therefore,
      it could offer positive effects including improvements of flexibility, muscle stiffness,
      visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, jump, and dynamic balance.

      Background: Delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is an acute micro-trauma or inflammatory
      response experienced in the most runners; and, it concurrently impairs athletic performance
      and may increase risk of sports injury. Alleviating the symptoms of DOMS strategies are
      various; however, the specific recovery way remains unconcluded. Furthermore, few studies
      have investigated that the effects of vibrating roller on alleviating the symptoms of DOMS,
      and understand the biochemical changes in response to recovery of athletic performance.
      Therefore, this study hypothesizes that vibration rolling (VR) could provide self-myofascia
      release. Meanwhile, vibration exercise could tramsit vibration to speific muscle groups to
      decrease inflammation in corresponding to reduce muscular pain. Therefore, it could offer
      positve effects including improvements of flexability, muscle stiffness, visual analog scale
      (VAS) for pain, jmup, and dynmaic balance. Purpose: To investigate VR, non-vibration rolling
      (NVR), and static stretching for DOMS on physiological changes and recovery of athletic
      performance in runners. Methods: Thirty healthy and recreationally adult runners will be
      voluntarily recruited in the experiment. Participant will be induced DOMS on the treadmill
      exercise firstly. Next, participants will be matched up and randomly assigned to the VR
      group, NVR group or static stretching group treatment. Each participant will be instructed to
      20-minutes treatment on bilateral muscles including gluteus, anterior, and posterior thighs
      as well as anterior, and posterior legs. All subjects will receive blood analysis (leukocyte,
      lymphocyte, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein, interleukin-6) and perform flexibility
      muscular stiffness, VAS for pain, counter movement jump, Y balance tests on lower limb before
      exercise and after 24hour and 48 hour interventions. Expected outcomes: VR could effectively
      alleviate the symptoms of DOMS including decreasing inflammatory biochemical values,
      decreasing muscular stiffness, reducing muscular pain, and increasing flexibility and jump
      ability as well as improving dynamic balance on lower limb. This data may provide in
      alleviating the symptoms of DOMS to healthy populations, athletes, and medical team members.

Ely's test to test the range of motion the rectus femoris.
=&gt;The therapist is standing next to the patient, at the side of the leg that will be tested.
One hand should be on the lower back, the other holding the leg at the heel. Passively flex the knee in a rapid fashion. The heel should touch the buttocks. Test both sides for comparison. The test is positive when the heel cannot touch the buttocks, the hip of the tested side rises up from the table, the patient feels pain or tingling in the back or legs.</description>

providing a range of scores from 0-10, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0), mild pain(1-3), moderate pain (4-6), and severe pain (&gt;6).</description>

    <description>The countermovement jump (CMJ) is a simple, practical, valid, and very reliable measure of lower-body power.
As a consequence, it is no surprise that this has become a cornerstone test for many strength and conditioning coaches and sports scientists.
The CMJ has been shown to be the most reliable measure of lower-body power compared to other jump tests.

    <measure>Y balance test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The YBT requires the athlete to balance on one leg whilst simultaneously reaching as far as possible with the other leg in three separate directions: anterior, posterolateral, and posteromedial.
Therefore, this test measures the athlete's strength, stability and balance in various directions.
The YBT composite score is calculated by summing the 3 reach directions and normalizing the results to the lower limb length, whereas asymmetry is the difference between right and left limb reach (1) - this is explained in greater detail in the scoring system section.</description>

    <description>Use Myoton PRO instrument to test the muscle stiffness. The method of measurement consists of recording damped natural oscillation of soft biological tissue in the form of an acceleration signal and the subsequent simultaneous computation of the parameters of State of Tension, Biomechanical and Viscoelastic properties.
Damped natural oscillation is induced by an exterior, low force quick-release mechanical impulse under constant pre-load.
The test muscle : Quadriceps, Hamstring, Gastrocnemius, Tibialis anterior muscle.</description>
