      This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      allogeneic donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) combined with the bispecific T cell engager
      blinatumomab in B-precursor ALL patients who have mixed chimerism (MC) or are MRD-positive
      after allogeneic SCT and are refractory to at least one MRD- or MC-targeted therapy (i.e.
      blinatumomab, DLI, tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other agents).

    <description>MRD response based on RT-PCR: Complete MRD response (MolCR): hCR and MRD not detectable by molecular probe[s] with a sensitivity ≥10−4. The MRD response is calculated as: [number of patients achieving complete MRD response after at least one cycle (minimum 4 days blinatumomab) of study treatment] / [number of patients who received at least 1 cycle (minimum 4 days blinatumomab) of study treatment].
Mixed chimerism response: CC response: only donor STRs in bone marrow; Low-level MC response ≥90% but &lt;100% donor STRs in bone marrow. The MC response is calculated as: [number of patients achieving CC/low-level MC response after at least one cycle (minimum 4 days blinatumomab) of study treatment] / [number of patients who received at least 1 cycle (minimum 4 days blinatumomab) of study treatment].</description>

    <description>For patients who received at least one cycle (minimum 4 days of blinatumomab), progression-free survival and overall survival will be calculated using kaplan-meier survival estimates. Descriptive summary statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum) for the duration of response will be performed for all patients with an observed complete MRD response or CC/low-level MC response.</description>
