  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use formal measures to monitor the outcome of using
      electroconvulsive therapy to treat self-injurious behavior in adults with Autism Spectrum
      Disorder for whom psychotropic medication has not worked. This study will be fundamentally
      different from the previously published literature on the subject in that this will be a
      prospective study which will aim to recruit multiple participants in an open label study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. They must have a
      confirmed ASD diagnosis and be generally healthy. As part of the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, the participant must have an appointment with their primary care provider or a
      hospital internist to complete a physical exam and required tests (EKG, CXR [chest x-ray],
      CMP [Comprehensive Metabolic Profile], CBC [Complete Blood Count], and head CTscan). At the
      first pre-treatment appointment (Visit 1), the participant and their legal guardian will
      review and sign the consent and assent forms with the investigator. The legal guardian also
      sign a Sentara Norfolk General Hospital release of medical information. The guardian will
      then fill out the ASD Diagnostic Checklist, Repetitive Behavior Scale- Revised, and the
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The physician will complete the Self-Injury Trauma Scale, which
      documents the number, type, and severity of unhealed self-injury traumas. At the end of the
      Visit 1, the guardian will receive a Subject Diary Card to record the number of self-injury
      episodes per day, the number of aggressive episodes per day, and the perceived severity of
      episodes that day. The Diary Card also has space to record the medication taken by the
      participant every day.

      The second pre-treatment appointment (Visit 2) will consist of a complete psychiatric
      evaluation with review of all medical evaluations. The subject must receive medical clearance
      to undergo ECT treatment. The first Diary Card will be collected at this time, and a second
      Diary Card will be given.

      After receiving medical clearance, participants (accompanied by their guardians) will begin
      to receive ECT treatments. They will receive ECT 3 times a week for 4 weeks, for a total of
      12 treatments (Visits 3- 14). All ECT treatments will take place in the Outpatient Surgery
      and Diagnostic Unit of Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, and will be performed by Dr. Shriti
      Patel or Dr. Justin Petri. All subjects will receive bilateral ECT. Participants will be
      placed under general anesthesia (Etomidate) and given a primary muscle relaxant
      (Succinylcholine). An anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist will be present and will
      hyperventilate the patient to lower their seizure threshold. The first ECT treatment (Visit
      3) will determine the participant's seizure threshold. Subsequent ECT treatments (Visits
      4-14) will be determined by the acting psychiatrist based on the patient's seizure threshold.
      Following the procedure, the patient will recover in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.

      Throughout the course of the treatment, guardians will continue filling out the Diary Card.
      Once treatment begins, guardians will be asked to also include any side effects of the
      treatment noted by themselves or the participant. Guardians will turn in and receive new
      Diary Cards weekly.

      After acute ECT treatment is complete, patients and their guardians will return to Eastern
      Virginia Medical School (EVMS) Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences for
      post-treatment appointments (Visits 15-18). At these post-treatment appointment guardians
      will complete the ASD Diagnostic Checklist, Repetitive Behavior Scale- Revised, and the
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The psychiatrist will complete a second Self-Injury Trauma
      Scale. At this time the Diary Card will be collected and subjects will receive Diary Cards
      for 1 month. Visits 15-18 will occur at 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months post -
      acute ECT treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects and their legally-appointed guardians will participate in a total of 18 visits over the course of 1 year. Visits 1 and 2 will occur during weeks 1 and 2. These visits will be for psychiatric and medical evaluations and will take about 1 hour each. Visits 3-14 will take place three times a week for four weeks. These visits will be for the ECT treatments and will take about 2-3 hours each. Visit 15 will take place 1 week post-treatment and visit 16 will take place 4 weeks post-treatment. Guardians will keep a daily diary card between visits 1 and 16, spanning a time of 10 weeks. Visits 17 and 18 will take place at 6 months and 12 months, respectively, and take about 1 hour each.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 7, 11, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Injury Trauma Scale (SIT). This scale allows differentiation and quantification of self-injury completed by the physician based on a complete medical assessment, location of injury, type of injury, number of injuries, and an estimate of severity.
Scales include:
Number Index (NI) - Scores range from 0 (no current injuries) to 5 (17 or more current injuries)
Severity Index (SI) - Scores range from 0 (no current injuries) to 5 (maximum severity of current injuries)
Estimate of Current Risk - Scores range from Low (no current injuries or a lower level of injuries) to Moderate (any abrasion/laceration near the eyes OR any contusion except on the head) to High (any moderate contusion on the head OR any severe abrasion/laceration or contusion)</description>

    <measure>Changes in Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) across time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 7, 11, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 43-item revised scale is specifically intended to assess the variety of repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD, grouped into 6 categories: 1) stereotyped behavior, 2) self-injurious behavior, 3) compulsive behavior, 4) ritualistic behavior, 5) sameness behavior, and 6) restricted injurious behavior.
All items are scored from 0 (behavior does not occur) to 1 (behavior occurs and is a mild problem) to 2 (behavior occurs and is a moderate problem) to 3 (behavior occurs and is a severe problem).
Scale scores for the above 6 scales include:
Number of Subscale Items Endorsed: The total number of items in each scale rated 1, 2, or 3 (per scale)
Total Subscale Score: The sum of the ratings for all items in that scale (per scale)
Overall Number of Items Endorsed: The sum of all &quot;Number of Subscale Items Endorsed&quot; (combined scales Total score)
Overall Score: The sum of all &quot;Total Subscale Scores&quot; (combined scales Total score)</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 7, 11, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 58-item measure useful for evaluation inappropriate and maladaptive behavior with five subscales: 1) Irritability, Agitation, Crying; 2) Lethargy, Social Withdrawal; 3) Stereotypic Behavior; 4) Hyperactivity, Noncompliance; and 5) Inappropriate Speech.
All items are scored from 0 (Not at all a problem) to 3 (the problem is severe in degree).
Each of the 5 scales includes a sum of scores for items on that scale, ranging from [0] (no problem with this measure) to [12 to 48, depending on the scale] (severe problem with this measure).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in ASD Diagnostic Checklist (ADC) across time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 7, 11, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 30-item instrument designed after the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule), ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised), and DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V) criteria for autism, used to assess: 1) qualitative impairment in social interaction, 2) difficulties in communication, and 3) restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior.
All items are scored &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.
Scale scores are the sum of the number of &quot;Yes&quot; responses for each scale. Scores range from [0] (zero &quot;Yes&quot; responses equivalent to no ASD-related behaviors) to [6 to 14, depending on the scale] (all &quot;Yes&quot; responses equivalent to higher ASD-related behaviors).
Total Score includes the sum of all items with a &quot;Yes&quot; response, ranging from 0 (no ASD-related behaviors) to 30 (higher ASD-related behaviors)</description>
