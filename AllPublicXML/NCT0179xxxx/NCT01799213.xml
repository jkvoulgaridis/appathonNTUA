    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is now recognized as a major health problem. It is the number one
      cause of lower extremity disability and has significant deleterious effects on quality of
      life. While there are numerous therapies available for knee OA, most have limited efficacy.
      Of particular concern, is the widespread use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      for this disorder. Veterans, as a group, are at high risk for both gastrointestinal and
      cardiovascular NSAID-induced complications. In this study the investigators propose to
      examine whether replacing NSAIDs with cognitive behavioral therapy delivered by telephone is
      an effective strategy for Veterans with knee OA. Telephone-administered therapy is
      particularly appealing since Veterans with knee OA are more likely to have limited mobility.
      If successful, this program may result in significant cost-savings for both Veterans
      (decreased co-pays and transportation costs) and the VA (decreased hospitalizations due to
      NSAID induced toxicity).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability among Veterans and is the primary
      indication of knee replacement in the VA. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
      the most commonly prescribed medications for knee OA. Though short-term studies have
      demonstrated that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo and acetaminophen, there are no
      long-term data supporting their use. This is of concern, because long-term use of NSAIDs is
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Guidelines have been published to
      improve safe use of NSAIDs; however, adherence to these evidence-based recommendations is low
      in the VA. There is therefore an important need to determine if the long-term use of NSAIDs
      offers any incremental benefit over safer alternatives. This is especially true for Veterans,
      a population at high risk for NSAID-induced toxicity.

      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective and safe treatment alternative for OA.
      This modality is becoming increasingly available in the VA for treatment of chronic pain as
      well as other chronic disorders such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and
      insomnia. CBT can be successfully administered over the telephone and thus stands to benefit
      Veterans living in more remote areas with limited access to hospital or community-based
      outpatient clinics.

      In this study, the investigators propose to conduct a 2-phase randomized withdrawal trial
      (RWT). The trial will focus on recruiting Veterans with knee OA who have been using NSAIDs
      for at least 3 months.

      In the first phase of the study, 544 Veterans with knee OA will be randomized to continue
      NSAIDs or to placebo for 4 weeks. This double-blind phase will enable us to infer whether
      placebo is non-inferior to continued NSAID use. In the second phase, subjects in the NSAIDs
      group will continue NSAIDs and those on placebo will stop taking the placebo and participate
      in a 10-week CBT program. The second, single-blind, phase will allow us to infer whether CBT
      is non-inferior to NSAIDs. All study data will be collected over the telephone thus enabling
      Veterans who have difficulty arranging transportation to the VA to participate.

      The investigators will test for between-group differences in knee pain measured using the
      well-validated Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (primary
      outcome) at 4 and 14 weeks. The investigators will also test for between group differences in
      lower extremity disability, subjects' global impression of change and use of co-therapies
      (secondary outcomes). As recommended for non-inferiority trials, the investigators will
      perform both an intent to treat and per protocol analysis. Lastly, the investigators will
      estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of the CBT protocol compared with continued NSAID
      use.

      Though it would be ideal for subjects randomized to the active study drug to continue their
      current NSAID, having the VA pharmacy formulate multiple different active drugs and
      maintaining the blind is not possible. Therefore, the investigators will include a 2-week
      run-in period where study subjects will replace their NSAID with meloxicam. Meloxicam was
      chosen as the study drug because it is the most commonly prescribed at the investigators'
      center and has a favorable safety profile compared to other NSAIDS.

      If successful, the trial will improve the quality of care delivered to Veterans with chronic
      knee pain due to OA. The proposed strategy is particularly appealing because it replaces the
      widespread use of NSAIDs with a safer alternative, enables delivery of care to Veterans with
      limited access, and is likely to be cost saving.

    <measure>Primary Endpoint: WOMAC Pain Score (Likert Scale Version) at 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC pain score has a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain and higher scores indicate worse pain. The WOMAC pain scale consists of 5 questions that ask about pain during walking, stair use, lying in bed at night, sitting, and standing. Each question is scored on a 5-point scale, where 0 = None, 1 = Mild pain, 2 = Moderate pain, 3 = Severe pain, and 4 = Very severe pain. Total pain scores range from 0 to 20 with higher scores reflecting worse pain. The WOMAC also includes a lower extremity disability scale. Both the pain scale and disability scale (17 items) can be analyzed separately.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the WOMAC Pain Scale Score Over 14 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC is a commonly used measure that combines multiple measurements over a specific time interval into a single index. The AUC provides a single score that quantifies each participant's total WOMAC score across the repeated measurements. The AUC is valid regardless of increases or decreases in reported pain over time. In this case, the possible range is 0-20, with higher scores indicating worse pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Extremity Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Lower extremity disability: Lower extremity functional outcomes will be measured using the WOMAC disability scale. The physical disability scale contains 17 items that assess the amount of difficulty subjects say they have with climbing stairs, rising from a chair, walking, and other activities of daily living. Responses are measured and scored in the same way as the pain scale. The WOMAC lower extremity disability score has a possible score range of 0-68 and higher scores indicate worse functional limitation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A balanced 5-point scale (rated 1 = Much better to 5 = Much worse) asking subjects to rate their change (if any) in pain since starting the study. The possible range of scores is 1 to 5.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will include those for whom a discontinuation trial of NSAIDs is most appropriate:
        1) Veterans with knee pain despite NSAID use and/or 2) Veterans at relatively higher risk
        of NSAID toxicity 55-59 as ascertained by meeting 1 or more of the following 4 criteria:

          -  Answer affirmatively to the question: &quot;Do you have some knee pain on most days over
             the past 3 months?&quot;

          -  Have 1 or more risk factors for NSAID-induced nephrotoxicity (age greater than 60
             years, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, current diuretic use, chronic renal
             insufficiency, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class I-II. Note,
             Class III and IV are excluded).

          -  Have 1 or more risk factors for NSAID-induced gastrointestinal toxicity (history of
             peptic ulcer disease, age &gt; 65 years, concurrent use of daily ASA or corticosteroids),
             and are currently on a gastro-protective agent.

          -  Have 1 or more risk factors for NSAID-induced cardiovascular toxicity (prevalent
             cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, family
             history of early heart disease or age greater than 55 years for women).

        In addition, subjects must:

          -  Be age 20 years or older. While the usual cut off for knee OA is approximately 40
             years, the investigators chose to lower the age cutoff as younger Veterans have a
             higher than expected risk of OA (see B.1).

          -  Have radiographic evidence of knee OA reported in the VistA electronic system.

          -  Be using an NSAID (other than daily ASA) for knee pain on most days of the month for
             at least the past 3 months.

          -  Be able to understand and speak English and have a telephone.

          -  Be willing to engage in a CBT program, to discontinue (or replace) their NSAID, and to
             restrict co-therapies to acetaminophen for 14 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects desiring escalation of analgesics for their current level of knee pain as
             determined by endorsement of the following statement: &quot;Is your knee pain bad enough
             that you want to talk to your doctor about taking stronger pain medications?&quot;

          -  Current use of opioids and/or Celebrex.

          -  Current use of an NSAID (not including ASA) for a painful condition in addition to
             knee OA.

          -  Contraindications to chronic NSAID use: current use of warfarin or antiplatelet agent
             other than ASA, allergy to any NSAID, active upper gastrointestinal ulceration in the
             previous 30 days, upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the past year, history of
             gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, cardiovascular event within the past 6
             months (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, coronary-artery bypass graft,
             invasive coronary revascularisation, or new-onset angina), severe congestive heart
             failure (New York Heart Association class III-IV), evidence of serious anemia,
             hepatic, renal (including nephrotic syndrome), or blood coagulation disorders, and
             pregnancy.

        ***Though the investigators are proposing a RWT - and thus will not be initiating NSAID
        therapy - it would not be appropriate to continue NSAIDs (even when prescribed) in
        high-risk patients. The investigators acknowledge that these exclusion criteria limit
        generalizability, but the investigators feel justified to ensure subjects' safety.***

          -  Previous hyaluronic acid knee injections (within 6 months) or corticosteroid knee
             injections (within 3 months).

          -  Scheduled knee hyaluronic acid or corticosteroid injections, arthroscopy, or knee
             surgery.

          -  Co-morbid conditions that include the following: known other causes of arthritis
             (infectious arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue disease, or psoriatic
             arthritis), gout or pseudogout attack within the last 12 months, peripheral neuropathy
             or cardiopulmonary disease that limits walking more than knee pain, bone metastases or
             Paget's disease involving the lower extremities, and history of drug or alcohol abuse
             within the past 2 years, bilateral knee replacements or knee pain in the replaced knee
             only.

          -  Current involvement in litigation or receiving workmen's compensation.

          -  Hearing, cognitive impairment or mental illness, as determined by chart review that
             would preclude participation in a CBT program.

          -  For Women of Childbearing Age: Must not currently be pregnant, agree to avoid getting
             pregnant during the course of the study and should inform the study team if pregnancy
             occurs at any time during study participation.

          -  Previous meloxicam use discontinued due to lack of effective symptom relief

          -  Contraindications to prolonged NSAID use, per PI discretion.

        <title>Primary Endpoint: WOMAC Pain Score (Likert Scale Version) at 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>The WOMAC pain score has a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain and higher scores indicate worse pain. The WOMAC pain scale consists of 5 questions that ask about pain during walking, stair use, lying in bed at night, sitting, and standing. Each question is scored on a 5-point scale, where 0 = None, 1 = Mild pain, 2 = Moderate pain, 3 = Severe pain, and 4 = Very severe pain. Total pain scores range from 0 to 20 with higher scores reflecting worse pain. The WOMAC also includes a lower extremity disability scale. Both the pain scale and disability scale (17 items) can be analyzed separately.</description>
        <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The WOMAC pain score was available for 84% (152/180) of participants in the placebo group and 92% (169/184) of participants in the meloxicam group four weeks post-randomization.</population>

        <description>The AUC is a commonly used measure that combines multiple measurements over a specific time interval into a single index. The AUC provides a single score that quantifies each participant's total WOMAC score across the repeated measurements. The AUC is valid regardless of increases or decreases in reported pain over time. In this case, the possible range is 0-20, with higher scores indicating worse pain.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse event data were collected through study completion, an average of 14 weeks. After 2-week run-in period where all subjects replaced their current NSAID with the study drug (meloxicam 15mg per day), remaining eligible subjects participated in 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority randomized withdrawal trial (RWT). After 4 weeks, subjects in the meloxicam arm continued study drug. Subjects in the placebo arm stopped the placebo and participated in a 10-week CBT program.</time_frame>
      <desc>All related adverse events were identified by study coordinator or study therapist during the time when subject participates in the study. Any serious adverse events and unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects and others were reported immediately to the study PI and within 24 hrs to the VA Central Institutional Review Board (IRB). The reporting processes, as listed in the VA Central IRB Table of Reporting Requirements, was followed.</desc>
