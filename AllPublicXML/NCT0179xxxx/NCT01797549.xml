  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop a test to assess frontal lobe function using a rapid,
      inexpensive, objective, and standardized method, without the need for expertise in cognitive
      test administration. Such methods would be particularly helpful in traumatic brain injury
      (TBI), where objective measures are needed, and would greatly expand the capacity to make
      such assessments in clinical practice and research.

        Males and females (military health care beneficiaries and non military health care

        traumatic brain injury as well as age, gender, education matched non-TBI volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to read, write, speak and understand English

          -  history of having sustained a TBI prior to enrollment. Evidence will be any one of the
             following 3 criteria:

               1. GCS 3 - 12

               2. Post-traumatic amnesia &gt; 24 hours

               3. TBI-related abnormality on neuroimaging (either CT or MRI). (Some missing
                  information about the initial injury (i.e. documentation of initial GCS) is not
                  necessarily exclusionary if the bulk of the available history is indicative that
                  the patient suffered a TBI and meets the inclusion criteria)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple sclerosis, pre- or co-existing

          -  Stroke (other than stroke at the time of TBI)

          -  Pre-existing developmental disorder

          -  Pre-existing epilepsy

          -  Pre-existing major depressive disorder

          -  Pre-existing schizophrenia
