  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, blinded, and controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of UVA1
      phototherapy in the treatment of active morphea in adults and children. Forty patients will
      be randomized to receive either medium dose (70 J/cm2) phototherapy (active UVA1
      phototherapy) with an ultraviolet translucent acrylic screen or &quot;sham&quot; UVA1 (0 J/cm2)
      phototherapy with an ultraviolet opaque acrylic screen 3 times per week for 10 weeks. The
      phototherapists, patients, and principal investigator will be blinded to whether the patients
      receive active or sham UVA1 phototherapy. Patients will only be allowed to apply emollients
      during the study.

      Patients completing the randomized placebo controlled trial (RPCT) will be followed during an
      open observation period for 3 months. During the open phase, all outcome measures from the
      RPCT (LoSSI, PGA-A) will be assessed every 5 weeks as well as adverse events. Patients who
      received sham UVA1 phototherapy will be invited to receive active UVA1 phototherapy using the
      same protocol as in the RPCT during the open observation. Adult patients enrolled in the RPCT
      will also be part of a nested translational study investigating the effect of UVA1
      phototherapy on gene expression from whole skin biopsies taken before (Study Visit 1) and
      after UVA1 phototherapy (Study Visit 3). Gene expression profiles will be compared in
      lesional skin before and after treatment as well as nonlesional skin.

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Forty patients will be randomized to receive either active (n=20) or sham (n=20) medium dose UVA1 phototherapy three times a week for 10 weeks followed by a 3 month open follow up. The primary outcome measure is mean change in Localized Scleroderma Severity Index (LoSSI), a validated clinical score of morphea activity, from baseline versus after 30 treatments.</description>

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PGA-A has been validated for content validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change. This will serve as a secondary outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To use gene expression profiling to characterize pathways and mechanisms that are involved in the therapeutic effect of UVA1 phototherapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The molecular mechanisms underlying the efficacy of UVA1 phototherapy in morphea are incompletely understood. To identify UVA1-induced molecular pathways that may account for its efficacy, we will perform gene expression profiling using RNA derived from affected and nonlesional whole skin from patients with morphea before and after UVA1 phototherapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of at least one active morphea lesion (linear, plaque, generalized, or mixed
             subtypes) confirmed by the primary investigator and/or by histopathological
             examination. Morphea lesions are clinically distinctive and therefore biopsy will only
             be performed if the diagnosis is in doubt.

          -  Age &gt; 6 years at enrollment

          -  Male or female

          -  Patient or legal guardian must be able to speak and read English or Spanish at a 6th
             grade reading level. A translator will be available with additional consent forms in
             Spanish.

          -  Both male and female patients will be eligible

          -  All races and ethnic backgrounds will be included

          -  Ability to give informed consent: Patients must be able to give informed consent or
             they will give assent with parent or guardian consent as a minor to be a part of the
             study (if &gt; 10 -17 years).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 6 years at enrollment. (Patients under the age of 6 years will be excluded
             because study participants must be able to comply with the use of protective goggles
             and lie still during UVA1 phototherapy.)

          -  Presence of morphea profunda or eosinophilic fasciitis

          -  Contraindication to UVA1 phototherapy, including personal history of melanoma or
             non-melanoma skin cancer, history of photosensitive disorders (systemic lupus
             erythematosus, porphyrias, polymorphic light eruption, xeroderma pigmentosum, and the
             like), history of any type of organ transplant (solid organ or bone marrow).

          -  Current or &lt;2 months prior use of systemic immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate,
             prednisone mycophenolate mofetil, etc) or UVA1 phototherapy &lt;2 months prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Prior failed UVA1 phototherapy (defined as requiring initiation of systemic therapy
             during or within 1 month of completion of prior course of UVA1 phototherapy).

          -  Presence of the following related to diagnosis of morphea: systemic manifestations
             (arthritis, uveitis, CNS changes, and the like), limited range of motion, contracture,
             limb length discrepancy requiring oral systemic therapy.
