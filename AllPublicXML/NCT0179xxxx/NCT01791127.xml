      <desc>According to the study protocol, sites were required to report all patient deaths and all adverse events that were considered related to the implant procedure, implanted pulse generator, or implanted leads. Adverse events determined to be not related to the implant procedure, implanted pulse generator, or implanted leads were not collected.
Reported adverse events were defined as a serious or 'other' adverse event according to the clinicaltrials.gov definition.</desc>
