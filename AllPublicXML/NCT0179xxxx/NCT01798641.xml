  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of our study is to verify the effectiveness of the shunt and to identify the most
      sensitive criteria to select patients for surgery. The study is designed to assess
      improvement in walking and balance (gait), urinary function and memory after shunting. In
      addition, the study aims to identify the most accurate and sensitive tools to measure
      improvement for our patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) causes memory loss, walking, and urinary difficulties. If
      NPH goes unidentified and untreated it can cause severe disability. The cause of this disease
      is poorly understood. It may involve damage caused by impaired blood flow in the brain.

      The standard methods by which we diagnose patients who have symptoms of NPH are less accurate
      than desired. Many times patients remain undiagnosed or untreated while others receive
      treatment due to a false-positive diagnosis.

      To treat NPH, a small tube called a 'shunt' can be surgically placed in the brain to drain
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and help relieve symptoms. Currently, the reported response rates
      to shunting vary from 31% to 89%. Follow-up studies have shown that the shunts may not work
      long-term. This could be due to the natural history of the disease, development of other
      diseases, or due to a short term 'placebo effect' following the shunt placement surgery.

      Our group is doing a study of patients with NPH. All participants in this study will have a
      shunt placed. These shunts are programmable and, once placed, may be opened or closed by the
      doctor. Programming the shunt does not require an additional surgical procedure. All study
      participants will be divided into two groups. One group will have their shunts open and
      draining. The other group will have their shunts closed (not draining). After 6 weeks, the
      groups will be switched. Those with open shunts will have them closed, and the group with
      closed, non-draining shunts, will have theirs opened. Participants will not know if their
      shunts are open (draining) or if they are closed (not draining). Study participants will be
      followed for two years. Any participants who develop recurrent, new or worsening symptoms
      will be taken off study and treated according to good medical practice.

      The purpose of this study is to (a) look for symptom improvement in response to the draining
      shunt compared to the non-draining shunt (placebo affect), (b) find 'predictors' that will
      help doctors identify patients who will respond well to shunt placement, (c) monitor the
      long-term effects of these shunts, and (d) assess current diagnostic testing to see which
      methods are most accurate.

    <measure>Tinetti Score on Open Shunt vs. Closed Shunt</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinetti tool test measures walking and balance. It is designed to determine an elders risk for falls within the next year. It takes about 8-10 minutes to complete. The patient is asked to complete the gait portion first with the evaluator walking close behind the elder and evaluating gait steppage and drift. The patient is then asked to complete the balance portion with the evaluator again standing close by the patient (towards the right and in front). The patient is then asked to sit and the score is then totaled.The higher the score, the better the performance. Scoring is done on a three point scale with a range on each item of 0-2 with 0 representing the most impairment. Individual scores are then combined to form three scales: a Gait Scale, a Balance Scale and then and overall Gait and Balance score. The maximum score for gait is 12 points while the maximum for Balance is 16 points with a total maximum for the overall score of 28 points.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG) Score on Open Shunt vs. Closed Shunt</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG evaluation measures walking and balance. The patient is timed while they rise from an arm chair (approximate seat height 46 cm), walk at a comfortable and safe pace to a line on the floor three meters away, turn and walk back to the chair and sit down again. The patient walks through the test once before being timed to become familiar with the test. The subject wears his regular footwear and uses a walking aid (cane or walker) if necessary. A faster time indicates a better functional performance and a score of ≥13.5 seconds is used as a cut-point to identify those at increased risk of falls.</description>

    <measure>Medical College of Virginia (MCV) Gait Grade on Open Shunt vs. Closed Shunt</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MCV gait grade evaluation measures balance and walking. The score ranges from 1 to 6 with higher values suggesting worse gait performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Kiefer Score on Open Shunt vs. Closed Shunt</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Kiefer is a modified clinical grading tool that measures the severity of the three key symptoms (mental deficits, gait disturbance, incontinence) and two additional minor symptoms (headache and dizziness). The overall score may reach values between 0 and 24, with higher scores indicating more severe impairment</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Kubo Score on Open Shunt vs. Closed Shunt</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Kubo tool measures your symptoms in three categories: cognitive (attention and memory), gait/balance and urinary function.The score ranges from 0 to 24 with higher scores indicating worse symptoms</description>

        <title>Tinetti Score on Open Shunt vs. Closed Shunt</title>
        <description>The Tinetti tool test measures walking and balance. It is designed to determine an elders risk for falls within the next year. It takes about 8-10 minutes to complete. The patient is asked to complete the gait portion first with the evaluator walking close behind the elder and evaluating gait steppage and drift. The patient is then asked to complete the balance portion with the evaluator again standing close by the patient (towards the right and in front). The patient is then asked to sit and the score is then totaled.The higher the score, the better the performance. Scoring is done on a three point scale with a range on each item of 0-2 with 0 representing the most impairment. Individual scores are then combined to form three scales: a Gait Scale, a Balance Scale and then and overall Gait and Balance score. The maximum score for gait is 12 points while the maximum for Balance is 16 points with a total maximum for the overall score of 28 points.</description>

        <title>Timed Up and Go (TUG) Score on Open Shunt vs. Closed Shunt</title>
        <description>The TUG evaluation measures walking and balance. The patient is timed while they rise from an arm chair (approximate seat height 46 cm), walk at a comfortable and safe pace to a line on the floor three meters away, turn and walk back to the chair and sit down again. The patient walks through the test once before being timed to become familiar with the test. The subject wears his regular footwear and uses a walking aid (cane or walker) if necessary. A faster time indicates a better functional performance and a score of ≥13.5 seconds is used as a cut-point to identify those at increased risk of falls.</description>
