  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercise has been identified as a major item of many chronic diseases and cancer
      rehabilitation. It contributes to an improvement in the quality of life and to a decrease in
      the current treatment side effects and mortality. Cancer in association with treatment
      toxicity and an inactive lifestyle lead to a fall in physical capability and causes problems
      in daily activities. The physical capacity and the tolerance for exercise fall simultaneously
      leading to a deconditioning vicious circle which increases physical, psychological and
      emotional symptoms of fatigue. Therefore, physical activity for health is a valid and
      relevant way to improve quality of life and to manage cancer patient fatigue. The aim of the
      study is the assessment of the effects of a physical activity retraining program on aerobic
      capacity, strength and fatigue, in a breast cancer population treated by adjuvant or
      n√©oadjuvant chemotherapy.
