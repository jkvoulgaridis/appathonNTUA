  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate safety, tolerability and effects on central diastolic blood pressure
      (cDBP) of MK-8892 given as single oral doses in healthy male participants (Panel A and B) and
      in male participants with mild-to-moderate hypertension (Panel C).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to three planned panels of either 8 healthy participants (Panels A and B) or 8
      participants with mild to moderate hypertension (Panel C) will be enrolled. In Panels A and
      B, 8 participants will alternately receive single rising doses of MK-8892 or placebo. All
      doses will be administered in the fasted state, except Panel A, Period 5 in which a standard
      high-fat breakfast provided approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing.

      Panel A will begin first. At least 3 days will elapse before participants in the alternate
      panel (Panel B) will receive the next higher dose. In Panel C, 8 mild to moderate
      hypertensive male participants will receive single rising doses of MK-8892 or placebo. Panel
      C may begin after the first 4 periods of Panels A and B have completed dosing. For all
      panels, there will be at least 7 days washout between treatment periods for any given
      participant. Participants may only be enrolled in one panel of the study. Subsequent doses in
      any panel will be administered only after careful evaluation of safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacodynamic effects of a given dose. All participants in periods of all panels (with
      exception of 2.0 mg fasted/fed periods) will be randomly assigned to either study drug or
      placebo, i.e a participant could be assigned to receive study drug in one period and placebo
      in another. As per the protocol allocation plan, the same participants will receive 2.0 mg
      MK-8892 in a fasted and fed state.The 2.0 mg MK-8892 fed/fasted data will be utilized for
      pharmacokinetic comparison and only the 2.0 mg MK-8892 fasted data will utilized for the
      analysis of the pharmacodynamics endpoints.

      In addition, during any of the treatment periods if a participant demonstrates change in any
      one of the protocol-defined parameters lasting ≥1 hour, dose escalation in that participant
      will be halted and the participant may be withdrawn from the study or rechallenged at same
      dose or at a lower dose. Paricipants that meet criteria listed will be followed up until
      parameters no longer meet stopping rule criteria.

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, regardless of whether or not it was considered related to the medicinal product. The percentage of participants that reported at least 1 AE was summarized. Adverse events were summarized by dose taken at the time of the event.</description>

    <description>Central diastolic blood pressure measurements were obtained at predose and at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours postdose via applanation tonometry of the radial artery. The average central diastolic blood pressure over the 24-hour monitoring period was calculated for each dose of each panel by adjusting each time-point by the baseline, aggregating the area under the curve (AUC) by the trapezoidal method and then dividing the AUC by 24 hours. A negative number indicates a decrease.</description>

        <title>Change in 24-hour Time-weighted Average (TWA0-24hr) for Central Diastolic Blood Pressure (cDBP)- Healthy Participants</title>
        <description>Central diastolic blood pressure measurements were obtained at predose and at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours postdose via applanation tonometry of the radial artery. The average central diastolic blood pressure over the 24-hour monitoring period was calculated for each dose of each panel by adjusting each time-point by the baseline, aggregating the area under the curve (AUC) by the trapezoidal method and then dividing the AUC by 24 hours. A negative number indicates a decrease.</description>

        <description>Central diastolic blood pressure measurements were obtained at predose and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours postdose via applanation tonometry of the radial artery. The average central diastolic blood pressure over the 24-hour monitoring period was calculated for each dose of each panel by adjusting each time-point by the baseline, aggregating the area under the curve (AUC) by the trapezoidal method and then dividing the AUC by 24 hours. A negative number indicates a decrease.</description>

          <description>Peripheral diastolic blood pressure was measured using a validated automatic measuring device. The time-weighted average change from baseline was calculated by adjusting each time-point by the baseline, aggregating the area under the curve (AUC) by the trapezoidal method and then dividing the AUC by 24 hours. A negative number indicates a decrease.</description>

        <title>Change in TWA0-24hr for Augmentation Index (AIx) - Healthy Participants</title>
        <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. The time-weighted average change from baseline was calculated by adjusting each time-point by the baseline, aggregating the area under the curve (AUC) by the trapezoidal method and then dividing the AUC by 24 hours.</description>

        <title>Change in TWA0-24hrs for Peripheral Diastolic Blood Pressure (pDBP) - Hypertensive Participants</title>
        <description>Peripheral blood pressure assessments were obtained at predose and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours postdose by using a validated automatic measuring device. Peripheral diastolic blood pressure was measured a validated automatic measuring device. The time-weighted average change from baseline was calculated by adjusting each time-point by the baseline, aggregating the area under the curve (AUC) by the trapezoidal method and then dividing the AUC by 24 hours. Negative number indicates a decrease.</description>

        <title>TWA0-24hr for Augmentation Index (AIx) - Hypertensive Participants</title>
        <description>AIx was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery. The central pressure waveform was determined from the peripheral pressure waveform by a transfer function. Augmentation index is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. The time-weighted average change from baseline was calculated by adjusting each time-point by the baseline, aggregating the area under the curve (AUC) by the trapezoidal method and then dividing the AUC by 24 hours. Negative number indicates a decrease.</description>

A mixed effects model with Cohort (Healthy or hypertensive) as a fixed term, participant as a random effect was used for summary data.
