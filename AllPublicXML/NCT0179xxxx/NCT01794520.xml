    <textblock>
      The phase 1 primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety profile, characterize
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and determine the dosing schedule, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and
      recommended phase 2 dose (RPTD) of ABT-199 (venetoclax) when administered in subjects with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This study will also assess the safety profile and
      PK of venetoclax in combination with dexamethasone in subjects with t(11;14)-positive
      multiple myeloma.

      The phase 2 primary objective is to further evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) and
      very good partial response or better rate (VGPR+) in subjects with t(11;14)-positive multiple
      myeloma.

             assay per the central laboratory testing (enrollment with local t(11;14)-positive FISH
             results only will be considered at the discretion of the TA MD) Subjects must have
             evidence of disease progression on or within 60 days of last dose of most recent
             previous treatment based on IMWG criteria AND Subject must have previously received at
             least 2 lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomide or

          -  Subjects with a history of autologous or allogenic stem cell transplantation must have
             adequate peripheral blood counts independent of any growth factor support, and have
             recovered from any transplant related toxicity(s) and be at least 100 days
             post-autologous transplant prior to first dose of study drug or at least 6 months
             post-allogenic transplant prior to first dose of study drug and not have active
             graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), i.e., requiring treatment.

          -  Meet the following laboratory parameters, per the reference range, at least once
             during the screening period: ANC of at least 1000/μL (Subjects may use growth factor
             support to achieve ANC eligibility criteria), AST and ALT not higher than 3 x ULN,
             Calculated creatinine clearance of at least 30 mL/min using a modified Cockcroft-Gault
             calculation, platelet count of at least 30,000 mm³ (independent of transfusion for 2
             weeks), hemoglobin of at least 8.0 g/dL (subjects may receive blood transfusion to
             achieve hemoglobin eligibility criteria), and total bilirubin not higher than 1.5 x

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exhibits evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s),

             drug.

          -  Cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class greater than or
             equal to 3.

             immunologic, cardiovascular or hepatic disease, within the last 6 months that, in the

             study.

          -  History of other active malignancies other than multiple myeloma within the past 3
             years prior to study entry, with the following exceptions: adequately treated in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix uteri, basal cell carcinoma of the skin or localized squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin, localized prostate cancer Gleason grade 6 or lower AND
             with stable prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels off treatment, previous malignancy
             confined and surgically resected (or treated with other modalities) with curative
             intent.
