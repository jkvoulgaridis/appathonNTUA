      Hypothesis This study is designed as an integral part of the development of a new CE score
      for Crohn's disease.

      The SB (small bowel) CD (Crohn's Disease)Niv score (CECDAI) is an established and validated
      CD score for SB involvement. In order to expand this score to the colon, this study will aim
      to develop the colonic score and later on will be combined with the already established SB
      score in order to achieve a full CE gut score for Crohn's disease Proposed Design This is a
      retrospective study in which up to 30 videos of colon Crohn's disease subjects who have
      undergone the Colon 2 CE procedure will be evaluated.

      These cases will have evidence of large and / or small bowel Crohn's disease The chosen
      videos will be marked for CD lesions by the site The de-identified marked videos will be
      scored by 4 independent experienced endoscopists, blinded to the results of the standard
      workup procedures, according to the colonic and CECDAIic new scores
