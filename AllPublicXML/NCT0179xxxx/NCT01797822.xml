  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether, in people with dry eye syndrome, over the
      counter artificial tears and the prescription eye drop, dexamethasone, change or effect the
      eyes response to a low humidity environment.

      It is known that irritation from dry eye can be improved by over the counter artificial tears
      because they wet and lubricate the eyes. The prescription eye drop, dexamethasone, can also
      improve eye irritation by decreasing the inflammation that develops in dry eye. Thus, the
      investigators hypothesize that the use of these conventional dry eye treatments will improve
      the eyes' response to a low humidity environment.

      This study evaluated the effects of the corticosteroid dexamethasone on suppressing
      development of eye irritation, cornea epithelial disease and increased production of
      inflammatory mediators in subjects who were subjected to an experimental low humidity drafty
      environment.

    <time_frame>Two weeks after treatment and exposure to a low humidity environment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be treated with preservative-free artificial tears for 2 weeks then exposed to a low humidity environment for 90 minutes, then treated with preservative-free dexamethasone 0.1% for 2 weeks and exposed to a low humidity environment again. The change in corneal fluorescein staining before and after the low humidity exposure was measured after each treatment. Fluorescein staining was graded using the CCLR scale (0-100) in 5 zones on the cornea for a maximum score of 500 (range 0-500). A lower change in staining indicates less severe disease in response to the low humidity stress. Negative number indicates staining after exposure was lower than pre.</description>

The change in corneal fluorescein staining before and after the low humidity exposure was measured after each treatment. Fluorescein staining was graded using the CCLR scale (0-100) in 5 zones on the cornea for a maximum score of 500 (range 0-500). A lower change in staining indicates less severe disease in response to the low humidity stress. Negative number indicates staining after exposure was lower than pre.</description>
