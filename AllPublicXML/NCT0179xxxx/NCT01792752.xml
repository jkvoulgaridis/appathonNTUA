    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to implement and evaluate a community-level, structured
      approach to enhance HIV care access and retention for drug users in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
      The &quot;Enhanced HIV Care Access and Retention Intervention&quot; will: 1) identify drug users living
      with HIV who either do not know their HIV status and/or are not engaged in HIV care; 2)
      provide direct HIV care services through a mobile health van; and 3) support identified
      HIV-infected drug users with patient navigators to enhance their ability to engage in HIV
      care and substance abuse treatment, to initiate antiretroviral therapy, and maintain
      adherence to their treatment regimens. The structural enhanced care approach will be
      evaluated through a randomized roll-out design, a refinement of the stepped-wedge design. The
      community-level success of the intervention will be assessed by evaluating virologic
      suppression (primary biological outcome), increased attendance to HIV care visits, uptake of
      antiretroviral therapy, adherence to HIV treatment regimens, and decreased substance use (as
      secondary behavioral outcomes) in an independent cohort of HIV-positive individuals drawn
      from each of the neighborhoods included in the intervention. The investigators will also
      evaluate the implementation process and cost of the enhanced care approach including
      implications for cost-effectiveness, feasibility of expansion, and sustainability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent scientific advances demonstrate that for people living with HIV, antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) is the most effective strategy to improve immune function, reduce morbidity,
      improve quality of life, prolong survival, and prevent HIV transmission. Translating this
      knowledge into practice, however, requires prompt diagnosis and linkage to care, entry into
      care with timely ART initiation, and engagement in care, support for ART adherence, and
      retention to promote durable viral suppression. Addressing failures in this cascade of care,
      often referred to as the &quot;Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain (STTR)&quot; paradigm, has become a major
      part of the National HIV/AIDS strategy in the United States. To date, much of the research
      and discussion surrounding this strategy has focused on expanding HIV testing to improve the
      early identification of new cases. There has been less attention focused on linkage to,
      engagement in, and retention in care. Specifically, little attention has focused on
      identifying HIV-positive individuals who, despite being aware of their diagnosis, have never
      been in HIV care, are intermittent users of care, or have dropped out of care.

      HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) are a particularly difficult subpopulation to link
      to and retain in HIV care. They face a myriad of challenges that can impede retention in care
      including substance use disorders (both alcohol and drugs), mental health problems and
      poverty-related issues such as unstable housing and food insecurity. If IDUs adhere to their
      treatment regimens, however, studies have demonstrated they realize similar survival benefits
      from antiretroviral therapy as persons without a history of injection drug use. In contrast
      to the majority of communities in the U.S., in Puerto Rico, drug use, particularly injection
      drug use, continues to fuel a fast-growing HIV epidemic. Puerto Rico has an estimated
      incidence rate of 45 HIV cases per 100,000 population, twice the rate for the 50 U.S. states,
      and almost 40% of new infections are associated with injection drug use. In contrast, only
      12% of new infections in the 50 U.S. states are among IDUs.

      The overall goal of this project is to implement and evaluate a community-level, structured
      enhanced approach, the Enhanced HIV Care Access and Retention Intervention, for substance
      users in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It will bring HIV care directly to five San Juan zones in
      which a high proportion of HIV-infected substance users reside. The significance of the study
      is threefold.f care, or have dropped out of care.

In addition to these intervention components, study participants will receive screening and access to treatment for other physical and mental co-morbidities, general primary health care, and social/psychosocial services addressing unstable housing, food insecurity, interpersonal violence, legal issues. All HIV-positive IDUs identified either through the HIV Testing Campaign or the Treatment Re-engagement Campaign will be enrolled in the HIV Care Cohort. The HIV Care Cohort will be comprised of the HIV-positive injectors who are receiving direct services in the Mobile Care Clinic. The 4 intervention components are detailed below:</description>

    <description>When the intervention is initiated in a neighborhood, HIV rapid testing will begin and continue in a particular neighborhood from the time that the neighborhood's intervention begins until the end of the study period. Anyone testing HIV positive will be seen and counseled by a member of the Patient Navigator Team.</description>

    <description>Simultaneously with the introduction of the HIV Testing Campaign, a patient navigator team will approach HIV-positive IDUs identified as not having seen their HIV care provider in the last 6 months. In addition, known HIV-positive IDUs within the designated neighborhoods will be approached for service enrollment and meet with a patient navigator.</description>

    <description>The patient navigator team will provide informational support to the HIV-positive injectors, motivate them to attend HIV care visits and engage in substance abuse treatment, encourage their use of and adherence to antiretroviral therapies, and work with them to overcome any barriers to attendance at HIV care visits and substance abuse treatment. All clients of the patient navigator will become part of the HIV Care Cohort; they will have been identified either in the HIV Testing Campaign or the Treatment Re-Engagement Campaign.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mobile Care Clinic</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants who choose to receive services in the study mobile HIV care clinic will receive an initial appointment and the patient navigator will ensure that the client attends it. At the initial visit, clients will have a medical history taken, be examined and have blood drawn to measure CD4 and viral load. The mobile care clinic doctor will also prescribe medications for the client at the subsequent visit which will be scheduled as soon as lab results are available and interpreted, approximately one week later. The mobile HIV care clinic van will provide health services to the general IDU population within each intervention neighborhood to avoid any stigmatization of the HIV positive clients.</description>
