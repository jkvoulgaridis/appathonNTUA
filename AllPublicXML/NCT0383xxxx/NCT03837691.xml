      This is a single-center, open-label, pilot study evaluating a treatment for obesity. The
      intent is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of a new Snowshoe suture placement
      pattern, Pose 2 (sutures placed in the mid + distal body without fundus), with a moderate
      intensity diet and exercise program. The procedure will be performed using the g-Cath EZ
      Delivery Catheter with Snowshoe Suture Anchors (AKA g-Cath or g-Cath EZ) and associated
      devices (g-Prox EZ, g-Lix and Transport), known collectively as the Incisionless Operating
      Platform (IOP). Efficacy will be evaluated based on changes in weight loss through 12 months.
      Adverse events will be recorded throughout the duration of the study.
