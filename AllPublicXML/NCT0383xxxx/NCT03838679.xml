  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The content of this research project is to identify the angiofibrotic switch, the transition
      from angiogenesis to fibrosis, in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD)
      longitudinally. Despite optimal treatment about 50% of eyes with nAMD develop fibrosis within
      2 years, causing irreversible damage to the retina and functional loss. Objective measurement
      of fibrosis, however, is challenging, since clinical staging is subjective and current
      imaging modalities such as color fundus photography (CFP), fluorescein angiography (FA) and
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) often do not allow clear delineation. Novel imaging
      modalities such as polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA) and
      adaptive-optics OCT (AO-OCT) offer identification of fibrous components and microvasculature
      of fibrotic lesions non-invasively with highest precision and shall thus be used in this
      study.

      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize to detect and quantify subclinical (i.e. not
      detectable on dilated fundus examination) areas of fibrosis using PS-OCT and determine the
      rate and exact location within the neovascular lesion. Furthermore, the investigators expect
      neuroretinal and microvascular changes, which will be assessed by AO-OCT and OCTA.

      Methods: Eighty eyes of 80 patients with chronic nAMD will be included and examined cross-
      sectionally to evaluate the accuracy of PS-OCT to detect and quantify fibrosis in comparison
      to gold standard imaging modalities. In addition, OCTA and AO-OCT will be performed to
      analyze the relationship between fibrous, neovascular and neuroretinal structures.
      Furthermore, forty eyes of 40 participants with treatment-naïve nAMD will be included and
      followed over 12 months with predefined follow-up intervals. Novel non-invasive imaging will
      be applied to objectively determine the exact time and extent of the angiofibrotic switch in
      nAMD during state-of-the- art therapy. This approach has not been done before and is
      clinically relevant for multiple reasons: Firstly, only little is known about the development
      of fibrosis in AMD during therapy. Secondly, the clinical diagnosis of subretinal fibrosis is
      subjective and does not allow reliable quantification. Thirdly, current gold standard imaging
      modalities (i.e. CFP and FA) for detection of fibrosis involve invasive and time-consuming
      procedures and do not allow three-dimensional analysis. Finally, our study may identify
      objective endpoints for future interventional trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research questions/hypotheses: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of
      legal blindness among elderly patients in industrialized countries. The main reason for
      severe and irreversible visual impairment among these patients is subretinal fibrosis (SF).
      Large-scale interventional trials (e.g. CATT) have shown that half of all eyes affected by
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV) develop clinically visible fibrotic scarring over two
      years despite optimal treatment, causing irreversible retinal damage and functional loss.
      Thus, prevention of fibrosis in AMD is currently the focus of researchers worldwide. Clearly
      defined end points for interventional trials, however, are lacking because detection and
      quantification of SF is challenging. Clinical staging of SF is subjective and current gold
      standard imaging modalities such as color fundus photography (CFP), fluorescein angiography
      (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), even in concert, do not allow a distinct and
      early delineation of SF. Novel imaging modalities such as polarization-sensitive OCT
      (PS-OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA) and adaptive optics (AO)-OCT are promising means to
      objectively detect SF and provide detailed insights into the biology of the microvascular and
      neurosensory compartments. Our group recently demonstrated that PS-OCT offers automated
      identification and quantification of SF in AMD based on tissue-specific contrast. Aim of the
      proposed research project is to detect and characterize the angiofibrotic switch, i.e. the
      transition from active and reversible neovascularization to irreversible fibrosis, in
      neovascular AMD under anti-VEGF treatment. We hypothesize to detect the initiating events of
      fibrotic conversion including even subclinical stages of fibrosis by non-invasive PS-OCT and
      identify the association with fibrovascular and retinal changes by OCTA and AO-OCT,
      respectively.

      Scientific/scholarly innovation/originality of the project: The combination of PS-OCT, OCTA
      and AO-OCTA to non-invasively detect pathognomonic features of fibrovascular conversion is a
      novel and unprecedented approach towards objective visualization and quantification of
      disease pathomechanisms. Outcomes of this study may provide clearly defined morphological
      endpoints for future interventional trials.

      Methods: Eighty eyes of 80 patients with chronic nAMD will be included and examined
      cross-sectionally to evaluate the accuracy of PS-OCT to detect and quantify fibrosis in
      comparison to gold standard imaging. In addition, OCTA and AO-OCT will be performed to
      analyze the relationship between fibrous, vascular and retinal structures. Furthermore, forty
      eyes of 40 participants with treatment-naïve nAMD will be included in a prospective study and
      followed for one year under treatment. PS-OCT, AO-OCT and OCTA imaging will be performed
      according to a standardized protocol at predefined visits. Gold standard imaging will be
      performed for validation.

    <description>The primary objective is to determine how well the fibrosis present/not present classification of the novel PS-OCT imaging works compared to gold standard imaging techniques. To assess the primary objective, a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of correct fibrosis yes/no classifications by the novel PS-OCT imaging compared to the gold standard will be computed. To assess this objective, data from cohort 1 will be used.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective is to determine how well the fibrosis area detection of the novel PS-OCT imaging works compared to gold standard imaging techniques. To assess the secondary objective, a Bland-Altman plot will be drawn. Furthermore, a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in detected area and the mean absolute difference in detected area will be computed. To assess this objective, two analysis sets will be used: Firstly, data from cohort 1 and baseline data of cohort 2, and secondly data from the 1 year follow-up examination of patients in cohort 2.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of fibrosis and co-localized vascular changes (comparison between OCTA and PS-OCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>In cohort 1 (eyes with a minimum history of 12 months of anti- VEGF), we will compare imaging data assessed by PS-OCT with image data from OCTA for morphological analyses. In cohort 2 the same analyses will be performed. Cohort 2 will provide detailed follow-up information about morphological changes over time. Outcome measures in eyes with and without fibrosis (vessel configuration in OCTA) will be compared using chi-square tests (categorical variables), t-tests (metric variables that can be assumed to be normally distributed) and Wilcoxon tests (metric variables that cannot be assumed to be normally distributed). ANOVA and paired t-tests will be used to investigate the longitudinal changes in cohort 2. P values &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Due to the exploratory nature of these analyses, no correction for multiplicity will be used.</description>
