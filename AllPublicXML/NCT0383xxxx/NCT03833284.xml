  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm Birth is the number one cause of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide and
      represents an important health disparity in the United States, particularly across the state
      of Kentucky. The best biomarker for the prediction of preterm birth is transvaginal
      ultrasound (TVU). This study will attempt to identify and rectify provider and patient
      related barriers to TVU screening implementation.

      Preterm birth is the number one cause of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide and
      represents an important health disparity in the United States, and especially across the
      state of Kentucky. The best biomarker for the prediction of preterm birth is transvaginal
      ultrasound (TVU) measurement of cervical length. However, several unique provider and patient
      related barriers for implementation of this screening limit the widespread uptake of this
      evidence based practice in Appalachian KY. The investigators propose to adopt a dissemination
      and implementation science approach using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
      Research (CFIR) as the guiding framework for identification of key areas of knowledge
      deficits as well as attitudes, practices and perceived barriers among prenatal care providers
      and patients in eastern KY towards TVU cervical length screening using a mixed - methods
      design. This will be utilized to develop a multifaceted implementation strategy best suited
      for addressing and overcoming barriers identified by the target population in eastern KY. The
      investigators anticipate that such an implementation strategy will likely include an
      educational component targeting obstetric care providers and patients in addition to hands-on
      TVU cervical length evaluation as well as telemedicine support and surveillance. Three
      community based sites (Hazard, Morehead and Ashland, KY) will be recruited for implementation
      of this multi-component pilot program focused on community engagement and outreach targeting
      obstetric providers and their patients. At the end of the pilot implementation phase,
      acceptability of the study intervention and feasibility of implementation will be evaluated
      along with a preliminary assessment of effectiveness of implementation.

    <description>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in attitudes towards TVU screening among patients and practitioners. This will be accomplished by conducting a qualitative interview with each participant at baseline and again at one year (after completing the CLEAR program workshop). Analysis of these interviews will aid in determining feasibility of implementing a future TVU screening component in Obstetric and Gynecologic care.</description>

    <description>Patients with a history of pre-term birth will be identified through a review of their medical history. Patients will then be asked to complete a survey assessing their knowledge of transvaginal ultrasound screening. Patients will then be asked to attend in-person or online workshops designed to increase patient knowledge of TVU screening guidelines and benefits. Finally, patients will complete exit surveys to determine whether their attitudes and beliefs towards screening have changed over time.</description>

    <description>Obstetric and Gynecologic Providers will be identified based on prior working relationships with the University of Kentucky outreach programs. Chosen providers will be asked to complete a survey assessing their attitudes towards TVU screening. Following completion, providers will be asked to attend either in-person or online workshops designed to increase provider knowledge of TVU screening guidelines and benefits. Finally, providers will complete exit surveys to determine whether their attitudes and beliefs toward screening have changed over time.</description>
