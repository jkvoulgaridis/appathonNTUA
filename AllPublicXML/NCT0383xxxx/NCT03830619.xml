  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of serum exosome noncoding RNA as
      a biomarker for the diagnosis of lung cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional tumor markers for non-invasive diagnosis of Lung cancer (LC) exhibit
      insufficient sensitivity and specificity to facilitate detection of early lung cancer (ELC).
      The investigators aimed to identify ELC-specific exosomal lncRNA biomarkers that are highly
      sensitive and stable for the non-invasive diagnosis of ELC.Hence, in the present study,
      exosomes from the plasma of five healthy individuals and 30 LC patients and from culture
      media of four human bronchial epithelial cells and four cancer cells were isolated. Exosomal
      RNA profiling was performed using RNA sequencing to identify LC specific exosomal lncRNAs.
