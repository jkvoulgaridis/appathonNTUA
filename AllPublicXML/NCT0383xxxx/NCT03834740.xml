  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed trial, patients will be administered ribociclib+everolimus prior to surgical
      resection of their tumor. Recurrent GBM patients will be randomized into one of the three
      time-interval cohorts for the first two dose levels.

      In the lead-in dose escalation study, the first six subjects (lead-in) will receive
      ribociclib 400 mg and everolimus 2.5 mg orally-administered in 5 daily doses with the last
      dose. If one or less patient experiences DLT among the 6 patients, this regimen with
      ribociclib 400 mg and everolimus 2.5mg will be considered safe and we will continue with the
      dose escalation phase of the study up to Level 3.

      Four dose escalation levels:

      Level 0: ribociclib 400mg and everolimus 2.5

      Level 1: ribociclib 600mg and everolimus 2.5mg

      Level 2: ribociclib 600mg and everolimus 5mg

      Level 3: ribociclib 600mg and everolimus 10mg

             contrast-enhancing lesion, with 2 perpendicular measurements of at least 1 cm, as per

             consent

         28. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.]

         29. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unwilling to use highly effective methods of contraception during
             dosing and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the appropriate
                  post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. For female
                  subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
                  for that subject

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception

               -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment

               -  Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a
                  barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction
                  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had
                  surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation
                  at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                  assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential

         30. Sexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking drug
             and for 21 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period.
             A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery
             of the drug via seminal fluid.
