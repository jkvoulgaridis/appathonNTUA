      The study investigates the prevalence and use of mechanical insufflation - exsufflation
      (MI-E) in children with Neuromuscular disorders (NMD) in Norway. The NMD related prevalence
      of MIE use in Norway will be described and possible regional differences regarding use will
      be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular diseases (NMD) in children are severe, possibly life-threatening orphan
      conditions. Respiratory tract infections and lung complications are the main causes of
      increased morbidity and mortality.

      The use of mechanical cough augmentation with insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) is a strategy
      to treat and prevent. Possible major benefits are described, but optimal settings for best
      efficacy and comfort in children are not established.

      The main objective is to determine the prevalence and use of MIE among children with NMD in
      Norway. All children with NMD &lt; 18 years which has received a machine for MI-E will be
      invited to participate in the study.

      The participants will be asked to complete two questionnaires. In addition will information
      from the data card in the MI-E machines give information about use. The information will be
      linked to the National register for Long term mechanical ventilation.

    <description>The DISABKIDS Chronic Generic Module (DCGM‐37) is a questionnaire measuring general health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the level of distress caused by a chronic disease at 3 domains (mental, social and physical) in 6 dimensions: Independence, Emotion, Social inclusion, Social exclusion, Limitation and Treatment. Each item is scored on a five‐point Likert scale which indicates behavior or feelings as 1 = never, 2 = seldom, 3 = quite often, 4 = very often and 5 = always. There is one form to be filled in by children 8 to 18 years of age, and one form by their parents. The sum of scores within each dimension makes up the raw score, which is transformed linearly into a score ranging from 0 to 100. The scores are added and further transformed into a total HRQOL score with a range 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating higher HRQOL.</description>
