  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REBOOT is a randomized trial of a repeated-dose brief intervention to reduce overdose and
      risk behaviors among naloxone recipients with opioid use disorder. It includes an established
      overdose education curriculum within an Informational-Motivation-Behavior (IMB) model. This
      study will test the efficacy of REBOOT vs attention-control.
