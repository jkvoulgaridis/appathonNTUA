  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanics are the largest ethnic group in the US as well as the fastest growing. Yet, despite
      being such a large population group, Hispanics are under-studied and under-represented in
      most studies of health, psychological well-being, and mind-body interventions. For many
      Hispanic immigrants, life in the U.S. carries multiple socio-economic stressors, which places
      them at higher risk for depression and other poor health-related quality of life outcomes.
      Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a group-based training shown to reduce stress
      and improve overall well-being. There is a quality gap about adaptation and implementation of
      MBSR programs in community settings and among Hispanic immigrants. This K23 seeks to adapt
      and test the implementation of an MBSR intervention among under-resourced Hispanic immigrants
      in St. Louis guided by methods and frameworks from the field of dissemination and
      implementation (D&amp;I) science as applied to community settings. Implementation research of
      mindfulness-based interventions among Hispanic immigrant populations is justifiable under
      several conditions, including ineffective clinical engagement with this population, risk or
      resilience factors that are unique to the Hispanic community, and lack of cultural relevance
      of many evidence-based MBIs.

      This career development award will establish Dr. Parra as a clinical translational
      investigator focused on mind-body interventions for Hispanic immigrant populations. This K23
      award will provide her the support needed to develop expertise in 3 areas: (1) Training to
      conduct well designed randomized clinical trials; (2) Dissemination and Implementation (D&amp;I)
      science; and (3) Mindfulness research. To achieve these goals, Dr. Parra has assembled an
      expert multidisciplinary team in clinical research, D&amp;I, and mindfulness. Her primary mentor,
      Dr. Eric Lenze, has extensive experience in conducting randomized clinical trials and
      mentoring junior faculty to become independent investigators. Her secondary mentor, Dr. Ross
      Brownson, is an internationally recognized and leading expert in D&amp;I science. Her scientific
      collaborators and advisors include Dr. Douglas Ziedonis, a leading expert in mindfulness
      clinical research and Dr. Tod Braver, a mindfulness research expert. Dr. Parra will also
      benefit from the expertise of two renowned researchers in D&amp;I science in the areas of
      intervention adaptation (Dr. Ana Baumann) and measuring implementation and feasibility
      outcomes (Dr. Rachel Tabak), as well as the experience from a senior MBSR expert (Dr. Jeannie
      Kloeckner), and an expert on mental health interventions for Hispanic populations (Dr.
      Patricia Cavazos-Rehg). Hispanics are the largest and fastest-growing ethnic group in the US,
      currently representing 14 percent of the population. Despite this, Hispanics are seldom
      represented in research studies and health promoting programs, in part due to a lack of
      cultural appropriateness by researchers and low levels of trust of the research community by
      many Hispanics. Using D&amp;I frameworks and methods, Dr. Parra will adapt a Mindfulness Based
      Stress Reduction intervention (MBSR-A) among under-resourced Hispanic immigrants in St. Louis
      (Aim 1). Dr. Parra will also conduct a pilot feasibility RCT trial among 60 Hispanic
      immigrants (Aim 2) to test and measure implementation outcomes including acceptability,
      appropriateness and feasibility. This research plan leverages existing institutional
      resources at Washington University in St. Louis (WU), including the Healthy Mind Lab from Dr.
      Lenze, Dr. Brownson's D&amp;I center, as well as Dr. Lenze's and Dr. Braver's NIH-funded
      mindfulness research groups. Finally, this training and research will form the basis for an
      R01 application to further study the adoption, implementation and effectiveness of a
      Mindfulness intervention in under-resourced Hispanic immigrant populations.

    <intervention_model_description>We will use a wait-listed design versus a standard parallel group RCT because the wait-listed design allows all participants to (eventually) receive the intervention, and maximizes the overall amount of information obtained. A wait-listed design has been previously used by the primary mentor of this award, Dr. Lenze; successfully increasing recruitment, retention and adherence of the intervention and control groups. This design also allows us to get participant feedback in the whole sample and get preliminary estimates of outcomes, which will be crucial to inform the proposed R01 to be submitted by year 4 of the current award.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>We will use the NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery (NIHTB-EB) for adults. The NIHTB-EB is a computerized assessment of emotions with 17 scales and four theoretically driven subdomains (negative affect, psychological well-being, stress and self-efficacy, and social relationships) with established psychometric properties. The battery takes 20 to 30 minutes to complete, and is self-administered. Each item is assessed on a 5 to 7 point Likert scale (ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;) and scored using item response theory (IRT) that generates a theta score. Spanish versions of the questionnaire are available and have been tested for psychometric properties in Hispanic populations, showing strong reliability and validity.</description>

    <description>The Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) will be used to evaluate quality of consciousness and well-being associated with increased self-awareness.61 The 15-item measure uses a 6-point scale to ask participants how often they experience mindful thinking and awareness, with response options ranging from &quot;1-Almost always&quot; to &quot;6-Almost never.&quot; An average is taken of the 15 responses for a total possible score range from 1 - 6 with higher scores indicating greater mindful awareness. A translated version of this scale has been previously used in Spanish-speaking community settings and tested for psychometric properties showing high levels of reliability and validity.</description>

    <description>Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a group-based intervention developed in 1979 by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn to provide mindfulness training in order to decrease stress and improve overall well-being. MBSR has been shown to be effective for a series of patient outcomes including depression, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, and chronic pain management. MBSR is a structured intervention delivered through an 8-week course of up to 30 participants who meet for 2.5 hours per week.</description>
