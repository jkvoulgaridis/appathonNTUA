  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to determine preliminary activity of the combination treatment with
      nivolumab and entinostat in children and adolescents with high risk
      refractory/relapsed/progressive tumors harboring a high mutational load, high PD-L1 mRNA
      expression or focal MYC(N) amplification and explore activity in biomarker low tumors (low
      mutational load, low PD-L1 mRNA expression and non-MYC(N) amplified).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to adult cancers, most pediatric cancers carry a relatively low mutational burden.
      However, a small fraction of pediatric tumors in the INFORM registry cohort display a higher
      mutational burden. Truly hypermutated tumors, e.g. in the context of rare cancer
      predisposition syndromes, are reported to respond well to immune checkpoint inhibition. In
      addition to hypermutation, increased PD-L1 expression is associated with clinical responses
      to checkpoint inhibition. Increased PD-L1 mRNA expression is observed in a small fraction of
      pediatric patients in the INFORM registry cohort independent from mutational load. We
      hypothesize that pediatric tumors with a high mutational burden and/or high PD-L1 expression
      will respond to checkpoint inhibition.

      HDAC inhibition (HDACi) modifies T-cell regulation and can augment response to checkpoint
      inhibition by reducing the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and creating an
      immunogenic tumor microenvironment including induction of MHCI and neo-antigens. In vitro and
      in vivo models showed enhanced anti-tumor activity of the combination of checkpoint
      inhibition and HDACi compared to either agent alone. This provides a strong rationale to
      combine these drug classes.

      Furthermore, MYC- or NMYC-driven (referred to as MYC(N)) malignancies like very high-risk
      medulloblastomas or very high-risk neuroblastomas still have a dismal outcome. MYC is not
      only reported to upregulate PD-L1 and thereby a possible biomarker for checkpoint inhibition
      but also very compelling recent preclinical data strongly suggests that HDAC inhibitors are
      active against MYC amplified medulloblastoma in vitro and in vivo. In NMYC amplified
      neuroblastoma cell lines similar observations were made in vitro. Taken together, our results
      suggest that MYC(N)-driven tumors depend on HDAC and we hypothesize that MYC(N) status can
      serve as a biomarker for response prediction to a combinatorial treatment of checkpoint
      inhibition and HDAC inhibition.

      Pediatric patients aged 6-21 years with refractory/relapsed/progressive high-risk
      malignancies with a high mutational load (group A), with high PD-L1 mRNA expression (group
      B), with MYC(N) amplification (group C) and with a low mutational load, low PD-L1 mRNA
      expression and no MYC(N) amplification (Biomarker low group D) are eligible for this trial.
      Phase I determines the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of the HDACi
      entinostat and the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab for the age groups 6-11 and 12-21 years,
      respectively. Phase II investigates activity in 4 groups A, B, C, D. The duration of
      treatment is 12 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days), preceded by 1 priming week.

      In addition, a comprehensive accompanying research program investigates PD biomarkers for
      immune checkpoint and HDAC inhibition.

      Clinical trials investigating the combination of nivolumab and entinostat in children have
      not been reported so far.

    <description>A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any AE according to the definitions and exceptions listed below that is related to the administration of the combination of investigational agents occurring during the priming week and first cycle of combination treatment (first 5 weeks) in phase I of the trial.
A study participant will be considered evaluable for a DLT if at least 2 doses of nivolumab and 4 doses of entinostat were administered during the first 5 weeks (5 weeks normally incorporate the priming week and 1 cycle of planned combination treatment). Participants who discontinue treatment or have treatment delays preventing them from receiving the above defined minimal amount of treatment in the first cycle of combination treatment for reasons unrelated to study drug toxicity, are not evaluable for DLT and will be replaced in enrollment (maximum number of replacement subjects will be 3 per dose level).</description>

    <ipd_description>The pseudonymized data will be shared for transparency reasons in the context of publications and after publication with other physicians and scientists (national and international academia) to promote and accelerate research on causes and treatment development of oncological diseases.
Requests for access to pseudonymized patient data for non-INFORM-related scientific purposes will be reviewed by a Data Access Committee consisting of the INFORM Board, and the participating investigators. A positive statement of the respective ethic committee and a signed data protection commitment are requested. Requests should be addressed to the coordinating investigator Prof. Olaf Witt. Results of scientific research based on the INFORM2 NivEnt data may be used for academic teaching, research and scientific publications or presentations at scientific meetings.</ipd_description>
