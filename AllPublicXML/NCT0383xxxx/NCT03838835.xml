      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a 10-week equine facilitated cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) group program for youth between ages of 6 to 17 with symptoms of anxiety. The
      program will be delivered at GallopNYC, a stable that provides equine-facilitated group
      therapy to youth with a range of mental health problems.

    <textblock>
      The equine-facilitated group therapy normally provided at GallopNYC (Treatment as Usual, TAU)
      will be compared to an augmented group program that will include CBT strategies, including
      psychoeducation to the child and caregiver about anxiety, coping strategies to use when
      anxious, and identifying and addressing dysfunctional thoughts that maintain anxiety.
      Seventy-five children between 6 to 17 years of age will be randomized to TAU
      (equine-facilitated group therapy), the augmented group therapy that contains CBT strategies,
      or wait list control. Outcomes include anxiety symptoms, self-efficacy,receipt of services,
      functioning and the child's relationship with the horse.
