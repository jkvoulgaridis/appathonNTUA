      The objectives of the study are:

        -  To describe the effectiveness of cemiplimab 350 mg administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) for
           treatment of patients with advanced CSCC in real-world clinical settings

        -  To evaluate the safety of cemiplimab based on incidence of treatment related
           immune-related adverse events (irAEs), infusion related reactions (IRRs), and treatment
           related serious adverse reactions (SARs) in patients with advanced CSCC receiving
           cemiplimab treatment in real world clinical settings

        -  To describe patient experience, including patient reported quality of life (QOL) and
           functional status, and clinician reported performance status in a real-world setting for
           patients with CSCC

        -  To describe baseline characteristics that could potentially be associated with
           health-related outcomes for patients with Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC)
           undergoing treatment with cemiplimab

        -  To describe patients who receive cemiplimab as treatment for CSCC in a real-world
           setting

        -  To describe real-world use patterns of cemiplimab for CSCC

        -  To investigate the long-term effects and effectiveness of cemiplimab in CSCC patients

        -  To describe the effectiveness of cemiplimab in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent
           patients with advanced CSCC, regardless of etiology, per available data

        -  To describe the effectiveness of cemiplimab after prior exposure to radiation therapy
           for CSCC per available data

        -  To describe the effectiveness of cemiplimab as a first-line (1L) or later systemic
           treatment in patients with advanced CSCC, regardless of etiology, per available data
