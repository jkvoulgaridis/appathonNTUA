      Background:

      -A gene provides instructions to the body. Mutated genes can sometimes cause cancer. Germline
      mutations are those people are born with. These mutations in the BAP1 gene can cause
      mesothelioma and other cancers. Researchers want to study people with germline mutations of
      BAP1 and other genes known to cause cancer.

      Objective:

      -To learn how cancer might develop in people with certain gene mutations.

      Eligibility:

      -People ages 2 and older with a germline mutation in BAP1 or another gene that might cause
      cancer

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with:

             -  Medical and family history

             -  Saliva test

        -  Participants with mesothelioma will be in the NIH Group. Participants without
           mesothelioma can choose to be in either the NIH Group or the Remote Group.

        -  Remote Group participants will have a medical and family history by phone. If they have
           tumor tissue from a previous surgery, it will be tested. They will be contacted once a
           year by phone.

        -  NIH Group participants will have a baseline visit. This can take up to 4 days. They may
           have to stay in the area overnight. The visit will include:

             -  Physical exam

             -  Evaluation of tumor tissue if available

             -  Optional tumor biopsy

             -  Blood tests

             -  Scans: A machine will take pictures of the body.

             -  Photographs of skin lesions or other issues

             -  Skin exam

             -  Eye exam

        -  NIH Group participants will have visits once or twice a year. These will include a
           physical exam, lab tests, scans, and other tests as needed.

        -  Participants who have a confirmed mutation will be asked to contact any relatives who
           may be at risk and ask them about joining the study.

      Background:

        -  BRCA1-Associated Protein-1 (BAP1), a deubiquitinase involved in regulating DNA repair
           enzymes, is believed to be a prominent mutation in malignant mesothelioma

        -  Germline mutations involving BAP1 have been reported in familial studies. These have
           been associated with a higher likelihood of mesothelioma as well as several other
           malignancies, including uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanomas, renal cell carcinoma and
           cholangiocarcinoma

        -  BAP1 mutations, if found, have a high probability of detecting multiple malignancies in
           family members.

      Objectives:

      -To characterize the natural and clinical history of malignant mesothelioma patients and
      their family members who have germline mutations in BAP1 and other DNA repair/cancer
      predisposition genes

      Eligibility for Genetic Testing:

      Cohort 1

      -Individual with mesothelioma with deleterious germline mutations in BAP1 or another
      DNA-repair/cancer predisposition gene(s) (previous testing may have been research or
      clinical)

      OR

        -  Individual with a diagnosis of mesothelioma who is otherwise eligible for testing on
           Cohort 2

        -  Age greater than or equal to 2

      Cohort 2

      -Individual with a germline BAP1 mutation who does not have a history of mesothelioma
      (previous testing may have been research or clinical)

      OR

      -Individual with no personal history of mesothelioma with:

      --a first degree biological relative (living or deceased) with a history of mesothelioma

      OR

      --a first degree biological relative with a CLIA confirmed germline mutation in BAP1

      OR

      --a first degree biological relative with mesothelioma and a CLIA confirmed germline mutation
      in another DNA-repair/cancer predisposition genes

      OR

      --a second degree biological relative with mesothelioma and a CLIA confirmed germline
      mutation in BAP1

      -Age greater than or equal to 16 unless participant has a BAP1 mutation or a first degree
      biological relative with a confirmed TP53 or BAP1 germline mutation; in such cases, will
      begin screening at age greater than or equal to 2

      Eligibility for Surveillance:

      Cohort 1

      -No additional criteria

      Cohort 2

      -Testing performed on study must confirm presence of germline mutation in BAP1 or another DNA
      repair/cancer predisposition gene(s)

      Design:

        -  Individuals with suspected hereditary predisposition to mesothelioma and their families
           will be recruited to assess for genetic mutations, and to study the natural history of
           malignancies occurring in germline BAP1 mutations as well as other mutations involved in
           DNA repair.

        -  Screening examinations will be offered to those with germline BAP1 mutations as well as
           other mutations involved in DNA repair/cancer predisposition.

        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between germline mutation and disease
           phenotype.
