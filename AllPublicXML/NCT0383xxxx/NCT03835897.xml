  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective observational multicenter study to compare the outcome of breast cancer
      surveillance using mammography, breast US, contrast-enhanced MRI, and diffusion-weighted MR
      imaging (DWI) as a screening tool, in the high-risk women for breast cancer.

        -  Primary objective: To compare the sensitivity of mammography, breast US,
           contrast-enhanced MRI, and DWI for the detection of breast cancer

        -  Secondary objective:

             1. To compare the specificity of mammography, breast US, contrast-enhanced MRI, and
                DWI for the detection of breast cancer

             2. To compare the cancer detection rate of mammography, breast US, contrast-enhanced
                MRI, and DWI

             3. To compare the characteristics of detected cancers

      -  Mammography, breast US, contrast-enhanced MRI, and DWI will be performed on the same day
           or within 1 month at baseline and then after 1 year, and images will be interpreted
           independently according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) by
           experienced radiologists.

        -  Each eligible woman, who provides informed consent for this study, will undergo
           mammography, breast US, contrast-enhanced MRI, and DWI at a 3T MR scanner.

        -  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI will be performed before and after a gadolinium-based
           contrast agent injection.

        -  Before contrast injection, DWI with b-value of 0, 800 and 1200 s/mm2 will be performed
           and will transfer into the server.

        -  A total of 890 high-risk women for breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.

        -  The BI-RADS 3 or higher is defined as test-positive. The reference standard will be a
           biopsy or at least 1 year of follow-up.
