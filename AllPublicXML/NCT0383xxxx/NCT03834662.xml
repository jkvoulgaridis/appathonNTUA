  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TGFβ has profound local immunosuppressive and immunoexclusion effects in the tumor
      microenvironment that are integrally involved in the failure of immune checkpoint inhibitors
      in some tumors. Preclinical data in a variety of models strongly support the study of AVID200
      in patients with treatment-refractory advanced and metastatic malignancies as an approach to
      reducing immunosuppression/exclusion and increasing the activity of immune checkpoint
      inhibitors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TGFβ inhibits local anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and also promotes
      the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that enhances the metastatic potential of
      tumor cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a critical constituent of the TME. As
      is the case for fibrosis in other settings, these cells are myofibroblast-like, and respond
      to and are activated by tumor-derived TGFβ. CAFs play a critical role in promoting EMT
      resulting in increased tumor cell migration and invasion as well as maintaining the TME to
      support tumor cell survival. The immunosuppressive role of TGFβ in the TME has been clearly
      demonstrated with the activation of CAFs being an important mechanism underlying immune cell
      exclusion. Exclusion of immune cells from tumors and local immunosuppression can both be
      reversed by AVID200 therapy.

             malignancy that is locally advanced or metastatic
