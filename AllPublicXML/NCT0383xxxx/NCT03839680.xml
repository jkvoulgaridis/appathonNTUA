    <description>Risk factors will be assessed by consultation of patients medical record and reported on the spreedsheet for analysis:
Demographic data: age, gender, smoking habit
Characteristics of colitis: median duration of disease before starting VDZ, extension of disease according to the Montreal classification and severity at baseline (Mayo score/UCEIS)
Treatments:
Previous therapy used including number of TNF ɑ antagonist and reason for failure
Concomitant drugs: corticosteroids, immunosuppressors
Biologic tests with blood tests (Haemoglobin, CRP, albumin with dosage in patients 'referent laboratory or hospital laboratory priori to each infusion of VDZ) and fecal calprotectin, realized only in hospital laboratory due to repayment terms, from stool samples or aspiration during proctosigmoidoscopy.</description>
