  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is characterized by profound infantile hypotonia, growth delay,
      cognitive impairment, muscle weakness and exercise intolerance. Studies have suggested that a
      defect in energy metabolism, yet to be clarified, may be involved in its pathogenesis. Many
      PWS patients have received Coenzyme Q10, but the rationale for this and objective impact on
      cellular metabolism has not been clarified.

      Investigators will determine the clinical efficacy of CoQ10 in a prospective, randomized,
      double-blind, controlled, cross-over study. Primary outcome will include determination of
      muscle function based on a 3 minute step test which showed good sensitivity in the
      investigators' pilot study. Secondary outcomes will determine effects on muscle power
      (maximal vertical jump), strength (hand grip), endurance (6 Minute Walk Test), fatigue
      (PedsQL quality of life scale), physical activity level (3DPAR), attention (ADHDT), cognition
      (MOCA), and physical function (CHAQ). The investigators' subaim is to elucidate the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms by which clinical improvements are mediated through interrogation
      of underlying mitochondrial dysfunction to optimize therapies. This will include
      determination of total aerobic capacity (maximal graded cycle ergometry), muscle metabolic
      function (31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of muscle to evaluate high energy
      phosphagen, anaerobic and aerobic exercise metabolism), mitochondrial function (serum
      lactate, carnitine, acylcarnitines, lactate/pyruvate ratio), and blood and urine oxidative
      stress markers of lipid, protein and DNA peroxidation. Investigators hypothesize that CoQ10
      will lead to a clinically significant improvement in motor function, power, fatigue, habitual
      activity, attention span &amp; thereby quality of life in PWS.

    <masking_description>The Sick Kids research pharmacist will be responsible for dispensing the CoQ10 capsules which will be of highest grade, purity and safety from Webber Natural Pharmaceuticals Limited. A placebo will be prepared by the Sick Kids research pharmacy and will consist of lactose-filled capsules. The CoQ10 and placebo capsules will not be identical in colour, shape or taste. However, as stated above, researchers, participants and families will be blinded to the treatment phase. They will know they are receiving one capsule for one part of the study and another capsule for the next part. No one (except the pharmacist and an unblinded study team member, who will only distribute and collect the medication given to the family (will not conduct any testing)) will know which capsule contains CoQ10 and which contains the placebo</masking_description>

    <description>Change in the baseline CHAQ score. Assessment of how an illness or condition affects child's ability to function in daily life. There are individual items in each of 8 sections (Arising, Eating, Dressing, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, Activities). Scoring of individual items ranges from 0-3 (0=from no difficulty to 3= unable to do). The higher the score, the more difficult is the task to a maximum of 3 points for each section. For each of the 8 sections, whatever the highest individual score was becomes the score of the section (max 3 points). Points are added to the section score if devices or aids are used for that section (to a maximum of 3 points). The CHAQ score is the total of the 8 sections, divided by 8 with a range from 0 points (no impact on quality of life) to 3 (large impact on quality of life) . The higher the score, the greater the impact of the illness on function.</description>
