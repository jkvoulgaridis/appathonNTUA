  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open surgery for esophageal cancer commonly involves large incisions in the chest, associated
      with a high rate of pulmonary complications (30-50%). Minimally invasive approach through
      keyhole surgery has been shown to reduce pulmonary infections by 20%. Enhanced recovery
      programmes are evidence-based protocols, developed to achieve early recovery after surgery
      with early mobilisation and chest physiotherapy and have been shown to reduce pulmonary
      complication rates as well. The investigators intend to objectively measure chest wall
      movement using 3D motion capture system as well as a wearable measurement system to monitor
      chest wall movement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population consists of 50 healthy volunteers who have not received upper
      gastrointestinal surgery and 100 patients treated with surgery more than one year ago (50
      open and 50 minimally invasive). Chest wall movement will be measured using a 3D optical
      motion system and the investigators will establish if inertial measurement units placed
      strategically on the chest wall are able to quantify chest expansion and lung capacity. Data
      will be acquired during different breathing patterns and during use of an incentive
      spirometry. Pulmonary function tests will be undertaken in all patients and the investigators
      will also collect clinical data concerning health-related quality of life and other
      concomitant medical conditions. The target outcome of this study is to determine whether the
      3D motion capture and wearable systems are reliable in the measurement of chest wall movement
      after surgical removal of esophagus and the validity and patient acceptability of wearable
      system, as well as the ability of distinguishing open and minimally invasive surgical
      approach. A tailored physiotherapy may be developed following this study in order to improve
      chest wall movement and objectively measure this using the wearable system. This can then be
      implemented in a clinical trial to provide the evidence base to for patient-tailored
      physiotherapy following major cancer surgery and to optimise the respiratory function.

    <description>Evaluation of changes in chest wall movement in patients who have undergone oesophagectomy more than a year ago (open or minimally invasive approach) and in healthy control participants. Reflective markers will be placed on the chest wall of the participant and chest wall movement will be detected by a 3D motion capture system using these markers. In addition, inertia measurement units will be applied next to the markers. Chest wall movement will be assessed during normal breathing, take and hold a deep breath and whilst performing incentive spirometry.</description>

    <description>All participants will be asked to fill in a validated questionnaire, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) for assessment of their current quality of life. The QLQ-C30 includes 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and 6 single items. Items 1 to 28 have a four-point scale response, namely 'Not at all' (point 1), 'A little', 'Quite a bit' and 'Very much' (point 4). The last 2 items have a seven-point scale for assessment of the overall health and overall quality of life, being 'Very poor' (point 1) to 'Excellent (points 7). Higher scores in the function and global quality of life scales represent better levels outcome, whilst higher scores in symptom scales represent presence of more symptoms.</description>

The QLQ-OG25 has six symptom scales (dysphagia, eating restrictions, reflux, odynophagia, pain and discomfort, and a scale assessing anxiety) and 10 single items relevant to patients undergoing palliative or potentially curative treatments and follow-up for upper gastrointestinal cancer. All items have four-point scale, namely 'Not at all' (point 1), 'A little', 'Quite a bit' and 'Very much' (point 4).

This questionnaire includes a total of 10 items assessing the usability and acceptability of the 3D motion capture system. Each item has a five-point Likert scale response, with 'Strongly disagree' (point 1), 'Disagree', 'Neutral', 'Agree' and 'Strongly agree' (point 5).

        Three cohorts will be studied, equal in size. A total of 150 patients will be included in
        this study. One hundred patients who have undergone oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer
        more than a year ago, 50 patients who have undergone open surgery and 50 who have undergone
        a minimally invasive approach. In addition, 50 healthy volunteers will be included as a
        control group with no underlying respiratory disease and no previous history of upper
        gastrointestinal surgery.

        Patients who have undergone oesophagectomy will be identified from existing databases by
        the direct care team of the patient. Healthy volunteers will be recruited from Imperial
        College through paper adverts.
