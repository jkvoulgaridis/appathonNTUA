  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to cardiac rehabilitation is poor, and worse for minorities, women, and those with
      lower levels of education. Patients less likely to be referred to and complete cardiac rehab
      are at highest risk of adverse outcomes and thus have the most to gain from participation in
      cardiac rehab. To improve participation, healthcare systems need to limit barriers to
      enrollment and promote adherence to rehabilitation.

      This study aims to (1) Iteratively develop and program a theoretically informed
      technology-based nudge message library for a diverse patient population using multiple and
      iterative N of 1 within subject studies. Investigators will also engage patient, provider and
      health systems stakeholders in designing and refining the messages; (2)Develop a one-page
      decision aid tool to present information designed with principles of shared decision making
      including pros and cons of hospital and home-based rehabilitation. Investigators will engage
      patients, providers, and health systems stakeholders to provide feedback on the information
      sheet (3) Conduct a 2x2 factorial design randomized trial of a) choice and b) nudge messaging
      to improve primary outcome of CR adherence. Secondary outcomes will include enrollment and
      completion of CR, exercise capacity, patient engagement, quality of life, hospitalizations
      and healthcare utilization.Evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and
      applying the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance)
      framework.

    <measure>Patient activation and engagement will be measured using the 13-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The low-literacy version of the 13-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM), both in English and Spanish, will be used to assess the effect of the intervention on patient activation. This validated and predictive tool assesses patient knowledge, skill and confidence in self-management. A single point change in PAM score is clinically meaningful and increases in the PAM are associated with increased self-management behavior.68 The PAM will be measured at the index visit, 6 weeks, 12 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Reported quality of life measured by Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index (QLI) will be used to assess quality of life. The QLI is a 35 question instrument that uses a 6 point scale ranging from &quot;very unimportant (lower end of the scale)&quot; to &quot;very important (higher end of the scale).&quot; The outcomes of these scales are averaged to compute the total score. The QLI is valid, reliable, sensitive to change in both CR and PR populations, and is available in English and in Spanish. The QLI will be administered at the index visit, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</description>
