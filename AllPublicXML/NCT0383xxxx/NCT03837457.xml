  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this clinical trial is to study the efficacy and safety of cobomarsen
      (also known as MRG-106) for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), mycosis
      fungoides (MF) subtype in subjects who have confirmed disease progression following treatment
      with vorinostat in the SOLAR clinical study (MRG106-11-201). Cobomarsen is designed to
      inhibit the activity of a molecule called miR-155 that may be important to the growth and
      survival of MF cancer cells.

      The effects of treatment will be measured based on changes in skin lesion severity,
      disease-associated symptoms, and quality of life, as well as the length of time that the
      subject's disease remains stable or improved, without evidence of disease progression. The
      safety and tolerability of cobomarsen will be assessed based on the frequency and severity of
      observed side effects.

      Study Design:

      Up to 60 subjects are expected to be enrolled after discontinuation from the SOLAR clinical
      study (MRG106-11-201). Cobomarsen will be administered in the clinic by 2-hr intravenous
      infusion on Days 1, 3, 5 and 8, and weekly thereafter. Treatment will continue until the
      subject becomes intolerant, develops clinically significant side effects, progresses, or the
      trial is terminated.
