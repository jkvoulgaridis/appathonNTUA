  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to assess the regulatory mechanisms of autonomic nervous system using
      noninvasive methods in newborns during postnatal adaptation period. Evaluated parameters will
      include complex analysis of electrodermal activity as a parameter reflecting sympathetic
      cholinergic system and indices of heart rate variability reflecting the activity of
      parasympathetic cardiac regulation. The project is focused on the neuro-psycho-physiological
      characteristics of physiological adaptation in early postnatal age and the effect of
      non-pharmacological pain relieving.

    <measure>Characteristics of parasympathetic (vagal) heart regulation in newborns in relation to nociception</measure>
    <time_frame>within the first 4 days of postnatal life</time_frame>
    <description>The study of cardiac vagal regulation of heart rate in relation to nociceptive stimulus using conventional linear and novel nonlinear analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) by special software (Kubios HRV, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland). Continual recordings of RR intervals will be recorded using Polar V800 (Polar, Finland).
HRV indices: linear (time domain - mean square of successive differences (MSSD); spectral domain - low frequency power (LF), high frequency power (HF), total spectral power (TP); non-linear (symbolic dynamics - 0V%, 2LV%, entropy).</description>

    <time_frame>within the first 4 days of postnatal life</time_frame>
    <description>The study of sympathetic cholinergic system indexed by electrodermal activity (EDA) using linear and novel nonlinear parameters characterizing complex sympathetic behavior in relation to nociceptive stimulus. Continual EDA recording associated with peripheral temperature monitoring will be performed using device BioInfinity, Thought Technology Ltd., Canada.
EDA indices: linear - SCA (skin conductance amplitude), frequency of NS-EDR (nonspecific electrodermal responses), nonlinear - SIE (symbolic information entropy), and ApEn (approximate entropy).</description>
