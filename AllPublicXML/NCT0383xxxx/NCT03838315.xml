      This study will evaluate Effects of Neural Mobilization with or without Soft Tissue
      Mobilization in Cervical Radiculopathy, half of the subjects will receive treatment of Neural
      Mobilization along with Soft Tissue Mobilization whereas half of the subjects will receive
      only Neural Mobilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neural mobilization and Soft Tissue Mobilization both treatments are used to treat Cervical
      Radiculopathy but they work differently.

      Neural mobilization technique is different for all 3 nerves i.e Radial, ulnar and median.
      Neural Mobilization Technique target the single nerve which is being compressed and showing
      symptoms.

      Soft Tissue Mobilization include traction which decompresses the nerve and stretches the
      surrounding muscles along with help to reduce pain and tingling sensation. whereas hot pack
      helps to increase blood circulation and warm up muscles and isometric exercises provide
      strengthening and build endurance.
