  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection frequently involves combination drug therapy for
      its treatment; hence, it is important to understand their interactions and resulting changes
      in exposure which are associated with medications. This is a Phase-1, open-label,
      fixed-sequence 2-period, one-way drug interaction study to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK),
      safety, and tolerability of GSK3640254 and Tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC) when
      administered alone and in combination in healthy subjects. The study will consist of a
      screening period of 28 days before the first dose of study intervention followed by 2
      sequential treatment periods. Subjects will be administered TAF/FTC 25/200 milligram (mg)
      once daily (QD) on Days 1 to 14 of Period 1 followed by co-administration of TAF/FTC 25/200
      mg QD with GSK3640254 200 mg QD on Days 1 to 7 of Period 2.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be 18 to 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          -  Subjects who are healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified
             designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring (history and ECG).

          -  Body weight &gt;=50.0 kilograms (kg) (110 pound [lbs]) for men and &gt;=45.0 kilograms [kg]
             (99 lbs) for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5 to 31.0 kilograms
             per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive).

          -  Male or female; A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant,
             not breastfeeding and not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP).

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal (GI) anatomy or
             motility (e.g.,gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric ulcers, gastritis), hepatic
             and/or renal function, that could interfere with the absorption, metabolism and/or
             excretion of the study drugs or render the subject unable to take oral study
             intervention.

          -  Any history of significant underlying psychiatric disorder including, but not limited
             to, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with or without psychotic symptoms, other
             psychotic disorders, or schizotypal (personality) disorder.

          -  Any history of major depressive disorder with or without suicidal features or anxiety
             disorders, that required medical intervention (pharmacologic or not) such as
             hospitalization or other inpatient treatment and/or chronic (&gt;6 months) outpatient
             treatment. Subjects with other conditions such as adjustment disorder or dysthymia
             that have required shorter term medical therapy (&lt;6 months) without inpatient
             treatment and are currently well-controlled clinically or resolved may be considered
             for entry after discussion and agreement with the ViiV Medical Monitor.

          -  Any pre-existing physical or other psychiatric condition (including alcohol or drug
             abuse), which, in the opinion of the investigator (with or without psychiatric
             evaluation), could interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the dosing
             schedule and protocol evaluations or which might compromise the safety of the subject.

          -  Medical history of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac disease or a family or personal
             history of long QT syndrome.

          -  History of any kidney disease or current or chronic history of impaired renal function
             as indicated by an estimated creatinine clearance &lt;80 milliliters per minute (mL/min).
             Creatinine clearance (CrCL) is estimated by either of the following methods: (a) The
             Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation: estimated glomerular filtration
             rate (eGFR) (milliliter [mL]/minute [min]/1.73 meter square [m^2]) = 175 x
             (SCr)^-1.154 x (Age)^-0.203 x 0.742 [if female] x 1.212 [if African American]
             glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is expressed in mL/min/1.73 m^2, SCr is serum
             creatinine expressed in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), and age is expressed in
             years. (b)The Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCL(mL/min) ={((l40-age) x weight)/(72xSCr)}x
             0.85 (if female) CrCL is expressed in mL/min, age is expressed in years, weight is
             expressed in kg, and SCr is serum creatinine expressed in mg/dL.

          -  Presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at Screening or within 3 months prior
             to starting study intervention.

          -  Positive HIV-1 and -2 antigen/antibody immunoassay at Screening.

          -  ALT &gt;1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN). A single repeat of ALT is allowed within a
             single screening period to determine eligibility.

          -  Bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, should preclude participation in the study of an investigational
             compound.

          -  Any Grade 2 to 4 laboratory abnormality at Screening, with the exception of creatine
             phosphokinase (CPK) and lipid abnormalities (e.g., total cholesterol, triglycerides,
             etc), and ALT (described above), will exclude a subject from the study unless the
             investigator can provide a compelling explanation for the laboratory result(s) and has
             the assent of the sponsor. A single repeat of any laboratory abnormality is allowed
             within a single screening period to determine eligibility.

          -  A positive test result for drugs of abuse (including marijuana), alcohol, or cotinine
             (indicating active current smoking) at Screening or before the first dose of study

             exception of imaging trials) prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30
             days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the study
             intervention (whichever is longer).

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within 56 days.

          -  Any positive (abnormal) response confirmed by the investigator on a screening
             clinician- or qualified designee-administered Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale
             (C-SSRS).

          -  Any significant arrhythmia or ECG finding (e.g., prior myocardial infarction,
             sinoatrial pauses, bundle branch block, or conduction abnormality) which, in the
             opinion of the investigator or VH/GSK Medical Monitor, will interfere with the safety
             for the individual subject.

          -  Exclusion criteria for screening ECG (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility
             determination): Heart rate for male: &lt;45 or &gt;100 beats per minute (bpm) and for

        <title>Period 1: Change From Baseline in Specific Gravity of Urine</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected at indicated time points for the assessment of specific gravity. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The concentration of the excreted molecules determines the urine's specific gravity. Baseline was defined as Day -1 for Period 1. Change from Baseline was defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Period 2: Absolute Values of Specific Gravity of Urine</title>
          <description>Urine samples were collected at indicated time points for the assessment of specific gravity. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The concentration of the excreted molecules determines the urine's specific gravity. Baseline was defined as Period 1 Day 14 for Period 2.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected at indicated time points for the assessment of Urinary pH. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). Baseline was defined as Day -1 for Period 1. Change from Baseline was defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>
