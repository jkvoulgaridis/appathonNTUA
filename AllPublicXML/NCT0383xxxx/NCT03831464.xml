  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, practice-oriented, repurposing, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
      randomized clinical trial. The RenoMet trial is repurposing an already approved agent
      (Metformin , Glucophage SR ) in a new indication (renoprotection ) in a new class of patients
      (chronic kidney disease patients CKD 2, 3A, 3B)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention consists in the treatment of patients with progressive kidney disease and
      blindly randomized to the treatment group with metformin as medication, added to their usual
      treatment. Metformin is a well-known and cheap medication used for many years and still used
      as main treatment of type 2 diabetes. In our study, this 'old' product will be used for a
      'new' indication, slowing down the progression of CKD. After randomization in the
      participating renal care clinic, patients in the intervention group will be treated with
      metformin at a dose of 1000 mg/day (2x500mg) in the evening during 30 months (Metformin -
      Glucophage SR (Merck KGaA)). During the first month of the trial a dose of 1x500mg will be
      used in order to avoid as much as possible some well-known mainly gastrointestinal side
      effects of metformin treatment At each visit during the study period, the metformin
      medication will be hand over to the patient in a HDPE bottle, closed with a MEMS cap
      (Medication Event Monitoring System). The MEMS a cap that registers the time and date of each
      opening ( presumed intake of the medication in the bottle).

      Patients blindly randomized to the control group will receive placebo treatment (2 tablets
      per day) also in a MEMS device and will continue to receive usual care. Control patients will
      have the same data collection.

      Follow-up of patients during the entire study period will be the responsibility of the
      treating nephrologist in the renal care clinic. All patients will have a baseline data
      collection at study entry (demographics, comorbidities, concomitant medication, clinical
      parameters, lab results). During the study period of 30 months patients will have follow-up
      visits at their renal care clinic every four months with collection of follow-up data
      (concomitant medication, clinical parameters, routine lab results and drug related problems).
      Extra blood and urine samples will be collected for a centralized second determination of
      serum creatinine and proteinuria
