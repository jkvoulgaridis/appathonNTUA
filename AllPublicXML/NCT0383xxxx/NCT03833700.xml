      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of E7386 in
      participants with solid tumor including CRC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation part and expansion part. The study
      will include Pre-treatment Phase, Treatment Phase, and Extension Phase (in expansion part
      only).

      Eligible participants from Pre-Treatment Phase (screening period) will enter into the
      Treatment Phase to receive E7386. After Treatment Phase, participants will be followed in
      follow-up period of Extension Phase (in expansion part only).
