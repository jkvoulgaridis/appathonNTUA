  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No consensus has yet been built on the treatment of lateral epicondylitis (LE) due to the
      lack of evidence. Although conflicting results are present, radial extracorporeal shock wave
      therapy (rESWT) has increasingly been used in the treatment of tendinopathy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ESWT and exercise have beneficial effects on the management of tendinopathies owing to their
      various mechanisms that showed therapeutic efficacy. Owing to its positive outcomes,
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has recently been used in the treatment of
      musculoskeletal system diseases such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy, calcific
      rotator cuff tendinopathies, and patellar tendinopathy

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 1 month and 3 months after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation is a specific questionnaire designed for the evaluation of the disease-specific pain and function/disability in LE. The scores were calculated separately and as the total PRTEE score, where 0 represented the best score, and 100 represented the worst score. The PRTEE consists of a pain scale with 5 items questioning pain during rest and specific activities (0 represents 'no pain' and 10 represents 'the highest pain'), and a function/disability scale with 10 items evaluating difficulties experienced during specific and daily activities (0 represents 'no difficulty' and 10 represents 'the highest difficulty)</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 1 month and 3 months after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Roles and Maudsley score was used to evaluate pain and activity limitation as classified in four categories: 1 point = excellent, &quot;no pain, complete movement, and complete activity;&quot; 2 points = good, &quot;discomfort from time to time, complete movement, and complete activity;&quot; 3 points = fair, &quot;discomfort after long-duration activity;&quot; and 4 points = poor, &quot;pain that restricts activity&quot;.</description>
