  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the impact of the availability of biopsy
      results at the time of organ offers on the use and outcomes of kidneys from deceased donors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomization of biopsy processing will be performed at the level of the deceased donor.

      If the participant agrees to be in this study and signs the informed consent, at the time
      that a kidney is accepted for them, the accepted deceased donor will be randomized, like a
      flip of a coin, to one of two groups.

        -  Group 1: biopsies will be processed immediately (routine &quot;frozen section&quot;) and results
           will be available to clinical teams at the time of the organ offers. Frozen section
           refers to a process where tissue from the biopsy sample is prepared by freezing and then
           slicing the tissue sample. Importantly, it can be done in about 15 to 20 minutes. Frozen
           sections are done when an immediate answer is needed; however, the quality of the sample
           is not always optimal.

        -  Group 2: biopsies will be processed using &quot;permanent sections&quot; - these results will not
           be available until after the organ is transplanted. Permanent section refers to a
           process where tissue from the biopsy sample is prepared by placing the tissue sample in
           a fixative, called formalin, to preserve the tissue, processing it through other
           additional solutions, and then placing it in paraffin wax. After the wax hardens, the
           tissue is cut into very thin slices, which are placed on slides and stained. This
           process normally takes several days.

      There is a 50/50 chance that the donor will be randomized to immediate biopsy processing by
      frozen section, versus permanent processing that yields results after transplant. If for any
      reason their surgeon feels that it would not be safe to proceed without the biopsy result, he
      or she will have the ability to receive the results of the biopsy before the transplant. The
      study team will record any episodes of this occurrence.
