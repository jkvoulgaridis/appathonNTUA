  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The pituitary gland produces hormones. A tumor in this gland can cause it to produce too much
      of the hormone cortisol. Too much cortisol in the body causes Cushing disease. This disease
      causes many problems. Some of these problems might persist after the disease is cured.

      Objective:

      To find out the long-term effects of exposure to high levels of cortisol during childhood and
      adolescence.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 10-42years who were diagnosed with Cushing disease before age 21 and are now
      cured and have normal or low cortisol levels

      People related to someone with Cushing disease

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history.

      Participants will complete an online survey. This will include questions about their or their
      child s physical and mental health.

      All participants will be seen at 5 -year intervals after cure of Cushing disease (5yr, 10yr,
      15yr, 20yr (last visit))

      Participants who have a relative with Cushing disease will have a medical history and blood
      tests or cheek swabs.

      Participants who have the disease will have:

      Physical exam

      Blood tests

      Cheek swab

      DXA scan: A machine will x-ray the participant s body to measure bone mineral content.

      For participants who are still growing, a hand x-ray

      Participants with the disease may also have:

      Hormone stimulation test: Participants will get a hormone or another substance that will be
      measured.

      Serial hormone sampling: Participants blood will be measured several times through a thin
      plastic tube in an arm vein.

      Urine tests: Participants urine may be collected over 24 hours.

      MRI: Participants may have a dye injected into a vein. They will lie on a table that slides
      into a machine. The machine will take pictures of the body.

      Objective:

      Cushing Disease (CD) describes the state of hypercortisolemia secondary to cortisol producing
      pituitary adenomas. The rarity of the disease (2-5 new cases per million, 1 out of 10 in
      children) and the subtle initial findings result in prolonged undiagnosed hypercortisolemia,
      that increases the risk for significant complications, including obesity, height
      deceleration, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, immunodeficiency,
      and others. Although hypercortisolemia usually resolves after successful resection of the
      pituitary adenoma, the reversal of the abovementioned complications and the long-term effects
      of the previous prolonged exposure of the body to supraphysiologic levels of cortisol have
      not been clarified, especially when hypercortisolemia occurs during childhood.

      Previous studies have addressed the possible complications after resolution of
      hypercortisolemia, but most of them refer to adult patients. Amongst the described
      complications, suppression of the pituitary hormones, such as the growth and thyroid hormone
      axes, and persistent increase of the body mass index (BMI) and abnormal fat distribution,
      have been described in limited number of pediatric patients followed for a few years after
      cure. Other complications, such as components of the metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular
      dysfunction, have not been extensively studied in children. Furthermore, equally important
      are the long-term effects of glucocorticoids on other aspects of health. For example, it has
      been previously described that the neurocognitive function of children with CD declines the
      first year after treatment. This can potentially result in impaired quality of life, lower
      education level, and lower job and life satisfaction in the future; however, the long-term
      neurocognitive sequelae of Cushing syndrome (CS) diagnosed in childhood have not been
      studied.

      This study aims to provide novel insight on the long-term effects of hypercortisolemia on the
      developing child, their underlying pathogenetic mechanisms, their evolution over time, and
      the risk factors for developing them. This will assist in designing methods to closely
      monitor or prevent them in the future. Certain results of this study could potentially apply
      to children with iatrogenic CS, which is much more common due to the widespread use of
      pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids in malignancies, autoimmune and atopic disorders.

        The study population will consist of patients that were previously successfully treated for
        CD before the age of 21 years. We aim to identify these patients through review of our
        current protocol 97-CH-0076 on Clinical and genetic investigation of pituitary and
        hypothalamic tumors , which has been recruiting patients since 1997. We will also accept
        patients who have been diagnosed and successfully treated for pediatric CD at outside
        institutions after reviewing the medical records and confirming their @@@diagnosis. The
        patients must be normocortisolemic at the time of their recruitment.@@@@@@Family members of
        subjects who are survivors of pediatric Cushing disease will be invited to participate in
        the DNA/linkage analysis study.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Males and females 10-42 years old (subjects) who were previously diagnosed and
                  had successful treatment of CD before the age of 21 years old. Patients who have
                  undergone therapies other than surgical resection (such as radiation or medical
                  treatment) will be eligible to participate.

               2. Normocortisolemia or hypocortisolemia at the time of the study (as documented
                  within past 6 months of recruitment) documented as urine free cortisol or
                  midnight/afternoon serum or salivary cortisol levels within or below the normal
                  range.

               3. Patients or a legal guardian (in case of cognitively impaired adults or children)
                  must provide assent/consent at the time of the recruitment.

               4. Family members (2- 90 yrs.) of patients with a family history of pituitary tumors
                  and who agree to participate in the DNA/linkage analysis study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Pregnancy (for the inpatient admission). Pregnant patients will still be offered the
             online questionnaire. Pregnant females will also be able to participate at the
             inpatient visit after delivery if they wish and they are medically cleared to do so.

          2. Patients with any medical, physical, psychiatric, or social conditions, which, in the
             opinion of the investigators, would make participation in this protocol not in their
             best interest, will be excluded from the on-site visit of the study. Patients who are
             critically ill, unstable, or with severe organ failure that may affect/limit the
             endocrine evaluation and place unsustainable demands on Clinical Center or NICHD
             resources will be excluded. They will still be offered the opportunity to participate
             in the online questionnaire part of the study.
