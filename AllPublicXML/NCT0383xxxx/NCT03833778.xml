  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study plan is to implement a tablet quiz in the German-speaking area, in
      order to test the specific knowledge about chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases (CED)
      concerning pediatric patients in the context of an age-appropriated and interesting digital
      playing environment, and to process knowledge gaps at the subsequent doctor's contact. The
      quiz should be combined with a game and can be performed by the patients, while they wait in
      the ambulance for their doctor's appointment. The investigator's goals are to grasp playfully
      gaps in the CED knowledge regarding the patients and to use these in the following consulting
      hour for clarification and advice in line with a better understanding of the disease. With
      this, the specific knowledge, the understanding of the disease, the therapeutic adherence,
      and the self-efficacy should improve the self-responsible handling of the disease. In
      particular, the willingness of the group of older teenagers to transit into the adult
      medicine can be collected and processed. The investigators want to check the efficacy in a
      randomized, controlled study with two groups of 15 pediatric CED patients. The hypothesis is
      that the additional play of the tablet-CED-quiz and the individualized advice have a positive
      impact on the CED knowledge, the disease activity, the CED-related life quality and the
      willingness of teenagers for transition.
