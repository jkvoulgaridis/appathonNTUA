  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies how well niraparib and temozolomide work in treating patients
      with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer with a complete or partial response to
      platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. Niraparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving niraparib
      and temozolomide may work better in treating patients with extensive-stage small cell lung
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of temozolomide in combination with
      niraparib. (Phase Ib) II. Evaluate the efficacy of niraparib plus temozolomide (Arm A)
      compared with best supportive care (Arm B) as measured by progression-free survival (PFS).
      (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of niraparib plus temozolomide compared with best supportive care
      as measured by overall survival (OS).

      II. To evaluate the safety of niraparib plus temozolomide compared with best supportive care
      as measured by adverse events (AEs).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess patient-reported outcomes on health-related quality of life and adverse events.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temozolomide. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and niraparib PO
      QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive best supportive care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for
      24 weeks, and then every 12 weeks for up to 1 year.
