  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-centre prospective cohort study of symptomatic patients with active
      neurocysticercosis (NCC) aims to identify factors related to treatment success of
      anthelmintic therapy.

      Neurological symptom/sign and cyst resolution, quality of life, accuracy and performance of
      serological T. solium diagnostics and NCC-specific immunological parameter will be followed
      up at multiple time points in the study. The final assessment will be done six months after
      the end of anthelmintic treatment. This study aims to guide treatment of NCC in sub-Saharan
      Africa by identifying factors that are associated with treatment outcomes.

      The factors that cause some people to fail complete resolution of all cysts and/or
      symptoms/signs are unknown.

    <description>The change in participants' self-reported quality of life from before to after treatment, as measured by the WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire (in all participants) [World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire; consisting of 26 items].
Quality of life is assessed by four domains - physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment. In each domain a score of 0 to 100 can be achieved. Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life). Domains are not summarised to an overall score.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in quality of life from before treatment to six months after treatment termination</time_frame>
    <description>The change in participants' self-reported quality of life from before to after treatment, as measured by the QOLIE-31 questionnaire [Quality of life in epilepsy - 31 items].
The score consists of 7 domains which all are range from 0 to 100%. Those domains are: seizure worry, overall quality of life, emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, cognitive, medication effects, social function. The seven domains are then summarized to an overall score by applying weights to each category. The overall score ranges from 0 to 100% with 100% being best possible quality of life.</description>
