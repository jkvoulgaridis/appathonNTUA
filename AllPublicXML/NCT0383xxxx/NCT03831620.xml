  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the strong association of hyperparathyroidism with arachidonic acid related lipid
      signals, little research has been performed over the years. A better understanding of the
      link between arachidonic acid remodeling, prostaglandin and endocannabinoid production with
      primary hyperparathyroidism in primary tissue/cells might open up new avenues for biomarker
      and thus to a potential therapeutic target.

      Arachidonic acid remodeling might also have an impact on depression and elevated cytokines in
      patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The investigators therefore will assess the
      correlation between postoperative improvement of PHQ-9 and cytokine levels with arachidonic
      acid remodeling.

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is described as a valid depression scale with good sensitivity and specificity for detecting depressive disorders, ranging from 1 to 27.
Depression severity:
1 to 4: minimal; 5 to 9: mild; 10 to 14: moderate; 15 to 19: moderately severe; 20 to 27: severe</description>
