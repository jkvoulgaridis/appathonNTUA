      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the non-inferior, clinical outcomes after
      cyanoacrylate closure comparing the surgical stripping for incompetent saphenous veins.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Varicose veins are highly prevalent. In western countries, an estimated 23% of adults have
      varicose veins, and 6% have more advanced chronic venous disease, including skin changes and
      healed or active venous ulcers. There are several modalities to treat varicose veins. Open
      surgical treatment with ligation and stripping of the saphenous vein, combined with excision
      of large varicosities, has been the standard of care for many years. Endovenous thermal
      ablation by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) has been shown
      to be a safe and effective alternatives with high long-term target vein closure rates.
      Although both techniques have gained broad acceptance in many countries, one major
      disadvantage of these techniques is the requirement for use of tumescent anesthesia to avoid
      the thermal injury of the surrounding structures. Cyanoacrylate closure for varicose veins
      has recently been introduced for treatment of the incompetent saphenous vein.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the complete closure of the target vein where complete closure is defined as Doppler ultrasound showing vein closure along entire treated vein segment with no discrete segments of patency exceeding 5cm after cyanoacrylate closure and absence of refluxing vein or residual vein after surgical stripping as read by a qualified site technologist or investigator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ecchymosis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will score the subjects ipsilateral leg of the occurrence of ecchymosis along treated segment, rated on a 0- to 5-point graded scale (0, none; 1, involving &lt;25% of the treatment area; 2, 25%-50%; 3, 50%-75%; 4, 75%-100%; 5, extension above or below the treatment segment)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of Quality of life score</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life scores are measured by the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) and EuroQOL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D).
The AVVQs are scored using a questionnaire. The total score for the 13 questions ranges from 0 to 100 points, with 0 points indicating the best possible quality of life. The EuroQOL is an instrument which evaluates the generic quality of life. The EuroQOL descriptive system is a preference-based measure with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction of the patients: satisfaction rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will be asked to the satisfaction rate by five response categories (strongly agree, agree, uncertain, disagree, strongly disagree) after asking as following: I'm very satisfied with the medical care I receive.</description>

    <description>After successful access of target vein and insertion of guidewire under any type of anesthesia, the procedure of cyanoacrylate closure for treatment of incompetent Saphenous Veins is performed. A 5 French introducer and catheter is advanced and positioned 5.0 cm caudal to the junction with proximal saphenous vein compression by the ultrasound probe, two injections of approximately 0.10 mL glue are given 1 cm apart, followed by a 3min period of compression, and then repeat injections and 30sec ultrasound probe and hand compression sequences until the entire length of the target vein is treated. The catheter is removed.</description>

    <description>For treatment of incompetent Saphenous Veins, surgical stripping is performed with a proper incision in the groin, with division and ligation of the saphenous vein and division of all tributaries under all types of anesthesia (general, spinal, regional block, or local anesthesia). The saphenous vein is then removed using a stripper. Compression stocking is apply.</description>
