  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hand osteoarthritis will be randomized into two groups, paraffin wax and
      prolotherapy group. Patients will be evaluated before and after treatment , after 2 weeks 4
      weeks and 3 months after treatment. Evaluation parameters are visual analog scale, Duruoz
      hand index scales, grip strength, lateral pinch, two point pinch and three point pinch
      strengths.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial. 40 Patients with hand osteoarthritis will be
      randomized into 2 groups, paraffin wax and prolotherapy group.Paraffin group patients will be
      told to take of jewellery and dip their hands into the bath of melted wax (52 ºC) with hands
      open and hand wrist in neutral position for 10 times .In paraffin wax group, patients will be
      treated 5 days a week for 2 weeks period. Paraffin wax bath will be applied for 20 minutes in
      every physical therapy session. Prolotherapy is a nonsurgical regenerative injection
      technique that introduces small amounts of an irritant solution to the site of painful and
      degenerated tendon insertions (entheses), joints, ligaments, and in adjacent joint spaces
      during several treatment sessions to promote growth of normal cells and tissues.Hypertonic
      dextrose solution is most common used agent. In prolotherapy group, %15 dextrose solution
      will be applied to medial and lateral aspect of proximal interphalangeal joints (PIJ), distal
      interphalangeal joints and carpometacarpal joint of thumb for 3 sessions once a week period.
      Grip strength, lateral pinch, two point pinch, three point pinch strengths, Visual analog
      scale (VAS), Duruoz Hand Index scales will be assessed before the intervention and after two
      weeks, 4 weeks and 3 months after intervention .

    <measure>Changed pain score &gt;%20 in hand osteoarthritis in paraffin wax group measured by Visual Analog Scale at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is measured by visual analog scale (VAS). The score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10‐cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. Pain intensity as none, mild, moderate, or severe, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm). The patients' pain in paraffin wax group are assessed by VAS in 3 months. Changed pain score &gt;%20 VAS is one of the primary outcomes</description>

    <measure>Duruoz Hand Index Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DHI is a self-report questionnaire which was developed about 15 years ago to evaluate the capacity to carry out manual functional activities with no assistance or aids in patients with rheumatoid arthritis .
It consists of 18 questions regarding manual tasks which are frequently carried out while cooking, washing, dressing, etc. The patient is asked to evaluate the difficulty which he/she has in carrying out these tasks (from 0: no difficulty, to 4: nearly impossible)
The psychometric properties of this scale have been evaluated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, hand osteoarthritis, stroke, trauma , diabetes and patients on haemodialysis. Duruoz Hand Index Scales of both groups before the treatment, 3 months after treatment will be compared</description>
