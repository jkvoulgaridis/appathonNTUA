  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis with limited therapeutic options.
      Nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 chemotherapy will be given to untreated patients with advanced
      biliary tract adenocarcinoma for the first-line treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel has become a standard therapy in advanced pancreatic cancer. Given
      the morphologic and histologic similarities between pancreatic cancer and biliary tract
      adenocarcinoma, nab-Paclitaxel may be a promising regimen, and S-1 has been approved for
      biliary tract cancer in Japan. Untreated patients with advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma
      will receive Nab-paclitaxel 120 mg/m2 (D1, D8, q3w) and S-1 (40mg BID for body surface
      area&lt;1.25 m2; 50mg BID for body surface area of 1.25-1.5 m2; and 60mg BID for body surface
      area&gt;1.5 m2; D1-14, q3w) as the first-line treatment. The investigators will investigate the
      efficacy and safety of the combination treatment, and expect to provide a more effective
      treatment plan for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer in China.The primary endpoint
      is objective response rate(ORR), and the secondary endpoints are progression-free
      survival(PFS), overall survival(OS) and the safety.
