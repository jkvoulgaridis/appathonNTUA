  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been progressively increasing. It
      is important to recognize and treat GDM to minimize the risk of maternal and neonatal
      complications. Multifaceted professional interventions are effective in the management of GDM
      and mobile healthcare can be an effective approach. The purpose of the current study was to
      develop and evaluate a model for prevention and management of GDM using mobile healthcare.
      Subjects with no previous history of diabetes, who were diagnosed with GDM during 24-28 weeks
      of gestation, were randomly divided into a conventional management group and a mobile
      management group. The conventional mangement group received conventional GDM management and
      could freely use the mobile healthcare application. The mobile management group received
      mobile healthcare services including tailored mobile coaching. The effectiveness of the
      management using the application were evaluated through the result values of the laboratory
      tests, anthropometric measurement performed during the study period and perinatal outcomes.

    <description>Mobile management group participants were given monitoring system devices including a glucometer with Bluetooth connectivity and an accelerometer to detect physical activity level. The mobile phone application specifically designed for this study was installed at enrollment for the mobile management group to collect clinical data and messages from the patients. The application consisted of four sections: clinical data, nutrition and diet, medication, and messaging system and information. Patients allocated to the mobile management group recorded their blood glucose level and diet via the smartphone application, and health care providers regularly scanned clinical data and messages from patients and sent return messages with tailored medical and nutritional guidance.</description>
