  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been long viewed that placebos cannot be administered in accordance with ethical
      values because deception is instrumental to the placebo effect. This notion has been shaken
      up by studies on open-label placebos, showing that placebos can lead to positive effects even
      though their inert nature is disclosed.

      Beneficial effects of double-blind placebos were found to be high in hot flush trials.

      The objective of the study is to determine whether an open-label placebo (OLP) treatment is
      efficacious in alleviating hot flushes and bother among peri- and postmenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beneficial effects of double-blind placebos were found to be high in hot flush trials. Recent
      studies demonstrating the efficacy of placebos without concealment provide a possible way to
      administer placebos in accordance with ethical and clinical values.

      The objective of the study is to determine whether an open-label placebo (OLP) treatment is
      efficacious in alleviating hot flushes and bother among peri- and postmenopausal women.

      In this assessor-blinded, randomized-controlled trial, women with ≥5 daily moderate to severe
      hot flushes of at least moderate bother are assigned 1:1 to a 4-week OLP treatment or no
      treatment. Both groups are informed about study objectives including a briefing about the
      inert nature of placebo pills, why OLP might be effective and the importance of the control
      group. To explore the duration and maintenance of placebo effects, participants in the OLP
      group are randomized a second time and divided into two subgroups who either discontinue (OLP
      4wk) or continue the OLP treatment (OLP 8wk) for another 4 weeks. All participants receive
      three study visits: at enrolment, baseline (1 week later), and at post-treatment. A fourth
      study visit is conducted at 8-week follow-up with the two subgroups OLP 4wk and OLP 8wk.
      Qualitative interviews about subjective experiences with the OLP treatment are conducted with
      n = 8 women.

      This trial will contribute to the evaluation of OLP treatments in clinical practice and
      further our understanding about the magnitude of placebo effects in hot flush treatments.

    <description>The group difference between OLP and no-treatment regarding health-related quality of life as assessed by the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ; Hunter, 1992; Shin &amp; Shin, 2012). Using the 37-item version of the WHQ, 8 subscales are calculated: Depressed mood, somatic symptoms, memory/concentration, vasomotor symptoms, anxiety/fears, sexual behaviour, sleep problems, and attractiveness. Although part of the questionnaire, we will not analyze the menstrual symptoms scale given that most women in our sample would be post-menopausal. Higher scores indicate better quality of life (e.g., higher scores in sexual behavior indicate that loss of sexual interest and sexual dissatisfaction is not experienced). Scores for each subscale range from 0 (poor health status) to 100 (good health status).</description>
