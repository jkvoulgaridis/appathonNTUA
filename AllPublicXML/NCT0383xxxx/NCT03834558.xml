  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is quantify, correlate and establish the diagnostic and prognostic value of the
      variation of the image biomarkers obtained by magnetic resonance (muscle volume,
      morphological, biochemical and structural biomarkers) longitudinally in fragile or pre-frail
      elders with sarcopenia after a mixed physical training of strength and myofascial
      self-conditioning. This project is based on an, longitudinal, prospective, controlled,
      randomized, intervention study and blind for the researchers responsible for the study. 60
      elderly with sarcopenia and frailty (Intervention Group, n=30; Control Group, n=30) will
      participate in the study. Intervention Group participants will perform 6-months mixed
      exercise program consisting in high-intensity strength training and self-myofascial
      conditioning. Data will be take trough 2 measurements that will be take place at baseline and
      post-intervention. Criteria of frailty, criteria of sarcopenia, sociodemographic, clinics,
      kinanthropometric, functional, nutritional and confusing variables will be evaluated.
      Moreover, magnetic resonance images will be performed to obtain muscle volume, morphological,
      biochemical and structural biomarkers.

    <intervention_model_description>This project is based on an, longitudinal, prospective, controlled, randomized, intervention study and blind for the researchers responsible for the study. Thus, the subjects participating in the study will be divided into 2 groups, one of which will perform the mixed exercise program (intervention group, IG), and another that will follow their daily routine without added exercise (control group, CG).
Each group will have 2 measurements in which the corresponding variables will be evaluated: A) before the start of the intervention, B) at 6 months (at the end of the intervention)</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A progressive program of high intensity strength and myofascial conditioning will be carried out in 2 non-consecutive weekly sessions (24 weeks). Each session will include:
A) Warm up on a cycle ergometer
B) Strength circuit: 6 exercises will be included to strengthen different muscle groups (2 in the upper extremities, 2 in the trunk and 2 in the lower extremities). 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions until the failure. The load will be set to 70% of 1 maximal resistance.
C) Self-myofascial conditioning: 10 repetitions, in the direction of the fibres of each muscle group, with different materials. 7 muscle groups will be worked (quadriceps, hamstrings, abductors, gluteus, pectoralis, full back and trapezius).
D) At the end, static stretches will be performed</description>
