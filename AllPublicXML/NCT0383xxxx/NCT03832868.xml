  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether it is better to give patients an implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) decision aid before they have their first consultation
      with an implanting cardiac electrophysiologist or after the consult.

      There are many unanswered questions about how shared decision making should be executed and
      how decision aids should be employed. The aim of this study is to determine whether it is
      better to give patients an implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) decision aid before
      they have their first consultation with an implanting cardiac electrophysiologist or after
      the consult.

    <intervention_model_description>Clinic sites will be block-randomized to eliminate contamination induced by individual-level randomization for a system-level intervention. Each site will rotate on a monthly basis whether the decision aid is administered pre- or post-office visit, and this will be applied to all ICD patients. Each site will have a minimum of 2 months exposure to each &quot;arm.&quot; No blinding will occur.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Decisional ICDs knowledge score among pre-visit arm participants compare to post-visit arm participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of ICD implantation (up to 60 days from the date of receiving the decision aid)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will receive a survey including 11 questions to gauge decisional knowledge about ICDs. The survey is expected to take no more than 10-15 minutes to complete, which should allow adequate time for completion in the pre-procedure area without interrupting clinical workflow.</description>

    <time_frame>Date of ICD implantation (up to 60 days from the date of receiving the decision aid)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will receive a survey including 12 questions to measure decisional conflict. The surveys are expected to take no more than 10-15 minutes to complete, which should allow adequate time for completion in the pre-procedure area without interrupting clinical workflow.</description>
