  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects received perioperative hAMSC treatment in order to accelerate the healing of the
      surgically repaired rotator cuff and increase the mechanical properties of the tendon,
      according to inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below). Each patient will undergo
      post-operative follow-up at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after the surgery. This will
      include a visual analogue score for pain (VAS), a questionnaire for the subjective Constant
      shoulder score, and the subjective questions of the University of California (UCLA) score.
      Preoperative and postoperative MRI at 12 months will be done to evaluate the quality of the
      rotator cuff repair.

  <detailed_description>

      Eligible patients will undergo an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair augmented by mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs). The primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety and
      tolerability of autologous mesenchymal stem cells treatment applied during arthroscopic
      rotator cuff repair.

      The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, adverse
      events (AEs) will be elicited using a standard non-leading questions. In addition, any signs
      or symptoms will be observed. All AEs will be collected as:

        -  patient's positive response to questions about their health

        -  symptoms spontaneously reported by the patient

        -  clinically relevant changes and abnormalities observed by the Investigator (e.g. local
           and systemic tolerability, clinically significant laboratory measurements confirmed by
           repeated measurement, results of physical examinations).

      Clinical improvement will be measured by clinical outcome scores (Constant shoulder score and
      UCLA Shoulder rating scale) at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after the surgery. MRI (Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging) findings made preoperatively and at 12 months (1 year) after operation
      will be evaluated.

      During the indication visit, patient's history will be taken and preoperative MRI evaluated.
      Written consent form will be collected from the patient after detailed education of the
      patient by the investigator.

    <measure>Efficacy: To evaluate the effect of hAMSCs applied during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair - Visual Analogue Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy analysis will be evaluated by comparing pre- and post-treatment rotator cuff function measured by changes in Visual Analogue Score (VAS) (meter-shaped scale; in mm) at Visits II, IV, V, and VI.
VAS is a self-report measure consisting simply of a 10 centimeter line with a statement at each end representing one extreme of the dimension being measured (most often intensity of pain). The respondent gives their indication with a pen mark on the line corresponding to their answer, e.g. the present pain level.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy analysis will be evaluated by comparing pre- and post-treatment rotator cuff function by changes in Constant Shoulder Score (points) at Visits II, IV, V, and VI.
Measurements: Pain, Activities of daily living, Range of movement (forward flexion, abduction, external rotation, internal rotation), Power.
Less points (out of 100) means more severe condition.</description>
