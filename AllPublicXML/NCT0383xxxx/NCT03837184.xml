    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose, trial of onasemnogene
      abeparvovec-xioi (gene replacement therapy) in participants with spinal muscular atrophy
      (SMA) Type 1 and who are genetically defined by a biallelic pathogenic mutation of the
      survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) with one or two copies of survival motor neuron 2 gene
      (SMN2). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of onasemnogene
      abeparvovec-xioi by assessing the proportion of symptomatic SMA Type 1 participants who
      achieve the ability to sit unaided for at least 10 seconds up to and including the 18 months
      of age trial visit. At least 6 participants aged &lt; 6 months (&lt; 180 days) at the time of gene
      replacement therapy (Day 1) will be enrolled.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose trial of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi
      (gene replacement therapy) in participants with SMA Type 1 with one or 2 copies of SMN2. At
      least 6 participants &lt; 6 months (&lt; 180 days) of age at the time of gene replacement therapy
      (Day 1) will be enrolled.

      The trial includes 3 trial periods: screening, gene replacement therapy, and follow-up.
      During the screening period (Days -30 to -2), participants whose parent(s)/legal guardian(s)
      provide informed consent will undergo screening procedures to determine eligibility for trial
      enrollment. participants who meet the entry criteria will enter the in-patient gene
      replacement therapy period (Day -1 to Day 3). On Day -1, participants will be admitted to the
      hospital for pre-treatment baseline procedures. On Day 1, participants will receive a
      one-time intravenous (IV) infusion of the equivalent of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi cohort
      2 dose received in the AVXS-101-CL-101 trial over approximately 60 minutes and will undergo
      in-patient safety monitoring over the next 48 hours. Participants may be discharged 48 hours
      after gene replacement therapy, based on Investigator judgment. During the outpatient
      follow-up period (Days 4 to End of Trial at 18 months of age), participants will return at
      regularly scheduled intervals for efficacy and safety assessments until the participant
      reaches 18 months of age.

    <time_frame>Up to 18 Months of Age Visit (Up To 14 Days After Participant Reaches 18 Months of Age)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of symptomatic SMA Type 1 participants who are homozygous negative for SMN1 exon 7 and have 2 copies of SMN2 without the SMN2 genetic modifier that achieve the ability to sit without support for at least 10 seconds. 'Sitting without support' is defined by the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study as &quot;a patient who sits up straight with head erect for at least 10 seconds; child does not use arms or hands to balance body or support position&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Participants Surviving</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Months of Age Visit (Up To 14 Days After Participant Reaches 18 Months of Age)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants at 14 months of age amongst symptomatic SMA Type 1 participants who are homozygous negative for SMN1 exon 7 and have 2 copies of SMN2 without the SMN2 genetic modifier. 'Survival' is defined as the avoidance of the combined endpoint of either (a) death or (b) permanent ventilation, which is defined by tracheostomy or by the requirement of ≥ 16 hours of respiratory assistance per day (via non-invasive ventilatory support) for ≥ 14 consecutive days in the absence of an acute reversible illness, excluding perioperative ventilation. Permanent ventilation, so defined, is considered a surrogate for death.</description>
