  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IMGN853 is designed to inhibit cell division and cell growth of folate receptor 1
      (FRα)-expressing tumor cells. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of IMGN853 and
      bevacizumab and see what effects (good and bad) that this combination treatment has on
      subjects with recurrent endometrial cancer.

      SCREENING: During the screening portion of the study, the subject will need to have tumor
      tissue tested and other exams to determine if s/he may proceed to the treatment part of the
      study. The subject's tumor tissue will be tested from either a previous or recent surgery or
      biopsy to see if it contains the FRα protein. If the tumor is positive and the patient meets
      all other eligibility, then the subject may proceed to treatment.

      TREATMENT: Study drugs (IMGN853 and bevacizumab) will be given by vein (IV) once each cycle
      on day 1 of 21 day cycle.

      Regular cancer care exams, tests, and procedures will occur. Additionally, an eye doctor
      visit with complete eye examination every other treatment cycle. Subjects will also
      self-administer eye drops as prescribed by the eye doctor.

      Study participation is up to three years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histological diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma (including others per
             protocol).

          4. Evidence that the endometrial cancer is advanced, recurrent, or persistent and has
             relapsed or is refractory to curative therapy or established treatments.

          5. At least 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen, but not more than 2 prior
             chemotherapeutic regimens, for management of endometrial carcinoma. Prior treatment
             may include chemotherapy, or chemotherapy/radiation therapy . Chemotherapy
             administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radio-sensitized therapy will
             be considered a systemic chemotherapy regimen

          6. Female patients 18 years or older

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1;

          8. Patient must have archival tumor tissue available from the primary or recurrent cancer
             prior to first dose. If archival tumor sample is not available, tumor sample from new
