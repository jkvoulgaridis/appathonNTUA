  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MAF-1217 is meant as the medical device which is to be effective in most forms of DED;
      therefore, it is expected that study patients benefit from study participation, and can
      reduce the signs and symptoms of surgery induced DED in patients undergoing cataract surgery,
      in a TID application pre-surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, pre-market, open label, randomized, prospective study exploring the
      performance of MAF-1217 when administered pre-surgery, in reducing the sign and symptoms of
      post-surgery DED in patients undergoing cataract surgery. Patients will be enrolled 2 weeks
      before Surgery (screening visit), will undergo cataract surgery (Day 0 - Baseline/Surgery),
      and then will be seen at week 1 and 2 after surgery.
