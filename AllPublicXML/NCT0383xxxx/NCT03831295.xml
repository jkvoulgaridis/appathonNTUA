    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of intratumoral injection of SD-101 and
      BMS-986178 in treating patients with solid malignancies that have spread to other places in
      the body. The TLR9 agonist SD-101 may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop
      cancer cells from growing. BMS-986178 is a monoclonal anti-OX40 antibody that enhances the
      activation of T cells, immune cells that are important for fighting tumors. Giving TLR9
      agonist SD-101 together with anti-OX40 antibody BMS-986178 may work better in treating
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of intratumoral TLR9 agonist SD-101 (SD-101) in
      combination with intratumoral and intravenous anti-OX40 antibody BMS 986178 (BMS-986178) in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with intratumoral SD 101 in combination with
      intratumoral and intravenous BMS 986178 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. To evaluate changes in pharmacodynamic endpoints in serial tumor biopsies from intratumor
      treated and untreated sites of disease.

      OUTLINE:

      SAFETY COHORT: Patients receive TLR9 agonist SD-101 intratumorally (IT) on days 1, 8 and 15.
      Patients also receive anti-OX40 antibody BMS 986178 IT on days 8 and 15, and intravenously
      (IV) over 30 minutes on days 8, 29 and 58.

      EXPANSION COHORT: Patients receive TLR9 agonist SD-101 IT on days 1, 8 and 15. Patients also
      receive anti-OX40 antibody BMS 986178 IT on days 1, 8 and 15, and IV over 30 minutes on days
      1, 29 and 58.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.

    <description>This outcome will be measured for any participant who has received at least one dose of any study medication. Treatment-limiting toxicities will be assessed using CTCAE v5.0. All adverse events will be recorded. Treatment-limiting toxicities are defined as;
Hematologic toxicities: Febrile neutropenia; Grade 3 &amp;4 thrombocytopenia; Grade 4 anemia unexplained with exception that toxicities can clearly be determined due to disease progression and/or unrelated to SD-101 or BMS-986178.
Non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3; Alopecia; Nausea; Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities; Grade 3 or 4 elevation of amylase or lipase not associated with pancreatitis; Grade 3 endocrinopathy controlled by hormone replacement; Grade 3 infusion reaction that returns to Grade 1 in &lt; 6 hours; Grade 3 skin rash not requiring systemic steroid therapy or other systemic immunosuppressive therapy.
Doses should be delayed if any Grade ≥ 2 toxicities are not resolved to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline by next cycle.</description>

          -  All patients with tumor types for which anti-PD-1 or anti PD-L1 therapy has been
             approved should have received such therapy prior to enrollment, with evidence of

             enrollment must have any immune related toxicities resolved to =&lt; grade 1 or baseline
             (prior to the checkpoint inhibitor) to be eligible. Patients who developed endocrine

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a urine or serum pregnancy test within 24
             hours prior to the first dose of trial treatment. If the urine test is positive or
             cannot be confirmed as negative, then a serum test will need to be negative
