  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase I/II, open label, randomized crossover pharmacokinetic, safety and acceptability
      study of the Abacavir/Lamivudine/ Lopinavir/Ritonavir (30/15/ 40/10mg ;4-in-1) Fixed-Dose
      Combination vs. Lopinavir/Ritonavir (40/10mg pellets) plus dual Abacavir/Lamivudine (60/30mg
      tablets) in HIV infected Children.

      The study is intended to support the adoption of the 4-in-1 by healthcare providers and will
      provide data that may support its registration in certain countries. The study will be
      carried out in HIV-infected children in Uganda weighing 3 to 25 kg (inclusive) and unable to
      swallow tablets and will provide supportive clinical data on the pharmacokinetics, safety,
      tolerability and acceptability of the 4-in-1.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to estimate the population average exposure to LPV, ABC and 3TC
      provided by the 4-in-1 formulation in HIV-infected children dosed per WHO weight bands.

      The secondary objectives:

        -  To determine the proportion of children overall, and within each weight band, with a
           lopinavir C12 &lt;1.0 mg/L while receiving the 4-in-1 formulation

        -  To evaluate and compare the safety and tolerability of the 4-in-1 formulation versus a
           reference treatment regimen.

        -  To compare the bioavailability of LPV, ABC and 3TC in the 4-in-1 formulation versus a
           reference treatment regimen.

        -  To assess post exposure CD4 and viral load

        -  To assess the factors that contribute to acceptability of the new 4-in-1 formulation.
