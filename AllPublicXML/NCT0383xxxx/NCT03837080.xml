  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of nutrition education
      (individual and group) on the intensity of pain in patients suffering from chronic pain. The
      secondary goal is to determine whether there is a change in the status of the patient's
      nutrition, their quality of life, quality of life, and other indicators of the psychophysical
      condition of the patient.

  <detailed_description>

      The underlying hypothesis of the study is that patients with chronic pain that go through a
      series of nutrition education (individual and group) specifically tailored to fit their needs
      (based on our preliminary findings), they increase the consumption of foods that have
      antiinflammatory properties, which will result in lower levels of inflammatory cytokines in
      the body (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP ), interleukin (IL) -2, IL-4 and IL-6),
      and consequently reduce the intensity of pain. Also, weight loss in obese patients is
      expected, and it will have an contributing effect of the intervention. Patient's quality of
      life and indicators of their psychophysical condition (eg, depression level) are also
      expected to improve.

      Chronic pain patients who either attend Daily clinic (Control Arm) or the 4-week
      multidisciplinary programme at the Department of Anesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive
      Care (Intervention Arm) will be recruited. They will be followed for total of 8 weeks (4 week
      intervention + 4 week follow-up).

    <description>The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting and are widely utilized by managed care organizations and by Medicare for routine monitoring and assessment of care outcomes in adult patients. Total of 36 questions (items) are scored on a 0 to 100 range where higher score corresponds to better quality of life. Items are divided into a total of 8 scales and assess the following: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain and general health. For each scale scoring is done on a 0 to 100 range where higher scores correspond to better health.</description>

    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) will be used to determine the change in patient's catastrophizing scale related to pain. The questionnaire is based on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (all the time) and assess patient's preoccupation with the pain. The questionnaire will be scored according to the instruction manual.</description>
