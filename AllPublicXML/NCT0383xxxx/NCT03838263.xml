      Methodology:

      Patient screened wil be randomized 2:1 between 2 arms:

        -  Experimental arm: Nivolumab 2 infusions (2 weeks part) before standard of care
           chemoradiation for 7 weeks with cisplatin at week 1, 4, and 7

        -  Control arm: Standard of care chemoradiation for 7 weeks with cisplatin at week 1, 4,
           and 7

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the feasibility and tolerance of neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment before
      chemoradiation in &quot;high-risk&quot; HPV-driven Oropharynx Cancer

             (IHC) and high-risk HPV DNA identification by in-situ Hybridization (ISH) or PCR. An
