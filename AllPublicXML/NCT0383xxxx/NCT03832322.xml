  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an observational study comparing consecutive group of WE and CO2 insufflation in
      terms of right and proximal colon AMR by tandem colonoscopy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective observational study to assess how WE colonoscopy would fit into
      clinical and research practices. We first observed whether optimal WE colonoscopy decreased
      the AMR in the right and proximal colon in a tandem approach. If WE did lower the AMR as
      compared with data in the literature, a randomized RCT deserves to be studied. For the
      calculation of sample size in the upcoming RCT, the AMR in the CO2 group would be collected.
      The differences of the AMRs in the right and proximal colon determined by tandem colonoscopy
      using WE or CO2 insufflation would then be compared.

    <description>Right-colon (cecum, A-colon, hepatic flexure) adenomas detected on the second-pass examination were used for the calculation of adenoma miss. Adenoma miss rate was calculated as the number of adenomas missed in the first colonoscopy divided by the total number of adenomas detected during both the first and second colonoscopies.</description>

    <description>During the insertion phase of the first-pass colonoscopy, water exchange (WE) method was used. WE entailed the infusion of water to open the lumen and sequentially suction of water. When the cecum was reached and after most of the water was suctioned to collapse the cecal lumen, CO2 was opened during the withdrawal phase of the first-pass colonoscopy. After the first complete withdrawal of the colonoscope, a second colonoscopic examination aided by CO2 insufflation during insertion and withdrawal was performed by the same endoscopist. The colonoscope was reinserted into the cecum as quickly as possible, and the entire colon was re-examined. Polyp resection was carried out during insertion and withdrawal of the first- and second-pass examinations.</description>

The colonoscope was reinserted into the cecum as quickly as possible, and the entire colon was re-examined.

        <description>Right-colon (cecum, A-colon, hepatic flexure) adenomas detected on the second-pass examination were used for the calculation of adenoma miss. Adenoma miss rate was calculated as the number of adenomas missed in the first colonoscopy divided by the total number of adenomas detected during both the first and second colonoscopies.</description>

            <description>During the first-pass colonoscopy, the procedure was performed in the usual fashion, with minimal CO2 insufflation to aid insertion. Cleaning of colon was predominantly performed during withdrawal. After the first complete withdrawal of the colonoscope, a second colonoscopic examination aided by CO2 insufflation during insertion and withdrawal was performed by the same endoscopist. The colonoscope was reinserted into the cecum as quickly as possible, and the entire colon was re-examined. Polyp resection was carried out during insertion and withdrawal of the first- and second-pass examinations.</description>

When the cecum was reached and after most of the water was suctioned to collapse the cecal lumen, CO2 was opened during the withdrawal phase of the first-pass colonoscopy.
