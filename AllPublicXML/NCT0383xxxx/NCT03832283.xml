  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, very little research exists on whether patient portals could be used to integrate
      patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement into the electronic health record (EHR) and
      clinical practice, even though 87% of ambulatory care practices have EHRs and 88% of U.S.
      adults have access to the internet. To date, no randomized controlled trial has examined
      whether patient portals can be used to collect PRO measures. The goal of this study is to
      implement the integration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for patient-reported outcome
      (PRO) measurement of depression symptoms into an electronic health record (EHR) and evaluate
      the effectiveness of collecting CAT PROs via an EHR patient portal in two randomized
      controlled trials. This study will advance the science of implementation of patient-centered
      outcomes research into clinical practice, as well as the evidence for high quality,
      accessible care.

      The overall goal of this proposal is to implement the integration of the Computerized
      Adaptive Test for Mental Health (CAT-MH) into an EHR for a healthcare system and evaluate the
      effectiveness of collecting CAT-MH PROs via an EHR-tethered patient portal (MyChart) vs.
      usual care in two randomized controlled trials. The first aim of this study will consist of a
      randomized controlled trial comparing screening rates among adult primary care patients with
      an active patient portal account (MyChart) and due for depression screening who receive usual
      care (CAT-MH screenings during routine clinic visits) vs. MyChart population-based CAT-MH
      screenings. The second aim of this study involves a randomized controlled trial comparing
      depression remission rates among patients with active moderate-to-severe MDD who receive
      usual care vs. MyChart CAT-MH measurement-based care. In addition, we will examine the
      resources needed to integrate the CAT-MH into the EHR and design the health IT strategy for
      collecting PROs via the patient portal.

    <description>Patients randomized to this intervention arm will receive usual care annual depression screening when they come in for a clinic visit and are due for screening. When the patient comes in for a visit, a best practice alert in the EHR will indicate that the patient requires depression screening. The CAD-MDD/CAT-DI screening during clinic visit will occur in a patient room, prior to their appointment with a primary care provider.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive invitations via MyChart to complete the CAD-MDD to screen for major depressive disorder (MDD). For patients who screen positive for MDD, CAT-DI will launch automatically and assess depression severity.
