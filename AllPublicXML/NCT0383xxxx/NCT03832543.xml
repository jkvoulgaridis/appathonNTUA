      Introduction : The extraperitoneal uterosacral ligament suspension (ULS) can be performed
      during the removal of the uterus in vaginal hysterectomy to prevent cuff prolapse. In this
      study, the modified extraperitoneal ULS technique was evaluated in terms of preventing cuff
      prolapse.

      Methods / Technique : Forty patients with second and third-stage uterine prolapse who were
      operated were included in the study. During routine vaginal hysterectomy procedure performed
      on patients, after sacrouterine ligaments which are the first-bites and uteroovarian and
      round ligaments which are the last-bites have been sutured and knotted, these ligaments were
      marked with 4-distinct clemps to make the right and left, upper and lower separation. After
      vaginal cuff was closed the sutures hanged by the clamps were ligated together, and the cuff
      tissue was stretched to the apical line.
