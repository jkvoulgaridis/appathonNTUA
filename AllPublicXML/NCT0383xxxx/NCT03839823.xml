             should be more than 10% ER positive or Allred ≥5 by local laboratory testing.

                  inhibitor treatment until randomization.

               -  If patients have disease recurrence during adjuvant tamoxifen treatment, disease
                  free interval (defined as duration between the date of patient received complete
                  tumor resection for primary breast cancer lesion to the date of disease
                  recurrence documented) must be greater than 12 months.

               -  Patients who are receiving ≤ 14 days of tamoxifen or NSAI or LHRH agonists ≤ 28
                  days for advanced breast cancer prior to randomization are eligible.

          2. Patient has received extended-field radiotherapy or limited field radiotherapy ≤ 2
             weeks prior to randomization, and has not recovered to grade 1 or better from related
             side effects of such therapy (with the exception of alopecia or other toxicities not
             considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion). Patient from
             whom ≥ 25% of the bone marrow has been previously irradiated are also excluded.

          3. Patient has a concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 3 years of randomization,
             with the exception of adequately treated, basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma or
             curatively resected cervical cancer in situ.

          4. Patients who have lung metastases with oxygen demand in resting status.

          5. Patients who have liver metastases with bilirubin &gt; 1.5 ULN.

          6. Patients with CNS involvement unless they meet ALL of the following criteria:

               -  At least 4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or
                  surgery) to starting the study treatment.

               -  Clinically stable CNS tumor at the time of screening and not receiving steroids
                  and/or enzyme inducing anti-epileptic medications for brain metastases
