  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to measure pain and psychosocial patient reported outcomes,
      objective functionality, and actual daily at home opioid usage in orthopedic patients. The
      study's goal following the data collection is to predict which patients are at high risk for
      chronic opioid use.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients undergoing orthopedic surgery at Duke Health will be eligible for enrollment. Additionally, all potential participants must be an adult at least 18 years of age, speak and read English, own a smartphone they are willing to use for the study, and live in the United States of America. All study assessments will take place on the app and other than baseline screening all assessments will take place after surgery until the patient stops taking opioids. Patients will be approached in the orthopedic clinic up to the day of surgery and asked if they are willing to be screened for inclusion. If they accept the screening request a link will be emailed to them or a QR code supplied that permits them to download the study app on their phone. Screening, consent, and all study data collection will occur from the app launch. All data will be collected after enrollment and consent through the Medable Research Application.</intervention_model_description>
