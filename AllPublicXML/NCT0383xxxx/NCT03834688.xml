  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible untreated patients will receive single arm venetoclax, bendamustine and rituximab as
      induction therapy. After 6 cycles, maintenance rituximab may be administered per physician
      discretion.

      Venetoclax is an oral Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. It targets the B-cell lymphoma 2
      (BCL-2) protein, which supports cancer cell growth and is overexpressed in many patients with
      mantle cell lymphoma. Venetoclax may make the cancer cells sensitive to chemotherapy. This
      may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die.

      The purpose of this study is to see if venetoclax in combination with bendamustine and
      rituximab chemotherapy is effective in treating people who have mantle cell lymphoma and to
      examine the side effects, good and bad, associated with this combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a subtype of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) which is considered
      incurable with conventional therapy. With an incidence of approximately 70,000 cases
      diagnosed in the United States (US) per year, the disease is rare.

      This is an open-label phase II study of venetoclax in combination with bendamustine and
      rituximab. Patients will receive induction therapy with venetoclax, bendamustine and
      rituximab for six cycles (1 cycle = 28 days). There will be an interim analysis after 19
      patients are enrolled to evaluate for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast
      breakdown of cancer cells which can lead to electrolyte and kidney problems.

      Tumor assessments will be performed after Cycle 3-4 and at end of induction therapy.

      Mandatory pre-treatment tumor tissue sample (i.e., obtained in the course of standard biopsy
      or surgery) will be required for research (if sufficient tissue is available).

      Mandatory bone marrow aspirate (obtained in the course of standard biopsy) and peripheral
      blood sample will be collected at the end of treatment for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD).
      MRD measures the disease remaining after treatment. Optional peripheral blood samples will
      also be collected for future research.
