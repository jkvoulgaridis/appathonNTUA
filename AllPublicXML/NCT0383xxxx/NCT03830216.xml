  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of a wireless smart insulin pen and
      smartphone-based bolus advisor on clinical and psychosocial outcomes in insulin-treated
      diabetes mellitus patients after 3 months of use.

    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, controlled treatment design. The study device will be
      used for multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy of insulin. The participant will interact
      with the study device in the uncontrolled environment of the participant's daily life. The
      study protocol is designed to yield meaningful data to determine clinical and psychosocial
      benefits of using the study device. The study will evaluate the study device as an
      intervention versus a control group.

             at least one long acting insulin dose and two or more short acting insulin doses per
             day.

          3. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 7.5%).

          4. The participant is a current iPhone user for over 30 days.

          7. Injectable anti-diabetic agents other than insulin

          8. The participant is legally blind or has below specified best-corrected vision level.

             disease, such as gastroparesis or renal disease (at Investigator's discretion)

         10. The participant is pregnant, lactating, or plans to become pregnant in the next 6
