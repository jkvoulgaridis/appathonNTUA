      in assessments regarding their child.

      Study B, which will run concurrent to Phase 3, will be for participants who did not meet the
      depression inclusion criteria or had recent changes in therapy or medications that make them
      ineligible for Phase 3.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Please note, inclusion criteria for Phase 3 Study A, and Phase 3 Study B are identical,
        with the exception that, for Phase 3/ Study B, we will not require elevated depressive
        symptoms (a) or stable treatment (b).

          1. Adolescents must have elevated depressive symptoms, defined by a score of 10 or higher
             on the Quick Inventory of Depression -Adolescent Version-- Clinician Rating
             (QIDS-A-CR), including endorsement of either sad mood or anhedonia on the QIDS.

          2. Other treatment for depression must be stable at baseline. Adolescents do not have to
             be in other treatment for depression, but, if they are, it must be stable for the past
             8 weeks.

          3. Adolescents must be aged 13-18.

          4. Adolescents must be medically cleared for moderate physical activity by their primary
             care physician. This criterion may be met by a current (dated in the past year)
             statement from their pediatrician that the adolescent may participate in school or
             camp programs including physical education.

          5. Adolescents must be able to read and write English sufficient to complete informed
             consent and engage in interventions.

          6. Adolescents aged 13-17 must assent to be in the study, and their parent or legal
             guardian must consent to their participation. Adolescents aged 18 must consent to be
             in the study.

          7. Able to attend one of the class times.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for Phase 3 Study A, and Phase 3 Study B are identical.

          1. QIDS- A-CR may not be higher than a score of 21. This ensures that adolescents are not
             severely depressed.

          2. Adolescents may not meet criteria for the following:

               -  Autism spectrum disorder &quot;cannot be ruled out&quot;, and symptoms are of sufficient
                  severity to interfere with study treatment per clinician judgement

               -  Current psychotic disorder

               -  Lifetime history of a manic episode

               -  Anorexia or Bulimia in past 3 months

               -  Substance use disorders in past 12 months, and symptoms are of sufficient
                  severity to interfere with study treatment per clinician judgment These will be
                  assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

          3. Adolescents may not have suicide ideation so severe it will interfere with study
             participation.

          4. Adolescents cannot currently be engaged in yoga classes, as this is the study
             intervention.

          5. Adolescents cannot be pregnant as yoga should be modified for pregnancy.
