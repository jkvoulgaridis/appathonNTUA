    <time_frame>30 minutes before and after coronary CT angiography and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Shortness of breath, or &quot;dyspnea&quot;, is the most famous symptom of left ventricular failure. It typically appears during strenuous activities, and progresses to ordinary activities, less than ordinary activities and ultimately resting state. The severity is categorized as above (FC 1 to 4)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional calss</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before and after coronary CT angiography and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Failure severity has been classified according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) to:
Class I: No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms of HF.
Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in symptoms of HF.
Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes symptoms of HF.
Class IV: Unable to perform any physical activity without symptoms of HF, or symptoms of HF at rest.</description>

    <measure>Blood pressure, systolic and diastolic</measure>

    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Before CT angiography and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of disturbed sleep measured as better than before, Worse than before, and No change
There are no standard classification for severity of this symptom. In our study, we measure this symptom as :
Better than before (1)
Worse than before (2)
No change (0)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appetite</measure>
    <time_frame>Before CT angiography and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of changing in appetite level measured as better than before, Worse than before, and No change
Loss of appetite is a common symptom of heart failure. There are no standard classification for severity of this symptom. In our study, we measure this symptom as :
Better than before (1)
Worse than before (2)
No change (0)</description>
