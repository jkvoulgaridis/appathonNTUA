  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to investigate health effects of oats and oat derived components, in
      human intervention studies, with the purpose to build new knowledge for development of
      cardiometabolic protective foods.

      The overall goal is to increase the knowledge which can be used for the development of food
      products with anti-diabetic properties, with the purpose to facilitate healthier food choices
      for people. More specifically the primary purpose of this project is to evaluate effects in
      healthy humans on cardiometabolic test markers of oat and oat based product. The new
      knowledge will form a base for the development of oat based food products with added health
      values.
