  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the recommended dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab
      (immunotherapy drugs) in pediatric patients with advanced solid and hematological cancers and
      expand in a second phase to test the efficacy of these drugs once this dose is determined.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first time in pediatrics study primarily designed to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of durvalumab and durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab at increasing
      doses in pediatric patients with advanced solid malignancies and hematological malignancies
      (including lymphomas) and for whom no standard of care treatments exist. Although treatment
      efficacy is not a primary objective of this study given its early phase nature, the patients
      screened for this study have no curative options and this study offers the potential of some
      benefit.

      The study will also characterize the PK of durvalumab and durvalumab in combination with
      tremelimumab in children and adolescents and explore potential biological activity and
      immunogenicity by assessing pharmacodynamics, anti drug antibody (ADA) levels, and anti-tumor
      activity. The results from this trial will form the basis for decisions for potential future
      pediatric studies.

    <description>Part 1 (dose finding) Durvalumab + tremelimumab Combination Treatment. Durvalumab and tremelimumab are initially administered at dose level 1 and dose escalated based on results from PK modeling and tolerance to determine the RP2D. Both drugs are administered every 4 weeks as intravenous infusions. Tremelimumab is only administered with durvavalumab for 4 doses, from cycles 2-5. (sarcoma, NB and NHL)
Part 2 (dose expansion phase) Durvalumab + tremelimumab Combination Treatment. Durvalumab and tremelimumab are administered at the RP2D, every 4 weeks as intravenous infusions. Tremelimumab is only administered with durvalumab for 4 doses, from cycles 2-5. (solid tumors, hematological malignancies and HL)
* Patients in the Hodgkin lymphoma cohort will receive durvalumab as monotherapy, administered every 4 weeks as an intravenous infusion. Tremelimumab may be added for 4 doses at time of progression.</description>
