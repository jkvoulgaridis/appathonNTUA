      Primary objective:

      To assess the efficacy of Levopront® in comparison with Libexin® based on daytime cough
      resolution rate by Day 8.

      The daytime cough symptoms resolution corresponds to 0 or 1 points on the &quot;Six-point daytime
      and nighttime cough assessment scale&quot;.

      Secondary objectives:

      Treatment effect assessment in terms of the following efficacy and safety parameters:

        -  To assess the efficacy of Levopront® in comparison with Libexin® based on nighttime
           cough resolution rate by Day 8.

        -  Daytime and nighttime cough symptoms resolution according to &quot;Six-point daytime and
           nighttime cough assessment scale&quot; by Day 4.

        -  Change in severity and frequency of daytime and nighttime cough according to &quot;Six-point
           daytime and nighttime cough assessment scale&quot; on Day 4 and Day 8 from baseline on Day 1.

        -  Cough intensity change according to the visual-analogue scale on Day 4 and Day 8 from
           baseline on Day 1.

        -  Change of FEV1 on Day 8 from baseline values on Day 1.

        -  Rate of Adverse events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) of the various severity
           according to subjective complaints, laboratory test results, physical examination, vital
           signs and spirometry

             study or safety of the patient and interfere his further participation in the study;
             any other concomitant medical or serious mental conditions that make the patient
             unsuitable for participation in the clinical study, limit the validity of receiving an
             informed consent or may affect the patient's ability to participate in the study.
