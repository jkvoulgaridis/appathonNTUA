  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALK-positive lung cancer is a subtype of lung cancer which carries a change in a gene called
      ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase). There are now many drugs for patients with ALK-positive
      lung cancer that slow cancer growth. However, after some time, just as bacteria evolve
      resistance to antibiotics, ALK-positive lung cancers evolve ways to avoid the therapies by
      developing new mutations so the drugs lost their effectiveness. These new mutations can
      potentially be treated with a different drug. For these new therapies, the range of mutations
      that can develop at resistance is not well understood.

      It is now possible to detect the presence of mutations or changes in the genetic structure in
      lung cancer by analyzing a patient's blood for bits of material shed by tumor. This approach
      is often called a liquid biopsy. Recently, researchers have shown that looking at tumor
      molecules through liquid biopsies can provide doctors with some of the same information that
      tissue biopsies provide. For example, liquid biopsies can be used to detect mutations that
      cause drug resistance. Obtaining liquid biopsies on patients with ALK-positive lung cancers
      at resistance to therapy may help better understand the different mutations that develop and
      guide therapy decisions.

      In this research study, a blood specimen will be collected and submitted for liquid biopsy
      analysis at a commercial diagnostic company. This company specializes in analyzing tumor
      material found in blood. Specifically, it will look for genetic changes in the ALK gene that
      could help understand why a cancer has developed drug resistance.

      This research study is for lung cancer patients with ALK-positive lung cancer who had been on
      a newer ALK targeted treatment (such as ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, or lorlatinib) to
      determine whether they have developed ALK resistance mutations. The investigators will
      collect a blood sample to examine these mutations. Participants will not have to have a
      tissue biopsy to participate in this study. Participants do not have to visit Dana-Farber
      Cancer Institute (DFCI) to participate. All study procedures will be performed remotely.

      SPACEWALK is an innovative remote consent and participation study using next-generation
      sequencing (NGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to characterize resistance mechanisms
      arising in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression while on a next
      generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Additionally, the study will capture the
      potential of genomic-driven resistance therapy approach for effecting outcomes in patients
      with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and TKI resistance. Finally, the study will assess the role
      of repeat plasma NGS in evaluating drug response.

      The study will accrue patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC on systemic progression
      (outside the brain) while on treatment with a next-generation ALK TKI. Any patient interested
      in the study will find information about the study on the study website. The patient will
      consent remotely through the study website and documentation of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC
      and systemic progression while on a next-generation ALK TKI. The study team will then reach
      out to the patient to confirm eligibility and send a blood collection kit. In the study kit
      the study participants will find all the necessary materials for local blood draws and
      collected specimens will be sent directly to the central study laboratory (Resolution
      Bioscience) for plasma NGS.

      Plasma NGS of cfDNA will involve sequencing of 19 genes, including ALK, permitting remote
      tumor genotyping. Plasma NGS analysis and results will be done following standard procedures
      of the Resolution Bioscience CLIA-certified laboratory. Results will take 1-2 weeks to be
      sent back to study participants, their physicians and study team. Those plasma NGS reports
      will not include any specific treatment recommendations but will describe the presence of an
      ALK rearrangement, ALK resistance mutation, or other relevant mutations.

      Study participants are then followed remotely. The study coordinator will contact the
      participants weekly for 4 weeks after enrolled into the study to learn of any new treatment
      initiation and to release an additional plasma collection kit 2-4 weeks after starting
      treatment. Study participants will then be remotely contacted every 3 months to follow
      clinical outcomes on therapy for up to 2 years. If the cancer begins to grow again on the
      participant's new treatment, the patient will have the option to provide a third blood
      specimen. Medical records and local imaging will be collected and studied.

      The primary objective of the study is to characterize ALK TKI resistance to next-generation
      ALK TKIs in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. Secondarily, the investigators will
      assess the potential of plasma NGS to impact outcome on treatment by studying time to
      treatment discontinuation (TTD). Serial plasma NGS will also be assessed as a response
      biomarker. A total of 300 patients will be enrolled, with the expectation that approximately
      200 will have tumor-related mutations detected in plasma NGS.

      Blood specimens will be tested for genetic mutations in ALK and other genes that may be
      important for lung cancer. The participant and their doctor will receive a copy of the test
      results. The test results will describe the gene alterations that are detected in the blood
      sample. The assay covers a region of the ALK gene and other lung cancer genes where
      resistance alterations can occur.
