  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the major changes occurring in developed societies is a significant ageing of the
      population. Nowadays, because of an enhanced life expectancy, 17% of the Spanish population
      is composed of people over 65 and the number is expected to rise to 33% in 2050. Aging is
      characterized by a gradual lifelong accumulation of molecular and cellular damage that
      results in a progressive and generalized impairment in several bodily functions, an increased
      vulnerability to environmental challenges and a growing risk of disease and risk of death.
      These facts led to an increase on the prevalence of diseases such as osteoporosis diabetes,
      sarcopenia, obesity or frailty. However, lifestyles such as physical activity could
      attenuated aging process, maintaining the autonomy of elders, and it has been demonstrated
      that even implying guided exercise programs could reverse this condition of frailty and
      dependence.

      In this way, the main aims of this research project are to analyze the effect of a
      multicomponent exercise program in frailty and pre-frailty people above 65 years and without
      cognitive impairment. Thus, it is going to be evaluated at the beginning and the end of the
      study; body composition, physical fitness, blood parameters including vitamin D and other
      health related parameters included in a questionnaire. Secondly, to study the perdurability
      of training-related gains over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The training will consist in a multicomponent exercise program, 3 days a week (Monday,
      Wednesday and Friday). It will take place during morning in groups of 10-14 and trainers will
      be qualified. Alll the exercise will be adapted for different levels of frailty and for their
      functional capacity.

Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) is a brief (5 minutes) and easily scored survey designed specifically to assess physical activity in persons age 65 years and older. The PASE score combines information on leisure, household and occupational activity. The PASE assesses the types of activities typically chosen by older adults (walking, recreational activities, exercise, housework, yard work, and caring for others. A total of 10 questions using frequency, duration, and intensity level of activity over the previous week to assign a score, ranging from 0 to 793, with higher scores indicating greater physical activity. Contribution of each questionnaire item to the overall PASE score is determined by the product of the sample mean and activity weight</description>

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. It descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. The second part of the questionnire records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents. It should be noted that the numerals 1-3 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score.</description>

Second part of MNA evaluates living arrangements, the presence of polypharmacy or pressure ulcers, the number of full meals eaten daily, the amount and frequency of specific foods and fluids, and the mode of feeding. The patient reports nutritional and health status, and the practitioner determines weight and height (to calculate BMI), and mid-arm and mid-calf circumferences. The maximum score for first part is 14; a score of 12 points or greater means disorders.</description>
