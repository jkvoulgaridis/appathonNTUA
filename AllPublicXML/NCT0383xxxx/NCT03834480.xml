      A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted at the department of anesthesiology
      Mansoura University Hospital during the period from December 2017 to January 2019 on fifty
      ASA I-III adult patients, of both sex after approval of IRB (Institutional Review Board) ID
      number MS17.10.03 &amp; IRB date 12-11-2017. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups
      each of 25 patients according to computer-generated random number codes that were placed in
      sealed envelopes, double blinded, with parallel-group comparison.

      Steroid Group (S) (n. 25):- Patients were injected by 4 ml of sterile water containing the
      methylprednisolone Acetate (Depo-Medrol) per-kg calculated dose (0.5mg/kg up to a lean muscle
      body weight of 80kg in the painful sacroiliac joint).

      Platelet rich plasma Group (P) (n. 25):-Patients received fixed volume of 4 ml platelet-rich
      plasma in the inflamed painful sacroiliac joint.

    <description>At the level of the sacral hiatus, the sacral cornuae were identified. posterior aspect of the sacroiliac joint, at 4.5 cm depth the SIJ was found. localal anesthetic was injected at the medial edge of the transducer, the spinal needle was advanced in a medial to lateral direction, under direct vision, until the needle was positioned in the SIJ. Local steroid solution or PRP 4ml volume was injected according to the study group and patient enrollment. If the injection is extra-articular, injectate (hyperechoic solution as it contains particulate steroid) can be seen spreading medially over the sacrum. The visual analog score, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score and the overall success rate basal, after one week,after one month,after three and six month's follow-up period after the initial block.</description>
