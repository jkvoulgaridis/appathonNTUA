  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood clots occurring in the legs and in the lungs are relatively common; they occur in
      around 3 in a 1000 people per year. They can cause disability and are also potentially life
      threatening. When a clot occurs in the legs it is called a deep vein thrombosis or DVT. When
      they occur in the lungs they are called a pulmonary embolism or PE. The risk for DVT and PE
      is higher in people with conditions which cause inflammation. The most common of these are
      inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), rheumatoid arthritis,
      and psoriatic arthritis (a condition comprised of psoriasis and joint inflammation).

      What is not known is how much higher the risk of DVT and PE is in these groups compared with
      people without inflammatory disease, and what causes the excess risk in these people. This
      study aims to assess the measure the exact increase in risk for DVT and PE in people with
      these inflammatory conditions and to identify which risk factors are most strongly associated
      with the increased risk. These data should help with an understand the causes of blood clot
      risk in these inflammatory conditions and in identify targets for reducing risk.

      Background

      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis
      (DVT), are common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. VTE risk is higher
      in chronic inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) compared to the general population. Evidence for differential VTE risk in
      other inflammatory diseases, notably psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and vasculitis, is more
      limited. Risk factors for VTE have been described in the general population, but there has
      been little interrogation of VTE risk factors for individuals with chronic inflammatory
      conditions and their association with subsequent VTE.

      Objective

      This study aims to describe the prevalence of VTE risk and risk factors in individuals with
      systemic inflammatory disorders in a contemporary real-world population, by disease type
      (IBD, RA, and PsA) and relative to a control population without systemic inflammatory
      disease. In the same cohorts a further comparison will be performed of the influence of VTE
      risk factors on risk of VTE events in individuals with systemic inflammatory disorders.

      Method

      A retrospective cohort study will be performed to compare VTE risk and VTE risk factors in
      adults with IBD, RA, and PsA and matched controls between January 1, 1998 and January 1,
      2018, within the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance
      Centre (RSC) network. In the cohorts with and without inflammatory conditions estimate will
      be determined for the risk of VTE overall, and for PE and DVT separately, using unadjusted
      Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by matched set (exposed cohort versus unexposed
      cohort), to provide overall hazard ratios for the association with each outcome. Models will
      be subsequently adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical and VTE risk factors in
      multivariable analysis to explore potentially important associations with VTE. The same
      analyses for each autoimmune condition will be repeated separately. Prespecified sensitivity
      analyses will be performed to explore the robustness of any potential associations.

        The exposed cohort will include all individuals with an existing or incident diagnosis of
        IBD, RA or PsA (systemic inflammatory diseases) in the RCGP RSC over the study period. IBD,
        RA or PsA will be identified using Read diagnostic codes previously validated in UK primary
        care studies.

        The matched unexposed cohort will be defined by matching individuals in the exposed cohort
        with individuals who have never been diagnosed with a systemic inflammatory disease either
        prior to or during the study period by age and sex at GP practice level. Unexposed
        individuals will require at least one year of follow-up when matched to minimize the risk
        they had a non-recorded existing diagnosis of a systemic inflammatory disease of interest.
        Follow-up for each matched individual will begin at the start of follow-up of their matched
        counterpart.
