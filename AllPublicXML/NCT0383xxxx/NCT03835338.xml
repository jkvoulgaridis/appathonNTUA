      WATCH-Rhythm is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, investigation to collect safety and
      effectiveness data on combining conventional AF ablation with LAA electric isolation and
      occlusion within a single procedure.

      The primary objective is to test the effectiveness of adding LAA electrical isolation and
      closure to conventional atrial fibrillation versus conventional atrial fibrillation alone in
      treating patient with persistent atrial fibrillation from a single procedure.

      This study will be conducted at up to 10 global sites in the European Union (United Kingdom,
      Spain, Germany, or others). The maximum enrollment ceiling for the Watch-Rhythm study is 278
      subjects. Included in the enrollment ceiling are up to 20 roll-in subjects and a maximum of
      258 randomized subjects.

      The duration of the study is expected to last approximately 4 years. Enrollment is expected
      to take approximately 24 months. The duration of individual subject participation is expected
      to last approximately 2 years but may vary per subject.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is of legal age to participate in the study per the laws of their
             respective geography.

          2. The subject has documented non-valvular persistent AF. For this protocol, the
             definition of persistent AF is sustained arrhythmia lasting at least 7-days but less
             than 36 months.

          3. The subject is able to tolerate OAC post ablation.

          4. Subject is able to undergo TEE.

          5. The subject or legal representative is able to understand and willing to provide
             written informed consent to participate in the trial

          6. The subject is willing and capable of attending all follow-up visits at the
             investigational site as medically appropriate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is unable or unwilling to return for required follow-up visits and
             examinations.

          2. The subject had or is planning to have any invasive cardiac procedure within 30 days
             prior to randomization (e.g., cardioversion, ablation).

          3. Previous AF ablation (surgical or percutaneous).

          4. Prior MAZE procedure.

        4. The subject is planning to have any cardiac or non-cardiac invasive or surgical
        procedure that would necessitate stopping or modifying the protocol required medication
        regimen within 90 days after the WATCHMAN Closure Device implant (e.g., cardioversion,
        ablation, cataract surgery).

        5. The subject had a prior BARC type 3 or 4 bleeding event within the 14 days prior to
        randomization. Lack of resolution of related clinical sequelae, or planned and pending
        interventions to resolve bleeding/bleeding source, are a further exclusion regardless of
        timing of the bleeding event.

        6. The subject had a prior stroke (of any cause) or TIA within the 30 days prior to
        randomization.

        7. The subject had a prior BARC type 3 or 4 bleeding event within the 14 days prior to
        randomization. Lack of resolution of related clinical sequelae, or planned and pending
        interventions to resolve bleeding/bleeding source, or a further exclusion regardless of
        timing of the bleeding event.

        8. The subject has a history of atrial septal repair or has an ASD/PFO device. 9. The
        subject has an implanted mechanical valve prosthesis in any position. 10. The subject
        suffers from New York Heart Association Class IV Congestive Heart Failure.

        11. Subject has LVEF &lt;30% 12. Subject has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 13. The subject has
        had a myocardial infarction (MI) documented in the clinical record as either a non-ST
        elevation MI (NSTEMI) or as an ST elevation MI (STEMI), with or without intervention,
        within 90 days prior to randomization.

        14. The subject is of childbearing potential and is, or plans to become pregnant during the
        time of the study (method of assessment upon study physician's discretion).

        15. The subject is currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
        would directly interfere with the current study, except when the subject is participating
        in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational registry with no associated
        treatments. Each instance should be brought to the attention of the sponsor to determine
        eligibility.

        16. The subject has a documented life expectancy of less than two years. 17. The subject
        has a known or suspected hypercoagulable state
