    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839
      hydrochloride, and to see how well it works when given together with osimertinib in treating
      patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and a mutation in the EGFR gene.
      Glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride and osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib (AZD9291) and glutaminase inhibitor
      CB-839 hydrochloride (CB-839 HCl) (telaglenastat) and determine the recommended phase II dose
      (RP2D) in patients with metastatic, EGFR activating mutation-positive non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of AZD9291 and CB-839 HCl
      (telaglenastat) in patients with metastatic, EGFR activating mutation-positive, T790M
      mutation-negative NSCLC who have developed progressive disease (PD) on front-line EGFR
      inhibitor therapy, as defined by response rate (RR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine toxicity profile of the combination of AZD9291 and CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat)
      in patients with metastatic EGFR activating mutation positive NSCLC. (Phase I) II. To assess
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and AZD9291 in patients with
      metastatic EGFR activating mutation positive NSCLC. (Phase I) III. To determine the
      progression free survival (PFS) of AZD9291 and CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) in patients with
      EGFR mutation positive, T790M mutation negative NSCLC who have developed progressive disease
      (PD) on front-line EGFR inhibitor therapy. (Phase II) IV. To determine the overall survival
      (OS) of AZD9291 and CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) in patients with EGFR mutation positive, T790M
      mutation negative NSCLC who have developed PD on front-line EGFR inhibitor therapy. (Phase
      II)

      EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) and measure changes with response
      to treatment as well as disease progression (EGFR sensitizing mutations, T790M resistance
      mutation, recognized bypass mechanisms). (Phase II) II. To assess circulating levels of
      glutamine, glutamate, aspartate and asparagine, and measure changes with response to
      treatment as well as disease progression. (Phase II) III. To assess 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
      (18F-FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) parameters at baseline and after treatment to
      evaluate changes with response to treatment as well as emergence of disease resistance or
      progression. (Phase II - select patients)

      IV. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq), in
      order to:

      IVa. To identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers beyond any genomic alteration
      by which treatment may be assigned.

      IVb. To identify resistance mechanisms using genomic DNA- and RNA-based assessment platforms.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839
      hydrochloride followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and
      osimertinib PO once daily (QD) (starting cycle 1 day 16 of phase I). Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

             the first cycle of therapy. Patients on corticosteroids for the treatment of brain
             metastases will be permitted as long as the dose is =&lt; 10 mg of prednisone-equivalent

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled
             hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize
             compliance with the protocol, or active infection with human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not required
