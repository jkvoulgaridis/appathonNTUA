  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to develop a social media delivered intervention to reduce
      unprotected sun exposure in young adults with a history of tanning.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will use social marketing theory and a user-centered design approach to develop a social
      media intervention that engages young adults with a history of tanning to practice sun safety
      behaviors. We will incentivize young adults who have a history of tanning to create social
      media posts that encourage their peers to engage in sun safety. Focus groups of tanners
      guided the development of the intervention. Investigators will conduct a pilot feasibility
      trial where participants will be randomized to a condition in which they are incentivized to
      create sun safety social media messages to be posted on a sun safety social media account or
      a condition in which they are incentivized to create social media messages about how to use
      technology to support healthy lifestyle behaviors to be posted on a health technology social
      media account. The intervention will last 4 weeks. Feasibility outcomes include recruitment,
      retention, acceptability, participation, social media message engagement (likes, comments,
      shares), persuasive impact of messages, unprotected sun exposure, sun protection, and tanning
      behavior. This work will inform a fully powered randomized trial testing the efficacy of this
      intervention.

    <description>Participants will attend a webinar to learn how to create effective social media posts about sun safety and be oriented to the social media accounts on which the messages will be posted. They will be informed that posts should include a sun safety message (e.g., promoting sunscreen use and protective clothing/hats or discouraging risk behaviors like tanning and burning). They will be encouraged to be creative so that the message gets likes and shares. Participants will be encouraged to follow the feeds to see the engagement on their posts, to share the posts in their feed, and to see other participants' posts. Participants will receive a $10 Amazon gift card per post for a maximum of 6 posts ($60). The participant who created the post that receives the most likes, comments, and shares each week will win a $50 Amazon gift card.</description>
