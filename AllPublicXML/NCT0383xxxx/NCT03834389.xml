    <textblock>
      Second-year nursing students are randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The
      case-based teaching method was applied to the experimental group and the classical teaching
      method was applied to the control group. After the initiative, both groups observed
      differences in perceived competence and critical thinking levels. In addition, the focus
      groups were interviewed with the experimental group and the opinions and suggestions about
      the initiative were evaluated qualitatively and the total mix method was used.

    <textblock>
      Nursing secondary school students were randomized into two groups. Case-based training was
      given to the experimental group, and classical training was given to the control group.
      Critical thinking scale and self-efficacy scale both before and after the training were
      applied to both groups. Posttest scores were calculated and compared for both groups. The
      focus group consultation with 10 people from the experimental group was carried out and the
      opinions and suggestions about the initiative were taken and evaluated. Permission was
      obtained in writing from all institutions before and after the participants, and the study
      was conducted by creating ethical conditions.Four separate training cases were given to the
      experimental group. the control group continued the classical training and no intervention
      was made.

    <measure>CRITICAL THINKING TENDENCY SCALE</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed by a Turkish researcher and reliability of validity was done. The scale covers 49.161% of the variance. Factor loads range from 0.33 to 0.71. Sub-dimensions: metacity, flexibility, systematicness, determination and patience, open mindedness. The scale consists of 49 questions in total. Scale your scale; I totally agree (5), I mostly agree (4), Partially agree (3), I mostly do not agree (2), I never agree (1). The test retest correlation coefficient of the scale was 0.761 and the correlation coefficient between the two half scores was 0.95. The Cronbach Alpha coefficient is 0.963. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed with the AMOS program (Ratio = 2778.981, Sd = 1073, X2 / Sd = 2.590, GFI = 0.903, CFI = 0.932, RMSEA = 0.038). The total score ranges from 49 to 245, with a high score indicating a high tendency to think critically</description>

    <measure>Effect of case-based learning method on self-efficacy level</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The German version was originally used by Schwarzer. It was originally prepared as 20 items, then reduced to 10 items. Over time, it has been translated and used in more than twenty languages. Item total correlations are between 0.30 and 0.77. Reliability of Turkish validity was done; Alpha internal consistency coefficient was 0.79-0.63, total alpha coefficient was 0.83. Test-retest reliability coefficient of the scale is r = 0.80, p &lt;0.001. Factor analys's results of the Turkish version show that it accounts for 47% of the total variance. The item total score correlation coefficients are between 0.37 and 0.59. The items of the scale have scores ranging from 1 to 4, with a total score ranging from 10 to 40. High score is considered as high self-efficacy perception.</description>
