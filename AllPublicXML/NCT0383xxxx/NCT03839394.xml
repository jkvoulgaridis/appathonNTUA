    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of a case manager/social worker
      administered, telephone-based educational curriculum in improving cardiovascular disease
      related outcomes among HIV-infected clinic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty high Cardiovascular Disease Risk (CVD) risk clinic patients will be randomized 1:1 to
      receive either a series of educational pamphlets on CVD risk reduction plus a telephone-based
      CVD risk reduction curriculum delivered over 24 weeks [intervention arm], or the educational
      pamphlets alone [control arm]. Anthropomorphic data, blood pressure and lipid profiles will
      be obtained from patients to assess the efficacy of the intervention in reducing blood
      pressure and serum low-density lipoprotein levels (LDL).

    <description>A series of educational pamphlets on CVD risk reduction plus a telephone-based CVD risk reduction curriculum will be administered by Clinic-Based Case Managers (CCMs). Six modules will be given over 24 weeks in a rotating fashion on topics relevant to CVD risk. Subjects will be given the pamphlets every 2 weeks corresponding with the first time they receive the telephone - based module.</description>
