      Primary Objective The objective is to determine the feasibility and agreement of remote
      evaluation of resting heart rate and HRV using the commercially available WHOOP® wrist
      monitor, compared to in-office measurements using AtCor Medical SphygmoCor HRV Software, in a
      cohort of 40 St. Jude Life Study participants with a history of mantle radiation for
      management of Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Elucidating the mechanisms that contribute to adverse cardiovascular outcomes and reduced
      quality of life among the growing population of childhood cancer survivors is paramount.
      Cancer, certain cancer drugs, radiation therapy, cancer-associated lifestyle disturbances,
      and cancer-independent comorbidities combine to predispose cancer survivors to autonomic
      dysfunction (AD). Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been described in various cancer
      cohorts. Furthermore, these markers of AD have been implicated in adverse outcomes in
      oncology patients, including increased mortality, exercise limitation, and fatigue. However,
      data are largely derived from small studies with methodological limitations, and the
      contribution of AD to overall morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors is not well
      understood.

      The objective is to determine the feasibility and agreement of remote evaluation of resting
      heart rate and HRV using the commercially available WHOOP® wrist monitor, compared to
      in-office measurements using AtCor Medical SphygmoCor HRV Software, in a cohort of 40 St.
      Jude Life Study participants with a history of mantle radiation for management of Hodgkin
      lymphoma.

      At St. Jude Children's Research Hospital survivors who meet the eligibility criteria will be
      identified from SJLIFE participants and contacted for potential participation via phone. If
      the SJLIFE participant expresses interest they will be e-mailed or faxed a copy of the
      consent form; the consent conference will occur via phone and e-mail or facsimile will be
      used to document informed consent. Once the consent signature page is received and the
      participant is enrolled on study, a WHOOP® wrist monitor and directions for wearing the
      device will be mailed to the participant. Feasibility will be assessed by evaluating how many
      participants wear and return the device with enough data for analysis. The investigator will
      consider the project feasible if 30 of 40 participants have 3 hours of usable data after
      removal of noise. Upon arrival at St. Jude for the St Jude LIFE study, the participant will
      undergo in-office measurement of HRV while also wearing the WHOOP® device. A standard
      10-minute electrocardiogram recording will be performed with the participant in a supine
      position, with a regular and calm breathing pattern in a quiet room. The standard deviation
      of normal RR intervals (SDNN, msec) will be derived from SphygmoCor HRV Software. SDNN during
      this 10-minute time period will be derived from WHOOP® HRV software. Agreement between
      measures of SDNN derived by the two techniques will be assessed. A mean discrepancy of &lt;20
      msec for SDNN measured by the two methods will be considered acceptable agreement.
