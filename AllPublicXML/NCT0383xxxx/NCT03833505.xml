    <textblock>
      Background. Bruxism is an involuntary, non-functional activity of the masticatory system, and
      is frequently seen in childhood. Bruxism has many aetiologies, like malocclusion,
      psychological factors, allergies and gastrointestinal disorders.

      Aim. To investigate the relationship between Enterobius vermicularis infection and bruxism in
      children.

      Bruxism has many aetiologies, like occlusal interferences, malocclusion, malnutrition,
      psychological factors, allergies and gastrointestinal disorders. Among these gastrointestinal
      disorders, are various intestinal parasitic infections.

      Given the controversy surrounding the potential association between bruxism and intestinal
      parasitic infestations, both important health issues, this study sought to evaluate the
      relationship between E. vermicularis infection and bruxism in E. vermicularis-positive and E.
      vermicularis-negative 3-10-year-olds children with bruxism.

    <description>The patients who had a teeth-grinding habit were invited to, our clinic for clinical evaluation of bruxism. Patients were examined under a reflector light with inspection, palpation and mirror-sond. The extraoral examination evaluated mandibular asymmetry, joint sounds, deviation/deflection during opening/closing actions, sensitivity to palpation of masticatory muscles and pain/tenderness, sensitivity to palpation of the temporomandibular joint and masseter muscle hypertrophy10. The intraoral examination assessed the presence of wear facets on the teeth, according to a modification of the method by Johansson. The assessed teeth included primary incisors, canines and molars, permanent incisors and lower first molars. Scores were calculated as follows: 0 = no wear (none); 1 = enamel wear only (mild); 2 = enamel and dentin wear (moderate); 3 = significant loss of tooth structure (severe).</description>
