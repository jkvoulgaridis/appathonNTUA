  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a major health concern in obese older Veterans, especially in those who are
      African American. The negative impact of diabetes on muscle and physical function contributes
      to metabolic as well as physical decline and is under-studied. This randomized controlled
      trial compares a higher-protein, weight loss regimen previously shown to improve physical
      function to an Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) protein intervention in obese older male
      Veterans with pre-diabetes and functional limitations. Equal numbers of white and black male
      Veterans will be studied, filling gaps in the investigators' knowledge of differential
      responses by race as well as obesity interventions for men in general. The primary outcome is
      functional performance by Short Physical Performance Battery and secondary measures include
      muscle quality, insulin sensitivity, lean body mass, physical activity, recent falls and fear
      of falling, instrumental activities of daily living, and quality of life measured at 0, 3 and
      6 months. The goal of this research is to accelerate functional recovery and enhance
      independence in obese male Veterans, which is strongly aligned with the RR&amp;D mission to
      &quot;maximize the physical and social autonomy of Veterans&quot;.

    <textblock>
      This study examines an evidence-based obesity intervention as a means of reducing the impact
      of prediabetes on muscle function in obese older men of white and black race. A total of 168
      obese (BMI 30 kg/m2) male Veterans aged 60 yrs, with mild to moderate functional impairments
      (Short Physical Performance Battery score of 4 to 10 units) and prediabetes, will be
      randomized to a higher-protein weight loss treatment (HP-WL) or an RDA-level protein control
      weight loss treatment (C-WL). All participants receive individualized calorie prescriptions
      calculated to achieve a weight loss of ~1-2 pounds per week and attend weekly group support
      sessions designed to enhance diet compliance with goal setting, self-monitoring, stress
      management, and daily diet journaling. They will also attend a weekly low impact, chair
      exercise class. HP-WL participants are provided a supply of chilled/frozen high-quality
      protein foods (lean meats, low fat dairy products) sufficient to give 30 g high quality
      protein for two of three meals daily to help assure diet compliance. C-WL participants are
      provided 1 serving per day of high quality protein to avoid unintentional bias. Treatment
      responses will be compared for the primary outcome of functional performance by Short
      Physical Performance Battery and important secondary measures, including muscle quality,
      insulin sensitivity, lean body mass, physical activity, recent falls and fear of falling,
      instrumental activities of daily living, and quality of life at 0, 3 and 6 months. An
      exploratory aim examines potential mediators of racial differences in treatment responses and
      documents the most successful intervention strategies. This will be the first randomized
      controlled trial of a balanced, higher-protein diet during a metabolic challenge (caloric
      restriction) in those with prediabetes and the first study to look at racial differences in
      responses of obese older men to this regimen. Study findings will fulfill the RR&amp;D mission by
      advancing interventions to improve physical function in older Veterans, yield novel
      information about the impact of balanced, higher protein on muscle quality and insulin
      sensitivity, and explore racial differences in responses to obesity interventions.

The PSQI includes a scoring key for calculating a patient's seven subscores, each of which can range from 0 to 3. The subscores are tallied, yielding a &quot;global&quot; score that can range from 0 to 21. A global score of 5 or more indicates poor sleep quality; the higher the score, the worse the quality.</description>
