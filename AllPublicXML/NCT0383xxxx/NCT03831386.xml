  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural effusion remains a debilitating complication of end stage cancer, which can
      be greatly improved by the introduction of the indwelling tunneled pleural catheter (IPC).
      However, there is no standard of care regarding drainage and limited data on the utility of
      different drainage techniques. In addition, many patients develop discomfort and chest pain
      during drainage. The investigators propose to evaluate gravity drainage and suction drainage
      on quality of life measures and outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indwelling tunneled pleural catheters (IPCs) are used to alleviate pleural effusion as a
      first-line therapeutic (albeit palliative) intervention. Limited data currently exists on
      drainage techniques and the impact the techniques may have on quality of life. Current
      recommendations for IPC drainage range from daily drainage to once a week drainage, as well
      as only when needed for dyspnea. It has been theorized that active drainage of effusions may
      have an impact on the development of chest discomfort/pain, whereas passive regimens may
      allow for more gradual intrathoracic pleural changes and potentially offer a difference in
      drainage discomfort.

      The objective of this investigation is to compare different drainage strategies of indwelling
      pleural catheters (IPCs) regarding patient quality of life and outcomes. Patients will
      undergo placement of a pleural catheter as per standard institutional protocol. Patients will
      be randomized on a 1:1 basis into the suction drainage (active) arm or the gravity drainage
      (passive) arm. Patients will receive follow-up at two weeks, four weeks, twelve weeks and
      then as needed post IPC placement per standard clinical protocol. All patients will be asked
      to fill out quality of life questionnaires and update drainage diary information with
      patient's providers.

      Patients will undergo standard care treatment throughout the disease course and no different
      interventions regarding the pleural disease will be performed as a result of enrollment
      within this study. Study interventions/procedures will consist of questionnaires and patient
      self-reported documentation regarding patient's care and outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in chest pain as assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily, up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the difference between the mean daily change in pain score during IPC drainage via the vacuum bottle technique and IPC drainage via the gravity bag technique over two weeks after IPC placement. Pre-drainage and post-drainage pain scores will be recorded each day of IPC placement. Measurements are in millimeters along a 10 cm VAS. VAS score is a range of 0 to 100. Lower limit is 0, meaning no pain; upper limit is 100, meaning extreme pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean difference in chest pain as assessed by VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-IPC placement, 12 weeks post IPC placement or time of pleurodesis</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary endpoint is the difference between the change in pain scores via vacuum bottle vs. gravity bag pre-IPC placement to the last available score after IPC placement. This last available score would be at 12 weeks or time of pleurodesis. Measurements are in millimeters along a 10 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). VAS score is a range of 0 to 100. Lower limit is 0, meaning no pain; upper limit is 100, meaning extreme pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SF 36-Item Health Survey score</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-IPC placement, 12 weeks post IPC placement or time of pleurodesis</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary endpoint is the difference between SF 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 scores via vacuum bottle vs. gravity bag from pre-IPC drainage to last available score after IPC placement (at 12 weeks or time of pleurodesis). Scoring is a 2-step process in which the numerical response from the Survey is first converted into a 0-100 scale (0 as lowest and 100 as highest possible score) using a conversion table by SF developers. These new values would be averaged according to their group identified in a second conversion table.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Dyspnea survey score</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-IPC placement, 12 weeks post IPC placement or time of pleurodesis</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary endpoint is the difference between FACIT-Dyspnea scores via vacuum bottle vs. gravity bag from pre-IPC drainage to the last available score after IPC placement (at 12 weeks or time of pleurodesis). Individual responses are converted into scores, then summed for an overall score. Scores range from 0 (lower limit) to 30 (high limit); the higher the score, the worse the dyspnea.</description>
