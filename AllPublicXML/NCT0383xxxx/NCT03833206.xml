    <description>Change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to week 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in patients taking 1 or 2 PDC-1421 capsules. The MADRS is a 10-item checklist including 1) depression [apparent]; 2) depression [reported]; 3) loss of interest; 4) suicidal ideation; 5) tension; 6) reduced appetite; 7) insomnia; 8) difficulty in activities; 9) concentration; and 10) pessimism. The MADRS is administered by a trained interviewer. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-6, with anchors at 2-point intervals; higher scores indicating more severity (i.e., ranging from 0 [no sadness] to 6 [extremely despondent]). The total score is used to define treatment response (≥50% reduction from baseline) and partial response (20-49% reduction from baseline). Remission is defined as a score of &lt; 10. The following are used as an interpretation of scores:
0 to 6 - normal/symptom absent 7 to 19 - mild depression 20 to 34 - moderate depression &gt;34 - severe depression</description>

          -  Subjects who were non-responsive to two or more courses of antidepressant medications
             given at an adequate dosage* for symptom treatment within four weeks, or by the
             judgment of the investigator considered to have treatment resistant depression (TRD),

             (volume)x 0.79 (density of alcohol). Result of serum ethanol test should be equal to
             or lower than 10.0 mg/dL to be determined as eligible for the trial. If test result is
             between 10.1 to 29.9 mg/dL, only one re-test is allowed per subject to meet the
