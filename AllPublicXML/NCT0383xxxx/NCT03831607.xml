        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stable chronic renal failure patients who have undergone hemodialysis 3 times per week
             for at least 12 weeks until screening examination.

          -  Met certain conditions for dialysis excluding Dry Weight (Dialysate, Dialyzer,
             Frequency of Dialysis per Week, Dialysis Time, Blood Flow Rate, and Dialysate and
             Substitution Fluid Flow Rate) 2 weeks before screening examination.

          -  Taking at least 2 tablets of phosphate binder 3 times per day. The prescribed dosage
             regimen should have been unchanged for the period from 2 weeks before screening
             examination through pre-enrollment.

          -  Serum phosphorus levels should be between 3.5 and 7.0 mg/dL (inclusive) at screening
             examination.

          -  If on any vitamin D or calcimimetics regimen, the dosage regimen should have been
             unchanged for the last 2 weeks before screening examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  iPTH &gt; 600 pg/mL (should be based on the most recent value from patient's medical
             records before pre-enrollment)

          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or diarrhea predominant irritable bowel
             syndrome

          -  History of gastrectomy or enterectomy (excluding endoscopic resection and cecectomy)
             or having undergone gastrointestinal tract surgery within 3 months before screening
             examination.

          -  Severe heart disease (including congestive heart failure, defined as New York Heart
             Association [NYHA] cardiac functional classification of Class III or IV, and vascular
             lesions requiring hospitalization such as myocardial infarction), hepatic impairment
             (including AST/ALT â‰¥ 100 U/L before the start of observation period), or concurrent
             cirrhosis.

          -  Developed cerebrovascular disease (such as cerebral infarction and cerebral
             hemorrhage) or cardiovascular disease (such as acute myocardial infarction and
             unstable angina) requiring hospitalization within 6 months before screening
             examination.

          -  Uncontrollable hypertension or diabetes

          -  Scheduled for living donor kidney transplant, change in the mode of dialysis, home
             hemodialysis or plans to change the dialysis center (relocate to another
             hospital/clinic) during the study period.

          -  Any diagnosis of or treatment of malignancy within 5 years before screening
             examination (excluding basal cell carcinoma or surgically resected intraepithelial
             carcinoma of uterine cervix).
