  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single centre, evaluator-blind study of the safety and performance of fractional
      radiofrequency (RF) for the treatment and reduction of facial wrinkles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate 15 subjects requesting treatment of their facial wrinkles. The study
      will involve three treatments on both sides of the face with 3-5 week intervals between each
      treatment. Subjects will be followed at 6 and 12 weeks after their last treatment. Analysis
      will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one treatment. An additional
      histological analysis will be conducted including up to 12 of the participating subjects.
