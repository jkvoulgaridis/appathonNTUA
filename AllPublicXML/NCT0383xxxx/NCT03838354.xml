  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowdays HDACi's were more and more focused on the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
      activities,independent of their known proapoptotic or cell cycle arrest actions on malignant
      cells. Low concentrations of HDACi's are effective in reducing inflammation and autoimmune
      response in humans with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and animal models of inflammatory bowel
      disease and arthritis. The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in
      China. In order to report the efficacy and safety of the low dose chidamide in the management
      of refractory ITP.

      The investigators are undertaking a prospective, open, multicentre trial of 30 refractory ITP
      adult patients from 5 medical centers in China. 1/2 of the participants are randomly selected
      to receive Chidamide in 2.5 mg po tiw, every four weeks for one cycle and it will be given
      three cycles. The other part will receive Chidamide in 5 mg po tiw, every four weeks for one
      cycle and it will be given three cycles. The treatment was discontinued after 3 months
      without blood index reaction. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated
      before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order
      to report the efficacy and safety of the low dose chidamide in the management of refractory
      ITP.
