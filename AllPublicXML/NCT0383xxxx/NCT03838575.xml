  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) pragmatic, blinded (patient and outcome
      assessor) multicentre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an internal pilot, to evaluate
      the use of three in-theatre interventions to reduce SSI rates in patients undergoing surgery
      with an abdominal incision. ROSSINI 2 is a non-factorial superiority design with allocation
      of various combinations of the three interventions to be used during the same operation, via
      seven possible treatment arms plus one control arm initially.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of ROSSINI 2 is to determine whether three specific in-theatre
      interventions, alone or in combination, result in decreased rates of surgical site infection
      (SSI) up to 30 days post operation in adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

      Ten local NHS hospitals will participate in the pilot phase of ROSSINI 2 and at least 60 NHS
      hospitals in the UK will participate in the main phase of ROSSINI 2.

      Approximately 6610 patients will be required to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction in the
      intervention arm(s) (15% to 10%) with 85% power.

      Three health technologies will be assessed versus their control arms (standard care):

        1. 2% alcoholic chlorhexidine skin preparation, versus any other standard skin preparation

        2. Iodophor-impregnated incise drape, versus no drape

        3. Gentamicin-impregnated implants/ sponge at closure, versus no implant

    <intervention_model_description>This major, multicentre, multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) trial with the opportunity to cease (and introduce) arms would be the first of its kind in a surgical setting. In addition to generating new knowledge in our primary research area, by utilising this advanced design in the context of our relatively simple primary endpoint of SSI, it will also pave the way for future efficient and rapid trials in other aspects of surgical care.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>ROSSINI 2 is a double blind trial; both the patient and outcome assessor will be blinded to the intraoperative intervention(s). It is not possible to blind the operating surgeon to the intervention allocation.
The following measures will be taken to ensure concealment of the chosen intervention(s) (blinding):
Randomisation in theatre after induction of anaesthesia
The intraoperative interventions used will not be documented in the operation notes or in the patient's notes.
The skin around the closed wound will be wiped clean using a wet sterile towel at the end of the procedure to prevent unblinding.
Clinical follow-up will be conducted by a trained surgeon or a trained member of the local research team who did not participate in the index procedure or surgery.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SSI rate up to 30 days after surgery as defined according to the 2017 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention Criteria.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The CDC definition will be used in ROSSINI 2 to identify deep incisional or superficial incisional SSIs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>30-day postoperative mortality rate (POMR).</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-day postoperative mortality rate (POMR) is determined as death of a patient within the first 30 postoperative days, with day of surgery taken as day 0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>30-day postoperative complication rate.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-day postoperative complication rate is determined as the highest level Clavien-Dindo grade complication measured in the first 30 postoperative days, with day of surgery taken as day 0. Any deviation from the normal postoperative course that has an adverse effect on the patient and is not either a treatment failure or sequel, is a complication. The Clavien-Dindo classification determines the severity of a complication based on the therapeutic consequence of that complication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serious Adverse Events up to 30 days.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an untoward occurrence that:
Results in death
Is life threatening
Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
Consists of a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is otherwise considered medically significant by the Investigator
As ROSSINI 2 is a non - CTIMP, BCTU will not be collecting Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs). We will however be collecting Related and Unexpected SAEs.
A Related and Unexpected Serious Adverse Event (RUSAE) means a SAE occurring to a research participant which in the opinion of the Chief Investigator was:
'Related' that is, it resulted from the administration of any of the research procedures, and
'Unexpected' that is, the type of event is not listed in the protocol as an expected occurrence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of hospital stay after surgery as measured from the date of surgery to the date of discharge.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from the date of surgery (Day 0) to the date of discharge (expected to be within 30 days.)</time_frame>
    <description>Length of hospital stay after surgery will be a 'Time to event' outcome, this will be compared between treatment groups using standard survival analysis methods. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be constructed for visual presentation of time-to-event comparisons. Cox proportional hazard models will be fitted to obtain adjusted treatment effects which will be expressed as hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <description>QoL will be assessed using the widely validated EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire at baseline (preoperative), as an inpatient (day 7 or at discharge if sooner) and day 30 mirroring the timings of blinded wound assessment.</description>

    <description>This intervention describes the preparation of the intact skin incision site immediately prior to incision, using chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) in an alcohol-based solution, providing durable sterilisation of the surgical field. Pre-prepared applicators will be available for use in this trial (ChloraPrep™ sticks, 2% CHG with 70% isopropyl alcohol, BD Infection Prevention).</description>
