  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensory Over-Responsivity (SOR) is characterized by a disruption in regulating sensory
      stimuli and can significantly impact pain perception and restrict daily participation and
      quality of life. Altered neurophysiological processes in SOR are documented, revealing
      reduced electroencephalogram at rest and P300 amplitudes, the latter tested through
      event-related potentials (ERP). Both may explain the failure to regulate incoming sensory
      stimuli. Neurofeedback (NF) therapy, a remedial treatment approach, aims at self-regulating
      the brain's neural activity and has proven its efficiency in treating comorbid SMD syndromes.

      Our study aims to investigate NF therapy efficiency in decreasing pain sensitivity, enhancing
      auditory ERP components of P300, increasing the power of the alpha band, life-satisfaction
      and Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) scores in adults with SOR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this serial experimental research design, 10 individuals with SOR aged 21-45 years will
      participate. A medical and demographic questionnaire and the Sensory Responsiveness
      Questionnaire-Intensity Scale (SRQ-IS) will be applied to screen for participation
      eligibility. Outcome measures will be conducted at 4-time points (1. baseline- 3 weeks
      pre-treatment; 2. before the first treatment session; 3. after the last treatment session;
      and 4. a month post-treatment) applying: The Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), the P300
      component using a neurophysiological assessment of the 'Oddball paradigm', the alpha power
      using electroencephalogram resting state, and electronic versions of the Satisfaction with
      Life Scale, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, and the Pain
      Sensitivity Questionnaire. Sixteen individually therapy sessions of 45 minutes each, twice a
      week, will be held at the same time of day.

      Repeated measures ANOVA or a non-parametric equivalent will be used to analyze the dependent
      variables measures change over time.
