  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that sub-mental ultrasonography measures are strongly
      correlated with the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome and the related specific
      subjective scales.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold-standard diagnose tool for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
      However, the availability of PSG is limited, particularly in developing and / or least
      developed countries. Sub-mental ultrasonography is stepped forward with its practical and
      cheap nature and its widespread use.

      The investigators aimed to perform sub-mental ultrasonography to the patients who underwent
      to PSG by a blind-to-the-PSG-results radiologist and analyse the correlation between
      ultrasound measures, Apnea-Hypopnea Index (measured by Polysomnography) and subjective OSA
      scales.

    <measure>Stop-Bang questionnaire</measure>

    <description>This questionnaire evaluates the risk of sleep apnea. Low risk of OSA: Yes to 0-2 questions Intermediate risk of OSA: Yes to 3-4 questions High risk of OSA: Yes to 5-8 questions or Yes to 2 or more of 4 STOP questions + male gender or Yes to 2 or more of 4 STOP questions + BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 or Yes to 2 or more of 4 STOP questions + neck circumference.</description>

    <measure>Berlin Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of 3 categories related to the risk of having sleep apnea.
Category 1 is positive if the total score is 2 or more points. Category 2 is positive if the total score is 2 or more points. Category 3 is positive if the answer to item 10 is 'Yes' or if the BMI of the patient is greater than 30kg/m2. (BMI is defined as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared, i.e.., kg/m2). Patients can be classified into High Risk or Low Risk based on their responses to the individual items and their overall scores in the symptom categories. High Risk: if there are 2 or more categories where the score is positive. Low Risk: if there is only 1 or no categories where the score is positive. Total score is ranged between 0-3.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The order of the PSQI items has been modified from the original order in order to fit the first 9 items (which are the only items that contribute to the total score) on a single page. Item 10, which is the second page of the scale, does not contribute to the PSQI score. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
