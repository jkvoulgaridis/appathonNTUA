      The primary objectives of the proposed pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be to
      examine: (1) the feasibility of a full RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of two popular types
      of physical activity (PA), a yoga training program and an aerobic dance training program, in
      female adolescents (13 to 18 years old) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) compared to
      a wait list control group; and (2) the acceptability of these interventions. A three-arm
      prospective randomized open-label study with a parallel group design will be used. A total of
      25 in a ratio of 2:2:1 female adolescents with JIA who have pain will be randomized to one of
      the three groups: 1) online yoga training program (Group A) (n=10), 2) online aerobic dance
      training program (Group B) (n=10) and 3) waiting list control group (Group C) (n=5).
      Participants in groups A and B will complete three individual 1-hour sessions per week using
      online exercise videos, as well as one 1-hour virtual group session per week using a
      video-conferencing platform (GoToMeeting) for 12 weeks. These participants will also take
      part in weekly e-consultations with a research coordinator and discussions on Facebook with
      other participants. Participants from all groups will be given access to an electronic
      educational pamphlet on PA for arthritis developed by The Arthritis Society to review via an
      online platform. Feasibility, acceptability and usability of Facebook and GoToMeeting will be
      assessed at the end of the program. Pain intensity (Primary outcome), participation in
      general physical activity, morning stiffness, functional status, fatigue, self-efficacy and
      patient global assessment will be assessed using self-administered electronic surveys at
      baseline, weekly until the end of the 12 weeks program.

      Objectives: The primary objectives of the proposed pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      will be to examine: (1) the feasibility of a full RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of two
      popular types of physical activity (PA), a yoga training program and an aerobic dance
      training program, in female adolescents (13 to 18 years old) with juvenile idiopathic
      arthritis (JIA) compared to a wait list control group; and (2) the acceptability of these
      interventions.

      Methods: A three-arm prospective randomized open-label study with a parallel group design
      will be used. A total of 25 female adolescents with JIA who have pain will be randomized in a
      ratio of 2:2:1 to one of the three groups: 1) online yoga training program (Group A) (n=10),
      2) online aerobic dance training program (Group B) (n=10) and 3) wait list control group
      (Group C) (n=5). Participants in groups A and B will complete three individual 1-hour
      sessions per week using online exercise videos, as well as one 1-hour virtual group session
      per week using a video-conferencing platform (GoToMeeting) for 12 weeks. These participants
      will also take part in weekly e-consultations with a research coordinator and discussions on
      Facebook with other participants. Participants from all groups will be given access to an
      electronic educational pamphlet on PA for arthritis developed by The Arthritis Society to
      review via an online platform. Feasibility (recruitment rates, self-reported adherence to the
      interventions, dropout rates, and percentage of missing data), acceptability and usability of
      Facebook and GoToMeeting will be assessed at the end of the program. Pain intensity (Primary
      outcome), participation in general physical activity, morning stiffness, functional status,
      fatigue, self-efficacy and patient global assessment will be assessed using self-administered
      electronic surveys at baseline, weekly until the end of the 12 weeks program.

      Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first study in paediatric patients to evaluate the
      effectiveness of yoga and aerobic dance as pain management interventions for female
      adolescents with JIA. The use of online tools such as Facebook and GoToMeeting to disseminate
      these two PA interventions may facilitate access to alternative methods of pain management in
      this population. The study design incorporates randomization and allocation concealment to
      ensure internal validity. To avoid intergroup contamination, the Facebook group page security
      settings will be set to &quot;closed&quot;, thus only allowing invited participants to access it. Study
      limitations include the lack of participant blinding due to the characteristics of this
      physical intervention pilot randomized controlled trial and a potential bias of recruiting
      more severe hospital-based participants. Reporting of the study follows the Standard Protocol
      Items: Recommendations for interventional trials (SPIRIT) statement. This study can lead to a
      full-scale RCT.

    <measure>Change in pain intensity using the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be assessed by the online Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) 100-mm pain VAS sub-scale. It uses a scoring system where 0 mm represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 mm &quot;very severe pain&quot; in the past week. This measure has already been validated in the JIA population. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the fixed factor study group and the within factor assessment time (0, 6, 12 weeks) will be conducted to compare groups at 0, 6 and 12 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of physical activity using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for adolescents</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participation in physical activity will be assessed by the online Physical Activity Questionnaire for adolescents (PAQ-A) ages ranging from 14-18 years, a seven-day recall instrument measuring the level of physical activity within the last 7 days. The PAQ-A is composed of eight items using a 5-point scoring system. The total score is calculated by taking the mean score out of 5, with 1 indicating low physical activity and 5 indicating high physical activity. The PAQ-A has been reported to be a valid and reliable measure of general physical activity levels in youth and adolescents. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the fixed factor study group and the within factor assessment time (0, 6, 12 weeks) will be conducted to compare groups at 0, 6 and 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in duration and intensity of physical activity using the Physical Activity Report Calendar</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by an exercise log, based on the 7-day PAR calendar. Physical activity level will be reported in terms of minutes and intensity levels (three subscales: moderate, hard and very hard intensity: subscale total scores in minutes) and will be transformed into metabolic equivalent of tasks (METS), which are units of the basal metabolic rate and are expressing the energy cost of physical activity. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the fixed factor study group and the within factor assessment time (0, 6, 12 weeks) will be conducted to compare groups at 0, 6 and 12 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in morning stiffness using self-reported questions</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Morning stiffness will be assessed by online self-reported questions asking about the presence (Yes/No) and duration of morning stiffness in minutes. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the fixed factor study group and the within factor assessment time (0, 6, 12 weeks) will be conducted to compare groups at 0, 6 and 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional status using the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional status will be assessed by the online Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ). CHAQ contains 8 domains (dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities) and items are scored using a 4-point Likert scale of 0-3 where 0 represents the ability to perform the activity with no difficulty; 1, the ability to perform with some difficulty; 2, the ability to perform with much difficulty; and 3, the inability to perform over the past week. The mean of the 8 scores will determine the total CHAQ score ranging from 0 to 3, with a lower score indicating higher functional status and a higher score indicating lower functional status. It is the most widely used functional health status measure in JIA, which is a reliable and valid tool for the functional, physical and psychosocial assessment of children with JIA.</description>

    <measure>Change in fatigue using the PROMIS Pediatric Short Form v1.0 - Fatigue 10a</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed by an online version of a subset of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pediatric Short Form v1.0 - Fatigue 10a which measures fatigue experiences and its impact, scored from 1 to 5, where 1 represents &quot;never tired&quot; and 5 &quot;almost always tired&quot; in the past week. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the fixed factor study group and the within factor assessment time (0, 6, 12 weeks) will be conducted to compare groups at 0, 6 and 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-Efficacy using the Children`s Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Efficacy will be assessed by the Children's Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (CASE), a specific valid and reliable tool for JIA. The CASE is an 11-item self-report scale that is divided into three concepts: activity, symptom and emotion. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate responses for each item where 1 = &quot;not at all sure&quot; to 5 = &quot;very sure&quot; based on how confident the child is that they can manage disease effects. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the fixed factor study group and the within factor assessment time (0, 6, 12 weeks) will be conducted to compare groups at 0, 6 and 12 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Assessment using the Juvenile Arthritis Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Assessment will be assessed by an item used in the Juvenile Arthritis Quality of Life Questionnaire (JAQQ). The JAQQ was designed to assess the health-related quality of life in children aged 2-18 years with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or juvenile spondylarthritides. The JAQQ includes four subscales (gross motor function, fine motor function, psychosocial function and systemic symptoms), as well as a pain and patient global assessment. The patient global assessment asks how youth have been since the last assessment (prior week) on a 5-point likert scale from much better (1) to much worse (5).</description>
