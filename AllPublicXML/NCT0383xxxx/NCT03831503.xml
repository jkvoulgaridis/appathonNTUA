      Phase 1, open label, single center, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of dMAb-ZK190 following delivery of INO-A002 with
      Hylenex® recombinant delivered IM followed by EP in healthy adult Dengue naïve volunteers

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, single center, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of dMAb-ZK190 following delivery of INO-A002 with
      Hylenex® recombinant delivered IM followed by EP in healthy adult Dengue naïve volunteers
      ages 18-60 years.

      The study will apply a 3+3 design such that 3 additional subjects will be enrolled into the
      cohort if one DLT (Section 7.3.1) is observed in one out of the first 3 subjects dosed during
      the 28-day period of safety and PK assessment. If no additional DLT is observed in 3
      additional subjects (i.e., 1 DLT in 6 total subjects), dosing will proceed to the subsequent
      cohort. However, if any additional DLT occurs (i.e., &gt;1 DLT in 6 total subjects), then that
      dose will be deemed not tolerated and the prior dose will be considered the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD).
