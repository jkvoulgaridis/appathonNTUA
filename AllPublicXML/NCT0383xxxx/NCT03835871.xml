      This is four arm study. Approximately 480 (120 per group) would need to complete the 12 weeks
      of treatments.In order to achieve that number of subjects, approximately 700 subjects will be
      screened randomized into the study.

      A screening visit (Visit 1) will be followed by at least 2 weeks (14 days) placebo Run-in
      Period during which asthma subjects will wash out their daily inhaled corticosteroid and
      other medications and be assessed for compliance.

      Study treatment period will be for a duration of 12 weeks with visits: Visit 2- Baseline Day
      1, Visit 3 Day 21 (± 2 days), Visit 4 Day 42 (± 2 days), Visit 5 Day 63 (± 2 days), and Visit
      6 Day 84 days (± 2 days).

      Rescue Therapy: Short-acting beta agonists, Albuterol 90 μg/actuation.

             be either abstinent from sexual intercourse or using adequate contraception and must
             also have a negative pregnancy test. Pregnant or nursing females or females intending
             to become pregnant during the course of the study must be excluded from the study.

          2. The subject has mild to moderate asthma as defined by the National Asthma Education a
             Prevention Program (NAEPP ERP-3 ), at least 12 weeks prior to screening.

          3. Pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) on the screening visit
             and on the baseline visit is &gt; 60% of the predicted value of predicted values
             according to age, height, race and sex using The global lung function 2012 equations:
             Report of the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI), following abstinence from
             short-acting β-agonists for a minimum of 6 hours and withholding restricted
             medications prior to the visits. At Visit 2 the baseline FEV1 and the predicted FEV1
             value would be the mean of 2 pre-dose FEV1 measurements taken 30 minutes apart (-30
             min and 0).

          4. The subject has demonstrated at least 12% reversibility of FEV1 at either the
             screening or baseline visit within 30 minutes after 4 inhalations (total of 360 μg) of
             albuterol (pMDI). [Note: Subjects who fail to demonstrate the required reversibility
             at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) are eligible to enter the Run-in Period and repeat
             the testing at the End of Run-in Period/Baseline (Visit 2)].

          5. If the subject in on inhaled corticosteroids the subject must be on a stable dose of
             daily-inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), at least 80 μg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate
             or equivalent for a minimum of 4 weeks before screening visit

          6. Currently nonsmoking; had not used tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, pipe
             tobacco) within the past year, and had ≤ 10 pack years of historical use.

          7. A body mass index between 18-35 kg/m2, inclusive.

          8. Willingness to give their written informed consent/assent to participate in the study.

          9. Subjects must be able to perform acceptable and repeatable spirometry, Peak Flow Meter
             (twice a day measurements), keep a diary record and to use the inhalation devices as
             assessed at Screening and Baseline by the study staff.

         10. Ability to understand and comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and
             protocol stated restrictions.

        NOTE: At the end of the placebo Run-in period the subject will be stratified into two
        categories:

          -  Corticosteroid naïve subjects (Not have taken inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) at least
             3 months prior to screening or systemic corticosteroids at least 6 months before
             screening)

          -  Prior corticosteroid users

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Incidence of asthma exacerbations per NAEPP ERP-3(1) (Appendix IV) within the last 3
             months.

          2. Respiratory diseases other than asthma or allergic rhinitis.

          3. Uncontrolled asthma defined as having 3 - 4 of the following symptoms: a) Daytime
             asthma symptoms (&gt; twice/week) b) Night waking due to asthma c) Reliever needed for
             symptoms more than twice a week (excluding reliever taken before exercise) d) Any
             activity limitation due to asthma per GINA, Chapter 2, Box 2-2, page 29.

          4. Life threatening asthma, defined as a history of asthma episode(s) requiring
             intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnia; respiratory arrest or hypoxic
             seizures, asthma related syncopal episode(s) within the previous 10 years.

          5. The known presence or history of tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract;

             asthma including laboratory result abnormalities that in the opinion of the
             investigator would put the subject at risk through study participation or would affect
             the study analyses if the disease exacerbated during the study. Following conditions
             should be considered carefully: congestive heart failure, recent myocardial
             infraction, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias and diabetes mellitus,
