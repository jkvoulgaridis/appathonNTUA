    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label Phase II study of the investigational drugs binimetinib
      and encorafenib that will be taken my mouth (orally) daily in adult patient with advanced
      and/or metastatic solid tumors for which no other standard therapy is available. The main
      purpose is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of the study drugs in the growth of
      the cancer in patients with class 2 and 3 BRAF mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BRAF is a gene in humans that is commonly altered in cancer, resulting in a change to the
      proteins created from this mutation. These altered proteins interact with a process in the
      body known as the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway and promote the growth of
      cancer. Three classes of BRAF mutations have been identified to understand why some patients
      respond to treatment and others do not. Class 2 and 3 BRAF mutations have worse overall
      survival. This study will look at participants in these classes (non-V600E BRAF mutations).

      Binimetinib is an oral drug (tablet) that stops the function of MEK (mitogen-activated
      protein kinase kinase). MEK is a part of the MAPK pathway, so blocking this step helps in
      stopping the pathway from confinuing to grow the cancer.

      Encorafenib is an oral drug (capsule) that stops the function of BRAF V600-mutant kinase, the
      protein that is produced from a type of BRAF gene mutation. This protein promotes the MAPK
      pathway so blocking this protein stops the MAPK pathway from growing the cancer.

      Patients will visit the clinic up to 2 times every 4 weeks (1 cycle) for tests and procedures
      while taking the study drugs daily. Procedures will involve review of medication and history,
      imaging scans, blood sample collection for safety and research purposes, urine collection,
      ECGs, eye exam, MUGA scans and mandatory and optional tumor biopsies.
