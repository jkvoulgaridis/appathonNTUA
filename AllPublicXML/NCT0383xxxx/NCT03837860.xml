  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consequences of prescription opioid abuse are serious and the number of deaths from
      unintended overdose have quadrupled over the last 15+ years. Opioid analgesics remain among
      the most commonly abused class of substances in the United States. Moreover, patients who
      take pain medications for legitimate reasons may develop an opioid use disorder (OUD), with
      as many as 1 in 4 patients becoming dependent on their pain medications. Because of changing
      access to prescription opioid analgesics due to an increasingly negative prescribing climate
      and changes in guidelines, patients often turn to heroin, with an estimated 1 in 15 pain
      patients trying heroin within 10 years. Pain is a symptom that can be severely debilitating
      and needs to be treated adequately to improve the quality of life. Clinicians, then, are in a
      proverbial &quot;catch-22&quot; situation whereby treating a patient's chronic pain also exposes them
      to medications with substantial abuse liability and overdose risk. In this proposal, a method
      aimed at reducing the abuse potential of prescription opioid medications, without altering
      their analgesic efficacy, is described.

      The study team hypothesize that this can be accomplished by administering a
      fixed-dose-combination of an opioid with an atypical antipsychotic drug, in the same pill or
      capsule.

    <measure>Change in Bipolar Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of Drug Likability</measure>
    <time_frame>Study visit 2 to study visit 6, an average of 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The bipolar VAS is used to measure the Change in magnitude of &quot;drug liking&quot;. The Drug Effects Questionnaire AKA the bipolar VAS of Drug Likability is a 5 item self-administered assessment where participants place a mark on a line from 0 to 100, &quot;strongly dislike&quot; at 0 (on the left hand side), &quot;no effect&quot; at 50 (in the center) and &quot;strongly like&quot; at 100 (on the far right). Change from visit 2 to visit 6 will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Change in Profile of Mood States (POMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Study visit 2 to study visit 6, an average of 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>POMS is a self-administered, standard validated psychological test formulated by McNair et al. (1971). It is a used to assess transient, distinct mood states. The questionnaire contains 65 words/statements that describe feelings people have. Outcome will be assessed using categorical and continuous data analysis comparing across groups. Change from visit 2 to visit 6 will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Change in Addiction Research Center Inventory Short Form (ARCI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Study visit 2 to study visit 6, an average of 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The ARCI is a self-administered, standardized questionnaire for assessing subjective effects of psychoactive drugs that was developed in the early 1960s at the National Institute of Mental Health Addiction Research Center. For this study, we will be using the 49-item short form. Outcome will be assessed using categorical and continuous data analysis comparing across groups. Change from visit 2 to visit 6 will be measured.</description>
