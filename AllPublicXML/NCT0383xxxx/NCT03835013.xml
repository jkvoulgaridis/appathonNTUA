  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to explore the cardiovascular effects of co-agonism at two peptide receptors,
      GLP-1 and glucagon. Peptides will be intravenously infused, both in isolation, and
      combination into healthy male participants. Overall, the aim of the study is to further our
      understanding on the role these endogenous substances play (both in isolation and
      combination) in haemodynamic regulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Co-agonist peptides (such as at the GLP-1:glucagon receptor) are currently in clinical
      development for type 2 diabetes with the dual intention of reducing body weight and
      controlling blood glucose. However, there is a lack of data on the effects that co-agonism
      has on haemodynamic regulation. Healthy male participants, by acting as their own control,
      will attend for five intravenous infusion visits as described. These will occur in a
      predefined but random order so that participants will be blinded to the infusion they are
      receiving. Each infusion visit will comprise of 15 minute baseline, then 120 minute infusion
      followed by a 30 minute washout period. Detailed non-invasive cardiovascular measurements
      (including peripheral/central blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, heart rate
      variability) and bloods (including insulin, glucose, GLP-1, glucagon) will be collected as
      part of the study.
