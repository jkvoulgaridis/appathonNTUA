  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of REGN1908-1909 (anti-Fel d
      1) administered as a single dose on day 1 in cat-allergic asthmatic patients not living with
      a cat in the prevention of a Controlled Cat Allergen Challenge-induced early asthmatic
      response (EAR) assessed by measures of lung function (FEV1) compared to placebo-treated
      patients.

      Secondary Efficacy Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of REGN1908-1909 administered as a single dose on
           day 1 in cat-allergic asthmatic patients not living with a cat, in the prevention of a
           Controlled Cat Allergen Challenge-induced: Allergic rhinitis and Ocular symptoms

        -  To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of REGN1908-1909 administered as a single dose on
           day 1 in cat-allergic asthmatic patients not living with a cat to increase the exposure
           to cat allergen, measured as a product of minute ventilation and time, required to
           induce EAR in a Controlled Cat Allergen Challenge as compared to placebo patients

      Secondary Safety Objective:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN1908-1909 vs. placebo in patients with
           cat allergen-triggered asthma
