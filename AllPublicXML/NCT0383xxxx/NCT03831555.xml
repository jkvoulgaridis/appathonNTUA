      The purpose of this study is to learn more about what psychological and social factors affect
      people in how they take their hepatitis C medications.

      The goal of this study is to determine if a qualitative survey that assesses a patient's
      readiness for treatment of Hepatitis C (HCV) and associated interventions based on identified
      barriers can improve treatment adherence and outcomes. HCV remains a leading cause of liver
      cancer and end stage liver disease despite greater than 90% cure rates with new, all-oral
      antiviral medications. While these new medications are easier to tolerate and access than
      previous treatment regimens, medication adherence still remains a great barrier to cure. In
      this study, we will administer the Psychosocial Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for
      Hepatitis C Treatment (PREP-C) tool, a free, online survey developed at the Mount Sinai
      School of Medicine to determine psychosocial readiness for treatment.

    <description>The treatment outcome will be measured by analyzing the rapid virologic response (RVR) at 4 weeks after completion of treatment. Rapid virologic response (RVR) is defined as an undetectable serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA. This data will be collected from chart reviews.</description>

    <description>The treatment outcome will be measured by analyzing the sustained virologic response (SVR) at 12 weeks after completion of treatment. SVR is defined as aviremia 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy. This data will be collected from chart reviews.</description>

    <description>The Psychosocial Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for Hepatitis C Treatment (PREP-C) tool assesses a patient's psychosocial readiness to start HCV treatment. There are nine sections in the survey:
Motivation: reasons client wants to begin HCV treatment, concerns about treatment, and the importance of treatment
Information: knowledge about HCV treatment and one's own HCV disease status
Medication Adherence: current prescribed medications and adherence to them in the prior month
Self-efficacy: self-confidence about adhering to HCV treatment
Social Support and Stability: stability of financial, housing, and social support resources
Alcohol and substance use: alcohol and substance use behaviors and current treatment
Psychiatric Stability: current psychiatric status, previous and current treatment
Energy Level: sleep and fatigue
Cognitive Functioning: perceived difficulty with communication in health care setting, problem-solving ability, and memory.</description>
