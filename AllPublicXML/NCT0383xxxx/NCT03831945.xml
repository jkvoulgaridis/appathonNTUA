  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      A daily drug combination can keep human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) levels low for a long
      time. But if this combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) stops, HIV levels go back up.
      People can also develop resistance or permanent side effects. Researchers want to see if 2
      new drugs can help control HIV when a person is not on ART.

      Objective:

      To see if VRC01 and 10-1074 are safe and control HIV when a person is not on ART.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 65 with HIV

      Design:

      All participants must agree to practice safer sex. Those who can get pregnant will have a
      pregnancy test every visit.

      Participants will be screened with:

      Physical exam

      Medicine review

      Blood and urine tests

      Some participants may need to change their HIV medicine for a brief period of time during the
      study.

      A few weeks later, participants will repeat screening tests and stop taking their HIV
      medicines.

      Interruption phase 1: Participants will have blood tests every 2 weeks, and repeat screening
      tests every 4 weeks.

      Treatment phase: Once their HIV reaches a certain level in the blood, participants will get
      the 2 study drugs or a salt water placebo. They will not know which they get. Each substance
      will be given through a thin tube in an arm vein for about 1 hour. Participants will restart
      their HIV medicines and repeat screening tests every 4 weeks.

      Interruption phase 2: Once the level of HIV in the blood becomes undetectable for 3 months,
      participants will again stop taking their HIV medicines and have blood tests every 2 weeks to
      monitor the level of HIV in the blood.

      Participants will restart their medicines by week 24. They will start sooner if they have
      certain symptoms or blood levels of HIV become too high. They will repeat most screening
      tests 3 times over 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in antibody cloning technologies have led to the development of a number of
      highly potent and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific broadly neutralizing monoclonal
      antibodies (bNAbs) from B cells of HIV-infected individuals. It has been shown that certain
      bNAbs can prevent acquisition of the virus, suppress viral replication, delay and/or prevent
      plasma viral rebound following treatment interruption in simian/human immunodeficiency virus
      (SHIV)-infected animals. Preliminary data from clinical trials indicates that bNAbs may delay
      plasma viral rebound following interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and block
      cell-to-cell transmission of laboratory-adapted HIV in vitro.

      In the above studies, suppression of plasma viremia was dependent on maintaining neutralizing
      serum levels of bNAbs via repeated intravenous (IV) infusions. A recent pre-clinical study in
      an acute SHIV-macaque model suggests a limited course of passive immunotherapy with two bNAbs
      (10-1074 and 3BNC117) given shortly after infection, can result in prolonged suppression of
      plasma viremia that is not dependent on the continuous presence of the bNAbs18. Based on CD8+
      T cell depletion studies, it appears that the prolonged suppression of plasma viremia
      observed in these animals resulted from the induction of potent antiviral CD8+ T cell
      immunity by the short course bNAb treatment. The mechanism by which bNAb therapy could induce
      such a response is unclear but could involve the early formation of unique bNAb-SHIV immune
      complexes that subsequently induce an effective and durable T cell response to the virus.

      In light of these encouraging preclinical outcomes, it is of considerable interest to
      investigate whether treatment with a single infusion of two bNAbs (VRC01 and 10-1074) which
      target different epitopes of HIV gp120 (CD4 binding site and V3 glycan, respectively), during
      transient plasma viremia can induce long-lasting anti-HIV immunity capable of controlling
      plasma viremia in the absence of ART.

                    2. Succeeding viral levels return to levels below the limit of detection on
                       subsequent testing.

               9. Willingness for both male and female subjects to agree to use barrier protection
                  methods or abstinence during the ATI phase of the study to decrease the risk of
                  HIV transmission.

        Reproductive Risks

        Contraception: The effects of VRC01 and 10-1074 on the developing human fetus are unknown.
        For this reason, men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate
        pregnancy prevention. This includes the use an effective method of contraception (i.e.
        condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, hormone-eluting IUD, hormone-based
        contraceptive with condom) for the study duration. Subjects should also agree to use a male
        or female condom while off ART. Pregnancy prevention must be practiced continuously for the
        duration of study participation. Females of childbearing-age must have a negative pregnancy
        test result prior to receiving the infusions of VRC01 and 10-1074/placebo. During the
        course of the study, if a female subject, or the partner of a male subject suspects or in
        fact becomes pregnant, the affected subject should inform the study staff immediately, as
        well as the woman s primary care physician.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Chronic hepatitis B, as evidenced by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg), or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as evidenced by a positive test
             for HCV RNA. Subjects with a positive test for HCV antibody and a negative test for
             HCV RNA are eligible.

          2. HIV immunotherapy or HIV vaccine(s) received within 1 year prior to screening.

          3. Any prior history of receiving 10-1074 or VRC01.

          4. Any licensed or experimental non-HIV vaccination (e.g., hepatitis B, influenza,
             pneumococcal polysaccharide) received within 2 weeks prior to study enrollment.

          5. Receipt of other investigational study agent within 28 days of enrollment.

          6. Any active malignancy that may require systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

          7. Systemic immunosuppressive medications received within 3 months prior to enrollment
             (Exceptions: [1] corticosteroid nasal spray or inhaler; [2] topical corticosteroids
             for mild, uncomplicated dermatitis; or [3] oral/parenteral corticosteroids
             administered for non-chronic conditions not expected to recur [length of therapy less
             than or equal to 10 days, with completion in greater than or equal to 30 days prior to
             enrollment]).

          8. History or other clinical evidence of:

               1. Significant or unstable cardiac or cerebrovascular disease (e.g., angina,
                  congestive heart failure, recent stroke or myocardial infarction).

               2. Severe illness, malignancy, immunodeficiency other than HIV, or any other
                  condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject
                  unsuitable for the study.

          9. Active drug or alcohol use or any other pattern of behavior that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

         10. Pregnancy or breast-feeding at time of screening.

         11. Documented multiclass antiretroviral drug resistance that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would pose a risk of virologic failure should additional mutations
