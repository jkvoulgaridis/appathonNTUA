  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-wake disturbances were found to be a common problem among patients with CHD either
      earlier during hospitalization or/ and after discharge Although there is an evidence that
      sleep-wake disturbanes occur in high rate among patients with CHD little was found about
      assessment and management of this problem. This randomized controlled study will assess sleep
      quality of stable CHD patients who were admitted for undergoing coronary angiography
      electively. Then it will test the hypothesis that atlas cedar wood essential oil aromatherapy
      have a positive effect on sleep quality of CHD patients.

    <textblock>
      The primary aim is testing the effect of Atlas cedar wood essential oil aromatherapy on sleep
      quality of patients after CHD.

      The secondary aim is estimating the prevalence of sleep-wake disturbances (difficulty falling
      asleep, staying asleep, inadequate sleep duration, dissatisfaction with a sleep and excessive
      daytime sleepiness) among recruited CHD patients.

      - data were collected by two phase:

        -  phase one: sleep quality of recruited CHD patients, who were admitted for undergoing
           coronary angiography electively, were assessed using Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index
           (PSQI). CHD participants who were reported poor sleep quality (=&gt;5) in PSQI score will
           randomly allocated by toss either to intervention or control group.

        -  Phase two:

             1. Intervention group received an atlas cedar wood aromatherapy for five consecutive
                nights.

             2. Control group received no intervention.

             3. Sleep quality of both group participants re-assessed at second day and six day of
                recruitment, respectively, using PSQI.

    <description>The participants were asked to fill a demographic and situational data sheet that is bulit by the researches based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. this sheet assess participants' age, gender, marital status, educational level, occupation and bed time habits. Also it have a disease related questions, that consists of time of diagnosis of CHD, presence of other chronic disease (physiological or psychological disease), previous complaint of sleep problem, medication history rather than used for CHD treatments, using of complementary therapy with justification.Through this data, female participants were asked if they are in menopausal period, pregnant or have a plan of pregnancy during next month.</description>

    <description>sleep quality (during past month) of participants was assessed at the day of each patient admission.

Each component has a score range from 0 point (no difficulty) to 3 point (extreme difficulty). Global PSQI score results from summation of seven component scores. It have a range from 0 point (no difficulty in all area) to 21 points (severe difficulties in all area). Global PSQI score &gt;=5 indicate a poor sleep quality where a total score &lt;5 indicate a good sleep quality.</description>
