  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient will receive lamotrigine vs. placebo with small sips of water. Lamotrigine reaches
      peak level 1-4 hours after oral administration.

      1:1 randomization without stratification use web-based software (Redcap) before surgery.
      Allocation will be concealed from the patient, the nurse, the operating room team. Both
      patient and the operating room team will be blinded to the treatment allocation (double
      blind).

      Standard preoperative care as per anesthesia care team. Patient will receive lamotrigine vs.
      placebo with small sips of water. Lamotrigine reaches peak level 1-4 hours after oral
      administration. Single dose lamotrigine is safe and is not associated with rash.

      Standard intraoperative care as per the anesthesia care team. All patients will receive
      Ketamine 1 mg/kg at induction. Ketamine 5mcg/kg/min will be started at induction and stopped
      at the end of surgery.

      Standard postoperative care as per PACU team. The psychologic side-effects will be measured
      using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) using an online tool.

      Research fellow will receive standardized training in administering BPRS from Dr Amit Anand
      using structured material. Dr Anand has used this training for other current research
      projects.

    <measure>Opioid use in PACU</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 minutes of PACU arrival</time_frame>
    <description>Assuming log-normal distribution of PACU opioid consumption (in IV morphine equivalent), we will evaluate the percent difference in geometric mean IV morphine equivalent dose between the two randomized groups using t-test on the log-transformed data. To evaluate the difference in mean PACU pain scores (in VRS scale) we will first summarize the pain scores (in VRS scale) by computing PACU time weighted average (TWA) pain score for each patient. Then we will use a t-test to assess the exposure effect on the TWA pain scores. Binary PONV outcome will be compared between two study groups using chi-square test.</description>

    <description>300 mg of oral Lamotrigine. One of the key studies in this area was reported at the Society of Neuroscience meeting in 1997 and later published in the Archives of General Psychiatry. This study reported that, in healthy subjects 300 mg oral lamotrigine significantly decreased ketamine-induced perceptual abnormalities as assessed by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (P&lt;.001).31 Furthermore lamotrigine increased the immediate mood-elevating effects of ketamine (P&lt;.05).</description>
