  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence place TGF-β, a potent pro-fibrotic cytokine, at the centre of the
      pathogenesis of Systemic Sclerosis (SSC). AVID200 is a novel inhibitor of TGF-β ligands. This
      Phase 1 trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of
      AVID200 in SSc patients in order delineate doses to be further evaluated in Phase 2.
      Approximately 9 to 24 male and female patients with documented SSc (i.e., score ≥ 9 according
      to the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification
      criteria), and classified as having the diffuse cutaneous SSs (dcSSc) subset (i.e., according
      to the LeRoy and Medsger Classification), will be entered into this Phase 1a, multicentre,
      open-label, dose-escalation, cohort study of AVID200.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential escalating doses
      of AVID200 (study drug), in order delineate a potential effective range of tolerated doses to
      be further evaluated in Phase 2.

      Patients will be treated and followed on an outpatient basis throughout the trial, unless
      hospitalization is required for other reasons, or to assure patient safety. The choice of
      doses for further Phase 2 study will be based on clinical and laboratory data obtained during
      this trial, including safety, PK, and preliminary anti-fibrotic activity.

      Upon completion of Cycle 1, and provided re-treatment criteria are met, patients may receive
      up to 2 additional cycles of study drug unless a criterion for treatment discontinuation has
      been met.
