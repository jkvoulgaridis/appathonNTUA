    <textblock>
      • Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder that can cause considerable maternal and fetal
      morbidity and mortality. Late preeclampsia (with delivery &gt;34 weeks) is more frequent and
      less serious than early preeclampsia (with delivery &lt;34 weeks). Poor early placentation has
      been especially associated with early disease. Early identification of women at risk of
      preeclampsia is currently a crucial aim of antenatal care since they may benefit from
      prophylactic treatment and increased surveillance.

      -  The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound techniques, with the option of
           calculating placental volume and measuring vascular indices, has created an excellent
           opportunity to study early changes in the uteroplacental circulation space, which
           includes the maternal spiral arteries and the intervillous space. This technology may
           allow a more direct evaluation of the abnormal placentation process thought to herald
           the development of preeclampsia.

        -  The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of placental volume and 3D vascular
           indices as reliable predictors of early preeclampsia in comparison to uterine artery
           Doppler
