    <textblock>
      This study determined the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the Figure-of-Eight
      method on healthy hands, and compared the figure-of-eight measurements to the gold standard
      volumetric measurements. Part B of the study conducted in a clinic, assessed the intra-rater
      reliability and inter-rater reliability on both hands of patients with hand injuries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Edema is the retention of fluid in the intracellular spaces, which is common in inflammatory
      condition such as traumatic injury and post surgical conditions. Edema in the hand and wrist
      can result in detrimental physiological changes which decrease the range of motion of joint
      and limit the overall functional capacity and dexterity of the hand. The gold standard
      Volumetric measurements are reliable for measuring edema changes in upper extremity. Using
      volumeters can be cumbersome in a busy clinic. Figure-of-eight measurements using a tape
      measure on the wrist and hand is an easy way to measure edema and can capture the
      accumulation in the dorsal hand that circumferential tape measurements do not capture. This
      study was performed in two parts. Part A determined the intra-rater and inter-rater
      reliability of the Figure-of-Eight method on healthy hands, and compared the figure-of-eight
      measurements to the gold standard volumetric measurements. No study other study has compared
      right and left hands. Part B of the study was conducted in a clinic to assess the intra-rater
      reliability and inter-rater reliability on both hands of patients with hand injuries.
