  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most frequent long-term complication of cataract surgery remains to be posterior capsule
      opacification (PCO). During the past decades many new intraocular lenses (IOL) with optimized
      lens material and design were introduced. We propose a study comparing three acrylic
      single-piece IOLs with different design and hydrophobic material. All IOLs (Hoya NY-60, HOYA
      Surgical Optics GmbH; EyeCee One, Nidek Co., Aichi, Japan) are commercially available and are
      used for routine cataract surgery. In this study a comparison of PCO score of all two IOLs, a
      comparison of optic quality with wavefront analyses, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, IOL
      decentration and tilt, slitlamp examination, fibrosis, glistening intensity (subjectively
      scored), YAG capsulotomy rate, and safety parameters (IOL related adverse reactions) of the
      investigated IOLs will be performed. Since PCO develops slowly within years, a long-term
      follow-up of three years will be necessary.

      As those IOLs are currently often implanted IOLs, their performance on PCO development and
      their optical quality is of high interest for the ophthalmologic community.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Bilateral age-related cataract for which phacoemulsification extraction and posterior
             IOL implantation has planned

          -  Age 40 and older

          -  Visual potential in both eyes of 20/30 or better as determined by investigators
             estimation

          -  Normal findings in the medical history and physical examination unless the
             investigator considers an abnormality to be clinically irrelevant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Preceding ocular surgery or trauma

          -  Relevant other ophthalmic diseases (such as pseudoexfoliation, retinal degenerations,
