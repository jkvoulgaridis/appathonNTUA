  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PGP) can appear during pregnancy, directly
      after labour or can be delayed to 3 weeks postpartum. Pain is experienced between the
      posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the vicinity of the SIJ. The pain
      may radiate in the posterior thigh and can also occur in conjunction with/or separately in
      the symphysis. The endurance capacity for standing, walking, and sitting is diminished. The
      diagnosis of PGP can be reached after exclusion of lumbar causes. The pain or functional
      disturbances in relation to PGP must be reproducible by specific clinical tests. Lack of
      accurate and early diagnosis of the PGP reasons postpartum may contribute to development of
      chronic condition, lowering quality of life years after delivery.

      Objectives: The aim of the project is to evaluate the underlying cause of the severe pelvic
      girdle pain postpartum (whether it is real PGP or diastasis pubic symphysis) and to assess
      the differences between females with severe postpartum PGP, mild and moderate PGP and with no
      PGP in terms of: presence of diastasis pubic symphysis, presence of diastasis recti and linea
      alba dysfunction, factors associated with labour and maladaptive mental
      processing(catastrophizing).

      Materials and methods: Because of low incidence of researched conditions, a case control
      study will be the study design of choice. The subjects with severe PGP will be matched with
      those with mild/moderate PGP and no PGP. Subjects'assessment will consist of palpation and
      ultrasonography evaluation of diastasis recti(inter-recti distance), ultrasonography
      assesment of pubic symphysis (inter-pubic width) and mental processing (catastrophizing
      assessed with Pain Catastrophizing Scale) analysis. Factors connected with labour (time from
      epidural anaesthesia injection to full dilatation and delivery) will be also investigated.

      Expected results: To the investigators' knowledge, severe postpartum pelvic girdle pain has
      not been extensively studied so far. The study will bring information about the possible
      underlying cause of severe postpartum PGP: whether it is real PGP or diastasis recti. It is
      expected that the study will confirm the investigators' clinical observations about severe
      PGP association with diastasis recti, maladaptive mental processing and time from epidural
      anaesthesia to full dilatation and labour.

    <description>Assessment of severity and functional limitations due to pelvic girdle pain. PGQ consists of a 25-item questionnaire thet includes a 20-item activity subscale and a 5 -item symptom subscale. Each item is scored in a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3 where 0 is 'not at all' and 3 is 'to a large extent'.</description>
