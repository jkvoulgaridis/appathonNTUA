  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that group interaction associated with individual interviews intensify the
      acquisition of safety skills compared to individual interviews alone in patients with CIR
      treated by subcutaneous biotherapies.

      Selection and inclusion of patients will be done by principal investigator of Rheumatology
      Department. After verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria by principal
      investigator and signature of consent, patients will be randomized by 1: 1 randomization
      (centralized randomization by statistician into 2 groups at M0) :

        1. Experimental group (individual and group therapeutic education )

             -  M0 (individual) Educational diagnosis and biotherapy education: &quot;subcutaneous
                injection education&quot; and &quot;biotherapy management&quot;.

             -  M3 (group with 3 to 10 patients) Intensification Biotherapy Education: Workshops :
                &quot;Subcutaneous injection education&quot; and &quot;biotherapy management&quot;.

             -  M6 (individual presential or by phone) Assessment of security skills and
                questionnaires.

             -  M12 (individual presential or by phone) Assessment of security skills and
                questionnaires.

        2. Control group (individual therapeutic education alone ) :

             -  M0 (individual) Educational diagnosis and biotherapy education: &quot;subcutaneous
                injection education&quot; and &quot;biotherapy management&quot;.

             -  M3 (individual) Intensification Biotherapy Education: &quot;Subcutaneous injection
                education&quot; and &quot;biotherapy management&quot;.

             -  M6 (individual présential or by phone) Assessment of security skills and
                questionnaires.

             -  M12 (individual présential or by phone) Assessment of security skills and
                questionnaires. Group session proposed.
