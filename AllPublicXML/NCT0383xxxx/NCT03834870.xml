  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop an interactive tool to screen for Elder Mistreatment (EM) in the Emergency
      Department (ED) to promote self-disclosure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To develop and refine the interactive VOICES tool, which will promote self-identification and
      self-disclosure to increase reporting of EM at point-of-care in the Emergency Department (ED)
      setting. Prior to conducting a feasibility study, focus groups will be conducted to inform
      the process and to develop a tool to evaluate the use of VOICES.

      Feasibility Study: To conduct a feasibility study (N= 800) examining the use of VOICES in a
      busy ED.

      Exploratory Aim: To perform a preliminary evaluation of the accuracy of VOICES as a screening
      tool in correctly classifying EM cases that were referred to Adult Protective Services (APS).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participation will be determined by the number of patients enrolled in VOICES. Successful enrollment of 800 older adults (N=800).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Usage will be determined by the number of patients enrolled in the study that complete the VOICES tool. Our target is to enroll 800 older adults (N=800).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction will be measured using post-use satisfaction survey with a 7-point Likert response set, developed based on the focus group analysis.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Demand</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Demand will be assess through examining how likely will VOICES be used by patients. To do this, the size of target population of EM victims in the ED will be measured by the % who screen positive for EM and the % who receive the Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) portion of VOICES.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Implementation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 17 months</time_frame>
    <description>Implementation will be measured by understanding to what extent can VOICES be used in the ED. To do this, the degree of execution will be measured by the % of potential participants approached who consent to participate in the pilot study and of those, the number that achieve success of execution measured by # of participants who used the tool to completion. Anecdotal reasons for not completing the tool will be collected to inform process.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Practicality</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 17 months</time_frame>
    <description>Practicality will be assessed by observing the ease of VOICES use by patients. To do this, a series of steps will be watched to determine the efficiency of implementation measured by the average time (1) to consent &amp; orient participants to the tool and (2) needed to complete VOICES documented by the Research Assistant; and (3) patients perceived time of VOICES as measured on post-survey. Each of these will be reported as part of the overall outcome.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of the Educational Material</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 17 months</time_frame>
    <description>To understand the efficacy of VOICES in this pilot, we will look at how many participants changed their self-identification response after completing the educational component.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of the Brief Negotiation Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 17 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will look at how many patients changed their readiness to disclose after completing the Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Self-Identification on Self-Disclosure</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 17 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will explore whether self-identification impacts likelihood of self-disclosure.
Effect-size estimation measured by change in the % of patients who disclose. Potential sources of bias measured by (1) sample representativeness &amp; (2) observed group differences of participants measured by demographic data determine through t-tests and chi-square analyses.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>To understand the accuracy of the VOICES tool, a preliminary evaluation of the accuracy of VOICES as a screening tool in correctly classifying EM cases that were referred to Adult Protective Services (APS). The percent correct classification will be reported.</description>
