      Co-design of a home-based anaemia monitoring system with participants who have previous
      diagnosis of anaemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The device/ monitoring system being developed is called Aptus home. Aptus home measures the
      haemoglobin and haematocrit levels in blood from a single drop of blood. By measuring these
      blood parameters, participants are able to monitor anaemia in participants' homes.

      The use of the device will take place in the participant's home to simulate what the
      investigators believe will be the ideal location for people who would prefer to self-manage
      their condition.

      This study is a unique opportunity to gain feedback on the future design and development of a
      home-based monitoring system through user evaluation. As this is an adaptive/ iterative study
      design, this will give the Sponsor the opportunity to make changes to the user interface and
      user platform based on the feedback received from the end user.
