  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the effects of different types of just-in-time
      intervention messages on daily meeting dietary, activity, and weighing goals in a sample of
      young adults participating in a mobile-based weight loss program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Public health interventions typically rely on a set schedule of intervention delivery.
      Advances in technology and computer tailoring allow us to go from a &quot;one size fits all&quot;
      approach to one that uses digital health data to deliver &quot;just-in-time adaptive
      interventions,&quot; or JITAIs, that can vary the timing, dose, and content of intervention
      messages to individuals. This pilot study is a micro-randomized trial that evaluates the
      effects of various intervention message options delivered in JIT moments on meeting dietary,
      activity, and weighing goals among young adults in a mobile-based weight loss program.

      The Nudge study is a 12-week mobile health weight loss program delivered via a native
      smartphone application. Individuals are asked to track their red foods (high-calorie,
      high-fat foods) in the app daily and meet their personalized red foods goal, wear a Fitbit
      daily and meet their daily active minutes goal, and weigh daily on their WiFi-enabled scale.
      Up to 4 times each day, participants are randomized to receive or not receive intervention
      messages in order to examine the effects of these intervention message types on meeting daily
      weighing goals, red food goals, and activity goals. This is a within-subjects design in which
      each participant serves as their own control, and data is analyzed at the person-day level.

    <description>Each of 7 intervention message options has specific decision rules (including weighed/not weighed and progress toward daily dietary and activity goals) that make a participant eligible to receive a specific intervention type at a specific time (decision points).
At each decision point (early morning, morning, midday, and evening), the system evaluates which intervention options a participant is eligible to receive, and randomly chooses one intervention option from that list. Then the participant is randomly assigned to either receive or not receive that intervention message (with a 50-50 probability).</description>
