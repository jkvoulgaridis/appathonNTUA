  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women. Standard therapy for early-stage
      breast cancer is breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant whole breast
      irradiation (WBI), which usually requires a treatment time of 3-6 weeks. Several randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that postoperative WBI after BCS significantly
      decreased the risk of local (in-breast) recurrence and improved breast cancer mortality as
      well as survival. However, one of the most common side-effects of radiotherapy is fatigue,
      which is reported in up to 80% of cancer patients during treatment. Especially in early-stage
      breast cancer patients it might be the only serious side-effect following adjuvant
      irradiation, as fatigue often significantly reduces quality of life due to resulting
      functional impairment and psychological distress. Fatigue additionally has a distinct
      socioeconomic impact: 75% of patients and 40% of caregivers are forced to change their
      employment status due to cancer-related fatigue.

      For reducing treatment-related toxicity, several RCTs consequently addressed the question
      whether adjuvant WBI could be omitted in early-stage, low risk breast cancer patients treated
      with endocrine therapy. However, all these trials detected up to seven-time increased local
      recurrence rates without WBI following BCS. Both, longer duration of radiotherapy and larger
      radiation field sizes are known to be associated with increase in treatment-related fatigue.
      Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), delivered exclusively to the original tumor
      location and not to the surrounding breast tissue, might therefore be an alternative
      treatment option with fewer side-effects for early-stage, low risk breast cancer patients.
      Few previous trials have already reported comparable outcomes for highly selected low-risk
      breast cancer patients for APBI compared to conventional WBI. First results also point out
      that APBI compared to WBI might be associated with less severity and intensity of fatigue.

      One method for APBI is single-dose intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) delivered directly to
      the tumor after resection. Data is still limited for APBI, hence current international and
      German guidelines suggest the use of APBI for low-risk early stage breast cancer patients but
      recommend the application of APBI preferably within a clinical trial.

    <measure>Local tumor control in the index quadrant of the breast</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years and 5 years after treatment start</time_frame>
    <description>Local tumor control in the index quadrant of the ipsilateral breast as a secondary endpoint is defined as no tumor relapse in the breast tissue quadrant of the initial tumor/ at the site of surgical intervention. Local tumor control in the index quadrant of the ipsilateral breast is used as an additional secondary endpoint to distinguish between true local recurrences in the index quadrant from second (or new) ipsilateral carcinomas in other quadrants. In the intraoperative study arm (arm B) only the former tumor bed is irradiated, while in study arm A the whole breast tissue is irradiated.
Local tumor control in the index quadrant of the breast is taken as number of days from randomization until local tumor progression, death without prior local progression, or end of follow-up. For patients alive and not diagnosed with local progression at the end of the study, the local control time will be censored at the time of the last study visit.</description>

    <description>The BREAST-Q questionnaire is specifically designed for patients undergoing BCS measuring quality-of-life (QOL) and satisfaction. Patients are asked to rate each item question on a four-point scale. The BREAST-Q is separated into a pre- and post-surgery version.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life employing BCTOS (Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 2 years, 5 years after treatment start</time_frame>
    <description>The Breast Cancer Treatment outcome scale (BCTOS-12) contains 12 items, which are assigned to two internally consistent subscales: 1) Functional Status, 2) Aesthetic Status. Patients are instructed to rate each item of the BCTOS-12 on a four-point scale evaluating the differences between the treated and the untreated breast (1 = no difference, 4 = large difference). The score for each subscale is the mean of the ratings over all items belonging to that subscale. A higher score reflects a poorer status (i.e. a larger difference between the treated and the untreated breast).</description>
