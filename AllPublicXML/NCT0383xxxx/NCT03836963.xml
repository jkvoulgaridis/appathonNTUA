  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility of an at-home cognitive training program that
      incorporates both memory training and online computerized cognitive training (CCT) software.
      Data will also be collected to determine if this program improves thinking and memory as well
      as everyday function. The hypothesis is that memory and cognitive training combined ,
      compared to memory training alone or will lead to greater improvements in cognitive
      performance and daily function.

      The objective of this study is to examine feasibility of an at-home cognitive rehabilitation
      program that incorporates both prospective implementation intentions strategies (PRIIS) and
      an existing web-based executive function (EF) computerized cognitive training (CCT) software
      for Veterans with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to collect pilot data to determine the impact
      of this program on cognition and everyday function. The central hypothesis is that CCT+PRIIS,
      compared to CCT alone and an active control group, will lead to greater improvements in
      cognitive performance and daily function. This innovative study uses a set of on-line
      training games that target aspects of EF susceptible in PD and trains the transfer of
      cognitive benefits to everyday function, using PRIIS, for Veterans with PD and mild cognitive
      impairment in executive function. Additionally, training is conducted at home allowing for
      convenience and flexibility for participants.
