  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is the commonest hematological disorder that occurs in pregnancy. According to the
      recent standard laid down by 'WHO', anemia is present when the Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration
      in the peripheral blood is 11 gm/dl or less. The most common cause of anemia in pregnancy is
      lack of iron. This study is done to compare the efficacy and tolerability of iron amino acid
      chelate and that of iron salts (ferrous fumarat).

Iron tablets should be taken at night or at least 1 hour prior to food to maximise absorption.
Substances that inhibit absorption such as tannins &amp; milk should be avoided but fruit juice contain ascorbic acid taken in conjunction with iron supplements increases their absorption.
Follow up will be done for all the pregnant women included in our studies at baseline &amp; then 4, 8 &amp; 12 weeks after treatment at each visit breif history for outcomes and adverse effects will reviewed.</description>
