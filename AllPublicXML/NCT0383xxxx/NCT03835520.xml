  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples, as well as tumor tissue for genetic
      analysis. The collection of samples will allow the creation of a plasma bank. Targeted
      individuals are cancer patients of all types, treated with immunotherapy or targeted therapy.

      Immunotherapy or targeted agents will be administered according to standard of care and
      reimbursement modalities in Belgium. Targeted agents will be administered according to
      manufacturer's instructions.

      With the aim to identify predictive markers of response to treatment or possible resistance
      mechanism, the plasma samples and the tumor samples will be used for genetic analysis, for
      example but not limited to, whole exome sequencing. This may lead to the discovery of some
      germinal mutations implicated in other diseases than cancer.

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression assessed up to 120 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of inclusion to the date of death from any cause or to the date of last follow-up (in exceptional cases where it is impossible to document the date of death). Every effort should be made to document the cause of death.</description>

    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of progression or death, whatever the cause.
Progression will be defined according to the RECIST criteria.</description>
