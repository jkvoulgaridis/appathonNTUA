  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following successful chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),
      a multitude of physiological and anatomical changes take place. Contemporary techniques such
      as dissection/re-entry or lumen-lumen wiring may influence the immediate and longer term
      follow up of these features. It is not known whether changes in this level of physiology and
      anatomy in the context of CTO vessels correlate with each other, or with quality of life and
      exercise capacity.

      This study aims to take physiological measurements of absolute coronary flow, resistance and
      pressure and intra-coronary imaging immediately after successful CTO PCI. The investigators
      will relate these to each other and to the method of revascularisation, comparing changes in
      these groups at three months follow up.

      Quality of life measurements, and exercise testing will be carried out to see if there is a
      relationship between physiological and anatomical changes with exercise capacity and quality
      of life.

      Results from this study could shed light on optimisation of CTO PCI procedural and clinical
      outcomes.
