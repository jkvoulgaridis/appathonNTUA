    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of glabellar injection of botulinum toxin type A (BTA) in treating
      depression has not yet been investigated in elderly patients. The study aims in addressing
      the question if glabellar injection of BTA is effective in treating geriatric depression.

    <textblock>
      Feedback from facial expressions is known to influence emotional experience. Treatment of
      muscles involved in facial expression of sadness, anger or anxiety with botulinumtoxin showed
      a quick, strong and sustained improvement in the symptoms of depression. As considerable
      proportion of patients do not sufficiently respond to existing treatment options. Especially
      in the elderly current treatments show limited response or are associated with side effects.
      Injections with BTA are considered as a very safe treatment without lasting side effects. The
      aim of the study is to investigate effectiveness of BTA in treating major depression in the
      elderly in a cross-over designed, placebo-controlled manner.

    <description>Response to treatment, as defined as a 50% or greater decrease in Montgomery Aasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders.
Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60.[4] The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms 1. Apparent sadness 2. Reported sadness 3. Inner tension 4. Reduced sleep 5. Reduced appetite 6. Concentration difficulties 7. Lassitude 8. Inability to feel 9. Pessimistic thoughts 10. Suicidal thoughts
Usual cutoff points are:
0 to 6 - normal /symptom absent 7 to 19 - mild depression 20 to 34 - moderate depression &gt;34 - severe depression.</description>

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>severity of depressive symptoms, self-rated Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) In the Geriatric Depression Scale, questions are answered &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; A five-category response set is not utilized in order to ensure that the scale is simple enough to be used when testing ill or moderately cognitively impaired individuals, for whom a more complex set of answers may be confusing, or lead to inaccurate recording of responses.
The scale consists of 30 yes/no questions. Each question is scored as either 0 or 1 points. The following general cutoff may be used to qualify the severity:
normal 0-9, mild depressives 10-19, severe depressives 20-30.</description>
