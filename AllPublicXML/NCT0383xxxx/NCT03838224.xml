  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is the 3rd cause of disability worldwide and represents an enormous socioeconomic
      burden. It has been reported that people with neck pain, with traumatic and non-traumatic
      onset, have an alteration of the sensorimotor function compared to pain-free people, such as
      deficits in the head and neck repositioning or alteration of the body balance. It has been
      suggested that alterations on the proprioception of the suboccipital muscles may cause a
      decrease in head and neck repositioning accuracy and changes in head and neck positioning
      patterns. The suboccipital muscles, particularly the obliquus capitis inferior (OCI), has a
      greater density of muscular spindles compared to lower cervical segments, which is believed
      to play an important role in the proprioception. The alteration of the JPE is more often
      found in patients with a dysfunction in the upper cervical spine, but people with lower
      dysfunction can also exhibit it. However, no conclusive results on JPE have been reported
      with articular techniques targeting the upper cervical spine. On the contrary, positive
      results on this test have been observed after the retraining of the upper cervical muscles.
      As OCI is a deep muscle, dry needling seems to be the most appropriate passive modality of
      treatment to target that muscle and restore the abnormal cervical sensorimotor control.
      However, this hypothesis has never been tested.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to investigate if a single dry needling (DN) session
      modifies the altered sensorimotor function in people with neck pain. The secondary objectives
      will be to investigate the effects of a single DN session on muscle length (indirectly
      measured with FRT) and to investigate the effects of a single DN session on self-reported
      pain.

      With this aim, a random control trial (RCT) design will be conducted with two groups;
      intervention group (dry needling of the OCI) and placebo group (sham needling). Sham needling
      has shown to be a valid control method in dry needling research.

      The study will take two days. In the first day, the outcome measures will be measured before
      (baseline) and immediately after the intervention (immediate follow-up). In the second day
      (one-week follow-up), outcome measures will be measured again. Pain intensity, measured with
      the visual analogue scale, will be only measured at baseline and one-week follow-up.

      The baseline and follow-up assessments will be performed by an independent assessor who will
      be blinded to the intervention allocation. The interventions will be provided by a therapist
      with dry needling training and 3-years of musculoskeletal experience who will be blinded to
      outcome measures.

    <measure>Change in Joint position error (JPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention follow-up and one-week post-intervention follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical JPE will be measured using a laser-pointer attached to a lightweight headband. In sitting position, 90 cm away from a target and blindfolded, patients will be requested to rotate to the right and to the left. An absolute error between the starting and end points will be calculated in millimeters and then converted to degrees. Six repetitions will be performed each side according to recommendations and the mean will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cervical movement sense</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention follow-up and one-week post-intervention follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will trace with the laser-pointer in their heads a specific pattern (located at 100 cm distance) at two velocities (accurate; accurate and fast). This test will be recorded and later examined at slow motion by a video analysis programme. Time (total time taken to complete the pattern), error frequency (number of deviations) and error magnitude (sum of deviations multiplied by the distance from the central line) will be measured. This test has shown high intra and inter-rater reliability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Postural stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention follow-up and one-week post-intervention follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be positioned on the force platform. The postural sway will be measured in 4 conditions as follows: (neutral) narrow stance (feet close together) on firm and soft surfaces with eyes open and eyes closed</description>

    <measure>Change in Active cervical range of motion (rotation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention follow-up and one-week post-intervention follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical ROM in rotation will be measured bilaterally with the patients in sitting position using a Cervical Range of Motion (CROM) instrument, which has been shown to be a reliable and valid tool.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cervical flexion-rotation test (CFRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention follow-up and one-week post-intervention follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Upper cervical ROM in rotation will be measured bilaterally with the CFRT using the CROM. Participants will be requested to lie in supine on the plitch and the examiner will perform rotation passively with the rest of the cervical spine blocked in full flexion position. This test has shown to be a valid and reliable tool to measure the range of motion of the upper cervical spine (C1-C2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Smooth pursuit neck torsion (SPNT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention follow-up and one-week post-intervention follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This test is understood to assess eye movement disturbances due to altered cervical afferent input. Patients will be sat in a neutral position on a swivel chair and will be requested to follow a pen in the hand of the examiner (with their eyes) whilst keeping their head still. The pen will be moved at the participant's natural focal length across their field of vision horizontally in a visual range of 40 degrees several times. The speed of the movement will be 20 degrees per second. Pursuit of the eyes will be observed. The test will be repeated with the neck torsioned to the left and right by rotating the trunk and shoulders to the right 45 degrees, keeping the head still. This is done so that input to the vestibular system is avoided.
Increased catch up saccades in the torsion position especially as they cross the midline and/or reproduction of symptoms in the torsion position compared to the neutral position is a positive test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neck pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one-week post-intervention follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Neck pain intensity will be measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients will be requested to grade their pain intensity of neck pain experienced on a 0-100 mm horizontal line (0 mm= no pain and 100 mm= worst pain imaginable).</description>
