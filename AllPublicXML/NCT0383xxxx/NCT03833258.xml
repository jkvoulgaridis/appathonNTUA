    <textblock>
      The purpose of ReHip2 is to explore the impact on function and quality of life in patients
      following Total Hip Replacement (THR). A randomised controlled trial will compare two
      different rehabilitation pathways following surgery (Routine care with precautions and
      Treatment group with no precautions). The proposal is to carry out the RCT with a minimum of
      182 patients based in the UK.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dislocation of the hip following total hip replacement (THR) is the sole reason for the
      endorsement of precautions following THR. This has remained unchanged sine the first hip
      replacement in 1969.

      The precautions are;

        -  Patients must not bend past 90 degrees at the hip (including sitting)

        -  Patients must not twist in either standing or sitting

        -  Patients must partial weight bear with elbow crutches for a minimum of 6 weeks

        -  Patients must sleep on their back for a minimum of 6 weeks

        -  Patients must not cross their legs

      Studies exploring factors affecting dislocation following THR identified three main
      influences: surgical technique, type of prosthesis and post-operative precautions. A number
      of studies have challenged the continued use of precautions or explored their impact on
      dislocation. However, these studies did not fully consider the impact of all precautions on
      dislocation, choosing to only select elements of the precautions for investigation. A recent
      review concluded the evidence evaluating practice and the impact of precautions was of poor
      quality. The review suggested further research should take into account different surgical
      approaches, different femoral head sizes and the type of prosthesis. Although there are
      studies that explored some of these hip dislocation confounders, the true impact of
      precautions remains unknown.

      Whilst precautions continue to be endorsed by surgeons and other clinicians, previous
      challenges have raised awareness of the possible excessiveness of precautions and the
      importance of further robust work recommended. This is particularly so in the wake of
      developments in surgical technique and prostheses design, such as hip joint capsule repair
      and larger femoral head sizes (larger hip replacements). These developments and their impact
      on dislocation are beginning to cast doubt on the impact of post-operative precautions and
      their direct link to incidence of dislocation, which is their primary purpose.

      The imposition of precautions has been evidenced to impact on both function and quality of
      life, with resultant non adherence in a proportion of patients. This study intends to explore
      whether an unrestricted pathway has no worse outcome in function, pain and quality of life
      parameters, in two specialist units in a multi-centre, prospective, randomised,
      non-inferiority study.

    <description>The OHS is a disease specific outcome measure routinely used and recommended to assess improvement in patient's function following Total Hip Replacement. The OHS consists of 12 items measuring pain, activity, joint mobility and ambulatory activity using a 5 point ordinal Likert Scale over the previous 4 weeks. The total score for the OHS range from 12-60 with the anchor of 12 signifying the least limited function and 60 signifying the most limited function.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an outcome measure designed to assess sleep quality, disturbance and impact on function over the preceding one month. The PSQI has been adopted in orthopaedic studies assessing the impact of orthopaedic conditions and surgery on sleep. The PSQI measures seven categories:
Subjective sleep quality
Sleep latency
Sleep duration
Habitual sleep efficiency
Sleep disturbances
Use of sleep medication
Daytime dysfunction Scores greater than 5 indicate clinically meaningfully disturbed sleep or poor sleep. measures will be repeated at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 following surgery</description>

    <description>The measure of health related quality of life is recommended in the assessment of new techniques in Total Hip Replacement using the EQ5D-5L. The EQ5D-5L measures health related quality of life (HRQoL) in 5 domains of mobility self-care, usual activities pain/discomfort and anxiety depression over the previous 4 weeks. These domains are assessed in three parts;
Using a descriptive system whereby patients are asked to rate their health, by identifying a response on a Likert scale. The 5 category Likert scale responses to the questions are coded to provide continuous data.
Use of a 20cm vertical visual analogue scale (VAS) with end points of 100 labelled 'the best health imaginable and 0 labelled 'the worst health imaginable.'
Using a continuous scale patients assign a preference value on to each of the health states generated in part 1 of the questionnaire.</description>
