  <brief_summary>

      The primary objective is to demonstrate that the risk of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) is
      correlated to the RNA III and SprD RNAs expression

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus ranks among the top three organisms for community-acquired,
      healthcare-related and nosocomial infections in humans. It lives as a commensal organism but
      can also provoke very severe diseases. Identifying markers of the 'colonization/disease'
      transition is of paramount importance. We recently found that an association of two
      regulatory RNAs was associated with S. aureus infection rather than colonization and with the
      severity of infection. Those preliminary results have to be confirmed with a more important
      prospective cohort.

    <description>all adult patients hospitalized in or consulting the Rennes University Hospital, known as S. aureus colonized could be included.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>SAB patients' group (SAB)</arm_group_label>
    <description>all adult patients with SAB could be included. S. aureus colonization in the nostrils will be systematically screened immediately after the first result of positive S. aureus blood culture. Two subgroups will be individualized depending on the SOFA Score:
Severe patients
Non-severe patients</description>

    <description>ST types will be determined for all individualized bacterial strains. For all the bacterial strains, RNAs expression will be analyzed at three different growth phases: early exponential phase, mid exponential phase and early stationary phase. Expression of RNAIII and SprD will be evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient over 18 years of age;

          -  Patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rennes, with according to groups:

               1. : Colonized subjects:

                    -  Any patient hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rennes, or any health
                       professional, in whom a colonization screening with S. aureus is performed
                       in routine care and a colonization with S. aureus is documented;

                  (For information, this screening is carried out frequently at the University
                  Hospital of Rennes for different reasons (before surgery or procedure requiring
                  the installation of equipment, screening of contact cases of infected cases,
                  investigation during a nosocomial epidemic...). These people are hospitalized for
                  reasons other than S. aureus infection and in different departments, but the
                  samples are collected centrally in the institution's bacteriology laboratory.)

               2. : Patients hospitalized for BSA:

                    -  Patients hospitalized in the infectious diseases and medical intensive care
                       unit and in the surgical intensive care unit, for whom a BSA is documented
                       at the bacteriology laboratory of the University Hospital of Rennes;

                    -  Patients for whom nasal carrying screening for S. aureus is prescribed as
                       part of their management;

                    -  These patients will be classified into two groups:

                         1. Serious clinic (CG):

          -  BSA ;

          -  Associated with signs of sepsis according to the 20168 international definition:

               -  SOFA score (see Appendix 3) 2 ;

               -  Septic shock will be defined as the existence of sepsis associated with
                  persistent low blood pressure requiring the administration of vasopressors to
                  obtain an average blood pressure (MAP) 65 mmHg and an arterial lactate dosage 2
                  mmol/L despite adequate vascular filling.

                  2) Non-serious clinic (CNG):

          -  BSA ;

          -  Which does not meet the definition of the CG group.

          -  Having expressed their opposition to this research or whose trusted person does not

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women;

          -  Persons of full age who are subject to legal protection (protection of justice,
             guardianship, guardianship), persons deprived of their liberty;

          -  S. aureus strain producing leucocidin from Panton-Valentine;
