    <textblock>
      Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the hepatological system. This
      study investigates reports of hepatological toxicities, including the International
      classification of disease ICD-10 for treatments in the World Health Organization (WHO) global
      Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database (VigiBase).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the hepatological system and are
      responsible of a wide range of hepatological diseases and side effects. Those are poorly
      described, due to the modification of the pharmacopeia, and the recent recognition of several
      of these adverse events. This study investigates the main characteristics of patients
      affected by rare hepatological side effects imputed to drugs. A causality assessment
      according to the WHO-UMC (World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Center) is
      systematically applied.
