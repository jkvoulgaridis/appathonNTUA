  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of the regular procedure for premature births, premature infants undergo several
      screening examinations, including an examination of the fundus. This examination seeks to
      establish whether the infant has retinopathy of prematurity. This disease affects the vessels
      of the retina of the eye, especially in prematurely born children, and can lead to serious
      complications such as blindness if it is not treated in time.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the discomfort caused by the screening in order to
      improve practices. To do this, the investigators would like to evaluate whether soft auditory
      stimulation, more precisely a person singing, would improve the children's level of comfort
      during the examination.

      To do this, the participating children will be divided into 2 groups:

        -  The &quot;Singing&quot; group will receive the usual comfort treatments (placed in a 'nest',
           pacifier and sugar water) and a trained professional will sing a lullaby or nursery
           rhyme at the same time

        -  control group will receive the usual comfort care (placed in a 'nest', pacifier and
           sugar water) The child's head and entire body will be filmed, which will allow an
           evaluator to assess the child's comfort.
