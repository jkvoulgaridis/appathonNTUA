  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vibrent Health is partnering with Stanford Cancer Center to conduct a randomized control
      trial (RCT) using mobile health technology to enhance adherence and improve swallowing
      outcomes in patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the 6th most common type of cancer in the world and has
      recently seen a dramatic rise in the United States due to a rise in the incidence of
      oropharyngeal cancers related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) . The majority of patients
      diagnosed with HNC receive radiation therapy at some point in their treatment, either in the
      definitive or post-operative setting. Dysphagia is a common consequence of treatment for HNC,
      experienced by approximately 50% of patients treated with radiation therapy. Post-treatment
      dysphagia has been associated with increased risk of morbidity/mortality as well as
      well-recognized deterioration of quality of life. Performance of swallowing exercises during
      radiation significantly reduces dysphagia risk; however, patient adherence to swallowing
      exercises during radiation treatment is limited. Thus, poor adherence stands as a major
      obstacle to achieving the best swallowing outcomes. In response to this, a mobile health
      application was developed to directly address barriers cited by patients as reasons for
      non-adherence. The objective is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the impact
      of the mobile application on adherence to prophylactic swallowing therapy during radiation
      for HNC.

    <description>Participants in the experimental arm (Group A) will receive a comprehensive swallowing rehabilitation app. This study seeks to determine if a mobile application may enhance adherence to swallowing therapy in patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. No devices - outside of the Smartphone already owned by the participant - will be used in this study. Similarly, no drugs, biological materials, or other substances will be used.</description>

    <description>The paper group (Group B) will be given paper exercise logs to fill out Participants will be educated regarding potential radiation-related side effects and trained in the same series of swallowing exercises by the SLP. The paper log treatment group will serve as a standard treatment group. As adherence is a primary goal of the target intervention, paper logging will be necessary to determine relative adherence while minimizing reporting bias.</description>

    <description>The smartphone application, tailored to patients with HNC, will monitor patient progress while also providing a direct line to health care providers should any questions or concerns arise concerning their treatment. The mobile application will also feature instructional videos that describe the swallowing exercises in detail, providing patients with another resource to help improve their overall rehabilitation experience. Finally, home practice reminders and prompts will be used to help patients integrate the exercises into their daily routine.</description>
