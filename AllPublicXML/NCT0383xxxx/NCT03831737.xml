    <description>During the initial 3 month control period, subjects are asked not to begin any new exercise or stretching program during this time.
During the 3 month intervention period that follows, subjects will participate in in-person physical therapist-led instructional sessions three times per week. Each stretch will be performed twice, one on the left and one on the right. The therapist will describe what to do and briefly demonstrate each stretch. Stretches will be held for 45-60 seconds with therapist instructions and modification as needed based on subject technique.</description>
