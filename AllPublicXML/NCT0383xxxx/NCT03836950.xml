  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine safety, feasibility, and the behavioral and brain
      effects of a non-invasive treatment, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), for
      Veterans with Parkinson's disease and mild impairments in their thinking. The hypothesis is
      that rTMS can improve thinking for people with Parkinson's disease who are experiencing mild
      problems with their thinking ability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) shows promise as an effective cognitive
      neurorehabilitation treatment. To date, no rTMS studies have assessed the effect of rTMS on
      cognitive function in PD-MCI. Nor has there been PD neurophysiological studies using rTMS to
      examine neural plasticity in cognitive neural networks. This study seeks to fill this gap by
      conducting a small scaled pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the
      safety and therapeutic effects of rTMS on cognitive outcomes as well as on brain connectivity
      in Veterans with PD-MCI. PD-MCI participants will be randomized to either active rTMS or sham
      rTMS. Participants will complete a standardized neurocognitive battery assessment at
      baseline, endpoint and at a one month follow-up. The primary outcome is change in executive
      function. Secondary outcomes include performance on other cognitive domain tasks and a
      proximal measure of real-life function that captures relevant functional changes related to
      cognitive impairment in PD. Multi-modal neuroimaging, in a subsample of participants, will be
      used to study neural connectivity changes induced by rTMS. Changes in resting state
      functional connectivity, grey matter volume via voxel-based morphometry and white matter
      integrity via diffusion tensor imaging will be assessed at baseline and endpoint. To inform
      how to optimize rTMS treatment in PD-MCI, these changes will be correlated with changes in
      cognitive performance.

    <description>The NIH-EXAMINER has an established 3-factor model defined by (1) cognitive control, (2) working memory (3) fluency. A confirmatory factor analysis indicates these 3-factors load on to 1-factor: executive composite score. Seven tests in the NIH-EXAMINER will be used to compute the composite score</description>

    <description>For active rTMS, a butterfly coil and MagVenture MagProX100 stimulator (MagVenture, Falun, Denmark) will be used. One rTMS session will consist of 40 trains of 5sec each at 110% of resting motor threshold and 15Hz will be provided at the left DLPFC.</description>

    <description>For sham rTMS, the procedure will be carried out at the left DLPFC but a sham coil will be used. The MagVenture coil has an active side and a placebo side allowing a double-blind study to be conducted. The sham system looks, sounds and feels like active rTMS.</description>
