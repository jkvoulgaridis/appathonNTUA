  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this work is to develop, systematically evaluate, and clinically test an
      integrated cessation intervention comprised of a depression-specific Behavioral Activation
      (BA) for cessation mobile app (&quot;Goal2Quit&quot;) packaged with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
      sampling. This integrated intervention will address the need for an easily disseminable,
      evidence-based, depression-specific cessation intervention for delivery via primary care.

    <description>Participants in the Goal2Quit + NRT Sampling condition will receive a download code to download the Goal2Quit mobile application. Goal2Quit is a mobile app for cigarette smokers with elevated symptoms of depression. Within the app, users identify values, create activities, schedule activities, rate mood daily, and track cigarette smoking. Participants in Group B will also receive a two-week &quot;starter kit&quot; sample of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; 14mg patch and 4mg lozenge). Participants will be asked to utilize Goal2Quit regularly, at least once per day, as well as the NRT sample in an attempt to quit smoking. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaire measures weekly for 8 weeks, with a final follow-up questionnaire at 12 weeks following study enrollment.</description>
