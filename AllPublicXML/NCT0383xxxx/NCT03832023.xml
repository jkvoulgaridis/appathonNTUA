  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The many gaps observed in the cascade of care of tuberculosis (TB) child contacts occur
      mostly in the screening, preventive therapy (PT) initiation and PT completion steps and the
      main drivers of these gaps are considered to be the health system infrastructure, limited
      worker resources and parents' reluctance to bring their children to the facility for
      screening. There would be great advantages of using a symptom-based screening at community
      level where only the symptomatic contacts are referred to hospital for further evaluation and
      asymptomatic contacts are started on PT in the community. Household or community-based
      screening is likely to improve the uptake and acceptability of child contact screening and
      management as well as adherence to PT and to reduce cost and workload at facility level.

      This study proposes to compare the cascade of care between two models for TB screening and
      management of household TB child contacts in two high TB burden and limited resource
      countries, Cameroon and Uganda. In the facility-based model, children will be screened at
      facility (Cameroon) or household level (Uganda) and preventive therapy initiation, refills of
      PT therapy and follow-up will be done at facility level. In the intervention group
      (community-based model), child contacts will be screened in the household by a community
      health worker (CHW). Those with symptoms suggestive of TB will be referred to the facility
      for TB investigations. Asymptomatic child contacts from high risk groups (under-5 years or
      HIV infected 5-14) will be initiated on PT (3 months isoniazid-rifampicin) in the household.
      Refills of PT therapy will also be done in the communities by the CHW. In both models,
      symptomatic children requiring further investigations for TB diagnosis will be referred to a
      health facility.

      The primary study objective is to compare the proportion of household child TB contacts
      eligible for PT (under-5 years and HIV-infected children 5-14 years without active TB) who
      initiate and complete PT using facility-based and decentralized community-based models of
      care for contact screening and management.

      Secondary objectives are:

        1. To compare the facility and community-based models in terms of:

             -  The full cascade of care for the initiation and completion of PT in child TB
                contacts &lt; 5 years or HIV+ children 5-14 years .

             -  Cascade of care for the detection and treatment of TB in child contacts (all ages):

             -  PT tolerability and adherence among eligible child contacts initiated on PT.

             -  Treatment uptake and outcomes for child contacts diagnosed with TB .

             -  Child contact outcomes at 6 months after enrollment for all child contacts.

             -  Acceptability by the parents/guardians, health personnel and community of the
                different models of care.

             -  Cost and cost-effectiveness of the different models.

        2. To assess the number of adult contact cases diagnosed with TB through the
           community-based screening.

        3. To compare between the pre- (baseline assessment) and post-intervention (by model of
           care) data related to:

             -  Children diagnosed with TB and registered at facility level and their treatment
                outcome.

             -  Adults diagnosed with TB and registered at facility level and their treatment
                outcome.

             -  PT initiation and outcomes.

      This study will be implemented under the frame of the Catalyzing Pediatric TB Innovation (CaP
      TB) Project, funded by Unitaid and implemented by the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
      Foundation (EGPAF). The goal of CaP TB is to improve the pediatric TB morbidity and mortality
      by catalyzing the wide uptake of the new first-line fixed dose combination drugs for children
      and optimizing the use of these drugs through improved case detection and innovative models
      of care. In both models of care, contacts with TB suggestive symptoms will be investigated
      for TB at the cluster facility that is supported by EGPAF within the CaP TB project. In
      Cameroon the CaP TB project will be implemented in the Central and Littoral regions and in
      Uganda in the South-West region.

    <intervention_model_description>Clusters were selected among facilities participating in the first phase of the CAP-TB project following an initial facility assessment for participating in the CAP-TB project. Facilities with diagnostic and treatment capacity and detecting and minimum of 50 bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases per year in a rural/semi-rural or semi-urban setting were selected. The facilities correspond to district hospitals in Cameroon and health center IV or district hospitals in Uganda.
Twenty clusters will be randomized between the intervention and the facility-based model. The randomization unit (cluster) will be the facility where TB cases (index cases) are diagnosed and its catchment area.</intervention_model_description>
