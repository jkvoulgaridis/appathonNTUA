  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate narlaprevir (NVR) pharmacokinetics (PK) after a single
      dose with or without ritonavir (RTV) in cirrhotic Child-Pugh class A patients without active
      HCV infection versus healthy subjects as well as to assess safety and tolerability of such
      treatment combination.

      The objective of this study was to evaluate PK after a single oral dose of NVR alone and in
      combination with RTV in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis and in matched healthy
      controls.

      The study consisted of 2 parts. In Part I of the study, 8 patients with compensated cirrhosis
      (Child-Pugh Class A) and 8 matched healthy adult subjects received single doses of NVR at 200
      mg with 240 ml of water after a standard breakfast. The 200-mg NVR dose was chosen since this
      is the intended therapeutic dose. Blood and urine samples were obtained to determine
      narlaprevir concentration in plasma and urine.

      As an additional safety precaution, patients with Child-Pugh Class A hepatic impairment were
      studied successively in Part I and Part II on the basis of the results of an interim safety
      analysis data and PK data.

      Based on the results of the interim analysis after the Part I of the study, it was decided to
      reduce the dose of narlaprevir from baseline 200 mg to 100 mg in Part II of the study.

      In part 2 of the study, 8 patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A) and 8
      healthy subjects received NVR at 100 mg in combination with RTV at 100 mg with 240 ml of
      water after a standard breakfast. Blood and urine samples were obtained to determine
      narlaprevir concentration, its metabolite and ritonavir in plasma and urine.

      The total duration of the study for each subject was a maximum of 35 days.

                  throughout the study.

               -  A patient/volunteer received drugs, food supplements or food products prohibited
                  in the study, with the exception of non-prescription drugs pre-approved for use
                  by the Sponsor. When deciding on inclusion in the study, particular attention was
                  paid to the use of such drugs as azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole),
                  antibiotics, macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin), cimetidine, HIV protease
                  inhibitors, nefazodone, rifampin, phenytoin, dexamethasone, troglitazone,
                  barbiturates or any inducers or inhibitors of enzymes P-450 CYP3A or CYP2C9 and
                  substrates or inhibitors of transport protein P-gp. In addition, drugs known
                  under strong evidence for their ability to prolong the QT interval and cause
                  polymorphic ventricular tachycardia should also have been considered as drugs of
                  concern at inclusion.

               -  Pregnant and lactating females as well as females who planned to become pregnant
                  or to deliver eggs for fertilization before, during, or within 1 month after
                  taking part in the study. The males who planned to deliver sperm for
                  fertilization during the study or within 12 weeks after it.

               -  A patient/volunteer had cancer in history other than basal cell carcinoma being
                  in remission for at least 5 years before Day 1.

               -  At screening, a patient/volunteer had positive results of tests for surface
                  antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBsAG), for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV),
                  for antigen/antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients/volunteers
                  with hepatitis B or C in history were not included in the study. The study could
                  include patients/volunteers with a history of hepatitis A from which they
                  recovered without any treatment, if there was no documentary evidence on complete
                  resolution of the disease for at least 6 months prior to Day 1.

               -  A patient/volunteer underwent surgery, donated or lost 450 or more ml of blood
                  (including plasmapheresis, or underwent transfusion of blood products within 90
                  days prior to Day 1.

               -  A patient/volunteer had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
                  eosinophilic esophagitis, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, dyspepsia, Barrett's
                  esophagus or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, or had a history of or had at the time
                  of the study (during 6 months before screening) gastrointestinal diseases that
                  could conceivably affect the absorption of drugs.

               -  A history of strokes, seizures or severe chronic neurological disorders.

               -  A patient/volunteer had a history of or had at the time of the study clinically
                  significant endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematologic, immune,
                  renal, respiratory or urinary disorders or diseases which the Investigator
                  believed to affect the correct evaluation of the study or pose additional risks
                  to a patient/volunteer's participation in the study.

               -  A patient/volunteer had creatinine clearance &lt;60 ml/min under Cockcroft-Gault
                  calculation at screening.

               -  A patient/volunteer had multiple and/or severe allergy history or had a history

                  drugs (including those for entertainment) or had a history of drug or alcohol
                  addiction for about 2 years.

               -  The Investigator had any concerns about safety of a patient/volunteer
                  participation in the study, or any other reason why the Investigator believed
                  that the patient was not suitable for participation in the study.

               -  A patient/volunteer was not able to refrain from the use or intended use of any
                  prescription or non-prescription drugs or herbal preparations (for example, St.
                  John's wort [hypericum perforatum], green tea, ginkgo, coenzyme Q, ginseng,
                  Echinacea, etc.) or dietary supplements (e.g., garlic supplements) starting about
                  2 weeks (or 5 half-lives) before the study drug dosing throughout the study and
                  before and before the visit after the study. Patients with hepatic impairment
                  administered with medication for treatment of this disease could participate in
                  the study, if these drugs were administered at stable state for at least 4 weeks.

          2. Specific non-inclusion criteria for healthy volunteers:

               -  A volunteer had a history of any chronic and/or acute liver disease, including an
                  increase in transaminase serum levels, hepatitis, biliary tract disease, or a
                  history of significant surgery on the gastrointestinal tract. The study could
                  include volunteers who had a history of transient increase in transaminase levels
                  fully resolved not later than 6 months before entering the study.

               -  Any laboratory parameter exceeding ULN at screening visit established by the
                  testing laboratory (if the deviation was considered clinically insignificant by
                  the Investigator, the deviation could be ±10% from the normal range).
