      To define the parameters for dose-dependent engraftment of MET-2 commensal bacteria for the
      treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will deliver MET-2 at two different doses via an oral capsule in patients with
      active mucosal inflammation and observe its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical efficacy as compared to placebo. The goal is to define the
      parameters for dose-dependent engraftment of MET-2 commensal bacteria for the treatment of
      mild to moderate ulcerative colitis not fully responsive to conventional therapy.

    <description>Mucosal biopsies will be taken and assessed. Assessment will be made using the Mayo Score for Ulcerative Colitis. There are four domains in this scale: Stool frequency, Rectal bleeding, Findings on endoscopy, Physician's global assessment. Each domain has a scoring range of 0 - 3, where 0 represents best possible outcome and 3 represents worst possible outcome. Efficacy of treatment will be defined as a 'Findings on endoscopy' score of less than or equal to one.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Mild to Moderate UC.

          3. Able to provide informed consent, or have a caregiver able to provide consent.

          4. Subjects must have a documented diagnosis (radiologic or endoscopic with histology) of
             UC for &gt;3 months before screening. The following must be available in each subject's
             source documentation:

          7. Allergy to vancomycin.

          8. Elective surgery that will require preoperative antibiotics planned within 3 months of
