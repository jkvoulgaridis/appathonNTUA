    <textblock>
      In this study, 40 patients with a history of Mild- Periodontitis who were diagnosed with
      clinical and radiographic findings showed that all of the periodontal parameters before the
      treatment, during the treatment period Then, scaling &amp; Root planing and oral hygiene
      instructions were given to the patients, and after 2 weeks, the patients who received the
      study were randomly divided into two groups (Balanced Block Randomization) with four blocks
      according to the visit time. To group A, oral chlorohexidine and to B group, the drug
      Ketorolac was given. 5 mm of the drugs required every 15 days the areas underwent a gingival
      wash with an insulin syringe, which lasted for 3 months.

      group, the drug Ketorolac (Exir-Boroujerd) was given. 5 mm of the drugs required every 15
      days the areas underwent a gingival wash with an insulin syringe, which lasted for 3 months.
      Pl, BI, PD were evaluated in the study sessions. At the end of the clinical change, a
      multiple measure ANOVA test was used to compare the preceding and follow-up sessions in both
      groups, considering the intervention method as Between subject comparison And measured at the
      time of measurement as a Repeated Factor.
