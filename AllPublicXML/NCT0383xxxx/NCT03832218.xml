  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major steps forward of the neurosciences in recent years have linked psychiatric
      diseases, neuropsychological symptoms and brain dysfunctions. The cerebral functioning
      requiring a big quantity of energy, mitochondria, essential organelles in the cellular energy
      processes, are at present considered as a way of research for big interest in neurology and
      in psychiatry. Thus, an increasing number of studies describe potential links between
      mitochondrial dysfunction and psychiatric symptomatology. The clinical symptomatology of
      children with mitochondrial cytopathy is varied. Well described neurologically and
      somatically, it is significantly less in its psychiatric aspects. However, psychiatric
      symptoms are frequently associated and this symptom has already been described in adult
      patients. The symptoms mainly include depressive and anxiety disorders, or even tables
      suggestive of psychotic disorders, which would precede the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease
      of 13 years on average.

      Neuropsychological disorders refer to disorders of the higher functions following a cerebral
      anomaly (language, praxis, motricity, gnosis, visual spatial processing, memory, attention,
      intelligence, executive functions ...). Tests validated in French and adapted to children and
      adolescents can identify neuropsychological disorders in these populations.
