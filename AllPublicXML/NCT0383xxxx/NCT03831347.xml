        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adolescents must have elevated depressive symptoms, defined by a score of 11 or higher
             on the Quick Inventory of Depression -Adolescent Version-- Clinician Rating
             (QIDS-A-CR), including endorsement of either sad mood or anhedonia on the QIDS.

          2. Other treatment for depression must be stable at baseline. Adolescents do not have to
             be in other treatment for depression, but, if they are, it must be stable for the past
             12 weeks.

          3. Adolescents must be aged 13-18.

          4. Adolescents must be medically cleared for moderate physical activity by their primary
             care physician. This criterion may be met by a current (dated in the past year)
             statement from their pediatrician that the adolescent may participate in school or
             camp programs including physical education.

          5. Adolescents must be able to read and write English sufficient to complete informed
             consent and engage in interventions.

          6. Adolescents aged 13-17 must assent to be in the study, and their parent or legal
             guardian must consent to their participation. Adolescents aged 18 must consent to be
             in the study.

          7. Able to attend one of the class times.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. QIDS- A-CR may not be higher than a score of 21. This ensures that adolescents are not
             severely depressed.

          2. Adolescents who meet criteria for:

               -  Current (past year) autism spectrum disorder (AS), if of sufficient severity to
                  interfere with study treatment per clinician judgment;

               -  Schizophrenia;

               -  Bipolar disorder;

               -  Clinically significant psychotic symptoms in the past month;

               -  Anorexia or Bulimia in past 3 months

               -  Substance use disorders in the past 12 months and symptoms are of sufficient
                  severity to interfere with study treatment per clinician judgment These will be
                  assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

          3. Adolescents may not have current suicide ideation or behavior that warrants immediate
             treatment. They may have passive ideation (i.e., thoughts that life is not worth
             living), but may not have active suicide ideation, intent, plan, or an attempt within
             the previous 6 months.

          4. Adolescents cannot currently be engaged in or yoga classes, as this is the study
             intervention.

          5. Adolescents cannot be pregnant as yoga should be modified for pregnancy
