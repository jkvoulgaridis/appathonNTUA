  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      H0: &quot;Within the first year post-placement, four interforaminally placed, immediately loaded
      2.4 mm narrow-diameter one-piece TiZr implants with miniaturized stud-type attachments show
      improved patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) compared to two interforaminally placed,
      early loaded, TiZr two-piece implants with stud-type attachments to retain a mandibular
      overdenture.&quot;The specific aim is to compare both treatment alternatives to evaluate which one
      may be recommended for elderly edentulous patients.
