  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xanamem™ is being developed as a potential drug for Alzheimer's disease. This study drug has
      been designed to change the cortisol levels in the brain. Cortisol is a naturally occurring
      hormone in the body. It is believed that reducing the level of cortisol will be a benefit in
      the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

      The XanaHES study is testing the safety and tolerability of Xanamem. It is planned to enrol
      approximately 84 participants, male and female aged from 50 to 75 who are in good health, in
      the study at 1 centre in Australia.

      The XanaHES Phase I study is a single-blind study. Subjects will be randomised to receive
      either 20mg once daily Xanamem or Placebo in cohort 1. Once all subjects have completed the
      study treatment of 12 weeks, a dose escalation committee will decide if a new cohort, cohort
      2, with 30mg once daily vs placebo is started.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomised, single-centre, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      assess the safety, tolerability of oral Xanamem once daily in healthy elderly subjects.

      It is planned to randomise approximately 84 subjects, 42 in each cohort, at a single site in
      Australia.

      Cohort 1 starts with a 20mg QD dose vs matching placebo. A Dose Escalation Committee will
      review the results from cohort 1 and provide a recommendation to proceed with Cohort 2
      randomisation which involves a dose escalation to 30mg.

      At the Baseline visit (Week 0), eligible subjects will be randomised on a 30:12 ratio to
      receive either Xanamem administered orally QD (treatment group) or matching placebo (placebo
      group). Subjects will return to the study site for visits at Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8,
      Week 10, End of Treatment (Week 12) and Follow-up (4 weeks post last dose of study drug)
      visits, at which study assessments will be performed.

      Ad hoc telephone contact may also occur at any other time-point throughout the study, if
      deemed necessary by the investigator/study nurse, or if the subject wishes to report an
      adverse event (AE).

      Subjects will be interviewed and examined at the study site at each visit and will complete a
      variety of questionnaires, routine safety evaluations and nerve function tests.

      A central reader will review every Nerve Function Monitoring (NFM) assessment performed for
      each subject for Potential Nerve Safety Signals (PNSS).

      Optional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling will be performed at baseline and end of
      treatment visits for a small subgroup of subjects, who provide additional consent. Subjects
      who do not provide consent for this optional sub-study will still be eligible for the main
      study.

      The overall study duration for an individual subject will be 17 to 20 weeks, including a
      screening period of up to 4 weeks, a single-blind treatment period of 12 weeks, and a
      follow-up period of 4 weeks. The total duration of the study is expected to be 1.5 years.

In this test an event (a card turning face up) occurs in the centre of the computer screen and the subject must decide &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot; as to whether this event meets a predefined and unchanging criterion (is the colour of the card red?).

    <description>Changes in Cogstate the Cogstate One Back memory test is a valid measure of working memory. On this test the subject is shown a single stimulus in the centre of the computer screen (a card turns face up).

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 (End of Treatment), Week 16 (Follow-Up)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Cogstate the One Card Learning test is a continuous visual recognition learning test that assesses visual learning within a pattern separation model. The One Card Learning test has been shown to be a valid test of learning and memory. In this test the participant must attend to the card in the centre of the screen and respond to the question &quot;have you seen this card before in this test?&quot; If the answer was yes, participants are instructed to press the &quot;YES&quot; button, and the &quot;NO&quot; button if the answer is no. Normal playing cards are displayed (without joker cards). In this test, six cards are drawn at random from the deck and are repeated throughout the test. These four cards are interspersed with distractors (non-repeating cards). The test ends after 50 trials, without rescheduling for post-anticipatory correct trials. The primary performance measure for this test is the proportion of correct answers (accuracy), which is normalized using an arcsine square root transformation.</description>

    <description>Changes in Cogstate the Continuous Paired Associate Learning test is a measure of visual associate memory and uses a well-validated paired associate learning paradigm in which the subject must learn the locations of a number of amoeba-like shapes on the computer screen. Finding the correct location for all patterns in the set is defined as a learning trial. There are six learning trials. A single trial delayed recall condition is available for this test after a 10-30-minute delay. The software records each move as an error or as a correct move.</description>

    <description>Overall Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will be assessed by EuroQoL Health Related Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L). The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, participant-rated questionnaire for use as a measure of health outcomes.
The EQ 5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system provides a profile of the participant's health state in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression).
For each dimension, the participant is instructed to choose one of 5 levels that best describes their health on that day: &quot;no problem&quot; (1), &quot;slight&quot; (2), &quot;moderate&quot; (3), &quot;severe&quot; (4), or &quot;unable/extreme&quot; (5). The VAS is the participant's rating of their health on a scale of 0 &quot;worst health you can imagine&quot; to 100 &quot;best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>
