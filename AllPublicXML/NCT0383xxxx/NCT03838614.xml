      Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of RAS-MPT, RAS alone, MPT alone, and usual care (as
      a control) for improving the overall gait performance of and reducing falls in children with
      developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and to explore the relationship between gait
      performance and falls in this population.

      Design: A randomized controlled trial. Sample: 76 children with DCD. Interventions: RAS-MPT,
      RAS alone, MPT alone, or usual care (12 weeks). Major outcomes: Outcomes will be evaluated at
      baseline, post-intervention, and a 6-month follow-up. Comprehensive gait analysis will
      produce spatiotemporal gait parameters (e.g., velocity and stride length), kinematic gait
      parameters (e.g., knee joint motions), and leg muscle EMG outcomes; an isokinetic test will
      quantify leg muscle strength and force production time; and fall histories will be obtained
      via interviews. Anticipated results and significance: The RAS-MPT group is predicted to
      display the best gait performance, which is associated with reduced fall incidents. This
      novel training regime can be readily adopted in school, clinical, or home settings to improve
      locomotor ability in children with DCD, an outcome with positive socioeconomic implications.
