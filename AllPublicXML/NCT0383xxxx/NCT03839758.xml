  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total shoulder arthroplasty is an effective procedure to improve patients function and to
      relieve shoulder pain in cases of glenohumeral arthritis. The main challenge of this
      procedure is implanting the glenoid component. Indeed, surgical exposure is difficult and
      proper visualization of the glenoid is demanding. The current free-hand method is not precise
      and especially unreliable in glenoids with severe deformity. Inappropriate reaming and
      glenoid positioning can cause more bone loss during surgery.

      In anatomic prostheses, glenoid component fixation is demanding and is the first component to
      present loosening at long term follow-up. When it comes to reverse arthroplasty, the glenoid
      component, once again, requires the most attention. Malpositioning of the glenosphere can
      cause notching, loosening, and instability.

      In order to prevent these complications, precision in glenoid implantation is key. To this
      end, intraoperative computer navigation would be a helpful tool, but the increased expenses
      in computer equipment represent massive costs and possibly increases in surgical time. A more
      affordable option is a personalized guide, for which the only extra expense is the customized
      guide. These guides are based on precise 3D CT scan templates. Previous studies have
      evaluated the precision of the guide in vivo and in vitro, but none have measured it in a
      randomized study. As it represents additional costs, its efficacy needs to be proven before
      widespread use.

      This method may also provide secondary benefits, such as decreasing operating time, lowering
      short- and long-term complications, and improving efficacy.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a patient specific glenoid
      guide.

      All participants scheduled for elective primary total shoulder arthroplasty will be contacted
      by a research assistant. Preoperative status will be characterized by demographic data, range
      of motion, quality of life, and functional status. A CT Scan and x-rays are part of standard
      preoperative care and always done prior to total shoulder replacement in our institution;
      these images will be collected for the study. Patients will be randomized to one of the two
      groups:

        1. Patient-specific glenoid guide group: Glenoid preparation will be done using the
           personalized guide provided by Wright-Tornier. This guide will be ordered after CT-scan
           measurement, using Blueprint software prior to surgery.

        2. Classic method group: Glenoid preparation will be done following surgeon evaluation of
           the 2D CT scan with the institution software. Generic guides included in the regular
           instrumentation set will be used.

      The investigators will use the classification proposed by Iannotti et al. to characterize
      glenoid bone loss prior to surgery. Glenoid bone density will be measured using radiology
      software (Hounsfield units). Blueprint software will be used to measure the preoperative
      anatomical characteristics of the glenoid: surface area, version, inclination and
      subluxation. This will be done prior to surgery in the patient specific group and after
      surgery in the classic group.
