  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of an intervention to prevent chronic
      diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity in midlife and older Latino adults
      living with HIV. The investigators expect that the participant will be in this study for
      seven months. Participants will be interviewed and asked to take part in walking groups.

MCS scores range from 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better mental health related quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in lipid profile as measured by total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4, Month 7</time_frame>
    <description>A total cholesterol value of less than 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L) is desirable and 240 mg/dL (6.22 mmol/L) or higher is high. Average HDL-C level is 40-50 mg/dL (1.0-1.3 mmol/L) for men. Low HDL-C level, increased risk, is less than 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L). Optimal LDL-C levels are less than 100 mg/d while high levels are 160-189 mg/dL (4.15-4.90 mmol/L). Desirable triglyceride levels are less than 150 mg/dL (1.70 mmol/L) while high levels are considered 200-499 mg/dL (2.3-5.6 mmol/L).</description>
