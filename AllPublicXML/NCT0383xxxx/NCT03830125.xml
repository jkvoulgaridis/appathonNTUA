             qualified designee at screening and check-in.

          -  For a female, must be of non-childbearing potential and therefore must have undergone
             one of the following sterilization procedures, at least 6 months prior to the first
             dose:

               1. hysteroscopic sterilization;

               2. bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy;

               3. hysterectomy;

               4. bilateral oophorectomy; or be postmenopausal with amenorrhea for at least 1 year

          -  A non-vasectomized, male subject must agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain
             from sexual intercourse during the study until 90 days beyond the last dose of study
             drug. (No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male provided his vasectomy has
             been performed 4 months or more prior to the first dose of study drug. A male who has
             been vasectomized less than 4 months prior to the first dose must follow the same
             restrictions as a non-vasectomized male).

          -  If male, must agree to not donate sperm from the first dose until 90 days after the
             last dose of study drug.

          -  Must have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form (ICF),
             which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any illness that, in the opinion of the PI or designee, might confound the
             results of the study or poses an additional risk to the subject by their participation
             in the study.

          -  History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years prior to the
             first dose or regular alcohol consumption within 6 months prior to the first dose with
             an average weekly intake of greater than 21 glasses/units per week for males or 14
             glasses/units per week for females, with one unit = 150 mL of wine or 360 mL of beer
             or 45 mL of 45% alcohol.

          -  History or presence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to the study drug(s)

               -  Any drug, including prescription and non-prescription medications, herbal

          -  Has been on a diet incompatible with the on-study diet, in the opinion of the PI or
             designee, within the 28 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study.

          -  Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to the first dose.

          -  Plasma donation within 7 days prior to the first dose.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to first
             dosing day.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within 30 days, or 5 half-lives of the investigational product (whichever is
             longer) of the first dose of study drug in the current study.

          -  Any condition or circumstance, in the opinion of the PI or designee, which may make
             the subject unlikely to complete the study or comply with study procedures and
             requirements, or may pose a risk to the subject's safety.
