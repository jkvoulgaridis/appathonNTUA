    <description>Plan to use a monophasic waveform having 100µmsec pulse duration, 300msec interpulse interval, and at a pulse rate 20 Hz and using tolerated voltage for a total of 20 minutes. Electrical stimulation will be produced with the Orthostim 3 device. The cathode will be placed on the ipsilateral muscle to stimulate and the anode over the ipsilateral arm.
The voltage is turned up by the participant until he or she can see twitches or as high as tolerated.</description>

    <description>Plan to use a monophasic waveform having 100µmsec pulse duration, 300msec interpulse interval, and at a pulse rate 20 Hz and using tolerated voltage for a total of 20 minutes. Electrical stimulation will be produced with the Orthostim 3 device. The cathode will be placed on the ipsilateral muscle to stimulate and the anode over the ipsilateral arm.
The voltage is turned down two clicks from the voltage at which the participant can first notice any electricity or at the minimal setting.</description>
