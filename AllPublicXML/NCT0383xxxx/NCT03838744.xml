      Randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter phase II clinical study. Patients will
      be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2 24-hour intravenous
      continuous infusion every 3 weeks with olaparib (per os) 150 mg twice a day versus
      trabectedin 1.5 mg/m2 intravenous 24-hour continuous infusion every 3 weeks until progression
      or unacceptable toxicity as second- or further-line treatment in a population of STS patients
