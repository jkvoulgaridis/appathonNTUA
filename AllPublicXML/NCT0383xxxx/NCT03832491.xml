  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired pulmonary function, decreased physical activity, functional capacity and depending
      on these factors are reported in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia in recent studies.
      The purpose of this study to evaluate the effects of game based approach on pulmonary
      function, functional capacity and quality of life in patients with primary ciliary dykinesia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder characterized
      by congenital structural abnormalities and impairment of respiratory function. Mucociliary
      clearance is affected by disorders in the structure and movement of cilia. That causes
      repeated infections in the upper and lower respiratory tract.In addition to mucociliary
      effects and impaired lung function, it is thought that there may be a decrease in respiratory
      muscle strength and functional capacity. One of the factors affecting functional capacity is
      the level of physical activity. For these reasons, the management of the respiratory system
      in patients with PCD is very important. In addition to airway clearence techniques,
      approaches to increase physical activity are also important. It was thought that severe
      physical activity could be an important determinant of cardiopulmonary functional capacity in
      patients with mild to moderate PCD. The level of physical activity is known to be associated
      with quality of life.

      In literature no study investigated the effects of game based approach on oxygenation,
      functional capacity and quality of life in patients with PCD. Game based approach is a new
      method lead to increase physical activity. In literature there is no study investigated the
      effects of game based approach on oxygenation, functional capacity and quality of life in
      patients with PCD.
