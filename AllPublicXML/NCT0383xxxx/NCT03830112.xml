  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the current evidence, it is known that Pilates is an exercise technique that has
      been used mainly by women in sport, fitness and rehabilitation. Most research has been
      developed with women. The participation of men in the research studies is reduced and
      methodology rigor is low, therefore, there is insufficient evidence on the effects of this
      type of training in men, in addition, there are no studies that have proven the effects of a
      Pilates-based mat exercise with resistance band on strength of core muscles.

      The main objective of this research is to identify the effects of a Pilates-based mat
      exercise program versus a Pilates-based exercise mat program with resistance band on the
      isometric strength of the core muscles in men 18 to 25 years.

      Fifty-eight men will be randomly assigned to one of two Pilates exercise programs.
      Pilates-based mat exercise and Pilates-based mat exercise with Theraband® (blue color).
      Interventions will be performed three times a week for eight-weeks on alternate days. Half
      will perform Pilates-based mat exercise and the remaining 29 will perform Pilates-based mat
      exercise with Theraband®. Both groups complete eleven exercises from week one to four and
      twelve exercises from week five to eight.
