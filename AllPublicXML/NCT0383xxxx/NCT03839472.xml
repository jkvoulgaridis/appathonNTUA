  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if washing out the bladder with large volumes
      of saline after surgical removal of bladder tumors helps to decrease the number of loose
      cells floating within the bladder after surgery. Anticipated decrease in tumor recurrence
      and/or progression rates will be measured.

    <textblock>
      Bladder tumor recurrence after resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) occurs
      in 50-70% of patients despite the use of adjuvant anticancer therapy after surgery. This is a
      single-arm, non-randomized pilot study looking to determine whether post-Transurethral
      Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) cells counts differ significantly between continuous
      washout of the bladder (CBI) with normal saline compared to pre-CBI wash out. Anticipated
      decrease in tumor recurrence and/or progression rates will also be measured, and each
      participant will act as their own internal control.
