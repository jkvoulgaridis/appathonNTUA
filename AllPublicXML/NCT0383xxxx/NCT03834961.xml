      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well larotrectinib works in treating
      patients with previously untreated TRK fusion solid tumors and TRK fusion acute leukemia that
      has come back. Larotrectinib may stop the growth of cancer cells with TRK fusions by blocking
      the TRK enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of children with infantile fibrosarcoma
      (IFS) treated with neoadjuvant larotrectinib prior to local control.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of response
      (DoR) of children with IFS treated with neoadjuvant larotrectinib prior to local control.

      II. To determine the ORR, EFS, OS, and DoR of children with newly diagnosed TRK fusion solid
      tumors other than IFS treated with neoadjuvant larotrectinib prior to local control.

      III. To describe the toxicity of larotrectinib in children with solid tumors and acute
      leukemia.

      IV. To determine the percentage of patients with TRK fusion solid tumors with detectable
      circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at baseline and after 1 week, 4 weeks, 24 weeks
      of treatment, at the time of discontinuation of larotrectinib therapy, and at progression.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the EFS, OS, and DoR of children with TRK fusion solid tumors other than IFS
      treated with adjuvant larotrectinib following upfront surgery with positive margins after
      neoadjuvant larotrectinib.

      II. To determine the EFS, OS, and DoR of children with TRK fusion solid tumors who experience
      a complete response to larotrectinib and subsequently discontinue larotrectinib therapy.

      III. To determine the remission induction rate for patients with recurrent/refractory TRK
      fusion leukemia when treated with larotrectinib.

      IV. To evaluate the surgical morbidity and extent of resection of initially unresectable
      tumors in patients with TRK fusion solid tumors who undergo surgical resection following
      neoadjuvant larotrectinib.

      V. To evaluate mechanisms of response and resistance to larotrectinib in children with TRK
      fusion cancers.

      VI. To evaluate the morphologic features of TRK fusion solid tumors at time of initial biopsy
      to further define criteria for pathologic diagnosis of these tumors.

      VII. To evaluate immunohistochemistry for pan-TRK as a screening method for TRK fusion tumors
      and in resection specimens following neoadjuvant treatment with larotrectinib.

      VIII. To evaluate the histologic response to larotrectinib in resection specimens following
      neoadjuvant treatment.

      IX. To evaluate circulating tumor DNA for the detection of the emergence of resistance
      mutations and recurrence in patients with TRK fusion solid tumors treated with larotrectinib.

      X. To evaluate the ratio of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to concurrent plasma concentrations of
      larotrectinib in patients with leukemia.

      XI. To evaluate the change in neurocognitive/behavioral functioning over time between
      baseline and 2 years post-diagnosis of patients treated on this protocol using
      parent-reported adaptive functioning (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System [ABAS]-III General
      Adaptive Composite), executive function (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function
      Scales-Preschool Version [BRIEF-P] or BRIEF Global Executive Composite Score), psychosocial
      functioning (Behavior Assessment System for Children [BASC]-3 Internalizing, Externalizing
      and Behavioral Symptoms Indices) and quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory
      [PedsQL] Total score).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive larotrectinib orally (PO) or by nasogastric (NG) or gastric tube (G-tube)
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients whose tumors shrink
      sufficiently while taking larotrectinib may undergo surgical resection of their tumor while
      on study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36,
      and 48 months and annually thereafter for up to 5 years from the date of study entry.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  COHORT A: Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of infantile fibrosarcoma with an
             NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion identified in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
             Act/College of American Pathologists (CLIA/CAP) certified laboratory. Fusions may be
             identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or molecular techniques
             (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] using primers flanking the
             fusion junction or next generation sequencing). For fusions identified by FISH, an
             ETV6 rearrangement is sufficient for eligibility in Cohort A. Identification of the
             upstream TRK fusion partner is not required.

          -  COHORT B: Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of any solid tumor other than
             infantile fibrosarcoma, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors but excluding
             high grade gliomas. An NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion must be identified in a CLIA/CAP
             certified laboratory. Fusions may be identified by FISH or molecular techniques
             (RT-PCR using primers flanking the fusion junction or next generation sequencing). For
             fusions identified by FISH, there must be an identified rearrangement in NTRK1, NTRK2,
             or NTRK3 (e.g., an ETV6 rearrangement is not sufficient for eligibility) unless the
             patient has a diagnosis of congenital mesoblastic nephroma in which case an ETV6
             rearrangement is sufficient for eligibility. Identification of the upstream TRK fusion
             partner is not required.

          -  COHORT C: Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of relapsed or refractory acute
             leukemia with an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion identified in a CLIA/CAP certified
             laboratory. Fusions may be identified by FISH or molecular techniques (RT-PCR using
             primers flanking the fusion junction or next generation sequencing). For fusions
             identified by FISH, there must be an identified rearrangement in NTRK1, NTRK2, or
             NTRK3 (e.g., an ETV6 rearrangement is not sufficient for eligibility). Identification
             of the upstream TRK fusion partner is not required.

          -  SOLID TUMORS (COHORTS A AND B): Patients must have measurable disease. Patients must
             have disease that cannot be completely resected without a predicted functional,
             neurologic, or significant cosmetic deficit in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  LEUKEMIA (COHORT C): Patients must have &gt;= 5% blasts in the bone marrow.
             Extramedullary disease is permitted.

             corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) categories 0, 1 or 2. Use
             Karnofsky for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky for patients =&lt; 16 years of age.
             NOTE: Neurologic deficits in patients with CNS tumors must have been stable for at
             least 7 days prior to study enrollment. Patients who are unable to walk because of
             paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the
             purpose of assessing the performance score.

          -  COHORTS A AND B: No prior anti-cancer therapy, including radiotherapy, other than
             surgical resection is permitted.

               -  Patients who experience recurrence after surgery alone and no other anti-cancer
                  therapy will be eligible.

               -  If not eligible due to prior anticancer therapy, patients may be eligible for the

          -  Patients with solid tumors: Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) =&lt; 1.5 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (within 7 days prior to enrollment). After
             approval of the study chair or designee, infants with a higher total bilirubin due to
             physiologic or breast milk jaundice are eligible if the conjugated (direct) bilirubin
             is =&lt; 2 mg/dL

          -  Patients with solid tumors: Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine
             aminotransferase [ALT]) =&lt; 135 U/L (within 7 days prior to enrollment). For the
             purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L

          -  Patients with solid tumors: Serum albumin &gt;= 2 g/dL (within 7 days prior to
             enrollment).

          -  Patients with leukemias: Conjugated (direct) bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal
             (ULN) for age (within 7 days prior to enrollment).

          -  Patients with leukemias: SGPT (ALT) =&lt; 225 U/L (within 7 days prior to enrollment).
             For the purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L

          -  Patients with leukemias: Serum albumin &gt;= 2 g/dL (within 7 days prior to enrollment).

          -  Patients with seizure disorder may be enrolled if on a stable antiepileptic regimen
             for &gt;= 14 days and well controlled.

          -  Nervous system disorders (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]
             version [v] 5) except tendon reflex decreased resulting from prior therapy must be =&lt;
             grade 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of
             fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies, OR because there
             is yet no available information regarding human fetal or teratogenic toxicities.
             Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Female patients of
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use a highly
             effective contraceptive method for the duration of study therapy and for at least one
             month after the final dose of larotrectinib. Males of reproductive potential with a
             non-pregnant female partner of child-bearing potential must use a highly effective
             contraception for the duration of the study and for at least one month after the final
             dose of larotrectinib. Because of the unknown risk of larotrectinib in nursing
             infants, nursing women should discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with
             larotrectinib and for 3 days following the final dose.

          -  Patients with solid tumors, including CNS tumors, requiring corticosteroids who have
             not been on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroid for at least 7 days prior to
             enrollment are not eligible. Patients with leukemia may receive systemic
             corticosteroids for cytoreduction up to 24 hours prior to the start of protocol
             therapy. If used to modify immune adverse events related to prior therapy, &gt;= 14 days
             must have elapsed since last dose of corticosteroid.

          -  Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug are not eligible.

          -  Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible [except
             leukemia patients receiving corticosteroids or hydroxyurea, which may be continued
             until 24 hours prior to start of protocol therapy]. Patients with leukemia should
             receive a single dose of intrathecal cytarabine, hydrocortisone, and/or methotrexate
             within 7 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 at the time of the baseline lumbar puncture.

          -  Patients who are receiving cyclosporine, tacrolimus or other agents to prevent
             graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow transplant are not eligible for this trial.

          -  Patients currently receiving a strong CYP3A4 inducer or inhibitor are not eligible.
             Strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided from 14 days prior to
             enrollment to the end of the study. Note: CYP3A4 inducing anti-epileptic drugs and
             dexamethasone for CNS tumors or metastases, on a stable dose, are allowed.

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other conditions that significantly limit
             enteral absorption are not eligible.

          -  Patients who are unable to swallow capsules or liquid and do not have gastric access
             via a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube are not eligible.

          -  Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible.

          -  Patients who have received prior solid organ transplantation are not eligible.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.

          -  Patients with high grade gliomas (HGG) are not eligible.

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent.

          -  All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute
             (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met.
