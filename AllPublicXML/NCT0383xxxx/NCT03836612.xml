  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the commonest types of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). Both conditions range in severity from no symptoms to being potentially fatal. Both
      conditions are treated with medications which suppress the immune system. It is not known
      whether this increases the risk for infections and cancers in these conditions. It is also
      recognised by healthcare professionals that these conditions cause a considerable amount of
      psychological distress. However, this has never been measured in a large population sample.

      This study will investigate any associations with treatment and new onset infections and
      cancer. They will also examine the relationship between IBD and common mental health problems
      (specifically, depression and anxiety) and the impact that these have on the healthcare use
      (including number of general practitioner [GP] appointments, hospital attendances, and
      medication prescriptions. Combined, these studies should provide a better understanding of
      the impact of IBD on affected people and provide evidence to support the correct allocation
      of healthcare resources.

      Objective We aim to provide an accurate and contemporary measurement of the current
      healthcare resource utilisation in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); namely
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). We also aim to provide estimates of
      infection incidence in this population and the prevalence of common mental health conditions.

      Method We will identify UC and CD using algorithms validated for accurately identifying these
      conditions from primary care records in the United Kingdom (UK). We will identify a prevalent
      cohort of adults with IBD with the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and
      Surveillance Centre (RSC) network over the last decade. We will identify a matched cohort of
      people without IBD; matched on age, gender and primary care practice. Across these cohorts we
      will compare healthcare resource utilisation (primary care attendances, number of primary
      care prescriptions for antidepressant and anxiolytic medications, number of primary care
      prescriptions for medications used in IBD, recorded secondary care attendances, and issue of
      statements of fitness for work), incident infections (any common infection, any viral
      infection, or any gastrointestinal infection), and common mental health conditions
      (depression and anxiety).

        All individuals with an existing or incident diagnosis of UC or CD during the study period
        (2013-2018), defined by the presence of at least one disease-specific diagnostic code will
        be eligible for inclusion in the IBD cohort. Controls will matched people without IBD
        matched on age, gender and primary care practice.
