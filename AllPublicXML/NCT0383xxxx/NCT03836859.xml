      This is a Phase I, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled eye drops administration
      study of rhNGF in healthy male and female subjects of Japanese Ethnicity to evaluate the
      Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Recombinant Human Nerve Growth Factor Eye Drops
      (rhNGF 20 μg/mL -formulation containing L-methionine as excipient) versus vehicle (vehicle
      control containing L-methionine as excipient) in Healthy Male and Female Volunteers of
      Japanese Ethnicity. The IMP was administered in the study Eye with the following scheme:

      Day 1: One drop instilled into study eye (35 μL, corresponding to 0.70 μg of rhNGF).

      Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: One drop six times a day (every 2h) into study eye (210 μL, corresponding
      to 4.20 μg of rhNGF).

      Total dose in the study eye will be 31 drops (1085 μL, equivalent to 21.7 μg rhNGF) over 6
      days.

      The reference product (vehicle) was administered in the study eye with the following scheme:

      Day 1: One drop instilled into study eye (35 μL, corresponding to 0 μg of rhNGF].

      Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: One drop six times a day (every 2h) into study eye (210 μL, corresponding
      to 0 μg of rhNGF).

      A total dose of placebo vehicle in the study eye will be 31 drops (1085 μL, 0 μg rhNGF) over
      6 days.

      For the Fellow (Non-Study) Eye for all subjects, the scheme was the following:

      Day 1: One drop instilled into a fellow eye (35 μL, corresponding to 0 μg of rhNGF).

      Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: One drop six times a day (every 2h) into a fellow eye (210 μL,
      corresponding to 0 μg of rhNGF).

      A total dose of placebo vehicle in the fellow eye will be 31 drops (1085 μL, 0 μg rhNGF) over
      6 days.

    <time_frame>On Day 1 (single dose scheme), Days 2,3,6 (multiple dose scheme), Day 7 (Follow-up [FU] 1), Day 8 (FU 2); Day 16 (FU 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Values of Best-Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (BCDVA) scores were measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) score. The ETDRS charts use letters, or a geometric progression in letter size from line to line, under standardized lighting conditions. The patient starts at the top of the chart, or on the last row where he or she can read all of the letters, and reads down the chart until he or she reaches a row where a minimum of three letters on a line cannot be read. The patient is scored by how many letters could be correctly identified. Therefore, the higher the number of letters the higher the visual acuity. Changes in the ETDRS score from baseline are summarised for the study eye.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT) for the Study Eye Over All Visits..</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 1 (single dose scheme), Days 2,3,6 (multiple dose scheme), Day 7 (Follow-up [FU] 1), Day 8 (FU 2); Day 16 (FU 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The TFBUT was performed after instillation of 5 μl of 2% preservative-free sodium fluorescein solution into the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye. With the aid of a slit lamp at 10X magnification using cobalt blue illumination, the examiner will monitor the integrity of the tear film, noting the time it takes to form lacunae (clear spaces in the tear film) from the time that the eye is opened after the last blink. The range of TFBUT normality in this trial is &gt; 8' to 12' in either eye at screening or baseline.
The longer the time the better the integrity of the tear film.</description>

A ocular tolerability score was determined using a 100 mm VAS on which 0 meant No symptoms and 100 meant the Worst possible discomfort. The patients subjectively evaluated their ocular symptoms (foreign body sensation, burning or stinging, itching, pain, sticky feeling, blurred vision and photophobia) using the VAS giving the value they were feeling from none to an extreme value.
The ocular symptoms were evaluated by the patients through the scale.</description>

        <description>Values of Best-Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (BCDVA) scores were measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) score. The ETDRS charts use letters, or a geometric progression in letter size from line to line, under standardized lighting conditions. The patient starts at the top of the chart, or on the last row where he or she can read all of the letters, and reads down the chart until he or she reaches a row where a minimum of three letters on a line cannot be read. The patient is scored by how many letters could be correctly identified. Therefore, the higher the number of letters the higher the visual acuity. Changes in the ETDRS score from baseline are summarised for the study eye.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT) for the Study Eye Over All Visits..</title>
        <description>The TFBUT was performed after instillation of 5 μl of 2% preservative-free sodium fluorescein solution into the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye. With the aid of a slit lamp at 10X magnification using cobalt blue illumination, the examiner will monitor the integrity of the tear film, noting the time it takes to form lacunae (clear spaces in the tear film) from the time that the eye is opened after the last blink. The range of TFBUT normality in this trial is &gt; 8' to 12' in either eye at screening or baseline.
The longer the time the better the integrity of the tear film.</description>

        <description>The course of VAS ocular tolerability score by eye over all visits was assessed. Only data &quot;Overall&quot; for study's eye are reported hereunder. A ocular tolerability score was determined using a 100 mm VAS on which 0 meant No symptoms and 100 meant the Worst possible discomfort. The patients subjectively evaluated their ocular symptoms (foreign body sensation, burning or stinging, itching, pain, sticky feeling, blurred vision and photophobia) using the VAS giving the value they were feeling from none to an extreme value.
The ocular symptoms were evaluated by the patients through the scale.</description>

        <description>Time points for rhNGF plasma levels measurement were the following:
Day 1 (Pre-Dose, 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16 hr), Day 2 (Pre-Dose, 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10.5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 hr), Day 3 (Pre-Dose, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 hr), Day 4 Pre-Dose, Day 5 Pre-Dose, Day 6 (Pre-Dose, 4, 8, 10, 10.5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 hr), FU 1 0 hr, FU 2 (0 and 8 hr), and FU 3 0 hr.
Values are reported for the single-dose regimen (Day 1) and the first day of the multiple-dose regimen (Day 2).
From Day 1, most values were below the detectable level (i.e. &lt;32 pg/ml). Values below this value are reported as not applicable (NA).</description>
