      This study evaluates the use of various assessments of common cold symptoms for proof of
      efficacy of ColdZyme Mouth Spray on naturally acquired common colds. Half of the participants
      will receive ColdZyme® Mouth Spray while the other half may use optional care as needed.

    <measure>Difference in the Jackson scale between the study groups</measure>
    <time_frame>16+/-4 days from start of common cold symptoms</time_frame>
    <description>Jackson scale - total score, local symptoms, systemic symptoms, 2-item score (sore throat &amp; malaise) as recorded in subject diary twice daily, morning and evening). The Jackson score is calculated by summing the following 8 symptom scores: sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough and sneezing (local symptoms) as well as headache, malaise, and chilliness (systemic symptoms). Symptoms are assessed on a 4-point scale: 0 = none (symptom not present), 1 = mild (sensible, but not disturbing or irritating), 2 = moderate (symptoms sometimes disturbing/irritating), 3 = severe (symptoms disturbing/ irritating most of the time).</description>

In this study, the QoL part of the WURSS-21 will be applied, from item 12 (&quot;think clearly&quot;) to item 20 (&quot;live your personal life&quot;).</description>
