  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this double-blind randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the influence of
      caries risk, occlusal stress and missing teeth on anterior restorations over a 10 years
      follow up period. 300 teeth will be randomized according to two adhesive systems: Single Bond
      2 and Single Bond Universal (3M ESPE); and two composite resins: nanoparticulated (Filtek â„¢
      Z-350- 3M ESPE) and nanohybrid (IPS Empress Direct - Ivoclar Vivadent). The randomization
      will be stratified according to the risk of caries and cavity type. The primary outcomes will
      be longevity, annual failure rate (AFR) and the success of the restorations, and the
      secondary outcome will be causes for restorations' failure.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a prospective randomized clinical trial, triple-blind, (patients, investigator and clinical evaluator) with parallel groups. After completing the ICDAS (International Caries Detection and Assessment), clinical occlusal stress examination and questionnaire application on occlusal stress, patients will be randomly divided into two types of dental adhesives and two types of composite resin. Randomization will be stratified according to the risk of caries determined by the ICDAS and the type of cavity to be filled. Operators (Master students and undergraduate students from the last year of the School of Dentistry, Federal University of Pelotas) will place the restorations supervised by highly trained clinicians.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Survival of the restorations</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in the dental restorations status compared to baseline will be assessed yearly up to 10 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Survival of the restoration is defined as any case where the restoration remains functional in the mouth at the time of evaluation, regardless of need of small interventions, such as repair or refurbishment. The restorations were evaluated shortly after baseline and in prospective periods through a direct clinical inspection, with an explorer probe and a clinical mirror, according to the criteria for clinical evaluation of restorations proposed by the FDI (International Dental Federation) (Hickel et al., 2010), the risks of caries and occlusal stress were also evaluated again.
Two trained and calibrated evaluators, unrelated to making the restorations, blinded to the type of material used, independently performed the clinical evaluations.</description>
