  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has recently been described the presence of a urinary inflammatory signature in patients
      with cystinuria, the most common cause of renal lithiasis of genetical origin. These data are
      very innovative in this pathology but deserve further studies to establish the specificity of
      this inflammatory signature in patients with cystinuria compared to other nephropathies and
      other renal lithiasis diseases. Moreover, the effect of the usual treatment of cystinuria
      (namely urine alkalanization) on urinary inflammatory biomarkers deserves to be tested.

      The objectives of the present study are: i) To study the urinary inflammatory profile by mass
      spectrometry (a very efficient tool to detect and identify proteins) in patients with
      cystinuria and in patients with lithiasis of other origin and in patients with inflammatory
      renal disease ; ii) To study the potential effect of urine alkalinazation with potassium
      citrate (usual treatment according to European recommendations) on the inflammatory signature
      of patients with cystinuria. To this aim, urine of non treated cystinuric patients will be
      collected before treatement initiation and 3 months after the start of the alkalizing
      treatment.

    <measure>Change from baseline urine inflammatory profile after 3 months of alkalizing treatment using mass spectrometry in patients with cystinuria.</measure>
    <time_frame>at inclusion and after three months of the usual alkalizing treatment for the patients with cystinuria</time_frame>
    <description>Study of urine inflammatory biomarkers profile using mass spectrometry to determine if the alkalizing treatment is susceptible to modify the urine inflammatory profile. Proteases inhibitors will be added to the urine sample immediately after urination. Urine will then be frozen at -80°C until mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry will determine the differential expression of all the proteins present the urine sample. For the purpose of the present study, the investigators will focus on the expression of inflammatory biomarkers among them MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase), Myeloperoxydase, Proteinase 3, Neutrophil Elastase, Cathepsine G, LSP1 (lymphocyte specific protein), Fibrinogen beta and gamma chains. The aim of mass spectrometry is to detect the presence of proteins in the urine sample and to assess the differential levels of expression of the detected proteins but not to precisely measure the urine concentration of the detected proteins.</description>

    <description>Study of urine inflammatory biomarkers with mass spectrometry in control groups to determine if the urine inflammatory profile is specific to cystinuria. Proteases inhibitors will be added to the urine sample immediately after urination. Urine will then be frozen at -80°C until analysis. Mass spectrometry will determine the differential expression of all the proteins present the urine sample. For the purpose of the present study, the investigators will focus on the expression of inflammatory biomarkers. The aim of mass spectrometry is to detect the presence of proteins in the urine sample and to assess the differential levels of expression of the detected proteins but not to precisely measure the urine concentration of these proteins. Moreover, urine analysis by mass spectrometry will detect all urinary proteins and the investgators do exclude to find unexpected proteins. For those reasons, urine analysis by mass spectrometry is a unique outcome.</description>

    <description>10 patients with cystinuria. Experimental. Urine collected before treatment initiation and 3 months after. Treatment: Usual alkalizing treatment using oral potassium citrate. The initial dosage will be 4 g/day divided into 3 to 4 oral daily doses. If the objective of urinary pH is not reached after the first two weeks of treatment, the dose will be increased by 2 grams (6 grams total). If the urinary pH remains below 7.5 after 2 weeks with 6 grams of potassium citrate per day, the alkalizing treatment will then be supplemented with oral sodium bicarbonate in the form of Vichy water or officinal preparation. This treatment is the usual treatment recommended for cystinuria .</description>
