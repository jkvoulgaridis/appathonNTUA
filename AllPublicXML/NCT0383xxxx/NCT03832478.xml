  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the use of virtual reality guided mindfulness meditation to
      reduce the pre and post-operative anxiety and pain of pediatric surgical patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-procedural anxiety in pediatric patients has been previously shown to increase the
      likelihood of family stressors, agitation, sleep disturbances, and negative behavioral
      changes. Post-procedural pain has been shown to negatively impact future interactions with
      healthcare personnel. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using
      guided mindfulness meditation through a non-invasive device (virtual reality headset) to
      manage pre-procedure anxiety and post-procedure anxiety and pain.
