        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (inclusive)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with Good clinical practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate
             (PR), or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) deviating from normal and assessed as clinically
             relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological, or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial
             medication or its excipients)

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days of planned administration of trial medication that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (including drugs that cause QT/QTc
             interval prolongation)

          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another clinical trial within 60 days of planned
             administration of investigational drug in the current trial, or concurrent
             participation in another clinical trial in which investigational drug is administered

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g per day)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days of planned administration of trial
             medication or intended blood donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to the
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with the dietary regimen of the trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             greater than 450 ms, if confirmed by a second Electrocardiogram (ECG) recording) or
             any other relevant Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study
