  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disparities between African-American and European-American youth regarding academic outcomes,
      mental health, and physical health exist. Depression, a very common mental health problem,
      plays a central role by impacting academic outcomes and cardiovascular health. Thus, a
      program that successfully reduces the likelihood for youths to develop depression should also
      reduce problems with academic outcomes and physical health and therefore reduce disparity in
      all three domains. Research demonstrates that European-American youth benefit more from
      programs preventing the development of depression than their African-American peers. Thus,
      the goals of this project are to (a) identify mechanisms that may result in differential
      program effectiveness across racial groups, and (b) adapt such a program (TIM&amp;SARA) so youth
      from diverse racial backgrounds benefit similarly. Freshmen in an urban high-school will
      participate in TIM&amp;SARA, fill out surveys and give biological data in saliva.

    <textblock>
      Already in adolescence, substantial disparities between African-Americans and
      European-Americans regarding academic outcomes, mental health, and physical health like
      cardiovascular health exist. While these domains are often treated as unrelated, they
      influence each other in a way that the disparity in one variable increases the likelihood for
      disparity in the others. Depression, a very common mental health problem, plays a central
      role by impacting academic outcomes and cardiovascular health. Thus, a program that
      successfully reduces the likelihood for youths to develop depression should also reduce
      problems with academic outcomes and physical health and therefore reduce disparity in all
      three domains. Unfortunately, research demonstrates that European-American youth benefit more
      from programs preventing the development of depression than their African-American peers.
      Thus, the main goals of this research project are to (a) identify mechanisms that may result
      in differential prevention program effectiveness across youth race groups, and (b) adapt such
      a program (TIM&amp;SARA) so youth from diverse racial backgrounds benefit similarly.

      In this project, the depression prevention program TIM&amp;SARA will be implemented as part of
      the normal school curriculum for freshmen in an urban high-school. The differential effects
      of the program on African-American and European-American youths will be examined using
      surveys and biological data in saliva.

    <description>The CES-D is a 20-item self-report instrument which has been repeatedly used in adolescent samples (e.g., Roberts et al., 1990) will be used. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = rarely or none of the time; 3 = most of the time; e.g., &quot;I was bothered by things that usually don't bother me.&quot;). The scale ranges from 0-60; total scores of 16 or higher indicate clinically significant depressive symptoms. The internal consistency of the CES-D in previous studies with adolescents is good (α = .92, Winkeljohn Black, &amp; Pössel, 2015).</description>

    <description>TIM&amp;SARA has a duration of 16 fifty-minute sessions and is organized in five modules. The first module (2 sessions) outlines the rationale for the program and establishes connections between group leaders and adolescents. The next module (2 sessions) focuses on helping adolescents to consider already existing goals, set new ones, and learn how to achieve goals to build up the motivation of the youth to learn and apply the material of the following modules. The third module (6 sessions) focuses on understanding the relations among cognitions, emotions, and behaviors, and teaching the participating youths how to identify and challenge negative cognitions. The forth module (5 sessions) trains the youth in assertive and social competent social behavior. Finally, the last session is a review session and includes a celebration. All parts of the program use illustrative, culturally relevant situations introduced by the participating adolescents.</description>
