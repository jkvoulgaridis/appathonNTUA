    <textblock>
      VIABILITY study aims to investigate the link between systemic inflammation, pancoronary
      plaque vulnerability (referring to the plaque vulnerability within the entire coronary tree),
      myocardial viability and ventricular remodeling in patients who had suffered a recent
      ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). The level of systemic inflammation
      in the acute phase of the myocardial infarction and at 1 month will be assessed on the basis
      of serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP, matrix metalloproteinases, interleukin-6).
      Pancoronary plaque vulnerability will be assessed: (1) in the acute phase of the infarction,
      based on serum biomarkers known to be associated with increased plaque vulnerability, such as
      adhesion molecules (V-CAM or I-CAM) determined from the blood samples collected in the first
      day after STEMI; (2) at 1 month after infarction, based on computed tomographic angiography
      analysis of vulnerability features present in all coronary plaques. Myocardial viability and
      remodeling will be assessed based on: (1) 3D speckle tracking echocardiography associated
      with dobutamine infusion; (2) MRI imaging associated with complex post-processing techniques
      for mapping myocardial fibrosis and scar at the level of left atrium and left ventricle. At
      the same time, CT imaging features associated with systemic and local inflammation, such as
      global epicardial fat or local pericoronary epicardial fat will be quantified in order to
      investigate the impact of inflammatory-mediated plaque vulnerability on the extent of
      myocardial damage in acute myocardial infarction. All these parameters will be investigated
      in patients with successful primary revascularization performed in a timely manner for
      ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, who will be divided into 2 groups: group 1
      - patients who present persistence of an augmented inflammatory status defined as serum
      levels of hsCRP&gt;3.0 mg/dl at discharge from the hospital or at 7 days postinfarction
      (whichever comes first), and group 2 - patients with no persistence of augmented inflammatory
      status (hsCRP&lt;3.0 mg/dl).

      The primary endpoint of the study will be represented by the rate of post-infarction heart
      failure development, defined as the rate of re-admission in the hospital for heart failure or
      by a significant decrease in the ejection fraction (&lt;45%).

      The secondary endpoints of the study will be:

        -  rate of re-hospitalization

        -  rate of repeated revascularization

        -  rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE rate, including cardiovascular death
           or stroke)

      Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who survive the acute event, very often
      present a significant deterioration of their clinical status with progression towards heart
      failure, which is directly linked to the extent of myocardial injury and the remodeling
      process starting immediately after infarction. The major aim of the urgent revascularization
      in STEMI is to save myocardial tissue from death and necrosis, in order to recover viable
      myocardium. It is well-known that one of the major factors that trigger an AMI is the
      systemic inflammation, which has a direct influence on coronary plaque vulnerability. At the
      same time, 20% of patients surviving an AMI present a recurrent cardiovascular event in the
      following 12 months, as a result of increased systemic inflammation triggered by the
      infarction, which leads to vulnerabilization of other atheromatous plaques from all the
      circulatory system in the post-infarction period. While the role of inflammation in acute
      coronary events is well established, the impact of inflammatory-mediated vulnerability of
      coronary plaques from the entire coronary tree on the extension of ventricular remodeling and
      scaring has not been elucidated so far.

      This is a clinical prospective, descriptive, single-center study which will be carried out in
      the University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology Tîrgu Mures, Romania, in
      collaboration with two clinical sites: Center of Advanced Research in Multimodal Cardiac
      Imaging Cardio Med Tîrgu Mures, Romania and County Clinical Emergency Hospital Tîrgu Mures,
      Romania. The duration of the study is 2 years which includes the initial screening and the
      follow-up period.

      The study will enroll 100 subjects with STEMI who underwent successful revascularization of
      the culprit lesion in the first 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. Imaging biomarkers and
      laboratory analyses such as: high sensitive C Reactive Protein (hsCRP), matrix
      metalloproteinases (MMP), interleukin-6 (IL6) and N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide
      (NT pro-BNP) will be determined in the first 24 hours after the index hospitalization. At 1
      month postinfarction all patients will undergo Dobutamine stress test associated with speckle
      tracking echocardiography for evaluation of myocardial function and viability, CMR for
      assessment of myocardial scar, function and remodeling, and Multislice Angio CT for
      assessment of pancoronary vulnerability, by complex characterization of vulnerability
      features in all the coronary plaques present in the coronary tree. All these parameters will
      be investigated in patients with successful primary percutaneous coronary revascularization,
      who will be divided into 2 groups: group 1 -patients with persistent elevation of systemic
      inflammatory biomarkers at discharge from the hospital or at day 7 (whichever comes first)
      (inflammation+ group); and group 2 - patients with no persistent elevation of systemic
      inflammatory biomarkers at discharge from the hospital or at day 7 (whichever comes first)
      (inflammation- group). In all patients, the following biomarkers will be determined: serum
      levels of inflammatory biomarkers, adhesion molecules and NT-proBNP at 24 hours and 7 days
      post procedure, the amount of myocardial fibrosis and scar in the left ventricle at 1 month,
      the degree of ventricular remodeling and myocardial perfusion at 1 month and the amount of
      epicardial fat surrounding the heart and the plaques. The study will be conducted over a
      period of 2 years, in which patients will be examined at baseline, and will be followed-up
      for MACE incidence.

      All patients will sign an informed written consent and will be checked for the exclusion
      criteria prior to enrollment.
