    <textblock>
      This trial studies how an imaging agent, hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate, works in
      diagnosing glioma in patients with brain tumors. Giving hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate
      before an advanced imaging technique called a magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI)
      scan may help researchers better diagnose glioma in patients with brain tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish a clinical infrastructure for performing hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate
      (hyperpolarized 13-C-pyruvate) imaging in the human brain at MD Anderson.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the correlation between conversion rate of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate
      (kpl) values and Ki-67 quantitation in the tumor.

      II. To compare kpl values between tumor and normal brain within patient. III. To assess the
      association between kpl values and pathology results, including conventional, diffusion,
      perfusion, and permeability imaging.

      IV. To assess the association between kpl values and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
      findings.

      V. To assess the association between kpl values and genomic findings, including methylation,
      ribonucleic acid [RNA], and deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) over 10-20 seconds
      and then undergo an MRSI scan.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 1 day.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent will be obtained from each participants including healthy
             volunteers.

          -  Healthy volunteers will not have contra-indications to MR scanning, but will otherwise
             not be subject to other selection criteria.

          -  All patients will be enrolled in study # 2011-0370, the Stereotactic RadPath trial

          -  Patient is &gt;18 years old, agrees to participate in the clinical study and to complete
             all required visits and evaluations. The pediatric population has a different disease
             profile from the glioma patients we hope to recruit. To reduce heterogeneity in the
             patient population we will not consider patients younger than 18 for this study.

          -  Patient is a candidate for cerebral tumor resection with lesion suspected to be or
             previously biopsy proven to be a primary brain tumor.

          -  Patient is able to understand and give consent to participation in the study.

          -  Patient agrees to undergo, prior to the procedure, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI,
             within 14 days and preferably with 3 days of the planned procedure) with perfusion,
             diffusion and spectroscopic imaging.

          -  Patient has a GFR &gt; 60. In patients with moderate renal failure (GFR 30-60), an
             alternate injection with 2 times half-dose multihance (gadobenate dimeglumine) or
             gadovist (gadobutrol) will be considered, if a contrast exam is deemed clinically
             necessary.

          -  Specifically for this Study: Patient is willing to give signed informed consent for
             C13-Pyruvate MR Spectroscopy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers will be screened using same process but will otherwise not be
             subject to other selection criteria.

          -  The patient is found to have unfavorable anatomy to indicate that stereotactic biopsy
             could not be safely performed.

          -  Pacemakers, electronic stimulation, metallic foreign bodies and devices and/or other
             conditions that are not MR safe, which include but are not limited to: •
             electronically, magnetically, and mechanically activated implants • ferromagnetic or
             electronically operated active devices like automatic cardioverter defibrillators and
             cardiac pacemakers • metallic splinters in the eye • ferromagnetic hemostatic clips in
             the central nervous system (CNS) or body • cochlear implants • other pacemakers, e.g.,
             for the carotid sinus • insulin pumps and nerve stimulators • non-MR safe lead wires •
             prosthetic heart valves (if dehiscence is suspected) • non-ferromagnetic stapedial
             implants • pregnancy • claustrophobia that does not readily respond to oral medication

          -  Prior brain tumor treatment, including surgical resection, radiation therapy or
             chemotherapy for a primary brain neoplasm. Previous biopsy will not disqualify the
             patient from participation. Remote history (&gt; 6month) of non-CNS malignancy in
             remission, without evidence of current/ prior brain metastasis, will also not
             disqualify patient from participating.
