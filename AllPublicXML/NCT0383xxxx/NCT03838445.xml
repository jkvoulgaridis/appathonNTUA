  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the RELIEVE-PAH study are to obtain first-in-human experience with the
      study device in patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, including evidence of
      initial safety, device performance and possible signals of clinical effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-national, multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, open label trial of
      patients implanted with the study device. A total of 20 patients will be implanted with the
      study device and followed at regular intervals for 1 year and then annually for a total of 5
      years post implant.

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Group 1 PAH (idiopathic, connective tissue disease, HIV, corrected congenital heart
             disease).

          2. World Health Organization Functional Class III or IV symptoms or history of syncope.

          3. Receiving maximal available and tolerable pharmacological PAH therapy at stable dose
             for â‰¥4 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Resting oxygen saturation &lt;90 % without supplemental oxygen corrected for altitude.

          2. Mean Right Atrial Pressure &gt;20 mmHg.

          3. Severe restrictive or obstructive lung disease.

          4. Evidence of organ dysfunction other than right heart failure.

          5. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40 %.

          6. Anatomical anomaly on transesophageal echocardiography or intracardiac
             echocardiography that precludes implantation of Shunt across fossa ovalis (FO) of the
             interatrial septum.

          7. Inadequate vascular access for implantation of shunt, e.g. femoral venous access for
             transseptal catheterization and inferior vena cava (IVC) is not patent.

          8. Hemodynamic heart rhythm, or respiratory instability at time of Final Exclusion
             Criteria.
