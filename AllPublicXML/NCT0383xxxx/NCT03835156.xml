  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre prospective observational study that will investigate a new EEG based
      index in recognizing recall of anesthesia in sedated patients.

      Awareness under general anesthesia is a dreadful complication. Various EEG-based technologies
      (such as BIS and others) were developed in order to identify this condition during
      anesthesia, using an EEG sticker on the forehead measuring the frontal EEG activity. However,
      these monitors might be inaccurate due to lack of sensitivity to various hypnotic agents as
      well as sensitivity to muscle activity, which might lead to report of deep anesthesia in the
      awake patient. Due to the very low prevalence of awareness under general anesthesia it is
      difficult to validate or invalidate the effectiveness of these monitors directly.
      Nevertheless, sedation often involves much greater prevalence of awareness, which permits to
      evaluate identification of recalled awareness with much humbler sample size.

      The current available depth of anesthesia EEG based monitors are not effective in sedated
      patients since they are susceptible to muscle activity effect, which is present under
      sedation.

      Based on the current literature in the field of electrophysiology the investigators have
      developed the anterior/ posterior (A/P) index (in the range of 0-100) for appreciating the
      anesthetic level. It is based on a comparison of anterior brain activity levels to posterior
      brain activity levels in response to anesthetic medication. The novelty of the index is stem
      from the fact that it is based on analyzing EEG data from only 4 electrodes covering the
      frontal and posterior brain activity. The investigators have shown in a proof of concept
      study performed in Rambam Hospital, Haifa, Israel that this index is not dependent on muscle
      activity thus is the only index that can identify recall in sedated patients.

    <description>In this new following study, the investigators suggest to repeat the proof of concept study performed in Rambam Hospital, Israel (NIH trial registration: NCT02938325), with an FDA approved EEG system, with much better signal-to-noise ratio in order to demonstrate the ability to monitor awareness at the 30-seconds resolution scale.
The objective of this study will be to demonstrate that the A/P index, which is generated with an FDA approved EEG system, would relate to recall of awareness in sedation, with a better signal to noise ratio whereas a prefrontal based electrophysiological method (BIS) would not relate to recall.</description>

        All participants will receive detailed oral and printed information about the study and
        will sign a written informed consent form prior to study enrollment. Enrollment in the
        study is entirely voluntary, and declining to participate will in no way affect the quality
