    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy given with
      or without paclitaxel and carboplatin work in treating human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV)-positive women with cervical cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells. They may either kill the cancer cells by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy to the pelvis
      destroys potential cancer cells in the pelvic area and significantly reduces the risk of
      tumor recurrence in the pelvic area. It is not yet known if giving chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin afterward may work better than than just chemotherapy
      and radiation therapy in treating HIV-positive patients with advanced cervical cancer.

      STANDARD CARE: All participants receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Patients also undergo radiation therapy over 2-5 fractions for
      5 days a week, for up to 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Four (4) to 8 weeks after finishing standard chemotherapy and radiation,
      participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      RANDOMIZED ARMS:

      Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Participants are followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months for
      recurrence or progression.

      Arm II: Participants undergo active monitoring at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months for
      recurrence or progression.

        This trial will be conducted at selected AIDS Malignancy Consortium sites in Sub-Saharan
        Africa.

        Eligibility Criteria for Screening

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to provide informed consent.

          -  Participant has clinically diagnosed LACC and self-reports as HIV-positive

          -  Age ≥ 18 years. DOB and age will be determined based on best possible information or
             documentation available.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 50%, see Appendix III).

        Inclusion Criteria for chemoradiation treatment enrollment:

          -  Participants with locally advanced primary, untreated, histologically-confirmed,
             documented invasive squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous
             carcinoma of the uterine cervix, adequately clinically staged by standard clinical
             guidelines, with Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages IIB, III, or
             IVA

          -  HIV positive. Documentation of HIV-1 infection by means of any one of the following:

               -  Documentation of receipt of ART by a licensed health care provider (documentation
                  may be a record of an ART prescription in the participant's medical record, a
                  written prescription in the name of the participant for ART, or pill bottles for
                  ART with a label showing the participant's name)

               -  HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) detection by a licensed HIV-1 RNA assay
                  demonstrating &gt;1000 RNA copies/mL confirmed by a licensed screening antibody
                  and/or HIV antibody antigen combination assay

               -  Any licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay
                  confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay such as a HIV-1 Western blot
                  confirmation or HIV rapid multispot antibody differentiation assay.

                    -  Note: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a kit that has been certified or
                       licensed by an oversight body within the participating country and validated
                       internally. WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease
                       Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial
                       test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the
                       initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by
                       either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different
                       antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus
                       competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 10 g/dL (6.2 mmol/L) (participants receiving transfusion are permitted)
             (within 4 weeks prior to enrollment)

          -  Leukocytes: &gt;= 3,000/mm^3 (3.0 x 10^9/L) (within 4 weeks prior to enrollment)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count: &gt;= 1,500/mm^3 (1.5 x 10^9/L) (within 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment)

          -  Platelets: &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 (100 x 10^9/L) (within 4 weeks prior to enrollment)

          -  CD4 T-cell count a minimum of 200 cells/uL (within 4 weeks prior to enrollment)

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) unless related to
             antiretroviral use (e.g., atazanavir or indinavir), then the direct bilirubin must be
             =&lt; 2 x ULN (within 4 weeks prior to enrollment)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]):
             =&lt; 3 x ULN (within 4 weeks prior to enrollment)

          -  Creatinine levels within normal institutional limits or, creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 (1.00 mL/s) calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation for women for
             participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal (within 4 weeks prior
             to enrollment)

          -  All participants must be prescribed combination antiretroviral therapy with the goal
             of virological suppression using an acceptable regimen that adheres to national
             guidelines for treatment of HIV infection. If on a ritonavir- or cobicistat-based
             regimen, the participant must be switched to a non-ritonavir/ cobicistat-based regimen
             at least 7 days before treatment enrollment. Participants not on ART must start an
             acceptable regimen at least 7 days before treatment enrollment.

          -  In the investigator's opinion the participant is suitable for treatment with radical
             intent using concurrent chemotherapy and pelvic radiation followed by adjuvant
             chemotherapy

          -  Participants of childbearing potential, defined as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has
             not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally

             required follow-up. For instance, if travel to and from treatment site is an issue

          -  Participants with carcinoma of the cervical stump

          -  Participants with history of cardiovascular disease manifested as:

               -  History of myocardial infarction

               -  Unstable angina

               -  Currently taking medication for treatment of angina

             biological composition to study drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel)

          -  Participants who are breastfeeding a child. Cisplatin is known to be excreted in human
             milk.

        Eligibility for Randomization

          -  Participants must have organ and marrow function within the following parameters
             within 4-8 weeks post CDDP/RT to be eligible for randomization

          -  Absolute neutrophil count: ≥1,500/mm3 (1.5 x 109/L)

          -  Platelets: ≥ 100,000/mm3 (100 x 109/L)
