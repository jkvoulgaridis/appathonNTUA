  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm study to evaluate the cryopreserved formulation of OTL-103
      Gene Therapy. OTL-103 consists of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells in which the gene
      encoding for the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome is introduced by means of a third generation
      lentiviral vector.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: up to 65 years

          -  Diagnosis of WAS defined by genetic mutation and at least one of the following
             criteria:

               -  Severe Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) gene mutation, defined by literature data
                  (genotype/phenotype studies).;

               -  Absent WASP expression, assessed by flow cytometry;

               -  Severe clinical score (Zhu clinical score â‰¥ 3);

               -  Family member affected by WAS with life-threatening or fatal clinical events.

          -  No human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical related donor available for hematopoietic
             stem cells transplant (HSCT).

          -  Parental/guardian/subject-signed informed consent, and subject assent (if
             appropriate).

          -  For all subjects in the reproductive age range, agreement to use highly effective and
             adequate method of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  End-organ dysfunction, severe active infection not responsive to treatment or other
             severe disease or clinical condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would
             make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Malignant neoplasia (except local skin cancer) or a documented history of hereditary
             cancer syndrome.

          -  Myelodysplasia, cytogenetic alterations characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome and
             acute myeloid leukaemia , or other serious haematological disorders

          -  Documented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with evidence of residual
             cells of donor origin

          -  Previous Gene Therapy
