  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric and oesophageal (OG) cancer associated with poor long term outcome as overall less
      than 25% of patients survive for more than 5 years due to late recognition of the disease.
      Growing evidence suggests an important role for bacteria in OG cancer and gastro esophageal
      reflux disease (GORD) development. About 1 in 10 people suffer from GORD and this one of the
      most common conditions leading to gastric and oesophageal cancer.

      In GORD surgical therapy is the most successful preventing cancer but around 85% of patient
      experience complications afterwards. Acid suppressing medications are reducing the risk of
      oesophageal cancer but equally increasing the risk of gastric cancer. They also shorten
      patients' life expectancy and often fail to provide relief. Analysis of stool samples of
      patients with GORD demonstrated different gut bacterial compositions to normal and rather
      resembled the one found in cancer.

      There is a clear need to improve the outcome of OG cancer. This could be achieved by
      identifying bacteria responsible for cancer development in gastric tissue, gastric content
      and saliva and potentially eliminate them hence avoid the development of cancer.
