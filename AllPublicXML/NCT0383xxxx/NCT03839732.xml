      BACKGROUND In the context of a progressively aging population, monitoring the status of
      Vascular Calcifications (VC) and Vertebral Fractures (VF) over time would be of primary
      importance, as VC and VF are recognized to be hallmarks of severe cardiovascular events
      (hospitalization and/or death) and hip fractures respectively, and VF represent an
      under-diagnosed cause of progressive disability and pain on its own. Moreover, there is an
      acknowledged relationships between VC and VF.

      However, data about the emergence/progression of VC and the emergence/worsening of VF over
      time are lacking. This is likely due to the absence of monitoring instruments for VC and VF
      that are both precise and easily accessible/applicable.

      OBJECTIVE This study aims to define the observer variability of a new software developed by
      the study sponsor and collaborators, called Calcify2D. Calcify2D offers physicians a
      computer-assisted procedure to simultaneously score vascular calcifications at the abdominal
      aorta and lumbar vertebral fractures (according to Quantitative Vertebral Morphometry
      principles) based on a latero-lateral thoracolumbar spine radiography. Secondary aims are the
      validation of the scores obtained from latero-lateral thoracolumbar spine radiography with
      more invasive and/or costly gold-standard imaging modalities (Computed Tomography for VC,
      Magnetic Resonance for VF) that may have been acquired near-simultaneously to radiographs on
      the patients enrolled for the study.

      STUDY DESIGN Not-for-profit monocentric observational study to be conducted on the diagnostic
      images of the thoracolumbar spine already collected at Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli (IOR)
      within a previous interventional study.

      Scoring of VC and VF will be performed by four clinicians from four relevant specialties,
      chosen among those who may often see VC and VF and are already familiar with the traditional
      scoring systems for both VC and VF (one radiologist and one spine orthopaedics from IOR, one
      nephrologist from the National Research Council and one internist from University of Padua).

      Each clinician will assess all radiographs to score VC and QVM, both via computer assisted
      procedures and via traditional visual inspection. To avoid bias, an interval of at least one
      week will be left between the computer assisted and visual scoring. To define intra-observer
      variability (i.e. repeatability), the whole dataset will be re-assessed three times.

        All patients that were included in a previous interventional trial of the sponsor
        institution aimed to compare the effectiveness of vertebroplastic and kyphoplastic
        augmentations of the throracolumbar spine. The choice of this population was driven by
        previous reports on similar populations stating a high prevalence of vascular
        calcifications.

             projection).

          -  Rx images will be screened for the presence of VC, retaining only those showing VC.

             alter the grayscale range and hinder correct identification of VC and vertebral
             fractures
