  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic and pervasive disorder
      characterised by problems in attention, impulse control and activity regulation that
      substantially burdens patients, families, and society. The efficacy of behavioural training
      for parents of children with ADHD symptoms is well established, however it is less clear
      which type of parenting intervention should be offered, and which aspects of parenting
      behaviour to focus on. It is not established whether an intervention designed specifically
      for families of children with a diagnosis will be more effective and cost effective than less
      specifically-targeted interventions. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      feasibility and likely size of a substantive randomised controlled trial comparing an AHDH
      specific parenting intervention to a diagnostically less-specific parenting intervention.

      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic and pervasive disorder
      characterised by problems in attention, impulse control and activity regulation that
      substantially burdens patients, families, and society. ADHD is often associated with
      challenging behaviours that can induce negativity, even in parents who would otherwise cope
      well.The efficacy of behavioural training for parents of children with ADHD symptoms is well
      established, however it is less clear which type of parenting intervention should be offered,
      and which aspects of parenting behaviour to focus on. It is not established whether an
      intervention designed specifically for families of children with a diagnosis will be more
      effective and cost effective than less specifically-targeted interventions.

      Parents In Control (Parents InC) offers specific support around empowerment, information and
      behaviour management specific to ADHD, as well as understanding of the child's development
      context. Parents InC has been used for a number of years in Scotland and has been evaluated,
      with promising results, but with relatively small sample sizes, no long-term follow-up, no
      economic evaluation and, most crucially, no comparison to an alternative intervention or to a
      control group. The investigators now need to understand if it: i) is at least as effective as
      the current best-evidenced alternative, Incredible Years, in impacting children's behaviour
      outcomes; ii) is cost-effective; and iii) offers something helpful and unique compared to
      other parenting programmes in terms of parenting self-competence and quality of life.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and likely size of a substantive
      randomised controlled trial comparing an ADHD specific parenting intervention to a
      diagnostically less-specific parenting intervention (Incredible Years). Specific objectives
      are to test (1) whether parents of children recently diagnosed with ADHD are willing to be
      randomised to Parents InC or IY; (2) whether sufficient numbers of families can be (a)
      recruited and (b) retained such that a full-scale RCT is likely to be feasible; (3) whether
      research procedures and efficacy measures are feasible and acceptable to participating
      families (including health economic measures and consent to link to routine datasets); (4)
      whether families participating in Parents InC achieve similar scores on the parenting sense
      of competence scale at 12 months post randomisation as those in the comparison arm
      (Incredible Years); (5) Whether the two intervention arms significantly differ on any other
      measures; and (6) the mean cost per participant of Parents InC.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12-months post-randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>17-items measure of parenting self-esteem questionnaire with 2 sub scales. Each item is rated on a 6 point Likert scale anchored by 1= &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 6= &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. A higher score indicates a higher parenting sense of competency. There are no average scores or 'cut-off's' for this tool.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Daily Hassles Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post Baseline (if applicable), 12-month post-randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>18-items self-report measure of the frequency and intensity of 20 potential parenting 'hassles' to indicate parents stress. The items are rated on a frequency and intensity scale. The frequency scale is scored rarely =1, sometimes= 2, a lot= 3, and constantly = 4. The intensity scale is scored by adding the parents rating of 1-5 for each item. If a 0 has been scored for frequency on an item then it should be scored 0 for intensity. The range for this scale is 0 -100. This measure will be re-collected if there is &gt; 3 months wait period between baseline data collection and the start date of the parenting groups. This will allow the investigators to detect any baseline measure changes over the wait period.</description>

    <measure>Goal Based Outcomes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post Baseline (if applicable), 12-month post-randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>Taken from the Child Outcomes Research Consortium to identify goals and assess progression. Progress toward individual goal is rated on a scale from 0 (no progress) to 10 (goal has been reached). This measure will be re-collected if there is &gt; 3 months wait period between baseline data collection and the start date of the parenting groups. This will allow the investigators to detect any baseline measure changes over the wait period.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post Baseline (if applicable), 12-month post-randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of parent quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L is a descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, some problems, moderate problems, extreme problems. Parents will be also be asked to rate their health on a visual analogue scale. This measure will be re-collected if there is &gt; 3 months wait period between baseline data collection and the start date of the parenting groups. This will allow the investigators to detect any baseline measure changes over the wait period.</description>

    <measure>Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12-month post-randomisation</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post Baseline (if applicable), 12-month post-randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>25-items questionnaire which assesses child's emotional and behavioural problems. Each item is scored 0, 1 or 2. Somewhat true is always scored 1, but whether Not true and Certainly true are scored 0 or 2 depends on whether the item is framed as a strength or difficulty. This measure will be re-collected if there is &gt; 3 months wait period between baseline data collection and the start date of the parenting groups. This will allow the investigators to detect any baseline measure changes over the wait period.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        • Parents of children aged 5-12 with a formal diagnosis of ADHD, following a standardised
        assessment from a paediatrician or a psychiatrist, referred to the Fife integrated ADHD
        pathway during the one year recruitment period will be eligible for inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Families attending other parenting groups

          -  Parents who have low proficiency in English (as this will compromise their ability to

          -  Participants already taking part in research on a parenting intervention will also be
             ineligible to participate.
