  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excess salt intake is a major contributor to high blood pressure, the leading individual risk
      factor for cardiovascular events, such as stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure.
      According to PHYSA study, salt intake in Portugal remains much higher (10.7 g) than
      recommended by the international health organisations, indicating the need for effective
      implementation of salt reduction interventions. In Portugal the main source of daily salt
      intake is added salt during cooking, and salt content in bread, cheese and processed meat.

      The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a dietary education program
      tailored for salt reduction. To assess the effectiveness of the salt reduction program the
      investigator's will measure changes in salt consumption levels, by evaluating the 24 h
      urinary sodium excretion.

      This study is a consortium-initiated, randomised, simple-blinded, controlled trial designed
      to assess the effectiveness of a salt reduction program versus generic healthy lifestyle
      program in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area.
