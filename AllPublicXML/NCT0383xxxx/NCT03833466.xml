    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II trial investigating the effect of metformin in combined with
      cisplatin plus paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy with advanced esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective phase II study, eligible patients are received cisplatin plus paclitaxel
      for 2-4 cycles combined with metformin orally. The investigators aim to compare the tumor
      metabolic pathway and tumor microenvironment of pre-chemotherapy endoscopic biopsy samples
      and post-chemotherapy surgical resection samples.
