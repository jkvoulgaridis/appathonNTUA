      Department (AED) during the permanence of care the week of March 11 to 17, 2018. The data
      collection would concern socio-demographic data, their consultation to the AED, the follow-up

      hours of the consultation.

      Study of the observance of emergency exit treatments during the permanence of care. This is a
      descriptive study with a prospective data collection that does not alter the management of
      the patient. The study is epidemiological, cross-sectional, prospective inclusion.

      The investigators would like to include patients consulting in a AED during the permanence of
      care the week of March 11 to 17, 2018. The data collection would concern socio-demographic
      data, their consultation to the AED, the follow-up given to the consultation and would take
      place by telephone contact of patients within 48 hours of the consultation.

      The objective is to study the follow-up given by the consultation to the emergencies, in
      terms of compliance, follow-up of the recommendations, the objective sought by the patient
      coming to the emergency department.

      Understand the motivation of the consultation and why the treatment was not followed where
      appropriate.

      Is there a sociodemographic explanation or is it the health network that results in the
      saturation of emergency services? Does the system still meet the expectations of people using
      it?
