      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Apatinib Mesylate combined
      with PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 in HCC patients with high risk of disease recurrence contained
      microsatellite lesions, microvascular invasion(MVI) or secondary and above portal vein tumor
      thrombosis (PVTT) after radical resection. Patients will be randomized 1:1 either to the
      experimental arm to receive Apatinib Mesylate and PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 or to the standard
      therapy arm of hepatic arterial infusion(HAI) .

    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide, which is the third cause of
      cancer related deaths. Radical hepatic resection is one of the most potentially curative
      treatments for HCC. Unfortunately, the long-term survival after radical hepatic resection is
      unsatisfactory because of the high incidence of tumor recurrence with the recurrence rates at
      2 and 5 years are approximately 50 % to 60 % and 80 %,respectively. Microsatellite lesions,
      microvascular invasion (MVI) , or portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) are the main risk
      factors for poor prognosis in HCC.

      HCC is a typical vascular-rich tumor, and its occurrence, development, metastasis and
      invasion are closely related to angiogenesis. Due to the long-term chronic inflammatory
      response of the liver, the establishment and development of HCC can be induced by creating an
      immunosuppressive microenvironment, including up-regulation of PD-1 receptors. Therefore,
      immunotherapy is also considered to be a potential effective method for advanced HCC
      treatment. And there is little convincing evidence indicating that adjuvant therapy reduces
      the risk of recurrence after hepatic resection. Furthermore, no standard regimen has been
      established.

      In the present study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of Apatinib Mesylate that is Small
      molecule anti-angiogenic targeted drugs /PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 combination therapy for
      surgically resected HCCs with high incidence of tumor recurrence containing microsatellite
      lesions, microvascular invasion(MVI) or secondary and above portal vein tumor thrombosis
      (PVTT).
