    <textblock>
      This is a UK (United Kingdom) based registry, involving all sites treating newly presenting
      Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). From this registry, important epidemiological data
      will be obtained. Admission and remission samples will be collected. DNA will be collected
      and analysed from patients wishing to participate to determine if any link exists between
      mutations/polymorphisms and the risk of TTP. As part of NHS commissioning, we will be
      undertaking long term follow up, to understand the impact of acute TTP on morbidity and
      mortality.

  <detailed_description>

      The UK TTP registry started in January 2009, following 3 years MRC funding, involving UK
      collaboration from all sites treating TTP patients. It has resulted in a cohort of data and
      samples from UK TTP cases. The registry promotes a collaborative approach with all UK
      patients and physicians involved with this life threatening disorder. The UK TTP registry has
      been used to provide information for highly specialist commissioning via NHS England and
      moving forward will be required to provide data relevant to the UK TTP Group and
      commissioners.

      University College London (UCL) Haemostasis Research Unit (HRU) will collect and collate the
      data and help administrate for those sites participating in the registry. However, ADAMTS13
      assays will no longer be subsidised. For those sites undertaking local assays, a record of
      cases will be shared centrally. The UK TTP registry will be part of the UK TTP Group.

      On Admission/Pre-treatment:

      â€¢ A 5ml double spun citrate sample (platelet free plasma separated) taken on admission and/or
      pre-treatment. (Part of Standard Care).

      In Remission/Approximately 3 months post admission:

        -  A 5ml double spun remission citrate sample (platelet free plasma separated) following
           discharge from the acute episode. (Part of Standard Care)

        -  A 5ml EDTA whole blood sample for DNA extraction. (Informed Consent from patient
           required).

        -  A 5ml serum sample. (Sample taken as part of Standard Care; Informed Consent required
           for storage and use of sample for current and future analysis of parameters related to
           TTP; Current tests include, IgG subtyping and Rituximab levels.)

        Patients presenting with an acute episode of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) will
        be asked to consent for the registry once in remission. However, for those sites
        undertaking ADAMTS13 analysis, consent for admission and remission samples for TTP cases
        will be requested. A screening log of all cases analysed will be kept by sites and
        forwarded at 3 monthly intervals. This will help identify other non-TTP causes for ADAMTS13
        analysis.
