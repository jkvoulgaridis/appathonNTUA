  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, observational open label, single center study enrolling up to 15 subjects to
      evaluate human factors and usability of the Pivot Breath Sensor.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this Human Factors/Usability study are to:

        -  Ensure that representative intended users are able to operate the Pivot Breath Sensor
           independently

        -  Validate appropriate mitigations of use related hazards identified in risk management
           documentation

        -  Uncover previously unforeseen use errors

      This human factors and usability testing is conducted to demonstrate that the Pivot Breath
      Sensor can be used by the intended users without serious use errors or problems, for the
      intended uses and under the expected use conditions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Human Factors - user performance in use scenarios assessment with observer ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 minutes per participant</time_frame>
    <description>User performance of participants in intended use scenarios will be assessed at a single visit. Participants will be observed if they can set up the device, use the device and interpret results. Observer ratings include 'Successful' and 'Unsuccessful'. Specific attention will be given to assess if any harms can occur from observed use errors.
For each participant, the single visit includes the consent process, entry into the study, the study session, and conclusion of the study. The study session is completed on a single day requiring up to 60 minutes.
Observations are made throughout the study session. Assessments for individual tasks will take approximately 1 minute and assessments will be made over the study session which can last up to 60 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Human Factors - user documentation assessment with observer ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 minutes per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Participant understanding of user documentation will be assessed at single visit. User documentation includes packaging information, quick start guide and user manual. Observer ratings include 'Successful' and 'Unsuccessful'.
For each participant, the single visit includes the consent process, entry into the study, the study session, and conclusion of the study. The study session is completed on a single day requiring up to 60 minutes.
Observations are made throughout the study session. Assessments for individual tasks will take approximately 1 minute each. The User documentation assessment portion of the study session will last up to 30 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Human Factors - subjective feedback questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 minutes per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective feedback focusing on any concerns on using device will be assessed at single visit. Participants will answer with a Yes or No to the questions.
For each participant, the single visit includes the consent process, entry into the study, the study session, and conclusion of the study. The study session is completed on a single day requiring up to 60 minutes.
Subjective feedback focusing on any concerns prior to the conclusion of the study session. Subjective feedback questions will take approximately 1-3 minutes each. The Subjective feedback portion of the study session will last up to 5 to 15 minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Human Factors - participant feedback using rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 minutes per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Participant will be asked to provide ratings on the following:
How would you rate the ease or difficulty using the device?
How clear or unclear was the Quick Start Guide?
How clear or unclear was the Packaging?
How clear or unclear was the User Manual?
How easy or difficult was it to understand and interpret the test results?
The participant will use the following rating scale:
5 - Very Easy 4 - Easy 3 - Neither Easy nor Difficult 2 - Difficult
1 - Very difficult
For each participant, the single visit includes the consent process, entry into the study, the study session, and conclusion of the study. The study session is completed on a single day requiring up to 60 minutes.
Participant will provide the ratings prior to the conclusion of the study session. Participant assessment with questionnaire rating scales will take approximately 1-2 minutes each.</description>
