      The performance of STIs and clinical scores alone and their combination to predict short term
      prognosis of acute decompensated heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure is a leading cause of hospitalization and death.Prediction of these
      adverse events is still challenging.

      STI is an old technique based on the recording of two parameters: electrocardiogram and
      phonocardiogram, and from them measuring the different systolic intervals:

      pre-ejection period (PEP),electro-mechanic activation time (EMAT), Left ventricular ejection
      time (LVET) and systolic time ratio (RTS) were measured.

      The aim of these study is to demonstrate whether systolic time intervals (STIs) can improve
      clinical scores EFFECT (Enhanced Feedback for Effective Cardiac Treatment) and GWTG-HF (Get
      With the Guidelines-Heart Failure) for predicting 30 day mortality and readmission in
      patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the ED.

    <description>Acoustic cardiography was performed for all participants using the BIOPAC system with &quot;Student Lab&quot; software version 3.7.2. An electrocardiogram was obtained by two electrodes placed at the right upper limb and the lower left limb. Simultaneously heart sounds were recorded with a specific sensor placed at the mitral focus.</description>
