  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to study the effects of anesthetics on Circulatory Function Genomics and
      find the anesthetic effects in pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, drug receptor or target
      DNA level differences, further guiding individual treatment in clinic, promoting the
      development of precision the medicine.The anesthesia medication during perioperative period
      is more and more accurate,reasonable and safe, so as to improve the satisfaction of the
      patients and their families in the perioperative period, to ensure the safety of patients.

      This study is a non traumatic and non intervention study, and will use a large sample of
      clinical research, the number of subjects to be enrolled in the study group are 200 cases.
      The basic information of the study was included in the study before the operation. During the
      operation, the investigators need a collection of participants's arterial blood and monitor
      the hemodynamic index and anesthesia depth by bispectral index(BIS) . Further moreï¼Œthe
      investigators will follow up the participants' condition after operation.Dividing the
      patients into different groups according to their clinical features.The relationship between
      vital signs and the depth of anesthesia was analyzed and compared between different
      groups.Blood samples collected during the operation were detected by gene test. Comparing the
      results of genetic testing and clinical data analysis, then the investigators will find the
      differences in the expression of the gene polymorphisms of anesthetic drugs in the
      circulating function.
