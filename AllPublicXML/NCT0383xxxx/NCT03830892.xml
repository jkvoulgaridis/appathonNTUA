      This study aims to understand the effects of device power and nicotine concentration on the
      likelihood that someone would use or abuse e-cigarettes.

    <intervention_model_description>We will recruit two populations of e-cigarette users: exclusive e-cigarette users and dual users of e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes.
All participants complete 5 within-subject laboratory conditions that each last 4 hours. Conditions (sessions) differ by the tobacco product used: 1) e-cigarette with low device power, low nicotine mg/ml; 2) e-cigarette with low device power, high nicotine mg/ml; 3) e-cigarette with high device power, low nicotine mg/ml; 4) e-cigarette with high device power, high nicotine mg/ml; and 5) own brand e-cigarette/cigarette.
The first four sessions are latin-square-ordered and the last session for all participants will be their own brand cigarette/e-cigarette depending on the population. For dual users, we will counter-balance own brand condition product assignment (cigarette vs. e-cigarette). Conditions will differ in the presentation of primary outcomes (task order) which will be counterbalanced.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Breakpoint of Drug Purchase Tasks (DPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each DPT will be completed once per study session (either 90 minutes or approximately 180 minutes into the session, timing varies based on task order presentation and potentially choices made in tasks presented prior to this task).</time_frame>
    <description>The DPTs will yield measures of willingness to pay and measures of price sensitivity for session-specific tobacco products. Choices made during this task are not reinforced during the session.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Breakpoint of Multiple Choice Procedure (MCP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed once per study session (either 90 minutes or approximately 180 minutes into the session, timing varies based on task order presentation and potentially choices made in tasks presented prior to this task).</time_frame>
    <description>The MCP will yield of measure of willingness to pay for session-specific tobacco products. One choice made during this task is reinforced (i.e., money or tobacco product is distributed).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effort for product puffs with the Progressive Ratio Task (PRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed once per study session (either 90 minutes or approximately 180 minutes into the session, timing varies based on task order presentation and potentially choices made in tasks presented prior to this task).</time_frame>
    <description>The PRT will yield a measure of willingness to work for session-specific tobacco products (via number of times a space bar is pressed to earn puffs) through three outcome measures. 1) Breakpoint (maximum number of key presses completed to earn a puff), 2) number of puffs self-administrated, and 3) latency (seconds) to initiate key pressing.</description>
