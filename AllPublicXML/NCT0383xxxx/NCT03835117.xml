  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the metabolic effects of a comprehensive
      wide-spectrum supplement for children with ASD to determine whether it physiologically
      targets mitochondrial pathways known to be abnormal in children with ASD.The intervention is
      a commonly used wide-spectrum nutritional supplement, which is theoretically designed to
      normalize mitochondrial function. The investigators aim to determine if the supplement does
      have the hypothesized effect on physiology in individuals with ASD. The investigator will
      enroll up to 50 children, aged 4 to 14 years of age with confirmed ASD and mitochondrial
      dysfunction, and participation will last 26 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder often with
      life-long consequences that affects young children during critical developmental periods. The
      Centers for Disease Control estimates that ASD affects as many as 17 per 1000 children (1 in
      59) in the United States suggesting that the prevalence is higher than previous
      estimates.Despite the dramatic rise in the detected prevalence of ASD over the past two
      decades, there is no effective medical treatment for core ASD symptoms (social communication
      and repetitive behavior), the closely associated problem of language impairment, or the
      underlying pathophysiology of ASD. Currently, the only accepted treatment for core ASD
      symptoms is behavior therapy, which may entail intensive one-on-one treatment over several
      years.

      The primary aims of this study are to evaluate the effect of a wide-spectrum nutritional
      supplement on mitochondrial function in individuals with ASD. Participants entered into the
      trial will have abnormalities in mitochondrial function that are known to be associated with
      ASD (approximately 50+% of children with ASD) but are not diagnostic of mitochondrial
      disease. The investigators hypothesize that nutritional supplements designed for children
      with ASD have a physiological action of normalizing mitochondrial function and cellular
      physiology throughout the body.

      To test whether the targeted nutritional supplement is superior to placebo, the investigators
      will study 50 children, between the ages of 4 years to 14 years, with confirmed ASD and known
      abnormal variations in mitochondrial at baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive active treatment or placebo for 12-weeks under double-blind conditions and at the end
      of the 12 weeks switch to the opposite condition after a 2-week wash out period.
      Mitochondrial function will be measured at baseline and after each treatment arm in order to
      determine if the supplement positively influences cellular biochemistry. The investigator
      will also evaluate the effectiveness of the supplement on core and associated ASD symptoms
      using several behaviors assessments.

    <measure>Change in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Childhood Autism Rating Scale is a 15-item clinician-rated scale that measures the severity of core ASD symptoms of social communication and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Each item is scored on a 4 point scale of severity from 1 (None/Minimal) to 4 (Severe). The measure is the total score of the 15 items in which a score of 15-27.5 reflects minimal to no severity of symptoms, 28-33.5 reflects mild to moderate severity of symptoms, and a score of 34 or higher reflects severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a clinician rated 7-point measure of overall symptomatic severity of psychopathology. Scores range from 1 (Normal, not at all ill) through 4 (Moderately ill) to 7 (Among the most extremely ill patients). The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I) is the companion measure that evaluates the change in the patient's symptoms relative to baseline. Scores range from 1 (Very much improved) through 4 (No Change) to 7 (Very much worse). Ratings are reflected in a single total score, in which a score of 2 (Much Improved) or 1 (Very Much Improved) on the CGI-I will be used as a secondary measure to define positive response.</description>

    <description>The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Autism Spectrum Disorder is a 5-item clinician-rated measure to evaluate severity of repetitive behavior in children with ASD. Each item is scored on a 5 point scale from 0 (None) to 4 (Extreme) for the severity of: Time Spent, Interference in everyday life, Distress, Resistance, and Degree of Control over the behavior. A decrease in the total score of the 5 items, ranging from 0 to 20, will be used as a secondary measure to define positive response.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist is a 58-item caregiver questionnaire consisting of five subscales: hyperactivity, irritability, social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior and inappropriate speech in children with developmental disabilities. A higher score indicates more frequent aberrant behaviors. Our secondary measures are the subscale scores for Irritability (15 item), Social Withdrawal (16 item) and Hyperactivity (16 item). Each item rates behavior severity on a 4 point scale from 0 (Not at all a problem) to 3 (The problem is severe in degree). A decrease in the subscale scores, ranging from 0 to 45 (Irritability), 48 (Social Withdrawal) and 48 (Hyperactivity), will be used as secondary measures to define positive response.</description>

    <description>The Parent-rated Anxiety Scale for Autism Spectrum Disorder is a 25-item scale that measures anxiety in youth with ASD. Each item rates the severity of a behavior on a 4 point scale from 0 (None/not present) to 3 (Severe/Very frequent and a major problem). A decrease in the total score of the 25 items, ranging from 0 to 75, will be used as a secondary measure to define positive response to intervention.</description>

Each item rates the severity of interference in the quality of the caregiver's life on a 5 point scale from 0 (Not at All) to 4 (Very Much). A decrease in the total score of the 7 items, ranging from 0 to 28, will be used as a secondary measure to define positive response.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Vineland III Caregiver score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland III Caregiver is a 381-item parent-reported measure of adaptive behavior in children with developmental and intellectual disabilities. The Vineland is comprised of three sub scores for the following domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, and Socialization. The frequency of adaptive behaviors for each item is scored on a scale from 0 (Never) to 2 (Usually). The total adaptive score is reflected as a composite score of the sub domains (which is determined by age norms) in which a higher total score reflects higher functioning. An increase in the total score or sub domain scores will be used as a secondary measure to define positive response to intervention.</description>

    <description>The Wide-spectrum nutritional supplement used will be a combination of NeuroNeeds: SpectrumNeeds and QNeeds. Weight based dosing will be used. The daily serving size will be divided into two oral daily doses in the form of a powder which can be mixed into liquid or food. Together, there are 34 different dietary supplements in the products. Except for ubiquinol, all of these nutrients are provided in a powder form in SpectrumNeeds. Ubiquinol is provided separately in QNeeds gel capsules. These capsules can be swallowed whole, or cut with scissors and the contents squeezed out and added to SpectrumNeeds just before ingestion.</description>
