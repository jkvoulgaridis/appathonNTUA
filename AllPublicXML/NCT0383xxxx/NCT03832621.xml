      This is a Phase II, multicenter, single-arm trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of nivolumab (NIVO), ipilimumab (IPI) and temozolomide (TMZ) combination in 27
      patients with MSS, MGMT-silenced mCRC with initial clinical benefit following lead-in
      treatment with single-agent TMZ.

      Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to trigger durable antitumor effects in a subset
      of patients. A high number of tumor mutations (so called 'tumor mutational burden') has
      recently been found associated with increased immunogenicity (due to a high number of
      neoantigens) and improved treatment efficacy across several different solid tumors. In mCRCs,
      only a small fraction of tumors (&lt;5%) display a high mutational load and are usually
      associated with inactivation of mismatch repair genes such as MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. Checkpoint
      inhibitors may have increased activity in dMMR/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)
      tumors, a hypothesis which was tested in various Phase II trials with positive results. On
      the opposite, mismatch repair proficient colorectal cancer is unresponsive to immune
      checkpoint inhibitors.

      Previous reports indicate that acquired resistance to TMZ may emerge through the induction of
      a microsatellite-instability-positive phenotype and recent data showed that inactivation of
      MMR, driven by acquired resistance to the clinical agent temozolomide, increased mutational
      load, promoted continuous renewal of neoantigens in human colorectal cancers and triggered
      immune surveillance in mouse models.

      On all of the above grounds, the investigators hypothesize that treatment of microsatellite
      stable MGMT hypermethylated CRCs with alkylating agents could reshape the tumor genetic
      landscape by increasing the tumor mutational burden, leading to achieve potential
      sensitization to immunotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In advanced CRC, the occurrence of chemorefractory disease poses a major therapeutic
      challenge for presence of an adequate performance status to potentially receive further
      treatments. Patients who progress after all approved treatments may be generally considered
      suitable for new investigational drugs or strategies. Thus, in the era of personalized
      medicine, tumor molecular profiling may lead to the identification of therapeutic targets or
      predictive biomarkers for pharmacological intervention. The DNA repair gene
      O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is responsible of the elimination of alkyl
      groups from the O6-position of guanine. If inactive, it may be involved in early steps of
      colorectal tumor genesis leading to an increase of G-to-A point mutations. Epigenetic
      silencing of MGMT during colorectal tumor genesis is associated with hypermethylation of the
      CpG island in its promoter. This transcriptional gene silencing is responsible for diminished
      DNA-repair of O6-alkylguanine adducts, with the consequence of enhancing chemosensitivity to
      alkylating agents including dacarbazine and its oral prodrug temozolomide (TMZ). Previous
      phase II studies showed that TMZ induced an average objective response rate by RECIST
      criteria in 10% of heavily pre-treated patients with advanced CRC carrying MGMT promoter
      methylated tumors. Thus, MGMT methylation by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) used for patients
      screening seemed to be a necessary but not sufficient condition to identify response to TMZ.
      Digital PCR quantification of MGMT methylation refined patients' selection, with benefit
      restricted to those with highly hyper-methylated tumors. Further analysis showed that MGMT
      negative/low expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is found in about one third of
      MSP-methylated samples and is associated with increased response rate. However, even in
      responding mCRC patients, acquired resistance to single agent TMZ emerges rapidly and almost
      invariably within 6 months from treatment initiation.

      Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to trigger durable antitumor effects in a subset
      of patients. A high number of tumor mutations (so called 'tumor mutational burden') has
      recently been found associated with increased immunogenicity (due to a high number of
      neoantigens) and improved treatment efficacy across several different solid tumors. Early
      clinical testing indicated that only 1 of 33 CRC patients had a response to anti PD-1
      treatment, in contrast to substantial fractions of patients with melanomas, renal-cell
      cancers, and lung tumors who showed benefit from PD-1 blockade. Similarly, anti CTLA-4
      treatment up today brought to unsatisfactory results in unselected mCRC patients. The
      probability of response has been ascribed to a high mutational burden (that is an elevated
      number of somatic mutations), which translates in increased number of neo-antigens. In mCRCs,
      only a small fraction of tumors (&lt;5%) display a high mutational load and are usually
      associated with inactivation of mismatch repair genes such as MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. Molecular
      alterations in these genes occur as an initial step in colon tumor genesis leading to the
      microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype. Indeed, mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR)
      colorectal cancers have 10 to 100 times as many somatic mutations as mismatch
      repair-proficient colorectal cancers. Moreover, mismatch repair-deficient cancers contain
      prominent lymphocyte infiltrates, a finding consistent with an immune response. Thus,
      checkpoint inhibitors may have increased activity in dMMR/microsatellite instability-high
      (MSI-H) tumors, a hypothesis which was tested in various Phase II trials with positive
      results. On the opposite, mismatch repair proficient colorectal cancer is unresponsive to
      immune checkpoint inhibitors.

      Previous reports indicate that acquired resistance to TMZ may emerge through the induction of
      a microsatellite-instability-positive phenotype. On the other hand, TMZ by itself has been
      shown to induce an increase of mutational load in other MGMT deficient solid tumors such as
      melanoma or glioblastoma. In parallel, other studies have demonstrated that alkylating
      agents' side effects can influence the immune cell compartment by selectively depleting the
      immuno-suppressive T regulator lymphocytes (Tregs), and activating the immuno-active T
      cytotoxic lymphocytes (Tc) and natural killers (NK). The investigators recently showed that
      inactivation of MMR, driven by acquired resistance to the clinical agent temozolomide,
      increased mutational load, promoted continuous renewal of neoantigens in human colorectal
      cancers and triggered immune surveillance in mouse models.

      On all of the above grounds, the investigators hypothesize that treatment of microsatellite
      stable MGMT hypermethylated CRCs with alkylating agents could reshape the tumor genetic
      landscape by increasing the tumor mutational burden either directly (by inducing G&gt;A
      mutations) or/and indirectly (by inactivating DNA repair genes such as MLH1, MSH2 or MSH6,
      which in turn could lead to hypermutated phenotype) therefore enhancing formation of cancer
      neoantigens and immunogenicity. TMZ treatment can also modulate the repertoire of immune
      cells (Tregs, Tc, NK) favoring T cell activation. To achieve potential sensitization to
      immunotherapy by means of TMZ-induced MSI-like status, treatment with TMZ should be active
      (i.e. inducing a SD/PR/CR).

             The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) is
             allowed.

             a. Note: Patients who have received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant
             medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled in the
             study after discussion with and approval by the Sponsor.

         24. Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

         25. Active hepatitis B (defined as having a positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             test prior to randomization) or hepatitis C

               1. Note: Patients with past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or resolved HBV
                  infection (defined as having a negative HBsAg test and a positive antibody to
                  hepatitis B core antigen antibody test) are eligible. Patients with detectable
                  HBV-DNA are not eligible.

               2. Note: Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if
                  polymerase chain reaction testing is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).

         26. Active tuberculosis

         27. Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to start of study
             treatment or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during
             the study

         28. Prior treatment with CD137 agonists, anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic
             antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint
             pathways, including prior therapy with anti-tumor vaccines.

         29. Pregnancy or lactation. A serum pregnancy test is required within 7 days prior to
             start of study treatment, or within 14 days with a confirmatory urine pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior start of study treatment

         30. For women who are not post-menopausal (&lt; 12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea)
             or surgically sterile (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): refusal to use a highly
             effective contraceptive method (i.e. with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year such as
             sexual abstinence, hormonal implants, combined oral contraceptives, vasectomised
             partner), during the study drug administration and for at least 6 months after the
             last dose of study medication. Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception. A combination of male condom with cap, diaphragm or sponge with
             spermicide (double barrier methods) is not considered highly effective, birth control
             methods. Acceptable methods of contraception may include total abstinence in cases
             where the lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance. A Vasectomised partner is a
             highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner
             of the trial participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical
             assessment of the surgical success.

         31. For men: refusal to use a highly effective contraceptive method (i.e. with a failure
             rate of &lt; 1 % per year such as vasectomy, sexual abstinence or female partner use of
             hormonal implants or combined oral contraceptives) during the study drug
             administration and for a period of at least 6 months after the last dose of study
             medication. Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post
             ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. A
             combination of male condom with either, cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide
             (double barrier methods) is not considered highly effective, birth control methods.
             Acceptable methods of contraception may include total abstinence in cases where the
             lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance. A vasectomised trial participant is a
             highly effective birth control method provided that the trial participant has received
             medical assessment of the surgical success.
