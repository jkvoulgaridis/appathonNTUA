    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of erenumab in migraine prevention in
      children (6 to &lt;12 years) and adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years) with chronic migraine. The study
      hypothesis is that in pediatric subjects with chronic migraine, the combined erenumab dose
      group has a greater reduction from baseline to week 9 through week 12 (month 3) in monthly
      migraine days (MMDs) when compared with placebo in the double-blind treatment phase (DBTP).

      This study is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Erenumab in migraine prevention in children (6 to &lt;12
      years) and adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years) with chronic migraine.

      The trial consists of four phases: screening (up to 3 weeks of initial screening and a 4-week
      prospective baseline phase); the double-blind treatment phase (24 weeks) in which
      participants receive placebo or Erenumab dose 1, dose 2 or dose 3 (based on participant's
      body weight) via subcutaneous injection once a month; the optional dose level blinded
      extension phase (40 weeks), in which all participants are assigned to receive dose 1, dose 2
      or dose 3 of Erenumab; and a 12 weeks safety follow-up phase (16 weeks after the last dose of
      investigational drug).

      The study intends to enroll 286 participants (256 adolescents and 30 children).

             migraine.

          -  History of ≥ 15 headache days per month of which ≥ 8 headache days were assessed by
             the subject as migraine days per month in each of the 3 months prior to screening.

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications. Further details are available at the link below.</ipd_access_criteria>
