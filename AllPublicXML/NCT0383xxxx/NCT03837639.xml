      The aim of the study is to analyze the effect of 12 weeks of arm crank exercise (ACE)
      training on cardiovascular function in PAD patients, and compare it with treadmill exercise
      (TE), the actual recommendation for this patients. In this clinical trial, 45 patients will
      be allocated randomly in three experimental groups: ACE training, TE and control group. ACE
      and TE groups will perform exercises twice a week with the intensity equivalent to 13- 15 on
      Borg's Subjective Perception Exertion Scale. Patients in control group will meet twice a
      week, however only to perform diverse activities and group living, without any type of
      exercise involved. All groups will be encouraged to increase their levels of activity, as
      they are usually guided in medical consultations. Before and after 12 weeks of intervention,
      cardiovascular function, functional capacity, cognition, and quality of life will be
      assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arm-crank exercise (ACT) is an alternative exercise strategy for patients with symptomatic
      peripheral artery disease (PAD) due the benefits on functional capacity and quality of life,
      besides provoking less or no pain symptoms during the execution. This study sought to
      describe the protocol of a study that will analyse the effect of ACT exercise on walking
      capacity, cardiovascular function, cognition and quality of life in patients with symptomatic
      PAD.

      This is a three-armed randomized, prospective, single-blind data collection, single-center,
      controlled study enrolling 45 patients with symptomatic PAD which will be randomized into 3
      intervention groups: walking training (WT), ACT (WT and AC: 15 to 10 sets of 2 to 5 minutes,
      Borg 13 to 15) and control group (CG). Before and after 12 weeks of intervention,
      cardiovascular function (ambulatory blood pressure , clinic blood pressure, central blood
      pressure, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, vascular function), functional capacity
      (six-minute walking test, 2 minute step test [2 MST], Walking impairment questionnaire [WIQ],
      Walking estimated limitation calculated by history [WELCH], Baltimore activity scale for
      intermittent claudication, handgrip test and short physical performance battery [SPPB]),
      cognition (executive function and memory) and quality of life (short version of world health
      organization quality of life and vascular quality of life questionnaire [VASCUQOL-6]) will be
      assessed.

      This is the first trial to evaluate the effects of ACT on regulatory mechanisms of
      cardiovascular system in PAD patients. If the results are as expected, they will provide
      evidence of ACT in promoting cardiovascular benefits in symptomatic PAD population.

    <description>Arm-crank exercise group will be performed twice a week for 12 weeks. In the first weeks of training, each session will consist of 15 bouts, two active minutes and two minutes of passive interval, consisting of 60 minutes of session (30 minutes of active exercise). After the first three weeks of training, the exercise time will progressively increase by one minute every 3 weeks and the recovery period will be decreased, completing, at the end, a maximum volume of 10 bouts of five minutes of exercise and one minute of passive interval. The intensity of the exercise will be determined by the load equivalent to the range of 13 - 15 of The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion, considered as somewhat hard to hard.</description>
