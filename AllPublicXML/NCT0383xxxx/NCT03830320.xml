  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate a new radiotracer called 64Cu-FBP8 for PET-MR imaging
      of thrombosis. The tracer has the potential of detecting thrombosis in the left atrial
      appendage of patients with atrial fibrillation, thereby may provide a non-invasive
      alternative to the current standard-of-care, transesophageal echocardiography.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To evaluate the safety of [64Cu]FBP8 and its whole body distribution, metabolism,
           pharmacokinetics, and radiation burden in healthy volunteers.

        2. To establish the accuracy of [64Cu]FBP8 -PET to detect left atrial thrombosis in
           patients with atrial fibrillation.

    <description>In the first stage, twenty (20) healthy adult subjects will be injected with [64Cu]FBP8 to establish the safety, whole body distribution, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and radiation burden of the probe. All subjects will be imaged using PET/MR. Healthy subjects will undergo blood collection before, during, and after the scan. Healthy subjects will also undergo electrocardiogram before and after the scan. An interim review of the data will be conducted after the first six subjects receive the study agent and complete all safety assessments.</description>

    <description>In the second stage, forty (40) patients with LAA thrombus documented by TEE will be injected with [64Cu]FBP8 and imaged for LAA thrombus with MR-PET. The TEE studies in these patients will be part of their routine clinical care.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For Healthy subjects:

          -  Must be deemed healthy at screening visit as determined by the physician investigator
             or nurse practitioner, based on the following assessments at Screening: physical
             examination, medical history and vital signs;

          -  No known history of atrial fibrillation or thrombosis;

          -  Negative Drug Screen;

          -  Have the ability to give written informed consent.
