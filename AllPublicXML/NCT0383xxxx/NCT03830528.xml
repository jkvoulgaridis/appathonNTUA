      The study will have 3 parts:

        -  In Part A and Part B, a placebo-controlled double-blind study will be conducted to
           investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose and 14 days
           multiple doses of KW-6356 in Japanese healthy men, respectively

        -  In Part C, an open-label study will be conducted to investigate safety, tolerability and
           pharmacokinetics of 7 days multiple doses of KW-6356 in Japanese and Caucasian healthy
           men
