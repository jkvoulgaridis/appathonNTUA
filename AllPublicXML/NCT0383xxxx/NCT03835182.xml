  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is a common problem which results in reduced functionality, quality of
      life and general well being. Conservative treatment includes patient education, exercise,
      maintaining a healthy body mass index and appropriate modifications to activities of daily
      living. Physical modalities are used to support the mainstay of treatment and include
      superficial heat, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), ultrasound, short wave
      diathermy , traction, and complimentary therapies.

      In the clinical practice of the investigators, diathermy, in the form of ultrasound and short
      wave, is used to heat deeper tissues, increase tissue elasticity and metabolic rate and
      reduce pain and muscle spasm. The medical literature to date states that further studies are
      required to compare the efficacy of different diathermy modalities in the treatment of lower
      back pain.

      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of ultrasound to that of short wave
      diathermy and a treatment program which does not include diathermy in the treatment of a
      slipped disc.

      Chronic lumbar pain is a common problem which results in reduced functionality, quality of
      life and well being. Chronic low back pain also results in many missed days of work and so is
      an economic burden as well as a social one. Subacute and chronic conservative treatment of
      low back pain secondary to a herniated disc of the lower back includes education, lifestyle
      modifications, and maintenance of a normal body mass index. Physical therapy includes range
      of motion, strengthening and aerobic exercises alongside use of physical therapy modalities
      such as superficial heating, low frequency analgesic modalities such as TENS and deep heating
      modalities such as ultrasonic waves and short wave diathermy.

      In Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation departments in Turkey, diathermy is commonly used as
      an adjunct to exercise in the inpatient treatment of disc herniation of the lumbar region.
      However, systematic reviews of the effects of diathermy in the form of ultrasound and short
      wave emphasise the necessity for further studies of their efficacy in the treatment of pain
      and impact on functionality and quality of life.

      Therefore, in this study the investigators aim to compare the efficacy of ultrasound and
      short wave diathermy in treating pain, improving disability and quality of life in patients
      with chronic low back pain secondary to disc herniation of the lumbar vertebrae.

    <intervention_model_description>Three groups of patients, each containing 31 patients, will be included in the study. Patients in each group will receive a total of ten sessions of physical therapy over a two week period. Each week the patients will receive five sessions of physical therapy on consecutive days. The first group will be treated with a hotpack (20minutes) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation applied to the lower back (frequency, ultrasound 1MHz frequency (ten minutes), abdominal and lower back muscle strengthening exercises. The second group will be treated with hotpack, TENS and exercises as previously described plus short wave diathermy at 27.12MHz frequency for ten minutes applied to the lower back. The third group will receive hotpack, TENS applied to the lower back and strengthening exercises as previously described.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire. The Revised Oswestry Disability Index is a condition specific outcome measure for low back pain. The index consists of ten questions with six possible responses regarding the patient's back pain, (scored from 0-5), including the severity of pain and impact on activities of daily living. The minimum obtainable score is 0, the maximum obtainable score is 50. This score is then used to calculate the index percentage using the formula: [total score/(no. of questions answered x 5)]100. The higher the percentage, the greater the level of disability due to low back pain. The minimal detectable change (90% confidence interval)is 10%, change of less than 10% maybe attributed to measurement error.</description>

    <description>Short Form 36 (SF-36).The SF 36 is a generic health survey which assesses health concepts that are pertinent to functional status and well-being such as physical function, bodily pain, role limitations due to emotional and physical problems. The sub scale values are reported: physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, general health, social functioning, emotional role, physical role, mental health. The lowest and highest possible raw score for the subscales are as follows: physical functioning 10-30, physical role 4- 8, bodily pain 2-12, general health 5-25, vitality 4-24, social functioning 2-10, emotional role 3-6, mental health 5-30. Higher values signify better well being in all subgroups. The raw score is then used to calculate the 'transformed scale: Transformed scale= [(actual raw score- lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range]100</description>
