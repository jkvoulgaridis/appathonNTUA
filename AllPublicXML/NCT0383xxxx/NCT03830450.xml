    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common complication in patients after cardiac surgery.
      An usual estimation of risk for AKI is estimation of serum creatinine, which is unreliable
      indicator of AKI risk. Because of that, today different biomarkers are investigated to
      predict incidence for development AKI after cardiac surgery. This investigation will try to
      find potentially risk patients for developing AKI after cardiac surgery by using conventional
      markers (creatinine, glomerular filtration rate) in perioperative period comparing with two
      different biomarkers neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and growth
      differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) which are proven markers in patients with increased risk
      for AKI development.
