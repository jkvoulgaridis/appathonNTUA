      Context Pain control is one of the most challenging problems encountered in postoperative
      period in bariatric patients. Currently there are no published studies evaluating Osteopathic
      Manipulative Treatment in bariatric surgery patients.

      Objective The primary objective of this study is to determine whether Osteopathic
      Manipulative Treatment (OMT) can decrease pain score in bariatric patients. The secondary
      objective is whether OMT can improve patient satisfaction with overall treatment.

      Design: A prospective randomized group controlled study.

      Setting: A 293-bed non-for-profit teaching community hospital.

      Methods Thirty-six patients scheduled for bariatric surgery as per ASMBS criteria were
      eligible for study from January 2017 through August 2018 at Flushing Hospital Medical Center,
      New York. Twelve patients were excluded.

      Twenty-four patients were included into study and randomized to receive OMT(n=12) vs Control
      (n=12) intervention.

      In Control group, patients received standard pain control protocol with morphine patient
      controlled analgesia pump (PCA) In OMT group, patients received standard postoperative pain
      protocol and OMT on postoperative day one. Three techniques were used (Sub-occipital Release,
      Thoracic Outlet Release, and Rib Raising). All patients received survey to complete prior to
      discharge measuring pain score (1-10), patient satisfaction score 1-4 (poor, fair, good,
      excellent) and data was analyzed.
