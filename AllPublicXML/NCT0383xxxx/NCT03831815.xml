  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blockade is essential to provide optimal conditions for tracheal intubation and
      also to facilitate the performance of surgeries involving mainly the abdominal cavity. The
      introduction of neuromuscular blockers in clinical practice optimized the execution of
      mechanical ventilation. Since the use of these drugs, increased intercurrences such as
      prolonged muscle paralysis and respiratory complications have been observed, resulting in
      unfavorable outcomes with residual neuromuscular blockade and delayed recurrence due to the
      occurrence of these complications. The present study aims to evaluate the incidence of
      residual neuromuscular blockade and late recurarization in the post-anesthetic recovery room
      in patients submitted to videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      This is an observational and prospective study in which patients aged 18-50 years classified
      as ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) I and II, body mass index below 35 and who
      will undergo cholecystectomy will be included. Patients will be allocated to two groups based
      on the neuromuscular blocker used by the anesthesiologist who participates in the surgery, ie
      in group C patients will participate in the administration of cisatracurium and the group R
      will consist of the patients in whom rocuronium was administered. General anesthesia and
      assessment of muscle function will be performed by measuring the four-stimulus sequence (SQE)
      / train of four (TOF) at pre-established times. A residual neuromuscular block is considered
      to be the patient presenting the value of the four-stimulus sequence of T4 / T1 of less than
      0.9.

In group C, the patients in whom cisatracurium was given and the R group consisted of the patients in whom rocuronium was administered. It is emphasized that the choice of the neuromuscular blocker was made by the preference and experience of the anesthesiologist of the case and not by randomization or lottery of the patients.</description>
