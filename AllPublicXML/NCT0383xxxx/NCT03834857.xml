      STENTRODE WITH THOUGHT CONTROLLED DIGITAL SWITCH: An early feasibility study (EFS) of the
      safety of the StentrodeTM device in participants with loss of motor function due to paralysis
      from spinal cord injury, motor neuron disease, stroke, muscular dystrophy or loss of limbs.

      Research has shown that in individuals with neurological conditions, brain signals can be
      recorded using electrical sensors implanted on to the brain. These signals could be used by
      the individuals to control assistive technology (e.g. spelling devices) that help with daily
      life, just by thinking. However, implanting these electrical sensors often requires open
      brain surgery.

      A new medical device and surgical technique has been developed, which allows implantation of
      the electrical sensors without open brain surgery. The device, called Stentrode™, is a small
      metallic mesh tube (stent), with electrode contacts (small metal disks) within the stent
      structure. It can be placed inside a blood vessel of the brain located in the motor cortex.
      This does not involve open brain surgery.

      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety of the Stentrode™ device in humans.
      This is an experimental device. This research will be the first of its kind to be performed
      in humans and may help find safer, more effective ways to introduce/implant electrical
      sensors in patients. This could foster the development of user friendly biotechnology for
      patients with neurological conditions.

             with negative pregnancy test and not breast feeding

          4. Life expectancy of at least twelve (12) months in the opinion of the treating
             physician

          6. Is computer literate

          7. Is willing and able to access all clinical testing locations and is not impeded by
             geographical location (ie: ideally lives within 100 kms or Less than 2 hours travel
             time to study site)

          8. No conditions, including an eye movement disorder, that would prevent the use of eye
             tracking software and has a level of vision that will not impede viewing of screens
