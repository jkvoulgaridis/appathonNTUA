      Open-label study involving longitudinal assessment of the continued safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of ADV7103 in maintaining targeted serum bicarbonate levels, preventing metabolic
      acidosis, and preventing hypokalemia in the following groups of subjects with primary dRTA:

        1. subjects who participated in Study B23CS and were adherent to the protocol;

        2. subjects ≥ 6 months of age who are living in Europe and did not participate in Study
           B23CS; and

        3. infants younger than 6 months of age
