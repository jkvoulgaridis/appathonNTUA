      This research study is studying a drug combination as a possible treatment for endometrial
      cancer.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  mirvetuximab soravtansine (IMGN853)

        -  pembrolizumab
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved mirvetuximab soravtansine as
      a treatment for any disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the combination of mirvetuximab
      soravtansine and pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy that activates a patient's
      own immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells. Pembrolizumab by itself may not be
      enough to kill cancer cells in all people with cancer. In this study, all patients will
      receive mirvetuximab soravtansine and pembrolizumab. Mirvetuximab soravtansine is an
      antibody-drug conjugate. That is a type of agent that attaches a chemotherapy drug to a
      molecule that binds a protein on the outside of cancer cells. The protein targeted by
      mirvetuximab soravtansine is called folate receptor-alpha (FRα). FRα is expressed on the
      surface of certain cancers, including endometrial cancer cells. Mirvetuximab soravtansine is
      expected to kill cancer cells by delivering chemotherapy to cells that have high levels of
      FRα. To participate in this study, a sample of your tumor was previously tested, and was
      found to have high levels of FRα. Mirvetuximab soravtansine also may also active immune cells
      and improve the response to immunotherapies like pembrolizumab.

      In this study, the investigators expect to learn whether the combination of pembrolizumab and
      mirvetuximab soravtansine can shrink endometrial cancers or prevent their growth for at least
      6 months. The investigators will also learn more about the side effects patients experience
      who receive this treatment. The investigators also plan to learn more about which patients
      are likely to benefit from this treatment

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have advanced or recurrent serous endometrial cancer. In addition,
             the tumors must be:

          -  microsatellite stable (MSS) as documented by either intact immunohistochemical (IHC)
             nuclear expression of the mismatch repair genes MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2; or
             microsatelitte stable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), next generation sequencing,
             or other CLIA-approved method;

        AND

          -  FRα positive by central immunohistochemistry (IHC, Section 9.1). If archival tissue
             does not meet FRα criteria, a fresh biopsy tumor sample may be submitted and used to
             meet this criterium. If a fresh tumor biopsy cannot be done safely the patient will
             not be allowed to enroll on this study.

               -  Participants must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. Lesions
                  situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression
                  has been demonstrated in such lesions.

               -  Prior therapy: Patients must have had one, but no more than three lines of
                  chemotherapy for endometrial carcinoma.

          -  Prior hormonal therapy is allowed (no washout period is required after hormonal
             therapy) and does not count as a prior line of therapy. Hormonal therapy in
             combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors or mTOR or other PI3K-pathway inhibitors is allowed
             and does not count as a line of prior therapy.

          -  Patients must NOT have received any class of drugs targeted to the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
             or folate receptor orthologs.

               -  Age 18 or greater years. Because insufficient dosing or adverse event data are
                  currently available on the use of mirvetuximab soravtansine and pembrolizumab in
                  participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded. Endometrial cancer is rare
                  in the pediatric population.

          -  creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above
             institutional normal.

             -Time from prior therapy:

          -  Systemic anti-neoplastic therapy: 5 half-lives or 4 weeks, whichever is shorter.
             Hormonal therapy is not considered anti-neoplastic therapy.

          -  Radiotherapy: wide-field radiotherapy (e.g. &gt; 30% of marrow-bearing bones) completed
             at least 4 weeks, or focal radiation completed at least 2 weeks, prior to starting
             study treatment

               -  The effects of agents used in this study on the developing human fetus are

                  prior to study entry, during study treatment, and for at least twelve weeks after
                  the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she
                  is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her
                  treating physician immediately.

          -  Known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to
             first dose of study treatment.

             or hypertensive encephalopathy, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, thrombotic or
             ischemic stroke, clinically-significant vascular disease (e.g. aortic aneurysm, or
             dissecting aneurysm), severe aortic stenosis, clinically significant peripheral
             vascular disease, or ≥ Grade 3 cardiac toxicity following prior chemotherapy, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
