      Inhomogeneous ventilation was more likely to happen in patients after general anesthesia.
      Inhomogeneous ventilation may associate with ventilator-induced lung injury. A large number
      of post-neurosurgical patients was delayed extubation and received mechanical ventilation, so
      that, inhomogeneous ventilation was more likely to happen in the population. Electrical
      impedance tomography (EIT) is an noninvasive, radiation-free, high temporal resolution,
      relatively cheap technique in monitoring ventilation distribution bedside. The investigators
      aimed to investigate the incidence of inhomogeneous ventilation and factors associated with
      inhomogeneous ventilation in post-neurosurgical patients under mechanical ventilation.

      Inhomogeneous ventilation was more likely to happen in patients after general anesthesia.
      Inhomogeneous ventilation may associate with ventilator-induced lung injury since the
      gravity-depend collapse and over-distention of nondependent regional in patients under
      mechanical ventilation. A large number of post-neurosurgical patients was delayed extubation
      and received mechanical ventilation, so that, inhomogeneous ventilation was more likely to
      happen in the population. Up to now, there is no research reported about the prevalence of
      inhomogeneous ventilation and the factors associated with inhomogeneous ventilation in
      post-neurosurgical patients, in present study, The investigators prospectively enrolled adult
      patients after neurosurgical operations. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an
      noninvasive, radiation-free, high temporal resolution, relatively cheap technique in
      monitoring ventilation distribution bedside. The investigators aimed to investigate the
      incidence of inhomogeneous ventilation and factors associated with inhomogeneous ventilation
      in post-neurosurgical patients under mechanical ventilation.

    <description>In supine position, global image of EIT was divided into upper and lower part, each part accounting for 50%, which was named as non-dependent region and dependent region respectively. Inhomogeneous ventilation was defined as the ratio between tidal impedance variation of dependent region(VTdep) and global tidal impedance variation (VT) is less than 45% during stable Spontaneous breath, which was defined as variation of tidal volume less than 10% in continuous 6 breathes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications(PPCs)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after neurosurgical operative</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pulmonary complication was defined as follows: Pneumonia was defined as recent pulmonary infiltration on chest radiography associated with at least 2 of the following signs: purulent tracheobronchial secretion, a body temperature &gt; 38.3℃，and leukocytes in peripheral blood &gt; 25% above the basal count. Tracheobronchitis was an increase in the volume or a change in the color or purulent aspect of tracheobronchial secretion with a normal chest radiograph. Atelectasis was evidence on chest radiography of pulmonary atelectasis associated with acute respiratory symptoms. Bronchoconstriction was classified as the presence of wheezing associated with acute respiratory symptoms with a good response to inhalatory bronchodilator medication.</description>
