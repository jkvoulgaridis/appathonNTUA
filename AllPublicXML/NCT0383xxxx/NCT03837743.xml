  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study has been designed to determine and compare the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of DUR-928 topical solution with that of the vehicle topical solution when applied
      once daily for approximately four weeks in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Subjects will be
      instructed (randomly assigned) to apply DUR-928 solution to a target lesion on one arm and
      vehicle solution to a target lesion on the opposite arm once daily for up to four weeks.
      Subjects will occlude the treated areas for approximately two hours after each application.

    <time_frame>Up to Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA of the Target Plaques will be determined on a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;Clear - 0&quot; to &quot;Severe - 4.&quot;</description>

    <measure>The change from Baseline as assessed on the Clinical Signs of Psoriasis (plaque elevation, scaling, and erythema)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Each clinical sign (plaque elevation, scaling, erythema) will be graded on a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;Clear - 0&quot; to &quot;Severe - 4.&quot;</description>

    <measure>The change from Baseline as assessed on the Local Psoriasis Severity Index (LPSI)</measure>

    <measure>The change from Baseline as assessed by the Target Plaque Area.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 57</time_frame>

    <description>The Target Plaque Comparison is scored on a 3-point scale: 1A = Target Plaque A is better than Target Plaque B, 0 = Target Plaque A is the same as Target Plaque B, and 1B = Target Plaque A is worse than Target Plaque B.</description>

             birth control. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test (UPT) at Visit 2/Baseline.

          5. Males (or their female partner) must agree to use an effective method of birth control
             throughout the study.

          6. Subject has two similar contralateral Target Plaques.

          7. Subject is willing and able to apply the test article(s) as directed, comply with
             study instructions, and commit to all follow-up visits for the duration of the study.

          8. Subject, in the investigator's opinion, is in good general health and free of any
             disease state or physical condition that might impair evaluation of the plaque
             psoriasis or exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is pregnant, lactating, or is planning to become pregnant during the study.

          2. Subject has spontaneously improving or rapidly deteriorating plaque psoriasis.

             psoriasis.

          4. Subject has psoriasis beyond the two Target Plaques that, in the investigator's
             opinion, could not be reasonably managed with only a bland emollient during the study.

          5. Subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study.

          6. Subject has been previously enrolled in this study and treated with test article.
