  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will generate patient reported outcomes (PROs) associated with the use of
      benralizumab as treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benralizumab was launched in 2018 following regulatory approval in Canada and is now widely
      available for Canadian patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.

      This study is an observational cohort study of patient reported outcomes (PROs) within
      real-world settings for participants who are prescribed benralizumab for treatment of
      uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma. Patients will be recruited in select clinics across
      Canada.

      Survey data for each participant in the study will be obtained at the following time-points:

        -  Baseline (Week 0)

        -  Short-term follow up: 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-weeks after baseline

        -  Long-term follow-up: 24- and 56-weeks after baseline

    <measure>Number of participants with Serious Adverse Events and hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of safety and tolerability through measuring the overall change in number of serious adverse events and hospitalizations.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, Symptoms (AQLQ(S)+12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ(S)+12 is a questionnaire that measures the health-related quality of life experienced by asthma patients.
The questionnaire comprises 4 separate domains (symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli).
Patients are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each of the questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment). The overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions, and is presented as a score from 1 to 7, with lower overall scores indicating increasing impairement.
The 4 individual domain scores (symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli) are the means of the responses to the questions in each of the domains.
Individual AQLQ(s)+12 Total or domain score changes of â‰¥0.5 are considered clinically meaningful.
Data will be presented as a mean score and change from baseline with a measure of dispersion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health care resource utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) will be measured through the overall change in the number of hospitalization visits, visits to the emergency department, and presenteeism/absenteeism from school/work.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQol 5 Dimension, 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
The measurement of the EQ-5D-5L health states, defined by the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system, may be converted into a single index value. The index values, presented in country specific value sets, are a major feature of the EQ-5D instrument, facilitating the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that are used to inform economic evaluations of health care interventions.
Index values are presented on a continuum between 0 and 1, with values approaching 1 indicating increasing quality of life (utility).
Data will be presented as mean score as well as a change from baseline score with a measure of dispersion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM-9 treatment satisfaction questionnaire is a measure of Effectiveness, Side effects, Convenience, and Global Satisfaction. The scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.
Data will be presented as a mean score with a change from baseline calculation including a measure of dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>The self-reported measure Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) reflects a patient's belief about the efficacy of treatment.
PGIC is a 7 point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement.
Patients rate their change as &quot;very much improved,&quot; &quot;much improved,&quot; &quot;minimally improved,&quot; &quot;no change,&quot; &quot;minimally worse,&quot; &quot;much worse,&quot; or &quot;very much worse.&quot;
Data will be presented as a mean score with a change from baseline calculation including a measure of dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>PGI-S is a 1-item questionnaire designed to assess patient's impression of disease severity. The PGI-S item asks the participant to best describe how their asthma symptoms are now (&quot;Check the one number that best describes how your asthma symptoms are now&quot;) on a 4-point scale scored as: &quot;normal&quot; (1), &quot;mild&quot; (2), &quot;moderate&quot; (3), or &quot;severe&quot; (4) .
