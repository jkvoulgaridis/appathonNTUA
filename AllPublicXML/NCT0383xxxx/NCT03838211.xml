  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a tDCS-accompanied intensive cognitive
      training of working memory leads to performance improvement in healthy older individuals.

    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to assess behavioral (primary) and neural effects of a
      multi-session cognitive training combined with transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS). Many studies to date have found tDCS to be an efficient method to enhance various
      cognitive functions by modulating cortical excitability in young adults, but its behavioral
      impact and underlying mechanisms in aging still need to be elucidated. Healthy older adults
      will participate in a three-week cognitive training with concurrent online tDCS application.
      Cognitive performance (primary), as well as structural and functional imaging data will be
      examined before, during and after the intervention. In order to draw conclusions about the
      effect of tDCS in addition to cognitive training, a control group, receiving sham stimulation
      during training, will be assessed. Furthermore, to assess neural correlates of performance
      improvement, functional and structural parameters will be measured with MRI before and after
      training. Follow-up sessions to assess long-term effects are planned four weeks and six
      months after the post assessment. The results of the study will offer valuable insights into
      efficacy of combined tDCS and cognitive training, as compared to training alone, in older
      adults. Moreover, improved understanding of tDCS effects on cognitive training performance
      and underlying neural correlates may help to develop novel approaches for cognitive decline
      in healthy and pathological aging.
