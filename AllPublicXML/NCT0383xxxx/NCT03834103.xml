  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of autonomy among elderly during and after hospitalisation is a well-known problem.
      Patient suffering of sarcopenia (decreasing in muscle mass and function) are more likely not
      to recover their previous autonomy.

      Studies have shown that physical exercise, especially resistance exercises, is the most
      efficient known treatment of sarcopenia. Several institution-based rehabilitation programs
      had been implemented in this purpose.

      On the other hand, some studies have shown that home-based self-rehabilitation can be as
      efficient as institution-based rehabilitation, for example in stroke, cardiac failure and
      COPD rehabilitation.

      The investigators propose to set up a home-based self-rehabilitation program to fight against
      sarcopenia and hence increasing autonomy among elderly. This study aimed to establish the
      feasibility of such a program.

    <description>Participants follow a home-based self-rehabilitation program consisting of the realisation of a set of physical exercises using an elastic band. The exercises have to be performed 3 times a week, and are associated with a protein supplementation.
The rehabilitation follow-up by the physician is planned once a week, by phone, and with face-to-face appointments at inclusion, 6 weeks and 3 months follow-up.</description>
