    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective study was to compare between two different treatment modalities
      of class II division 2; to start treatment in upper arch first until adequate overjet is
      obtained or to start in the lower arch first with removable anterior bite plane in upper
      arch.

      Fifty four subjects with class II division 2 participated in this study. The subjects were
      randomly divided into two groups; Group one (28 patients): orthodontic treatment with upper
      arch bond up first and lower arch was bonded when 4 mm overjet was reached. The treatment
      continued until 0.019 x 0.025 &quot; stainless steel wires were reached in both arches. Group 2
      (26 patients): orthodontic treatment with lower arch bond up first with removable anterior
      bite plane in upper arch. When 0.019 x 0.025&quot; stainless steel wire was reached, the upper
      arch was bonded. The treatment continued until 0.019 x 0.025&quot; stainless steel wires were
      reached. Three cephalograms were taken for each patient in both groups; pretreatment (T0) ,
      after bonding the other arch (T1) and at the end of leveling and alignment in both arches
      (T2). Cephalometric measurements and superimpositions were made. Skeletal and dentoalveolar
      treatment changes were compared within and between the 2 groups.

    <description>Intervention : using fixed orthodontic pre-adjusted edgewise appliance in the upper and lower arches.
starting treatment in the upper arch The upper ach was bonded for 28 patients and teeth alignment was started using round 0.014&quot;NiTi arch wire. The 0.014&quot;NiTi arch wire was placed into the slots of the brackets and tied with elastomers by figure of 8. Orthodontic treatment was continued in the upper arch with arch wire sequence of 0.014&quot;NiTi, 0.018&quot;NiTi, 0.016&quot;X0.022&quot;NiTi, 0.019&quot;X0.025&quot;NiTi, and 0.019&quot;X0.025&quot;stainless steel arch wires. The patients were followed up on a monthly basis until sufficient proclination of the upper incisors achieved to establish an overjet of at least 4 mm. After reaching the full working arch wire in lower arch (0.019&quot; X 0.025&quot;stainless steel wire), lateral cephalogram and study models were taken.</description>

    <description>Intervention : using fixed orthodontic pre-adjusted edgewise appliance in the lower arch and anterior bite plate in the upper arch.
The lower arch was bonded after taking the pretreatment records. At the same appointment an anterior bite plate in the upper arch was delivered to prevent shearing off the mandibular incisor brackets and help in correction of anterior deep bite .After lower arch alignment and leveling in the same arch wire sequence as the other group and 0.019&quot; X 0.025&quot;stainless steel arch wire was reached, the anterior bite plate was removed and the upper arch was bonded. The same arch wire sequence was used in the upper arch as was used in the lower arch. When the full working arch wire (0.019&quot; X 0.025&quot;stainless steel arch wire) was reached in the upper arch, study models and lateral cephalogram were taken.</description>
