  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AML and MDS-EB2 are malignancies of the bone marrow. The standard treatment for these
      diseases is chemotherapy. Patients participating have a special type of this disease because
      the leukemia cells (blasts) have developed an error in the genetic material (DNA). This error
      is called an IDH1 mutation or an IDH2 mutation (a mutation is a change in the DNA), which
      leads to changes in specific substances in the leukemia cells. This trial will investigate
      whether the addition of the new drugs Ivosidenib (for patients with IDH1 mutation) or
      Enasidenib (for patients with IDH2 mutation) to the standard treatment of chemotherapy
      controle the disease more effectively and for a longer period.

    <measure>Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) after CR/CRi</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately up to 60 months following first patient enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>CIR is measured from the date of achievement of CR/CRi until the date of relapse. Patients not known to have relapsed will be censored on the date of last clinical assessment. Patients who died without relapse will be counted as a competing cause of failure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative incidence of death (CID) after CR/CRi</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately up to 60 months following first patient enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>CID is measured from the date of achievement of CR/CRi until the date of death from any cause. Patients not known to have died will be censored on the date they were last known to be alive. Patients who experienced relapse in CR/CRi will be counted as competing cause of failure.</description>

    <measure>EORTC-QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>At entry, 1st day of maintenance, every 3 months during the first year of maintenance, every 6 months during the second year of maintenance until relapse or treatment discontinuation (approximately up to 84 months following first patient enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire that assesses 5 functional subdomains (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning and social functioning), 1 global health status, 3 symptom subdomains (fatigue, nausea and vomiting and pain) and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Estimate the average of the items that contribute to the scale; this is the raw score. a higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning, or a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms.</description>
