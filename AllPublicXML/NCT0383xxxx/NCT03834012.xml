    <textblock>
      This is four arm study. Approximately 480 (120 per group) would need to complete the 6 weeks
      of treatments.

      In order to achieve that number of subjects, approximately 700 subjects will be screened
      randomized into the study.

      A screening visit (Visit 1) will be inclusive of at least the 2-week (14 days) placebo Run-in
      Period during which asthma subjects will wash out their daily inhaled corticosteroid and
      other medications and assessed for compliance. Study treatment period will be for a duration
      of 6 weeks with visits: Visit 2 - Baseline Day 1; Visit 3 Day 21 (± 2 days) and Visit 4 Day
      42 (± 2 days). Rescue Therapy: Short-acting beta agonists, Albuterol 90 μg/actuation

    <description>The primary analysis of change from baseline trough (pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) FEV1 percent predicted (0-6 weeks) will be carried out on the mITT Population using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as an effect, and status of previous steroid use (naïve or prior use) as the covariate. The efficacy endpoint for the primary analysis is the change from baseline trough FEV1%- predicted at week 6.</description>

    <description>Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints and other continuous tertiary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly to that specified for the primary endpoint. After FEV1%-predicted is estimated for all scheduled visits (either as observed or as imputed for missing), AUC0-6 FEV1 percent predicted (0-6 weeks) will be calculated and Satterhwaite t-test will be used to compare the difference on AUC0-6 between treatment groups and placebo.</description>

             race and sex using The global lung function 2012 equations: Report of the Global Lung
             Function Initiative (GLI), following abstinence from short-acting β-agonists for a
             minimum of 6 hours and withholding restricted medications prior to the visits. At
             Visit 2 the baseline FEV1 and the predicted FEV1 value would be the mean of 2 pre-dose

          4. The subject has demonstrated at least 12% reversibility of FEV1 at either the
             screening or baseline visit within 30 minutes after 4 inhalations (total of 360 μg) of
             albuterol (pMDI). [Note: Subjects who fail to demonstrate the required reversibility
             at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) are eligible to enter the Run-in Period and repeat

          6. Currently nonsmoking; had not used tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, pipe
             tobacco) within the past year, and had ≤ 10 pack years of historical use.

        NOTE: At the end of the placebo Run-in period the subject will be stratified into two
        categories:

          -  Corticosteroid naïve subjects (Not have taken inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) at least
             3 months prior to screening or systemic corticosteroids at least 6 months before
             screening)

          -  Prior corticosteroid users Exclusion criteria
