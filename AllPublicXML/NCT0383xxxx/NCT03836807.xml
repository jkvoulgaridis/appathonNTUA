  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective:

      To assess the efficacy of OKITASK® 40 mg granules versus Placebo in patients with acute pain
      syndrome after removal of one molar tooth by comparing AUC0-6h of posttreatment pain profile
      measured by VAS.

      Secondary objectives:

      To assess the following efficacy and safety parameters of OKITASK® 40 mg granules versus
      Placebo in patients with acute pain syndrome after removal of one molar tooth:

        -  Time profile of pain and time profile of pain relief using VAS scales

        -  Time to first perceptible pain relief (TFPR) and time to meaningful pain relief (TMPR)

        -  Proportion of patients requiring rescue medication (analgesia) and time to rescue
           analgesia

        -  Patient's overall assessment

        -  Rate of adverse events (AE)

    <description>Should the patient require rescue medication at any time during 6 hours post-dose, the last VAS measurement and patient's overall assessment will be performed before the rescue medication dosing.

    <measure>Time to rescue analgesia</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>In the event of poor pain control, subjects will be allowed access to rescue medication for analgesia (Paracetamol 500-1000 mg). Time to REMD (rescue) with an alternative analgesic, if it occurred, will be recorded. Subject will be encouraged to postpone the rescue medication until after 1 h post dose. If Paracetamol 500-1000 mg is not effective, the patient will be allowed to take another dose of Paracetamol 500-1000 mg every 6-8 hours; maximum daily dose is 4000 mg.</description>
