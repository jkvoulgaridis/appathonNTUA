      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate whether RockTape has similar efficacy to
      Elastikon in the treatment of foot blisters in ultramarathon runners. Elastikon with paper
      tape and spray adhesive is a well-accepted means of blister treatment and has been used by
      medical staff at over 50 multi-stage ultramarathons around the world. RockTape is another
      commercially available product that has also been used by runners successfully to treat foot
      blisters. RockTape's adhesive qualities have a potential advantage over Elastikon, in that it
      does not require an additional adhesive substituting a level of complexity, weight, and cost
      for foot care. There have been no studies examining the efficacy of either agent for blister
      treatment.

      This randomized controlled trial will compare the traditional method of treating blisters
      with a multi-step approach of percutaneous drainage, paper tape, spray adhesive and then
      Elastikon to percutaneous drainage, paper tape and RockTape.

    <textblock>
      Friction foot blisters are one of the most common injuries encountered by hikers and
      runners(1) with incidence as high as 39% in marathoners(2). In adventure races it is the most
      commonly reported injury(3) and in expedition length ultramarathons, blisters account for
      nearly 74% of medical visits(4). While most blisters are of minor medical significance, they
      can impair concentration, decrease athletic performance, and can be potentially debilitating.

      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate whether RockTape has similar efficacy to
      Elastikon in the treatment of foot blisters in ultramarathon runners. Elastikon with paper
      tape and spray adhesive is a well-accepted means of blister treatment and has been used by

    <time_frame>Data will be collected during the 1 week ultramarathon in austere conditions until study completion, usually 3-5 days. This will be conducted over 3 separate races.</time_frame>
    <description>The subject's involvement in the study will end in one of the following situations and the researcher will fill out the appropriate data sheet at the time of the subject's departure from the study.
The blister treatment is a success as defined by:
the blister treatment falls off and the subject has no pain and no blister reoccurrence
the blister treatment is removed by the subject and does not need to be replaced because the there is no pain or blister present
the blister treatment stays on for the length of the study needing no intervention
The blister treatment is a failure as defined by:
if the blister re-occurs
if the treated area has pain to the point that the blister treatment must be removed to evaluate
if the subject removes the blister treatment and needs to be retreated.
The race has come to completion
The subject withdraws from the race or the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study enrollment period will run for approximately 7 days over 3 weeks throughout
             2019 at Racing the Planet races in Namibia, Mongolia and Chile. All racers are
             potential subjects.

        Subjects will be enrolled when they present to the medical tent for the treatment of their
        first painful blister. The subject will be evaluated for exclusion criteria and the subject
        will be asked to select the most painful blister to be included in the study. All other
        blisters may be treated through traditional means and are not included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Blister exclusion criteria:

               1. Toe blisters will be excluded because they are treated with paper tape only to
                  avoid friction against neighboring toes and further blister formation.

               2. Only intact blisters are included in this study as de-roofed blisters are treated
                  differently.

               3. Hemorrhagic blisters are excluded as they are often not amenable to percutaneous
                  drainage given the increased risk in infection.

        If the most painful blister is a toe blister or a hemorrhagic blister, then the second most
        painful blister will be selected. If there is no second blister, the subject cannot be
        enrolled at this time.
