  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NGLY1 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by: global developmental
      delay and/or intellectual disability, hypo- or alacrima, transient elevation of
      transaminases, and a hyperkinetic movement disorder. Significant phenotypic variability has
      been observed in the small number of affected individuals described in the medical
      literature.

      The purpose of this study is to describe the natural history of NGLY1 deficiency in a
      prospective, detailed, and highly uniform manner. Study participants will be closely
      monitored over the course of five years in order to:

        -  understand the clinical spectrum and progression of NGLY1 deficiency using standardized
           clinical and neurodevelopmental assessments

        -  identify clinical and biomarker endpoints for use in therapeutic trials, and

        -  identify genotype-phenotype correlations

      Close clinical follow-up will allow for generation of a rich dataset and detailed
      understanding of the natural history of NGLY1 deficiency.
