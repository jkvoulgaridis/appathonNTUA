    <textblock>
      The innovative drug XC221 is planned for use in treatment of acute respiratory viral
      infections in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, comparative multicenter study
      assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of XC221 at a dose of 200 mg per day in
      patients with uncomplicated influenza or other acute respiratory viral infections during the
      3-days treatment.

      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, comparative multicenter study in two groups.
      A total of 120 patients with uncomplicated influenza or other acute respiratory viral
      infections are planned to be randomized. Patients will be randomized into 2 groups: 60
      patients in the treatment group 200 mg XC221 and 60 patients in the placebo group. The
      purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the drug
      XC21 in treatment of influenza or other acute respiratory viral infections. The primary
      objective is to demonstrate the difference between the groups in the time of the onset of
      sustained improvement in clinical symptoms according to the Modified Jackson Scale. The study
      will consist of the following periods: screening (duration not more than 36 hours from the
      moment of the first symptoms of the disease), treatment period (3 days), follow-up period (11
      ± 1 days after completion of treatment with the study drug/placebo). The duration of
      participation in the study for each patient is no more than 16 days and 12 hours.
