  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the accuracy of a novel urine test for diagnosing urinary tract
      infections in acutely ill children presenting to ambulatory care. The accuracy of this novel
      test will be compared to the accuracy of conventional dipstick testing. In addition, the
      evidence on urine tests will be added to the existing algorithm for diagnosing serious
      infections in children. Finally, the study aims to describe the relation between the CRP
      level at study entry and the duration of symptoms and final diagnosis over the following 30
      days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design is a cross-sectional cohort study with a nested longitudinal follow-up in acutely
      children presenting to ambulatory care.

      The cross-sectional cohort study will compare an innovative urine test with conventional
      dipstick testing to establish their relative accuracy to diagnose urinary tract infections,
      and construct an algorithm consisting of clinical features, urine test results and CRP
      point-of-care testing to identify serious infections. The longitudinal follow-up study will
      describe illness trajectories of children with an intermediate CRP test result (5-80 mg/L) at
      first contact.

      The study will run in general practices and community paediatrics in Flanders. Recruitment to
      the study is expected to last 18 months, with each patient entering the study only once.
      Children and their parents/guardians will be approached for possible participation in the
      study by practice staff. There is only one study visit.

      Those who agree to participation via written informed consent will have demographics and
      clinical features recorded. All children will be asked to provide a urine sample on study
      entry. Subsequently, CRP point-of-care testing will be conducted in all children testing
      positive on a clinical prediction rule, and in a random sample of children testing negative
      on that rule. Follow-up information for all children will be collected using general practice
      notes, hospital records and direct patient/parent contact.

      Treatment and other management decisions will be left to the treating physicians' discretion.
