  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to determine whether the entire intervention (Mindfulness
      meditation, AF education, and weekly phone visits) that is nurse delivered to individuals
      with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is more effective than a combination, single or no
      intervention in the reduction of overall AF symptoms, anxiety, and negative illness
      perception; or the improvement of quality of life (QOL) and functional status.

    <description>Atrial Fibrillation Burden and Symptom Severity will be calculated from the patient-completed responses on the Atrial Fibrillation Symptom Severity Scale-Symptom Burden can range from 3.25 (minimally bothersome) to 30 (continuous symptomatic episodes) and is based on event frequency (1-10), duration (1.25-10), and global episode (1-10). Symptom severity is based on symptom specific subscale with range from 0(no symptoms) to 35 (severe symptoms).</description>
