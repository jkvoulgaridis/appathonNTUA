  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research Hypothesis Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in France
      and in western countries, accounting for more than 1.8 million new cases and 1.5 million
      deaths worldwide in 2012. Recent advances in the management of patients with Non-small Cell
      Lung Cancer Patients (NSCLC) include the use of therapies targeting oncogenes but a molecular
      alteration is currently found in only the half of the non-squamous NSCLC . More recently,
      immune check point inhibitors (ICI), firstly targeting PD-(L)1, became available and
      demonstrate an overall survival advantage over standard second-line chemotherapy both in
      squamous and non-squamous NSCLC. Unfortunately, this global overall survival benefit is
      driven by approximately 20% of the patient's population while a large majority of patients is
      in fact progressing in the first weeks of treatment.

      In the context of personalized medicine, innovative immunotherapy strategies in oncology are
      based on the principle of immune-contexture and require:

        -  The identification of biomarkers for assessing the specific immune-contexture of each
           patient (microenvironment, tumors and effector cells)

        -  The development of new treatments targeting their appropriate effector cells in
           monotherapy or combination treatments.

      The current PIONEER-Clinical study is aimed at assessing how to overcome resistance to ICIs
      monotherapies with experimental precision immunotherapies combined to Durvalumab in 3rd or
      4th line, in advanced NSCLC progressors patients after up to 18 w. of anti PD (L) 1.

      Some supplementary blood and tissue samples are aimed at identification of personalized
      patients' biomarkers, correlation of them with the efficacy endpoints, in order to better
      understand mechanisms of resistance and improve their future treatment.

      Study Design:

      During a mandatory post treatment 28-day wash-out period, 135 advanced NSCLC patients with
      progressive disease evaluated between 6 and 18w. of a second or third line ICI monotherapy;
      will undergo a screening visit. After signing an informed written consent, if they are found
      eligible, their participation in the study will ensue.

      Treatment allocation will be performed using the randomization module of the eCRF, :

        -  Arm A: combination of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) + Monalizumab (IPH2201), to target a PD-L1
           co-inhibitory pathway

        -  Arm B: combination of Durvalumab + oleclumab (MEDI9447), to target limitations of
           antitumor T-cell immunity caused by adenosine receptor signaling

        -  Arm C: combination of Durvalumab + AZD6738, to potentially enhance anti- tumour T-cell
           responses

        -  Arm D: a standard third or forth-line chemotherapy maintenance (Docetaxel).

      A maximum of 120 patients will be randomized, with 30 patients per arm (4 arms).

             such products may be administered with caution and the reason for use documented in
             the CRF. Please see Appendix E, for further details.

          -  Patients with relative hypotension (&lt;90/60 mmHg) or clinically relevant orthostatic
             hypotension, including a fall in blood pressure of &gt;20 mmHg at screening.

          -  Any of the following cardiac criteria currently or within the last 6 months (by New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) ≥ Class 2 where applicable)

               1. Patients at risk of brain perfusion problems, e.g., medical history of carotid
                  stenosis or pre-syncopal or syncopal episodes, history of TIAs

               2. Uncontrolled hypertension (grade 2 or above) requiring clinical intervention

                  Fredericia formula

               4. Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication e.g. complete
                  left bundle branch block, third degree heart block

               5. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, immediate family
