      The trial was completed by Shaanxi Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and
      Northwest Women and Children's Hospital. Thirty-five patients with POR who underwent ART
      (Assisted Reproductive) treatment were observed in each center. Patients in the experimental
      group were given acupuncture treatment for 12 weeks prior to COH. If the patient has a good
      COH timing during acupuncture treatment, she will enter the COH cycle at any time. Patients
      in the control group waited for 12 weeks before COH. In this study, the COH regimen of the
      two groups of patients was the same, and the appropriate ovulation induction protocol was
      selected by the investigator according to the B-ultrasound and endocrine conditions of the
      patient's menstrual day 1-3. At the end of treatment, patients were observed for the number
      of eggs in the COH cycle, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, available embryo rate, high
      quality embryo rate, implantation rate, ovarian reserve function assessment, menstrual status
      and peri-menopausal symptoms.

      1.Acupuncture intervention

        1. test group Patients in the experimental group were given acupuncture treatment for 12
           weeks prior to COH. If the patient has a good COH timing during acupuncture treatment,
           he or she will enter the COH cycle at any time.

           The acupuncture intervention program of the test group is as follows:

           Acupoint group 1: Baihui（DU20）, Zhongwan（RN12）, Tianshu （ST25）(bilateral),
           Guanyuan（RN4）, uterus (bilateral)（EX-CA1）, Dahe（KI12） (bilateral),Zusanli
           （ST36）(bilateral), Sanyinjiao（SP6） (bilateral), Taichong （LR3）(both sides) Acupoint
           group 2： Baihui（DU20）,ShenShu（BL23）、ZhongLiao（BL33）、TaiXi（KI3） Operation: The two-point
           group was used alternately, with the group 1 as the initial treatment. The patient took
           the appropriate position (point group 1 was taken in the supine position, group 2 was
           taken in the prone position), and the local skin of the acupoint was routinely
           disinfected. Baihui, flat thorn 0.5-1.0 inch; Tai Chong, acupuncture 0.5-1.0 inch in the
           direction of Yongquan; Shenshu, Taixi, straight thorn 0.5-1.0 inch; ZhongLiao（BL33） ,
           inward and downward oblique thorn 2.0-2.5 inch, It is required to puncture the hole in
           the second hole; the remaining hole is straight 1.0-1.5 inch. All the acupoints are
           evenly inserted and twisted (the Baihui acupoints only turn around). Each time the
           needle is kept for 20 minutes, once every other day, 3 times a week for a total of 12
           weeks.

        2. Control group Patients in the control group waited for 12 weeks before COH。

      2.Standard IVF/ICSI Process

        1. COH process（In this study, the COH regimen was the same in both groups, and the
           investigator chose the antagonist regimen based on the B-ultrasound and endocrine
           conditions on the 1-3 day of menstruation.） 1）Gn start time: Menstruation Day3 days,
           B-ultrasound and hormone levels (FSH/LH/E2/P/β-HCG) suggest that the ovary is in a basal
           state; 2）Gn starting dose: 75~300 IU; 3）Gn dose adjustment: 5 days after administration,
           according to ovarian response (B-ultrasound and E2 levels) Whole Gn dose, hMG (Hemeiqi)
           can be added if necessary; 1 ovarian response is monitored every 1~2 days thereafter
           (B-ultrasound and E2 level), adjust the amount of Gn accordingly。 4）When the antagonist
           is added: when the dominant follicle is ≥12mm, add antagonist (Eugly) 250ug/d to HCG day
           (including HCG day); 5）HCG trigger timing and dose: at least 3 follicles ≥ 18mm, given
           HCG4000~8000IUim.

        2. Eggs taken 36 hours after intramuscular injection of HCG:

        3. In vitro fertilization, embryo culture:In vitro fertilization was performed 4 to 6 hours
           after egg retrieval, and Day 3 embryos were scored according to the general standards of
           each center.The two embryos with the highest score were labeled as the embryos of the
           first embryo transfer. The remaining embryos are often Freeze on Day3, Day5 or Day6.

        4. Embryo transfer and corpus luteum support：On Day 3, the patient maintained bladder
           filling and transplanted 2 of the best quality under the guidance of transabdominal
           B-ultrasound.Embryo; or on day 5, under the guidance of transabdominal B-ultrasound,
           transplant 1-2 blastocysts; continue to gestrinone 20mg Bid po supports the corpus
           luteum.

        5. Pregnancy test： 1）Determination of blood βHCG levels 14 days after ET or Cryopreserved
           embryo transfer (CET) to determine biochemical pregnancy; 2）If determined to be
           pregnant, continue corpus luteum support。 3）35 days after ET, determine the clinical
           pregnancy by transvaginal B-ultrasound, record the number of gestational sacs, location,
           large Small, the presence or absence of fetal buds, the presence or absence of fetal
           heart, other abnormal conditions.
