  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan an R33 phase trial in which 120 persons with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) will be
      randomized (using a 1:1 ratio) to education alone (Ed) on following a carbohydrate restricted
      diet for T2DM, or this same education content with added mindful eating/Mindfulness-Based
      Intervention components (Ed+MBI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will randomize 120 persons with T2DM in a 1:1 ratio to a nutrition education alone arm (Ed
      n=60) vs. a nutrition education with mindfulness-based intervention components (Ed+MBI n=60)
      arm and follow them for 12 months. The interventions will be provided in a weekly group
      setting, with about 10 to 12 persons per group. Some educational intervention components will
      be delivered using a smartphone app. After the 12-week initial intervention, we will
      re-randomize participants using an adaptive intervention design to receive low, medium, or
      high intensity maintenance training, depending on level of adherence achieved during the
      initial intervention period. Follow-up assessments will be performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months. We will address the following specific aims:

        1. Test the hypothesis that the Ed+MBI arm will have better dietary adherence than the Ed
           arm.

        2. Test whether our proposed behavioral mechanisms (e.g. decreased eating in response to
           cravings or difficult emotions) predict dietary adherence.

        3. Compare randomized arms in the adaptive maintenance intervention design to optimize
           maintenance phase dosing in future trials.

        4. Obtain preliminary assessment of intervention effects on clinical outcomes

      This is the second phase of a two-phase study. Pilot testing has been completed in the first
      phase (R61). The second phase (R33) will include employing an adaptive intervention design in
      the post-treatment phase to test optimization of the maintenance intervention (i.e. assigning
      maintenance intensity/dose based on how a participant is doing). We will use fingerstick
      blood ketone measures, which provide an objective measure of whether the target levels of
      carbohydrate restriction have been attained, as our primary adherence outcome measure. This
      will be supplemented by 24-hour diet recall measures of carbohydrate consumption. Important
      secondary outcome measures will include clinical measures such as glycosylated hemoglobin and
      behavioral measures such as frequency of eating in response to food cravings.

    <description>All participants will receive instruction in the Carbohydrate-Restricted (CR) diet and basic behavioral strategies in weekly, in-person, group sessions for 3 months. The study diet has approximately 10% of kcal coming from carbohydrate, typically 50 grams/day or fewer, not including fiber. Participants will be encouraged to eat a normal amount of protein, typically about 80-100 grams/day (about 20-25% of calories), and the rest of their calories from fat.</description>

    <description>In addition to the diet components described above, participants randomized to the Education + Mindfulness (Ed+MBI) group will receive MBI components using the Eat Right Now (ERN) platform. This will consist of two integrated components: 1) use of the ERN app at home, during the week, to learn and practice mindfulness skills for food-cravings and eating, and 2) in-person group-based discussions of how the mindful eating practices are going, trouble-shooting obstacles/pain points, and doing group exercises and reflecting on them.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. History of T2DM mellitus.

          2. HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and &lt; 12.0% at screening.

          3. Experience food-related cravings most days of the week and eat in response to these
             cravings regularly.

          4. Aged 18 years old and older.

          5. Able to engage in light physical activity.

          6. Willing and able to participate in the interventions including appropriate
             participation in the group setting.

          7. Have smartphone and are willing to use it on a regular basis for data collection.

          8. Ability to speak English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to provide informed consent.

          2. A substance abuse, mental health, or medical condition that, in the opinion of
             investigators, will make it difficult for the potential participant to participate in
             the intervention, that may need immediate changes in medical management that will
             affect study outcome measures, or that may require important adaptations in the study
             diet.

          3. Pregnant or planning to get pregnant in the next 12 months, breastfeeding or less than
             6 months post-partum.

          4. Current use of weight loss medications, such as Alli or amphetamine-based drugs that
             may affect weight.

          5. Planned or history of weight-loss (bariatric) surgery, or other intestinal surgeries
             that cause malabsorption. These are likely to change study outcome measures, making it
             difficult to distinguish the effects of the intervention program, or require extensive
             tailoring of the diet intervention.

          6. Currently enrolled in a weight loss program, such as Weight Watchers or a self-help
             group such as Overeaters Anonymous, or have unalterable plans to enroll in one of
             these programs in the next year; using a ketogenic low carbohydrate diet in the past 6
             months with advice from a health care professional; or use of a mindful eating program
             with guidance from a professional in the past 6 months or have ever used the study
             mindful-eating app.

          7. Vegan or vegetarian.

          8. Unwilling to do regular blood testing at home for glucose or ketone monitoring.
