  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decision making about whether to have breast reconstruction after mastectomy can be
      difficult, and previous studies have found that many women are not well informed about their
      options. Patient decision aids can improve decision quality for a variety of health
      conditions. This pilot randomized study seeks to determine how a patient decision aid about
      breast reconstruction affects the quality of decisions about reconstruction including patient
      knowledge, concordance between preferences and treatment, and decisional regret.

      Enrolled participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 arms; participants may receive a breast
      reconstruction decision aid or an educational website on healthy living with breast cancer.

      Participants will complete up to three surveys; a baseline survey before viewing the decision
      aid or website, a second survey immediately after viewing the decision aid or website, and a
      third survey six months after surgery. Tablets will be made available to participants at the
      study site through which they can complete the surveys and view the decision aid or website.
      Participants will have the options of viewing the decision aid or website outside of the
      study site, and completing the three surveys electronically or on paper.

      The baseline survey and second survey will each take approximately 45 minutes for
      participants to complete. The third survey will take approximately 30 minutes for
      participants to complete.
