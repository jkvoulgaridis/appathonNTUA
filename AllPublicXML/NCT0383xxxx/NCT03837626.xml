  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether treatment with the ENaC inhibitor, amiloride, improves endothelial
      function and arterial stiffness in obese insulin resistant subjects in a randomized
      placebo-controlled trial examining pre and postmenopausal women and age-matched men.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight/obese males, pre- and post-menopausal females with insulin resistance, 30-70 years
      of age will be recruited. Following screening, eligible men and women will be randomly
      assigned to either amiloride (max dose 5mg) or placebo in a double-blinded design manner.

      After randomization, subjects will be scheduled for an outpatient visit to the undergo
      baseline assessment of arterial stiffness (carotid femoral pulse wave velocity - cfPWV) and
      endothelial function (brachial popliteal artery flow mediated dilation). Subject assessment
      will be repeated at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months (interim) and 6 months (final)</time_frame>
    <description>It is the gold standard non-invasive index of arterial stiffness. Transit time between carotid and femoral pressure waves is calculated using the foot-to-foot method. cfPWV is calculated as distance traveled by the pulse wave (i.e., femoral location-sternal notch minus sternal notch-carotid location) divided by pulse transit time. All the measurements will be done by the same blinded technician.The goal is to assess changes from baseline when compared to interim and final time point.</description>

    <measure>Brachial artery flow mediated dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months (interim) and 6 months (final)</time_frame>
    <description>The goal is to assess changes from baseline when compared to interim and final time point. ] Brachial artery FMD will be assessed at baseline and at 12-wk. FMD is a measurement of conduit artery endothelial function. FMD is assessed immediately after each PWV measurement. Shear rate AUC until peak diameter is calculated as stimulus for FMD and used in covariate analysis as described. All measurements will be performed, under co-I supervision by the same blinded technician.</description>
