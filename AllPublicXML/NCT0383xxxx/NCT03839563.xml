  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of conventional exercise, tai chi chuan and health education/usual physical
      activity over a 6-month intervention period in improving primary outcomes and secondary
      outcomes in older mild cognitive impairment adults will be compared. Third, whether changes
      in serum levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor
      (IGF)-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and expression of the apolipoprotein E
      (APOE) Îµ4 allele parallel changes in gait characteristics and cognitive functions after the
      intervention will be examined.
