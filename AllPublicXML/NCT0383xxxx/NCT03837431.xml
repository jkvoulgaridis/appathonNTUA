  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The performance of the CL Detect Rapid test will be tested in individuals with suspected
      cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ethiopia using both skin slit and dental broach samples against a
      combined reference of microscopy and PCR. Alternative sampling methods will also be
      evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Leishmaniasis is common in Ethiopia and mainly affects the poor living in rural
      areas. Diagnosis of CL routinely uses invasive skin slits which are examined with microscopy,
      requiring trained staff and an equipped lab. A new rapid diagnostic test for CL which may be
      used in the field has been developed and validated in several countries where other
      Leishmania species are present. Less invasive tape sampling has also become available.
      Whether this new RDT and alternative sampling methods can be used in Ethiopia is unclear.

      The performance of the CL detect Rapid Test against a combined reference (microscopy and PCR)
      and alternative sample collection methods will be tested in CL suspected individuals in
      North-West Ethiopia in a cross-sectional study.

      Skin samples will be stored (skin slit smear, dental broach sample, tape sample) for a period
      of one year after the end of the study for quality assurance testing. If patients consented
      to long-term storage and secondary use of their samples, the skin samples will be stored for
      a period up to 25 years.

        Patients presenting at the LRTC with clinically suspected CL during the study period will
        be screened for eligibility. Suspicion for CL is assessed by physicians as per routine
        care. In general, children are included in the study population since they are commonly
        affected, and also make up the majority of DCL patients. Very young children below the age
        of two are excluded as was done in other studies18 since the study does require more
        potentially painful procedures as compared to the routine diagnostic procedures.
