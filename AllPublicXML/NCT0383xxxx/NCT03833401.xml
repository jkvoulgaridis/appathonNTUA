    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop new improved therapy for teeth that require root
      canals due to tooth infection or tooth inflammation. Investigators will recruit total of 50
      participants from the age group 7 - 50 at the UCLA School of Dentistry Endodontic clinic. The
      participants will be divided into two groups, one will receive traditional therapy, which may
      include root canal or a procedure called &quot;revascularization,&quot; which is a procedure trying to
      regrow the tissue inside the tooth. The other group of participants will receive the test
      treatment, which will involve harvesting of pulp tissues from the same tooth or other teeth
      that are planned for extraction. Investigators will prepare these tissues and place the
      tissues back into the cleaned root canal space with induced bleeding to allow regrowth of the
      tissue. For all participants, investigators will follow up after 6, 12, and 24 months in a
      shorter appointment, which may involve taking x-ray and clinical exam.

      The goal of the study is to test whether autologous pulpal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is
      capable of de novo regeneration of pulp-dentin complex and restoration of normal pulp
      physiology in teeth with necrotic or inflamed pulp. This is a highly novel study that will
      bring the regenerative endodontic approaches to the next level. Furthermore,
      revascularization approaches, as delivered in today's endodontic offices, present several
      challenges, including lack of de novo pulp-dentin regeneration, and frequent occurrence of
      intracanal calcification. These findings attest to the limitation of revascularization as a
      regenerative endodontic procedure (REP) and necessitates advent of novel approach for
      functional restoration of dental pulp. The ultimate objective of the current study is to
      develop a new REP that allows for de novo regeneration of functional dental pulp, which can
      be readily performed in a chair-side manner.

    <measure>Changes in radiographic assessment for periapical inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will test the effect of treatment in either Arm on resolving periapical inflammation, which will be assessed by radiographic imaging and clinical examination. Healing of periapical inflammatory lesion will be measured by radiographic imaging to note changes in the size of pre-existing radiograph periapical lesions after the treatment.</description>

    <measure>Changes in pulpal sensibility to temperature and electric current</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will test whether the treatment in either Arm will allow revitalization of pulp tissues, by means of thermal and electrical testing of pulp vitality.</description>

    <measure>Changes in root dentin thickness of root canals</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will assess changes in root dentin thickness after treatment in either arm. We will also determine if the apical opening (foramen) will close in cases that initially present with open apices. This assessment will be based on radiographic imaging.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in root length</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will assess changes in root length after treatment in either arm. This assessment will be based on radiographic imaging.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of root canal calcification in teeth treated by revascularization with or without tissue transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will assess the degree of root canal calcification in teeth treated in either Arm by radiographic imaging. Degree of calcification will be measured by means of different levels of radio-opacity in routine dental X rays.</description>
