  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open, randomized, pilot clinical trial which aims the assessment of quality of
      life (QOL) in epilepsy outpatients equipped with a wrist-worn biosensor that provides
      measures of electrodermal activity and accelerometry. These measures are used to
      automatically detect epileptic seizures that are transmitted to a mobile phone-based system
      for alerts and recording.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The mean change from Baseline of the total score, of the french version of the Quality of life Epilepsy inventory-31</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>The change between the QOLIE-31 questionnaire total score measured at the first and the final visit will serve as primary endpoint. The possible range of each scale's final score is from 0 to 100. higher scores reflect better quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The mean change from Baseline of the total scores of seven Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 subscales covering the following epilepsy-specific domains:</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Epilepsy-specific domains are: seizure worry, overall QOL, emotional well being, energy/fatigue subscales, medication effects, work-driving-social limits, cognitive function subscales. The possible range of each scale's final score is from 0 to 100. Higher scores reflect better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The usability total score of Embrace and Mate apps</measure>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The experimental group will make use of the Alert app that sends alarms to patients mobile devices, and if desired to the mobile devices of their caregivers. This group will also use the Mate app which is used as a seizure diary</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group will only use the Mate app and not the Alert app. This group will thus not receive any notification, from the device, and will be unaware, of the devices performance</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Embrace with Alert and Mate apps</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will wear the device on their wrist as often as possible during the day and night. The Embrace Watch contains sensors and memory recordings of electrodermal activity, temperature and physical activity from the wearer. This group will receive notifications on the mobile phone when seizure takes place. Quality of life questionnaires will be filled by the patients at the first follow-up and final assessments.</description>

    <description>Patients will wear the device on their wrist as often as possible during the day and night. This group will just use the Mate app that summarizes Embrace Watch data for the owner and captures contextual information around events.This group will not receive any alert notification on the mobile phone when a seizure takes place.</description>
