  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NeuroCatch Platform™, an investigational medical device system developed by NeuroCatch
      Inc., consists of software and hardware that captures brain health information. The platform
      intends to provide a quick, portable and easy to use solution for the acquisition, display,
      analysis, storage, reporting and management of electroencephalograph (EEG) and event-related
      potential (ERP; brain response to a stimulus) information.

      The purpose of the study is to understand how the brain responds to sounds and words, and how
      this response varies between individuals of different age groups. Interindividual variation
      reflects the many different factors which cause results to vary from one individual to
      another within a population. The current clinical study aims to establish a reference
      interval database of ERPs. These reference intervals will characterize the expected range of
      interindividual variability between groups. Reference interval databases provide a tool for
      comparing the results from one individual with those from other members of the same age
      group.
