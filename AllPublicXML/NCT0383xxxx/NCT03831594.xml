  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is evaluating the effect of combining Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) with
      standard Physiotherapy treatment in patients admitted to a neurological rehabilitation unit
      with Pusher syndrome (PS). Patients will be randomised to receive standard Physiotherapy
      treatment or standard treatment with GVS.

      Perceived verticality data will also be collected and analysed on age-matched controls. This
      data will be used to compare these results with the patients with PS.

      The investigators hypothesis that GVS and standard Physiotherapy treatment will lead to a
      greater improvement in functional ability and awareness of perceived verticality compared to
      standard Physiotherapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pusher syndrome (PS) can be described as disordered balance and orientation which causes
      patients to perceive they are in an upright position when in fact they are positioned towards
      their affected side. These patients use their unaffected limbs to 'push' themselves away from
      their unaffected side in an attempt to correct their perceived postural alignment. PS is a
      common disorder and can affect 16% of stroke patients.

      Patients with PS have shown to take longer to improve in rehabilitation than non-PS patients
      and tend to stay in hospital for longer.

      Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) involves passing a small electrical current behind the
      ear to stimulate the vestibular system to in-turn cause the head and body to move.

    <description>This is made up of 3 components: 1.The symmetry of spontaneous body posture (rated with 0, 0.25, 0.75, or 1 point. 1 = severe tilt, 0 = no tilt), 2. The use of non-paretic extremities (0, 0.5, or 1 point. 1 = performed spontaneously at rest), 3. The resistance to passive correction of the tilted posture (0 or 1 point. 1 = resistance occurs). For a diagnosis of Pusher Syndrome all 3 components need to be present.</description>

    <measure>The Burke Lateropulsion Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, end of week 1 and end of week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Test of pushing. The score for each component is rated on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 to 4 for standing) and the score is based on the severity of resistance or the tilt angle when the patient begins to resist the passive movement. The score for diagnosis of Pusher behaviour is ≥2 points</description>

    <description>The Catherine Bergego Scale is a standardized checklist (10 everyday tasks) to detect presence and degree of neglect during observation of everyday life situations. The scale also provides a measure of neglect self-awareness (anosognosia).4 point rating scale indicating severity of neglect (0 = no neglect, 3 = severe neglect).</description>

    <description>18-item of physical, psychological and social function.The tool is used to assess a patient's level of disability as well as change in patient status in response to rehabilitation or medical intervention. Each item is scored on a 7 point ordinal scale, ranging from a score of 1 to a score of 7. The higher the score, the more independent the patient is in performing the task associated with that item.</description>
