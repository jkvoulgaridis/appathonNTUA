  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of older persons use of a personal sleep
      monitoring device(PSMD)to improve self-management of sleep. Disrupted sleep occurs in up to
      50% of persons over the age of 65 with chronic health conditions. Impaired sleep negatively
      influences subjective and objective health outcomes.To improve their sleep, older adults with
      chronic health conditions could benefit from objective information, available through
      personal health monitoring devices, about their current and changing sleep patterns. Based on
      this information, sleep self-management interventions can be individualized and shared, and
      associations between sleep and health changes may be better managed.
