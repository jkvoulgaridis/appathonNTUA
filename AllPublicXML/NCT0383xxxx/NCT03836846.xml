  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate the association between social media use and depression in adolescents
      admitted to a psychiatric unit and continue to follow their progress after discharge in
      outpatient clinic services. We expect improvement in their depressive symptoms by modifying
      social media use and adding a mental health app to further encourage the positive effects of
      social media.

    <description>Compare presence and severity of depressive symptoms in treatment as usual (TAU) group with TAU and the mobile app intervention group. The presence and severity of depression will be determined using the PHQ9-A (Patient Health Questionnaire, adolescent version), a 9-question depression scale that is based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria of depression and modified for teens to further inquire about other aspects of depression such as dysthymia, suicide risk, and other mental illnesses. The PHQ-9A scores each of the DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Total depression severity score ranges of 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe.</description>
