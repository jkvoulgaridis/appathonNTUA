  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caring with older people in west societies has becoming a challenge for all health
      professional and any measure that can increase health or well-being will be ultimately
      improve quality of life and life expectancy. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome describing
      physical and functional decline that occurs as a consequence of certain diseases (e.g.,
      cancer, chronic infection, etc.) but also even without disease. Frailty is characterized by
      an increased risk for poor outcomes such as incident falls, fractures, disability,
      comorbidity, health care expenditure and premature mortality. The aetiology of frailty is not
      well understood but it has been associated with changes in several physiologic systems,
      including inflammation, metabolic and micronutrients deficits.

      The investigators wish to test with a confident perspective that any measured that improve
      the efficiency of muscular system can prevent the progression of frailty syndrome and that
      can have many others effects since it has been consistently demonstrated that a proper
      muscular function in aging is associated with other signs and symptoms. Looking at the
      literature, there are two clinical trials that evaluated the effect of leucine
      supplementation in older individuals with beneficial effects. The investigators wish to
      replicate those findings and to extend the analysis of the effect afforded by leucine
      supplementation in sarcopenia, frailty and cognitive function in individuals living in
      nursing homes in Valencia and province. This trial will show the eventual effects of leucine
      supplementation in elderly people may be also useful to afford some beneficial effects
      (sleep, cognitive function, depressed mood, balance and gait, etc) by modulating the function
      of muscular and metabolic system and in reduce the progression of sarcopenia and loss of
      muscular function.

    <masking_description>Administration of Leucine or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) will be done twice/day in the morning and in the afternoon for 13 weeks measuring spoon of placebo. Both products will be delivered in white jars, without label, and will carry the patient number on the outside. Randomization of numbers to either placebo or verum product will take place by Bonusan and will be revealed to the researchers at the end of final phase.
The administration of prebiotics or placebo will last 13 weeks except for appearance of side-effects related to the study. The side-effects will be recorded and consulted with Bonusan Research Staff.
The researcher enrolled in the geriatric, psychological or analytical measurements will be blind to the drug treatment.
After finishing the study period, the study the Director of the Research group (Dr. Omar Cauli) will ask Bonusan to reveal who participants received Leucine and those who received placebo.</masking_description>
