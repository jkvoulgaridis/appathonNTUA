  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of PROSPER-B is to study effectiveness of EMDR compared to integrated DBT-EMDR in
      treatment-seeking, adult patients with comorbid PTSD and Borderline Personality Disorder
      (BPD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly comorbid with personality disorders (PD),
      mainly borderline (BPD) and cluster C personality disorders (CPD). It is not clear yet what
      treatment is most effective for those who suffer both PTSD and PD. There is growing
      preference in clinicians for evidence-based PTSD treatments, such as Eye Movement
      Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) or Imagination and Rescripting (ImRs), because these
      treatments are relative short, and there is some evidence that comorbid PD symptoms might
      resolve as well. However, at least 30-44% PTSD patients do not sufficiently respond to PTSD
      treatments or are excluded because of suicidality or self-harm. PD treatments are more
      intensive than PTSD treatments, e.g. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Schema-Focused
      Therapy (SFT) . There is some evidence that integrated PTSD-PD treatment is twice as
      effective than PD treatment alone, but integrated PTSD-PD treatment is not yet directly
      compared to PTSD treatment alone. This study will address this knowledge gap, including
      secondary outcome measures on functioning, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.

      For patients with comorbid PTSD and BPD, EMDR-only will be compared to integrated EMDR-DGT
      (PROSPER-B).

      Psychological (cognitive, affective, and relational) and neurobiological candidate predictors
      and mediators of treatment outcome will be investigated through a machine-learning paradigm,
      in order to develop a clinically useful and individual prediction instrument of treatment
      outcome. Example predictors and mediators are educational level , working memory, hyper- and
      hypo-arousal , therapeutic alliance and social support, resting state fMRI, an emotional face
      task fMRI , cortisol levels from hair samples and (epi)genetic markers. For the
      neurobiological prediction, a subgroup of patients will undergo MRI scans, as will healthy
      controls as control subjects.

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized controlled trial comparing PTSD-treatment (EMDR) to integrated PTSD-PD-treatment (DBT-EMDR) in patients with PTSD and comorbid BPD.
The PTSD treatment (EMDR) specifically address the troubling memories of the traumatic event and the personal meaning of the event and consist of 12 to 18 sessions in a maximum period of 6 months. Integrated PTSD-PD-treatment consist of a PTSD treatment (EMDR) interwoven in a PD treatment (DBT) that takes at least one group- session per week, and one individual coaching session every two weeks, for the duration of one year.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>CAPS-5 (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is a structured diagnostic interview to assess the frequency and severity of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. The interview consists of 30 items, with higher scores indicating more severy symptomatology. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Similarly, CAPS-5 symptom cluster severity scores are calculated by summing the individual item severity scores for symptoms corresponding to a given DSM-5 cluster: Criterion B (items 1-5); Criterion C (items 6-7); Criterion D (items 8-14); and, Criterion E (items 15-20). A symptom cluster score may also be calculated for dissociation by summing items 19 and 20. To meet the criteria for PTSD diagnoses, at least one Criterion B and one Criterion C symptom, and two criterion D and E symptoms are required. Furthermore, Criterion F and G should be met.</description>

The responses on each item range from no difficulty (1) to extreme difficulty (5). Responses to the six dimensions are weighted and summed to create a total score between 0 (no disability) and 100 (complete disability).</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is a 41-item self-report measure to assess clinically relevant difficulties in emotion regulation. DERS items reflect difficulties within four dimensions of emotion regulation: awareness and understanding of emotions, acceptance of emotions, the ability to engage in goal-directed behaviour and to refrain from impulsive behaviour, and access to effective emotion regulation strategies. Items are scored on a five-point scale, ranging from almost never (1) to almost always (5). Although the Dutch version of DERS (DERS-NL) has not been validated yet, the original DERS showed high internal consistency, good test-retest reliability and adequate construct and predictive validity (Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004).</description>
