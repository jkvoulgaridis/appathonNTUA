    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of denosumab in smoldering multiple
      myeloma subjects as well to see if denosumab can reduce subjects' risk of getting multiple
      myeloma.

      This is an open label, Phase II trial of denosumab 120mg subcutaneous (SC) for patients with
      smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Subjects will be recruited from the James P. Wilmot Cancer
      Center, University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. Patients seen in the inpatient or
      outpatient setting with histologically confirmed SMM will be evaluated for this study.

      20 patients will be treated as follows: Denosumab: day 1 = 120mg SC every 4 weeks for 12
      cycles. Cycles will be 28 days in length. Patients will be followed after completion of the
      study per standard of care for progression free survival for an additional 2 years after the
      last dose of denosumab. All patients will take daily vitamin D and calcium supplements of at
      least 1200mg elemental calcium and 800IU of vitamin D unless documented hypercalcemia
      develops on study. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy
      with denosumab. Serum vitamin D levels will be checked during screening and should be
      repleted to a total 25-hydroxyvitamin D level ≥30ng/mL.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has confirmed SMM according to the definition of the International Myeloma
             Working Group (IMWG) definition: serum M-protein ≥3 g/dL or BMPC &gt;10% but less than
             60%, or both, along with normal organ and marrow function (CRAB) within 4 weeks prior
             to baseline. C: Absence of hypercalcemia, evidenced by a calcium ≤11 mg/dL. R: Absence
             of renal failure, evidenced by a creatinine ≤ 2.0mg/dL A: Absence of anemia, evidenced
             by a hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL.

             B: Absence of lytic bone lesions per IMWG recommendations:

             One of either PET-CT, low-dose whole-body CT (LDWBCT) or MRI of the whole body or
             spine. Increased uptake on PET-CT alone is not adequate for the diagnosis of multiple
             myeloma; evidence of underlying osteolytic bone destruction is needed on the CT
             portion of the examination.
