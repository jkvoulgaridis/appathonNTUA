  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III randomized-controlled, single-blind study comparing the standard schedule
      for antalgic radiotherapy of a single fraction of 8.0 Gy delivered through three-dimensional
      conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to a single fraction of 20.0 Gy delivered through
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). The primary aim of this trial is to double the
      complete response rate. Secondary aims are to compare general response rates, duration of
      pain response, acute and late toxicity, HRQoL through patient-reported outcome measures
      (PROMs), pain flare, and re-irradiation need.

    <description>Using the EORTC quality of life questionnaire for Bone Metastases (QLQ BM22) to measure impact of bone metastases on QoL [min score 0 - max score 100].

    <description>The current standard treatment will be prescribed, i.e. a 3D-conformal radiotherapy of a single fraction dose of 8.0 Gy to the metastasis with a planning target volume (PTV) margin for set-up and positioning uncertainties of 1 cm. This can be performed at any linear accelerator.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Single fraction of 20 Gy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Within the framework of stereotactic body radiotherapy, a single fraction dose of 20.0 Gy will be delivered to the metastasis using a PTV margin of 3-5 mm based on high-precision image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Therefore, only linear accelerators with the European Organization for Radiotherapy &amp; Oncology advisory committee on radiation oncology practice (ESTRO-ACROP) specifications for SBRT can be accepted. A risk-adapted approach will be applied, aiming for the highest possible dose no less than 16 Gy, while respecting the tolerances of critical organs at risk (e.g. spinal cord, cauda equina, brainstem etc.).</description>

    <intervention_name>Stereotactic body radiotherapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Treatment will be prescribed to the periphery of the target, i.e. 80% of the dose should cover 95% of the PTV. The organ at risk (OAR) dose constraints will be in accordance with the recommendations from the report of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) task group 101. Image-guidance will consist of cone-beam CT in combination with 6 degrees of freedom corrections using robotic couch.</description>

    <description>In the standard setting, 95% of the PTV should receive 95% of the prescribed dose while near maximum dose (Dnear-max) in the PTV should not exceed 107%. Image-guidance will consist of portal images showing the relevant bony anatomy.</description>
