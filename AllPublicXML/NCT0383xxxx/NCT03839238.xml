    <description>VAS is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective pain. The scale range is from 0 to 10, the higher the score, the more severe the pain.</description>

    <measure>Lysholm Knee Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 2months and 3 months after the injection of MSC Like Cell</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is to assess the function of knee. The scale range is from 0 to 100, the higher the score, the more severe the knee problems. This scale includes 8 items, and the total score is the sum of these 8 items' scores. Individual items are scored differently, using individual scoring scales: 1. limp (0,3,5), 2. support (0,2,5), 3. locking (0,2,6,10,15), 4. instability (0,5,10,15,20,25), 5. pain (0,5,10,15,20,25), 6. swelling (0,2,6,10), 7. stair climbing (0,2,6,10), 8. squatting (0,2,4,5).</description>
