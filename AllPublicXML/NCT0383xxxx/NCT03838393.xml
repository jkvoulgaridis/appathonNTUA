      Background: Prognosis of medically treated trigeminal neuralgia patients is assumed to be
      poor, but the evidence is lacking. Thus, prospective real-life studies of medical management
      of trigeminal neuralgia are warranted.

      Methods: Observational study. Patients were consecutively enrolled in a structured management
      program at a specialist centre for facial pain. Optimisation of medical treatment,
      physiotherapy, psychotherapy, and advice from trained nurses, were parts of the program.
      Medically intractable patients were referred for neurosurgery. Data-collection was
      prospective using standardised schemes and patient surveys. The aim was to describe the
      two-year outcome of medical treatment at the specialist centre. The primary outcome was a 50%
      reduction in the overall burden of pain according to a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) after two
      years.

      This study aimed to provide evidence concerning the real-life efficacy of medical management
      of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) when directed by specialists. The investigatgors hypothesised
      that the two-year prognosis in a group of medically managed TN patients enrolled in a
      structured multidisciplinary management program was favourable, defined as a 50 % reduction
      of the overall burden of pain over a two-year period

        The diagnostic criteria used in this study were the beta version of the 3rd edition of the
        International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3-beta). Until the publication of
        IHCD-3-beta, ICHD 2 criteria were used. According to the ICHD-3 classification, this study
        included patients with both idiopathic and classical TN; in this paper termed primary TNThe
        number of patients enrolled in the inclusion period determined the sample size.
