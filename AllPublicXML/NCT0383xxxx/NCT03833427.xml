             Performance Scale.

             pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
             years except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy. Replacement therapy, such as
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or
             pituitary insufficiency, is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is
             allowed. Use of non-systemic steroids is permitted.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to allocation.

          -  For HIV infected participants, has a history of Kaposi's sarcoma and/or Multicentric
             Castleman's Disease.

             prior or current cardiomyopathy, or severe valvular heart disease; 4) Uncontrolled
             angina; 5) Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia and/or conduction abnormality ≤6
             months prior to start of study treatment; 6) Myocardial infarction or acute coronary

          -  Has retinal degenerative disease.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's
             participation for the full duration of the study, make administration of the study
             treatments hazardous or make it difficult to monitor adverse effects such that it is
             not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the
             treating investigator.

          -  Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the
             Participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.

             investigational agent or has participated and received study treatment in a study of
             an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 28 days of
             administration of selumetinib.
