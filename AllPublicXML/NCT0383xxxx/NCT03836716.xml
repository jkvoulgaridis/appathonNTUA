             local regulation and/or procedures

          -  Subject has completed the ORARIALS-01 trial (i.e., met one of the surrogate survival
             endpoints of tracheostomy or PAV or has completed the 76 weeks randomized treatment
             period)

          -  Subject completed ORARIALS-01 while on treatment, where on treatment is defined as
             having taken the last dose of IMP within 2 weeks of the End of Trial visit (whether at
             week 76 or prior)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected allergy or intolerance to the IMP (Arimoclomol or constituents)

             use of any other prohibited concomitant medications

          -  Women who are lactating or pregnant, or men or women unwilling to use a highly
             effective method of birth control if not surgically sterile (defined as bilateral
             tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy for women; vasectomy for men)
             for female participants until 4 weeks after last dose and for male participants until
             3 months after last dose. Pre-menopausal women must have a negative pregnancy test
             prior to dosing with trial medication.

          -  Any of the following medically significant conditions:

               1. Clinically significant renal or hepatic disease OR clinical laboratory assessment
                  (results ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] for aspartate aminotransferase
                  and/or alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin ≥ 2 times the ULN, or creatinine ≥ 1.5
                  times the ULN).

               2. Any new condition or worsening of existing condition which, in the opinion of the
                  investigator, would put the subject at undue risk.

          -  Any serious adverse event or moderate/severe adverse event from the ORARIALS-01 trial
             which is ongoing at the time of transitioning to ORARIALS-02 and assessed as probably
