  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: (1) develop a communication-based intervention to improve
      advanced cancer patients' and caregivers' prognostic understanding using communication
      strategies (e.g., acknowledgment, validation of fears) and distress management techniques
      (e.g., deep breathing, muscle relaxation); (2) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      the intervention among advanced cancer patients and their caregivers; and (3) test the
      preliminary efficacy of the intervention on patients' and caregivers' prognostic
      understanding (primary outcome); completion of DNR order, living will, and health care proxy;
      psychological distress; communication quality; caregiver burden; and healthcare utilization
      (secondary outcomes).

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (within 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in prognostic understanding will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention with items used previously in our team's NIH-funded cohort studies of advanced cancer patients and their caregivers: terminal nature of the illness [terminal (accurate) versus non-terminal (inaccurate) as assessed by the item: &quot;How would you describe your current health status?&quot; Answer choices include: 1) Relatively healthy, 2) relatively healthy but terminally ill, 3) seriously ill but not terminally ill, and 4) seriously ill and terminally ill] and life-expectancy [months (accurate) versus years (inaccurate) as assessed by the following item: &quot;Many patients have thoughts about how having cancer might affect their life expectancy, either based on what their doctors have told them, what they have read, or just their own sense about how long they might live with cancer. When you think about this, do you think in terms of&quot; Answer choices include: 1) Months, 2) Years].</description>

    <measure>Change in the number of patients and caregivers providing the same response for type of preferred end-of-life care (life-extending or comfort care)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (within 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the number of patients and caregivers providing the same response for type of preferred end-of-life care (life-extending or comfort care) will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention with an item used previously in our team's NIH-funded cohort studies that asks patients/caregivers to express a preference for life-extending versus comfort care. Patient-caregiver agreement on treatment preferences will be defined as patients and caregivers providing the same response. The following question will be used: &quot;If you were forced to choose between one of the following two options, which one would you prefer?&quot; Answer choices include: 1) A course of treatment that focused on extending life as much as possible, even if it meant more pain and discomfort. 2) A plan of care that focused on relieving pain and discomfort as much as possible, even if that meant not living as long.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in psychological distress, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (within 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological distress will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a valid and reliable 14-item, Likert-type self-report measure of mood disturbance commonly used with cancer patients. The HADS contains two seven-item subscales: 1) anxiety and 2) depressive symptoms. Each item on this scale is rated on a 4-point scale (0 to 3), and all items are summed to create a HADS total score. Total scores can range from 0 to 42, with higher numbers indicating higher levels of distress. Change in psychological distress will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention.</description>
