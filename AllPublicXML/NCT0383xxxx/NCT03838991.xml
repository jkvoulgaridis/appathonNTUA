  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrous dysplasia of bone is a rare congenital but non-hereditary disease caused by a
      post-zygotic activation mutation of the GNAS gene. Patients with fibrous dysplasia may
      present pain and bone complications (fractures, deformities..) related to their bone lesions.

      For undetermined reasons, severity and disease evolution may vary considerably from patient
      to patient.

      Epigenetic regulation could then be involved, including micro Ribonucleic Acids (miRs).

      These small non-coding micro Ribonucleic Acids are involved in the regulation of major steps
      of cellular processes in different pathologies, in particular in bone diseases. However,
      micro Ribonucleic Acids have never been studied in fibrous dysplasia.

      The aim of this study is to identify micro Ribonucleic Acids significantly associated with
      the severity of fibrous dysplasia.

    <description>The objective is to compare nature and level of expression of the micro Ribonucleic acids identify by NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) in bone tissue and serum between the 3 groups of subjects: monostotic Fibrous Dysplasia, polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia and controls (controls are patients with osteoarthritis).</description>

    <measure>Validation of micro Ribonucleic acids identified by NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) in blood samples</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of realization of the analyzes, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The objective is to validate expression of micro Ribonucleic acids identified by NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) in blood samples of patients from 4 pre-existing cohorts : a fibrous dysplasia cohort (PERIOSDYS) and 3 cohorts of control patients (OFELY and MODAM for women, STRAMBO for men).
For that the expression of the significant micro Ribonucleic acids identified by NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) in sera of patients with monostotic and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia versus control patients will be measured by RT-qPCR (Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) and then these results will be compared with same analysis on blood samples of patients from the 4 pre-existing cohorts.</description>

    <measure>Association between micro Ribonucleic acids and severity of fibrous dysplasia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of realization of the analyzes, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Association between expression of significant micro Ribonucleic acids in patients with fibrous dysplasia with the severity of the disease will be studied by statistics analysis.
Severity of fibrous dysplasia will be evaluated with clinical, biological and radiological data extracted from patients' medical records (Easily software) and from the CEMARA database (fibrous dysplasia database).</description>
