  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate people who have moderate-to-severe obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA), and have been newly prescribed a Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) machine.
      Patients with suboptimal adherence, defined by the Center of Medicare and Medicaid criteria
      (&lt;70 % usage and &lt;4 hours of average daily PAP usage) will be identified. The purpose of this
      research is to examine the impact of the sleep apnea management (SAM) grouped
      based-intervention on positive airway pressure adherence and patient report outcomes
      questionnaires (quality of life, daytime sleepiness and depressive symptoms) and PAP barrier
      questionnaire compared to a patient group managed by regular non-sleep prescribing provider.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research involves collection of information from the medical record and PAP adherence
      collection website and completion of a survey at several time points. The survey asks
      questions about their experience with the therapy, quality of life, daytime sleepiness and
      depressive symptoms. The participants will also be provided with some literature on sleep
      hygiene.

      Participants will be randomized to one of two groups, Sleep Apnea Management (SAM) Clinic or
      Usual Care with the non-sleep provider.

      Questionnaires. These questionnaires are the Epworth Sleepiness Scale which measures daytime
      sleepiness, Patient Health Questionnaire which is a 9-item depression scale that provides
      psychometric measurement of depression, the PAP Barrier Questionnaire, the PROMIS Global
      Health, a 10-item questionnaire measuring patient reported health status for physical, mental
      and social well-being, The PROMIS Sleep Related Impairment, 8-item questionnaire used to
      identify problems in sleep the affect overall quality of sleep and the PROMIS Fatigue,
      another 8-item questionnaire that evaluates self-reported symptoms of tiredness that affect
      daily activities and functioning.

      If randomized to Sleep Apnea Management (SAM) Clinic patients will be scheduled to attend the
      SAM Clinic. The SAM is a group clinic created to address challenges in PAP management by
      promoting adherence by providing access to problem-solving of PAP therapy issues. This allows
      patients with common problems and needs to have direct access to sleep medicine providers,
      sleep nurse practitioners, sleep nurses and/or durable medical equipment (DME)
      representatives all in one room in order to receive the most efficient service.

      The questionnaires will be completed at baseline (randomization visit), after 1 month, and
      again at 3 months.

    <description>To examine and compare changes in patient reported outcomes daytime sleepiness between the SAM Clinic and the usual care arms from baseline to 1 and 3 months in those with moderate to severe OSA with suboptimal PAP adherence. To examine the correlation between changes in daytime sleepiness to changes in PAP adherence at each time point (secondary analyses).
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is an 8-question scale that measures subjective daytime sleep propensity. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-3, with a total score possible of 0-24. Greater scores indicate greater daytime sleep propensity, with a score of ≥10 indicating excessive daytime sleep propensity.
Investigators hypothesize that greater improvement in daytime sleepiness will be noted with the SAM clinic intervention compared to usual care.</description>

    <description>To compare changes in patient reported outcomes depressive symptoms between the SAM Clinic and the usual care arms from baseline to 1 and 3 months in those with moderate to severe OSA with suboptimal PAP adherence. To examine the correlation between changes in depressive symptoms to changes in PAP adherence at each time point (secondary analyses). The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) is a self-administered survey that assesses each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria for depression in a separate question. Each question is scored from 0-3, with a total possible score of 0-27. Higher scores indicate greater severity of depressive symptoms; a score of 20-27 is indicative of severe depressive symptoms warranting active treatment, 15-19 moderately severe warranting active treatment, 10-14 moderate, 5-9 mild, and 0-4 none/minimal depressive symptoms.
Investigators hypothesize that greater improvement in depressive symptoms will be noted with the SAM clinic intervention compared to usual care.</description>

    <description>To compare changes in patient reported outcomes global health between the SAM Clinic and the usual care arms from baseline to 1 and 3 months in those with moderate to severe OSA with suboptimal PAP adherence. To examine the correlation between changes in global health to changes in PAP adherence at each time point (secondary analyses). The PROMIS Global Health (10 questions) short form measures health. Higher score indicate greater perceived health. The raw sum score is rescaled by a t-score into a standardized score, where a standard score of 50 is the general population average (with a standard deviation of 10). If not all questions were answered, a raw score can be calculated (and later standardized) from the following formula: (Score sum of questions answered * number of questions on the form) ÷Number of questions answered.

To examine the correlation between changes in fatigue to changes in PAP adherence at each time point (secondary analyses). The PROMIS Fatigue (8 questions) short form measures fatigue. Higher score indicate greater perceived fatigue. The raw sum score is rescaled by a t-score into a standardized score, where a standard score of 50 is the general population average (with a standard deviation of 10). If not all questions were answered, a raw score can be calculated (and later standardized) from the following formula: (Score sum of questions answered * number of questions on the form) ÷Number of questions answered.

To examine the correlation between changes in sleep impairment to changes in PAP adherence at each time point (secondary analyses). The PROMIS Sleep Related Impairment form measures sleep impairment. Higher score indicate greater perceived impairment. The raw sum score is rescaled by a t-score into a standardized score, where a standard score of 50 is the general population average (with a standard deviation of 10). If not all questions were answered, a raw score can be calculated (and later standardized) from the following formula: (Score sum of questions answered * number of questions on the form) ÷Number of questions answered.

    <measure>Changes in PAP Barrier questionnaire (eg. mask fit, nasal congestion, pressure intolerance) from baseline to 1 month and 3 month follow up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Examine the impact of the SAM Clinic on changes in barriers to PAP adherence compared to usual care from baseline contact to 3 months in those with moderate to severe OSA with suboptimal PAP adherence.
The Barriers questionnaire is a 12-question scale that measures subjective barriers to using a PAP machine. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-1, with a total score possible of 0-12. Greater scores indicate greater difficulty with wearing a PAP machine. Each yes answer can be addressed to improve the patient's use of the PAP.
Investigators hypothesize that the SAM Clinic intervention will be able to address PAP barriers more effectively compared to usual care. This questionnaire is in the yes/no format. This questionnaire is in the survey that will be completed by the patient.</description>

    <description>SAM Clinic is a sleep provider led team comprised of either a sleep clinician or sleep nurse practitioner along with sleep nurses and or durable medical equipment representative. The provider interacts with each patient personally. Various modes of trouble shooting of PAP related issues are tailored to solve PAP adherence issues including mask complaints, nasal issues, pressure intolerance, anxiety, and other related barriers to PAP adherence. When the provider is seeing patients individually other patients have the opportunity to interact and offer informal interpersonal support to other participants in dealing with similar PAP issues. The provider makes an individualized follow-up plan for each patient, which may include another SAM visit or referral back to the non-sleep provider.</description>
