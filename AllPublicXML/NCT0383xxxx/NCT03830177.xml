  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a topical treatment for dry scalp conditions, is
      safe and effective in clinically improving dry scalp conditions. The investigators will
      additionally examine individuals experience in using the treatment as well as any changes in
      the scalp microbiome before and after use studying the treatment , the investigators hope to
      offer children and adults a new, natural way to improve dry scalp conditions.

    <measure>Safety/patients comfort of the product using Overall Safety Score assessment, a 4 point assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be determined by contacting the patient via text over the phone and through a daily journal designed to document adverse events and Overall Safety Score. The Overall Safety Score and the reporting of adverse events throughout the study will measure the safety of the treatment. The Overall Safety Score is a 4-point assessment ranging from &quot;no signs of irritation&quot; (0) to &quot;patient discontinued due to irritation&quot; (3).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of patients erythema, scaling, and pruritus</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be determined using the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale, a 5-point assessment ranging from clear (0) to severe disease (4) and the Total Severity Scale (TSS), an assessment that averages erythema, scaling, and pruritus severity scores of scalp lesions. The TSS uses a 4-point scale ranging from none (0) to severe (3).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in bacterial composition of scalp using RODAC</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An exploratory aim of this study is to find whether the natural treatment changes the microbiome after use for a dry scalp condition to more closely resemble healthy scalps. This will be accomplished by obtaining swab samples from the participants' scalps, before and after the treatment period. The samples will be analyzed using 16s RNA sequencing and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing. Additionally, the change in colony count of bacterial and fungal colonies on the scalp before and after the treatment will be assessed using the Replicate Organism Detection and Counting (RODAC) method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be calculated using the ScalpDex tool, a validated 23-item instrument that explains the way that patients with scalp dermatitis are affected by symptoms, functioning, and emotions.The scale is the Scalpdex quality of life instrument and asks questions about everyday activities such as wearing black clothes to itching. For the scale,the higher the score, the worse the outcome for the patient.</description>

The kit will contain the instruction handout and their treatment. They will be instructed to apply the treatment to their scalp, wait seven minutes, and then rinse their scalp. They will perform this entire procedure once per day for 14 days.</description>
