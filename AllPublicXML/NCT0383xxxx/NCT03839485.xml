  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pulp therapy in primary teeth is still necessary even with all odontopediatrics evolution
      in prevention and minimal intervention, aiming to keep the tooth free of inflammation or
      infection and in a functional state until its exfoliation. Several materials are used as
      filling paste of primary teeth. In Brazil, the Guedes-Pinto Paste (PGP), an association of
      iodof√≥rmio, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, prednisolone and rifamycin, has been widely
      used for some decades. However, current Brazilian legislation has made it difficult to
      commercialize antibiotics, which has made it difficult to obtain the ointment that is the
      association between prednisolone and rifamycin. Therefore, the objective of this clinical
      trial will be to test PGP without rifamycin in the pulpectomy of primary teeth, and to
      compare it with the treatment performed with conventional PGP.

      A randomized triple-blind non-inferiority clinical study with two parallel arms, with a
      12-month follow-up, will be performed. The experimental group will be PGP formulated without
      the antibiotic, while the control group is the conventional PGP, containing rifamycin. The
      conventional pulpectomy will be performed using manual files, performing the instrumentation
      aided by Endo-PTC and 1% sodium hypochlorite. At the end of the instrumentation, just before
      the obturation, the groups will be drawn, with the strategy of randomization in permuted
      blocks and stratified by the initial condition of the tooth (with or without periapical
      lesion). The main outcome will be the clinical and radiographic success of endodontic
      treatment after 12 months.Patients who seek the dental service of the municipality and
      require endodontic treatment will be invited to participate in the study. The data will be
      statistically analyzed using the statistical package Stata 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College
      Station, TX, USA). The longevity of the treatments will be evaluated by estimating survival
      rates using the Kaplan-Meier method. The differences between survival rates according to the
      type of endodontic treatment proposed will be analyzed through the Log-rank test.

    <masking_description>Both materials will be packed in identical and opaque syringes, identified only with letters (A and B). The codes will be revealed only at the end of the study. Neither the professional who will be performing the treatment, nor the patient or the evaluator, who will perform the exams at follow-up times, will know which of the two materials of choice were selected for each tooth, characterizing the study as triple-blind.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Success or failure of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The success or failure of endodontic treatments evaluated by the time spent in the tooth arch in clinical conditions of normality. Clinical criteria for determining success are: absence of fistula, absence of painful symptoms and pathological absence of adequate mobility and gingival contour. Radiographically, the success criteria are: no occurrence of a periapical rarefaction in the furcation area; reduction or maintenance of an already present bone rarefaction in the furcation area of posterior teeth, maintaining the periradicular space, root resorption compatible with the eruptive phase and absence of pathological bone resorption. To evaluate the reduction of lesions or appearance of new lesions, we will compare the initial and final radiographs.</description>
