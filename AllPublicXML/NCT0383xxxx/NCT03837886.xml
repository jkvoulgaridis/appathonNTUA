  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to verify if sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) suplementation promotes
      changes in the performance, muscular activity and strength of individuals trained during the
      intermittent and intense task . Twelve trained adult men will participate in this randomized,
      double-blind, crossover clinical trial. Each participant should receive two types of
      intervention with a 14-day interval between conditions: alkalosis (ALK) in which gelatinous
      capsules containing 0.3 g.kg -1 of NaHCO 3 and placebo (PLA) are administered, in which 0.3
      g.kg-1 of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3). The following results will be considered:
      electromyographic activity (EMG) of the quadriceps muscle, peak torque, pH, lactate, and
      perception of effort, recovery and pain questionnaires, which will be collected during
      intermittent and high intensity DI protocol. ANOVA of repeated measures will be used to
      verify possible differences between groups.
