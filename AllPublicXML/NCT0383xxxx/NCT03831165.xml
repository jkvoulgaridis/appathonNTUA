  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genital herpes is a common and increasingly-common infection worldwide. The annual incidence
      in the United States is 1.75 per 1000 inhabitants. The etiologic agent is the herpes type 1
      and 2 strains simplex virus. Classical Treatment is with acyclovir which decreases the
      duration of the disease and prevents rashes but has no curative effect. Also, studies show
      herpes resistance to acyclovir which has stimulating research into new drugs to treat this
      condition. Authors suggest melatonin way be a therapeutic agent in herpetic disease due to
      its modulatory action in immune and inflammatory responses when administered in adequate
      doses. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of melatonin in the
      treatment of genital herpes as well as compare it to acyclovir in a double-blind, prospective
      and randomized, investigation. Outcame measures will include clinical evaluation of patients
      and laboratory endpoints.

      The authors have investigate the relationship of estrogen-dependent malignant tumors with
      reduced levels of melatonin. It is speculated that the indoleamine can be classified as
      anti-estrogenic drug, both by its action on estrogen synthesis with aromatase inhibition and
      by its interference with estrogen receptors. Experimentally melatonin prevents promotion and
      growth of mammary tumors in rodents, probably by interacting with epithelial cell receptor;
      increasing local immunity by acting as an antioxidant agent and by inhibiting telomerase
      activity intumor cells .

    <intervention_model_description>The patients will be divided into three groups. One group (group A) will receive a bottle with 360 pills of acyclovir 200 mg. These individuals will be instructed to take 2 tablets of 200mg acyclovir (400 mg) twice daily for 90 days. Group B will receive 90 tablets of 30 mg of melatonin, the tablet will be used as 01 tablet daily for 90 days. Group C will receive 90 tablets of melatonin 3mg, and 360 tablets of acyclovir dose is 1 tablet per day for 90 days.</intervention_model_description>

After, will be delivered bottle identified by letters (abc, bca or cab) with its drug without patient and investigator know its nature. It will only be revealed which drug was used by every woman at the end of the study; but occurring worsening of herpetic disease, the blind will be broken for proper assessment of the participant. If the employee drug is melatonin, this case will be considered as therapeutic failure in the final statistical analysis.</description>
