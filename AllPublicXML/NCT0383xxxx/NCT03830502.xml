  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prophylactic (Opportunistic) salpingectomy is a cost-effective strategy recommended for
      reducing the risk of ovarian cancer at the time of gynecologic surgery in women who have
      completed childbearing. Similar evidence for cesarean section is growing. However,
      salpingectomy refers to the surgical removal of a female reproductive organ. Some women may
      have hesitations about salpingectomy with regard to religious concerns, reduced self-image,
      tubal reanastomosis or lack of knowledge.

      The investigators aimed to explore the underlying factors that motivate women for either
      decisions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prophylactic and opportunistic bilateral salpingectomy is an increasing trend among surgeons
      and also proven as an effective risk-reducing method for ovarian cancer.

      The investigators have experienced denials among women who were seeking tubal ligation as a
      sterilization procedure during cesarean section after a comprehensive counseling for
      prophylactic salpingectomy. Therefore, the investigators aimed to assess the driving factors
      of decision making for prophylactic salpingectomy or tubal ligation. It is planned to
      preoperatively have a non-validated questionnaire for the women after a detailed briefing.
