  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) involves short (~1-2min) bouts of breathing low oxygen air
      to stimulate spinal neuroplasticity. Studies in rodents and humans indicate that AIH improves
      motor function after spinal cord injury (SCI). This study will use a double blind, cross-over
      design to test if the combination of AIH and respiratory strength training improves breathing
      function more than either approach alone in adults with chronic SCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts neural pathways to respiratory motor neurons, causing
      muscle paralysis and decreased breathing capacity. Since respiratory impairment is the major
      cause of illness and death with SCI, it is critical to devise new strategies to restore
      breathing function.

      Repetitive exposure to brief episodes of low oxygen (acute intermittent hypoxia or AIH) has
      demonstrated to increase respiratory function in humans with chronic SCI. Additionally
      pre-clinical studies demonstrate that AIH-induced functional benefits are enhanced by
      combining AIH with task-specific training. The investigator's central hypothesis is that
      combined daily AIH (dAIH) and respiratory strength training will elicit greater and more
      sustained gains in respiratory function than either treatment alone in people with chronic
      SCI.

      This study is a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design where participants will complete
      4 random-ordered blocks, consisting of a 5-day intervention followed by a 3-week washout
      period, during which 1-day, 3-day, and 1-week post-tests will be conducted. Participants will
      include 53 adults with chronic, incomplete SCI with &gt;20% respiratory impairment based on
      maximal inspiratory or expiratory pressure generation.

Blocks 1, 2 and 3 include a 5 day intervention (e.g., dAIH and/or respiratory training) or sham protocol, followed by a 3-week washout period, with follow up measurements at 1 day, 3 days and 1 week post-intervention. The final block includes a 5-day protocol followed by 1-day, 3-day and 1-week post-tests.</intervention_model_description>
