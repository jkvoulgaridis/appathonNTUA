      An open label, pilot study involving the use of low dose oral minoxidil to treat permanent
      chemotherapy-induced alopecia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be evaluated through clinical assessment, histology, quality of life
      assessment, and adverse event monitoring. The data gathered from this study will be used to
      determine the safety and efficacy of the treatment regimen for this subset of CIA patients.
      The oral minoxidil regimen will be considered effective if significant clinical regrowth,
      positive histological changes, and improved Quality of Life are reported after the onset of
      treatment.
