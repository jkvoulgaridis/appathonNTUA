  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA), are common
      in patients with cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of OSA is 2%-4% in general population
      and 16%-47% in surgical-heart failure patients.

      The previous studies found that the sleep apnea types shifted from OSA to CSA after
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment or from CSA to OSA after heart surgery
      (cardiac valve replacement/ repair or heart transplantation) without the mechanism
      illuminated clearly. The recent studies found that the loop gain (LG) could predict the
      effect of upper airway surgery and CPAP treatment on the reversion of OSA. However, in
      patients with valvular heart disease, whether LG and related parameters can predict the
      therapeutic efficacy of CPAP or cardiac valve replacement is not expounded clearly.

      The investigators' previous study found that there were different outcomes of sleep apnea
      after cardiac valve replacement: elimination or consistent. But the corresponding
      non-anatomic mechanisms was not clear. The investigators' preliminary experiment showed that
      the LG and related parameters were not improved while OSA improved by CPAP treatment;
      however, the recovery of OSA after cardiac valve replacement was closed related to the
      improvement of LG and related parameters.

      The investigators speculated that, 1. LG and related parameters could predict OSA outcome of
      CPAP treatment or cardiac valve replacement. 2. non-anatomic mechanisms including LG and
      associated parameters, contributed to CPAP treatment and cardiac valve replacement were
      different. In this study, the investigators aimed to explore the relationship between LG and,
      outcomes of OSA and the regarding non-anatomic mechanisms in patient with heart valve
      disease.

      Between January 31, 2020 and June 30, 2023, 300 patients with valvular heart disease waiting
      for cardiac valve replacement in Department of Cardiovascular Surgery were screened for
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by full-night polysomnography. Of them, 40 OSA patients were
      enrolled and randomly received CPAP treatment and non-CPAP treatment (20:20).

      The CPAP treatment group received both baseline medicine and CPAP treatment. The full-night
      CPAP treatment was conducted from 21:00 pm to 6:00 am for 7 days preoperatively. The non-CPAP
      treatment group received baseline medicine treatment. LG and related parameters were
      collected at the first day of treatment in non-CPAP group and both first and last day of
      treatment in CPAP group.

      Sleep parameters including apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), mean and lowest SPO2, and clinical
      evaluations including New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes, electrocardiographic,
      echocardiographic, arterial blood gas analysis findings, baseline medication, and 6-minute
      walk test were recorded.

      Operation related parameters (duration of operation, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and
      bleeding volume) were recorded. Postoperative adverse events such as duration of ICU stay,
      postoperative duration of mechanical ventilation, pacemaker use, complicated infection and
      reintubations were recorded.

      A full-night polysomnography as well as LG and related parameters were re-examined before
      discharge from hospital. The changes of AHIs, mean and lowest SPO2, LG and related parameters
      between pre- and post-operative polysomnography parameters were calculated.

      The correlation between changes of polysomnography and LG parameters pre- and post-CPAP in
      CPAP group were analyzed. The correlation between changes of polysomnography and LG
      parameters pre- and post-operative in both CPAP and non-CPAP group were analyzed. The
      differences of polysomnography and LG parameters, and post-operative adverse events between
      CPAP and non-CPAP treatment group were analyzed.
