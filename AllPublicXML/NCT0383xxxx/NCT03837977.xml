  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no standard treatment beyond first-line etoposide/platinum-based
      chemotherapy in patients with progressive poorly differentiated extra-pulmonary
      neuroendocrine carcinoma. Therefore the treatment of patients whose disease progresses on or
      after this first-line treatment is an area of unmet need.

      Combination regimens such as irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid are a second-line
      treatment option currently used in Europe and world-wide for this subset of patients.
      However, there is currently no trial evidence supporting this treatment regimen in these
      patients.

      Results of the NAPOLI-1 phase III trial of liposomal irinotecan in the treatment of patients
      with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma after gemcitabine-based therapy reported improved
      survival for those patients who received a combination of liposomal irinotecan with
      5-FU/folinic acid compared to those patients who received 5-FU/folinic acid alone. Liposomal
      irinotecan has been found to show an improved distribution into tumour tissue in comparison
      to irinotecan, and this may have clinical benefit in patients with extra-pulmonary
      neuroendocrine carcinoma.

      Docetaxel is standardly used as a second-line treatment option in patients with small cell
      lung cancer who have progressed on primary etoposide-platinum combination therapy. Therefore
      this drug could also have clinical benefit in patients with extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine
      carcinoma as the biology of the disease is similar to small cell lung cancer.

      The overall aim of the NET-02 trial is to select a treatment for continuation to a Phase III
      trial. The intention of the trial is to determine whether liposomal
      irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid and docetaxel are sufficiently active in this
      population of patients. If both treatments are found to be efficacious, selection criteria
      will be applied to select a treatment to take forward.

      102 eligible participants will be randomised to receive either liposomal
      irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid given every 14 days, or docetaxel given every 21 days.
      Participants will be treated for a minimum of 6 months or until discontinuation of treatment
      as per protocol.

         10. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure,
             ventricular arrhythmias or uncontrolled blood pressure .

         11. Severe bone marrow failure or bone marrow depression after radiotherapy or treatment
             with other antineoplastic agents (defined as haematological values of haemoglobin or
             white blood cells or neutrophils or platelets not meeting inclusion criteria).

         15. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases which, in the view of the
             treating clinician, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial.

         16. Evidence of significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding which, in the opinion
             of the treating clinician, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the
             trial.

         17. Medical or psychiatric conditions that impair the ability to give informed consent.

         18. Any other serious uncontrolled medical conditions (in the opinion of the treating
