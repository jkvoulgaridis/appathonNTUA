      A Window-of-Opportunity Trial of Abemaciclib followed by radical cystectomy in patients with
      Platinum-Ineligible Urothelial Carcinoma to Evaluate CDK4/6-Dependent Phosphorylation of
      Pocket Proteins and Clonal Evolution Dynamics. Subjects will be treated with Abemaciclib at
      200 mg every 12 hours for at least 4 weeks (and likely slightly longer depending upon
      surgical date). Individual dose reductions will be made on the basis of the AEs observed. In
      the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment will be continued until
      the surgical date unless any of the following criteria applies: 1-Disease progression;
      2-Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment; 3-Unacceptable
      adverse event(s) as a result of Abemaciclib; 4- Patient decides to withdraw from the study;
      5-General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for
      further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. Patients will be followed with
      history, physical, and blood tests at each visit to monitor for toxicity. Patients will be
      followed for survival endpoints following completion of this study for 3 years after surgery
      or until death. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
