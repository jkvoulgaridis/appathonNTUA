      Functional Limitation Scale-8.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 60% of individuals with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) reported increased
      pain intensity from midlevel to severe. This was seen at the end of the intervention or work
      related activities in the quarter of individuals. Therefore, the correct diagnosis of TMD is
      very important to reduce the economic cost. Craniofacial Pain and Disability Inventory
      (CF-PDI) is designed based on a biopsychosocial approach. Evidence has shown that CF-PDI is
      an well-structured, internal consistency, repeatable and valid, and that an objective outcome
      for the evaluation of pain and discomfort in patients with craniofacial pain. There is no
      Turkish version and validity study of CF-PDI. Each item is scored between 0-3. The total
      score ranged from 0 to 63, and a high score indicate a high level of discomfort. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of CF-PDI. The
      study of validity and reliability is planned with 105 individuals with TMD. The
      sociodemographic characteristics of the individuals will be questioned by the investigators
      and then the patients will be evaluated with CF-PDI, Neck Disability Index (NDI), Tampa Scale
      for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6),
      Jaw Functional Limitation Scale (JFLS) (Turkish version) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The
      test-retest will be re-administered by face-to-face interview technique after 1 week. The
      results will be analyzed using the SPSS version 22.0 computer package program.
