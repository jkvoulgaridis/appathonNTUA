  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study enrolling older individuals aged 60-85y to observe changes
      during physical inactivity. This study is investigating the relation between short-term
      physical inactivity and the impact of muscle health and function. The enrollment goal is 8
      participants. The study will occur over the course of a month where participants will undergo
      testing before and after a reduction in physically activity levels. There will be a screening
      event collecting baseline data, two body composition scans, muscle function and oral glucose
      tolerance tests and a metabolic study before and after a 2-week period of inactivity. Each
      metabolic study will entail three-muscle biopsies: one before and 2 after the ingestion of
      leucine.

      Pre-testing- The baseline evaluation will assess muscle function and strength, and an oral
      glucose tolerance test. After the baseline visit, participants will be provided with a step
      activity monitor to track their level of activity. This will provide a baseline of the
      participant's normal level of physical activity so an accurate level of 75% activity
      reduction can be determined. A 3-day daily dietary diary will be provided for the participant
      to self-report prior to the experiment, as well.

      Day 1- After the participant completes their normal activity log and dietary diary, they will
      be asked to return to the research center for a body composition scan and a metabolic study.

      The metabolic study will involve blood sampling from an arm vein and muscle biopsies from the
      thigh before and after a leucine drink.

      2-week period of inactivity- After the metabolic study, the participant will return home and
      maintain a reduced level of activity (75% reduction) for a two-week period. During this time,
      the participant will receive phone calls from research personnel in order to maintain
      adherence to the intervention.

      Day 14- After the 2-week reduced activity period, the participant will return to the research
      center to receive a body composition scan and undergo a metabolic study identical to 'Day 1'.

      Post-testing- After Day 14, the participant will be asked to return once again to the
      research center for a oral glucose tolerance test and the exercise lab for muscle function
      testing.
