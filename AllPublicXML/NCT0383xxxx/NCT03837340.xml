      A single-blinded hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial (Type II), that both evaluates the
      intervention outcomes (clinical and service use outcomes) through patient-randomization in
      the implementation sites, as well as evaluates the implementation strategy chosen for the
      intervention and its impact on implementation outcomes (e.g. adoption, fidelity,
      acceptability and maintenance (continued implementation) of the intervention).

      The overall goal of the study is to contribute to improving the level of functioning and
      quality of life and mental health outcomes for people with severe and enduring mental ill
      health (SMI) (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression) by adapting and upscaling the
      implementation of a community-based service delivery model in Montenegro.

      Effectiveness component of the trial: Multidisciplinary community mental health teams for
      people with SMI.

      The intervention condition offers flexible, assertive community treatment (FACT) in the
      community for people with SMI. FACT can intensify (e.g. provide more intensive treatment in
      the form of daily home visits, crisis care at home, more intensive evidence-based
      psycho-social and pharmacological treatments) or provide less intensive treatment depending
      on client need. It can also provide less intensive care during non-crisis periods, offering
      routine home treatment where a combination of psychological and pharmacological treatments
      (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, family-based interventions)
      are offered, as well as care processes (reviewing recovery and crisis/treatment plans, and
      the clients' Wellness Recovery Action Plan), and social care interventions (assistance in
      obtaining or maintaining employment, looking for reasonable accommodation options).

      Care offered in this project in the intervention condition will be provided by a
      multidisciplinary community mental health team (CMHT), consisting of a diverse set of
      professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and social workers, that
      deliver integrated medical and social care that are focused on (symptomatic-, functional- and
      personal-) recovery.

      CMHTs will provide home-based treatment inclusive of crisis resolution services and
      procedures for early recognition of sub-clinical psychosis and bipolar disorder, ACT, and
      intensive case management. Integrated care (i.e. health and social care interventions) will
      be provided to all clients. Furthermore, health and social care evidence-based interventions
      for severe mental illnesses will be employed during home treatment, such as family-based
      interventions, motivational interviewing, and cognitive behavioral therapies, combined with
      medication management and identifying employment (paid and unpaid options) and support in
      finding and maintaining this employment, (Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) recovery
      groups and housing opportunities.

      Comparison condition: Usual care Health care settings and their providers randomized to the
      control condition receive usual care.

    <intervention_model_description>There are two study arms- groups - both consisting of patients with SMI (severe mental illness). One group will be receiving care as usual, which in the actual setting means mostly medical treatment, without home care and assertive treatment through community based outreach teams. Another, intervention group, will be receiving assertive treatment care, with mobile assertive teams, consisting of at least three team members.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2 (WHO-DAS2) measures health and disability-level of functioning in 6 domains:1.Cognition - understanding and communicating; 2.Mobility - moving and getting around; 3.Self-care - attending to one's hygiene,dressing, eating and staying alone; 4.Getting along - interacting with others; 5. Life activities - domestic responsibilities, leisure, work and school; 6.Participation in community activities,in society.The instrument is self-reporting; can be administered by a health worker if needed.Answers are distributed into 5 categories:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;mild&quot;,&quot;moderate&quot;,&quot;severe&quot;and&quot;extreme or cannot do&quot;. It ends with 3 items where answers are presented as number of days (when difficulties were present). Score on any dimension ranges 0 to 7, results are depicted in a diagram which reflects relation between dimensions(the higher the score, the lower level of difficulties/better functioning) and changes over time.</description>

    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Euro Quality of Life Index (Euro QoL 5-D 3-L). The instrument measures five dimensions:Dimension 1: Mobility; Dimension 2: Self-care;Dimension 3:Daily activities; Dimension 4: pain/discomfort; Dimension 5: Anxiety/ Depression.
Each dimension can be rated at three levels: from no problems to major problems. The five dimensions can be summed into a descriptive health state with 11111 representing no problems in any of the five health dimensions and 33333 indicating major problems in any of the five health dimensions. Second part of the instrument is the Visual Analogue Scale to assess health status at baseline, where 0 signifies worst imaginable health state, and 100 signifies best imaginable health state.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (ages 18-65), current service users, with severe and enduring mental
             ill-health, which, for clinical purposes, typically relates to diagnostic categories
             of bipolar disorder, severe depression, or schizophrenia. We use the following
             definition for SMI:

               -  Presence of a psychiatric disorder that requires care and treatment (so, they are
                  NOT in symptom remission)

               -  Has severe limitations in social and community functioning (i.e. they are not in
                  functional remission)

               -  These problems are not transient (e.g. temporary, one-off) in nature (They are
                  systematic and long-term)

               -  Coordinated care provided by care networks or teams is needed to implement the
                  treatment plan

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria at the patient level includes patients who do not consent to their
             data being collected who are part of the intervention or control conditions, those who
             are under the age of 18 at the start of the study.
