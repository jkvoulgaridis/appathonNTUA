  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The classical musician's work, which comprises numerous daily hours of precise
      and often strenuous repetitive movements in asymmetrical postures, renders them vulnerable to
      musculoskeletal (MSK) injury. Performance-related MSK disorders (PRMDs) have been defined as
      &quot;any pain, weakness, numbness, tingling or other physical symptoms that interfere with your
      ability to play your instrument at the level to which you are accustomed&quot;. The lifetime
      prevalence of PRMDs in professional instrumental musicians ranges from 62 to 93%.
      Furthermore, typical musical instruction does not include education on physical health and
      injury prevention, and this is thought to be an important factor in musicians' development of
      pain and injuries.

      The combination of musician-specific exercise and education on injury prevention may have
      greater impacts on musicians' wellbeing than exercise or education alone. In a pilot trial,
      15 orchestral musicians were offered an educational presentation and carried out a home
      exercise program for 11 weeks. There were no dropouts, exercise adherence was high and
      musicians reported improvement of their symptoms. However, certain weaknesses were
      identified. Thus, this type of rehabilitation program demonstrates much potential for
      improving the wellbeing of orchestral musicians, but improvements should be made. The
      collaboration of experts with relevant backgrounds, including musicians who were exposed to
      the program, can optimize the program.

      Objectives and hypotheses: The objectives are 1) to identify facilitators and obstacles to
      the implementation of the initial program by realizing focus groups with musicians; 2) to
      adapt the program to the local context; 3) to evaluate the effectiveness of the revised
      program to decrease the intensity, functional impact and frequency of PRMDs in musicians with
      a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT); 4) to evaluate the effect of the educational
      components of the program on health-related knowledge and behaviour. The hypothesis for
      objective 3 is that a decrease in PRMD intensity, frequency and functional limitations will
      be demonstrated in the experimental group following participation in the program, compared to
      the control group.

      Methods:

        1. - Focus groups: The 15 pilot project participants will be invited to share their
           perceptions regarding the initial program. Sessions will be comprised of questions on
           implementation determinants described in the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
           Research.

        2. - Adaptation to local context: Experts in education and exercise will design the
           components of the program according to results from Step 1. All new or modified
           exercises will be reviewed by two clinicians, and tried by participants from the pilot
           trial. New comments will be considered, and an adapted program will be proposed.

        3. - Implementation and evaluation of effectiveness Participants: Fifty orchestral
           musicians (25 per group) will be recruited from full and part-time orchestras and
           university-level music performance programs. Students will be included because the
           program will have the potential to directly impact the workers of tomorrow. Musicians
           with and without PRMDs will be invited to participate, as the program is both preventive
           and curative.

      Study design: Pilot single-blind RCT with 1-year follow-up. Participants will be evaluated at
      baseline (T0), at the end of the 3-month rehabilitation program (T1) and 1 year later (T2).
      The baseline evaluation will consist of questionnaires on PRMD symptoms and functional
      limitations. Following baseline, subjects will be randomly assigned to either a
      rehabilitation program (exercise group) or no intervention (control group). Randomization
      will be stratified by instrument group and PRMD prevalence (presence or absence of symptoms).
      The same questionnaires will be completed by all participants at evaluations 2 and 3. All
      meetings will be held in participants' workplace.

      Intervention: The rehabilitation program will consist of education on healthy practice habits
      and load and injury management and a 3-month home exercise program specific to musicians.
      Control group members will receive no intervention until after T2.

      Baseline demographics will be compared between groups (independent t-tests, chi-square
      tests). Two-way mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVA) will explore the effect of the
      rehabilitation program on PRMD symptoms and functional limitations.

      Relevance: Orchestral musicians frequently suffer from debilitating pain that can have a
      lasting impact on their career. Our multi-sectorial research and clinical team hopes to
      create an effective rehabilitation program that can be offered to many musical populations.
      If the program is effective, next steps will include integration of the program into the
      workplace. In order to have longer-lasting and further-reaching impacts on musicians'
      wellbeing, the presence of rehabilitation in the workplace is the ultimate goal.

    <description>Self-report questionnaire containing two subscales: Pain Intensity (4 questions) and Pain Interference (5 questions). Each question is scored by the participant on a scale from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot; or &quot;does not interfere&quot; to 10 &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;completely interferes&quot; for Pain Intensity and Pain Interference, respectively. The pain intensity scale ranges from 0 to 40, and pain interference from 0 to 50, for a possible total of 90 points (summation) where higher scores indicate worse outcomes and lower scores indicate better outcomes.</description>
