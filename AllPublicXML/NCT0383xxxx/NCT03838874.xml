  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if there is a difference between two different spinal
      anesthetics (Mepivacaine vs. Bupivacaine) as it relates to reducing post-operative
      complications and the time it takes for subjects to regain mobility after surgery.

    <description>To evaluate the time to return of lower extremity motor function between mepivacaine and low-dose bupivacaine spinal anesthetic among patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty. This will be assessed by measuring time from spinal anesthetic administration to postoperative achievement of Bromage 0 function (return of spontaneous ankle, knee, and hip movement) in the non-operative extremity.</description>

             previous history of menopause, hysterectomy, or tubal ligation will not be required to
             perform a pregnancy test. Female patients that do not meet this criterion will be
             asked to submit a urine sample, and will require a negative urine sample in order to
             proceed with study protocol. Urine sample be collected pre-procedurally.
