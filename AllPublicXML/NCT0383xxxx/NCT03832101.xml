  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the efficacy of training on facial recognition and multitasking.
      The researchers hypothesize that participants who have undergone facial recognition and
      multitasking training will demonstrate an improved facial recognition ability and performance
      in multi-tasking. The researchers also hypothesize that measures of sustained and selective
      attention will predict performance on multitasking tasks. This work sets the ground work for
      future research into if and how facial recognition and multitasking ability can be improved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been evidence showing improvements on performance on various cognitive tasks after
      training, but evidence on multitasking and facial recognition is lacking. Both multi-tasking
      and facial recognition are crucial for military and law enforcement personnel, and the
      respective organizations can consider these abilities during their respective recruitment and
      training processes.

      This study will test whether training on multi-tasking and facial recognition tasks can
      improve an individual's performance. Additionally, it will test whether their performance on
      other measures of attention and multitasking can predict changes post-training.

      Participants will go through 5 testing sessions span over 5 days. For each session,
      participants will complete a multitasking task and a facial recognition task. Participants
      are hypothesized to improve in their performance after 5 consecutive days of training on
      these 2 tasks. Additionally, participants will also complete 2 attention tasks, 1 face memory
      task, and 1 other multi-tasking task only on the first day. Both multitasking tasks are
      expected to correlate at baseline, and performance on the attention tasks may predict
      performance on multitasking tasks as these tasks require sustained and selective attention. A
      face memory task will also be used to account for each individual's baseline facial
      recognition ability.

    <description>The crucial measure is percent correct recognition of target faces learned on the first day. These faces are either presented in isolation (Is this a target face? Yes/No) or with other faces (Which is the target?). Performance is measured on each day of training to establish learning trajectories.</description>

    <description>All participants will complete 5 training and testing sessions in total, once a day, over the course of a week (weekdays). On the first day, participants will go through an initial test (Cambridge Face Memory Test; approximately 15 minutes) to determine their baseline facial recognition ability. Thereafter, participants in the Difficult group will undergo training involving discriminations between highly similar faces. Each participant's involvement in the study will last only 5 consecutive days. The total participation time is 7.5 hours per participant.</description>

On the first day, participants will go through an initial test (Cambridge Face Memory Test; approximately 15 minutes) to determine their baseline facial recognition ability.

Each participant's involvement in the study will last only 5 consecutive days. The total participation time is 7.5 hours per participant.</description>
