  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of high protein (HP) vs. normal protein
      (NP) diets on weight loss, loss of fat free mass (FFM), and remission of type 2 diabetes
      (T2D) in individuals with T2D. Both diet groups will receive dietary and physical activity
      guidance through a group-based weight loss program, State of Slim (SOS). The central
      hypothesis is that the HP diet (with ≥4 weekly servings of lean beef) will lead to greater
      remission of T2D vs. a NP diet by 1) producing greater weight loss and limiting weight regain
      and 2) preferentially reducing fat mass while preserving FFM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  T2D diagnosis within previous 6 years (documented physician diagnosis, use of
             antidiabetic medication, fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dl, and/or HbA1c ≥6.5%)

          -  BMI of ≥27 kg/m2

          -  Weight stable (±3kg in the last 3 months)

          -  Participants using GLP-1 agonists or SLGT-inhibitors must be on a stable (≥3 months)
