  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pentoxifylline, atorvastatin, and vitamin E (PAVE) work
      in treating patients with erectile dysfunction after radiation therapy for prostate cancer.
      Atorvastatin may reduce high cholesterol. Pentoxifylline and vitamin E may enhance blood
      flow. Giving PAVE may work better in treating prostate cancer patients with post-radiation
      therapy erectile dysfunction.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who achieve a clinically significant improvement in
      erectile dysfunction (ED) when treated with a combination of atorvastatin or patient's
      currently prescribed statin, vitamin E, and pentoxifylline (PAVE).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To report the safety profile of PAVE. II. To report the rate of choosing other ED
      treatments after PAVE.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atorvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning week 7, patients receive atorvastatin
      PO QD, vitamin E PO QD, and pentoxifylline PO thrice daily (TID) for up to 12 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>Patients' baseline erectile dysfunction (ED) levels will be reported along with the proportion for patients who improve by at least 1 level according to the IIEF for each time point measured. The proportion will be reported along with a 95% credible interval implementing a non-informative prior of beta (0.33, 0.67). Additionally, the proportion of patients who ever improve by at least 1 level will be reported overall.</description>
