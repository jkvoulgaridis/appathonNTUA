  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether the administration of iron to patients with
      heart failure and preserved ejection fraction results in an improvement of symptoms and
      functional class, in addition to evaluating whether oral iron is equivalent to intravenous
      iron to achieve this improvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is one of the most prevalent co-morbid conditions in chronic heart failure.
      In the absence of any iron treatment, it is estimated that up to 50% of patients with heart
      failure have low levels of available iron. Treatment with intravenous iron improves exercise
      tolerance , quality of life , and reduces hospitalization in patients with chronic heart
      failure and reduced ejection fraction. However data on the effect of iron therapy in patients
      with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are still lacking. The evidence related
      to oral iron therapy in HF is limited and no randomized trials compared oral iron vs no iron
      therapy in the absence of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
