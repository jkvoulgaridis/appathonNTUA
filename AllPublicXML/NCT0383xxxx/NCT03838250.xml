      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of Cellgram™ delivered via
      hepatic artery in patients with decompensated alcoholic liver cirrhosis.

      After providing written informed consent, subjects will return to the study center for
      further evaluation and to have their Bone marrow harvested by an experienced hematologist or
      interventional radiologist.

      Within approximately 1 month (30 ± 7 days) after Bone marrow aspiration, study participants
      will be admitted to the study center on Day 1.

      At the study center, the participant will undergo hepatic artery catheterization by an
      interventional radiologist who will inject a single dose of Cellgram™. Participants will
      remain as in-patients and be observed for 24 hours post-infusion. Following discharge,
      participants will periodically return to the study center for study assessment visits over a
      period of 1 year.

      When a suitable candidate is identified by the Investigator, the Investigator or designated
      healthcare professional will ask the patient about his/her willingness to be included in the
      clinical study. Following this, patients will be allowed sufficient time, in their own
      opinion, to consider study entry, and will be offered the opportunity to ask any further
      questions prior to signing the informed consent form.

    <measure>Incidence of Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side-effect, or precaution. With respect to human clinical experience, this includes any event that:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening.*
Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Other medically important condition
Life-threatening in the definition of a SAE or adverse reaction refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Child-Pugh Score will be used to determine the prognosis, required strength of treatment and the necessity of liver transplantation. The score employs 5 clinical measures of liver disease (total bilirubin, serum albumin, INR, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy). Each parameter is scored 1 to 3, with 3 indicating the most severe derangement.</description>

    <description>MELD uses the patient's values for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the INR for PT to predict survival. It is calculated according to the following formula defined by Kamath et al (2001):
MELD = 3.78×ln[serum bilirubin (mg/dL)] + 11.2×ln[INR] + 9.57×ln[serum creatinine (mg/dL)] + 6.43</description>
