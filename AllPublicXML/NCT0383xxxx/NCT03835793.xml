      Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy (RRSO) at the age of 35 to 45 years is recommended for
      women with a high genetic risk for ovarian cancer. While this procedure decreases the risk of
      ovarian cancer by 80-96%, it also results in an immediate menopause. Current research on
      potential adverse effects of premenopausal risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, such as
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease, compromised bone health, cognitive dysfunction and
      reduced quality of life, is limited, mostly due to short follow up.

      The investigators will conduct a multicenter cross-sectional study nested in a cohort of BRCA
      mutation carriers from 8 Dutch centers for hereditary cancer. Eligible participants are women
      who underwent RRSO before the age of 45. The participants will be frequency-matched on
      current age with women above the age of 55 without RRSO or with RRSO after the age of 55.
      Participants will complete an online questionnaire containing various questions about
      lifestyle, medical history, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, bone health, cognition
      and quality of life. Participants will be asked to visit one of the participating hospitals
      for a blood test, a cardiovascular assessment and a DEXA scan for determining bone mineral
      density. Afterwards participants will be requested to perform the online Amsterdam Cognition
      Scale.

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Women at high genetic risk of ovarian cancer are advised to undergo risk-reducing
      salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) at ages 35-45 years. Currently, in the Netherlands ~500 women/
      year opt for RRSO, which minimizes ovarian cancer risk and may decrease breast cancer (BC)
      risk as well, due to reduced gonadal hormone levels. Besides favorable effects of RRSO on
      ovarian cancer and, potentially, BC risk, RRSO induces immediate menopause, which may have
      unfavorable long-term health consequences. Early menopause has been associated with increased
      risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), lower bone mineral density (BMD), cognitive
      impairment, and decreased quality of life. Current evidence regarding these health effects is
      mainly based on women with a natural early menopause, and it is unknown whether these results
      hold for women undergoing RRSO at early premenopausal ages.

      Objective: The investigators will investigate long-term health effects of premenopausal RRSO
      on (subclinical) cardiovascular status, BMD, cognition and quality of life.

      Study design: the investigators will assess long-term health effects of RRSO in a
      cross-sectional study, among 500 women who underwent premenopausal RRSO compared to 250 women
      of the same age without RRSO (or with RRSO after age 55). Eligible women will be invited to
      participate in a screening program assessing cardiovascular status, bone mineral density,
      cognitive functioning and quality of life.

      Study population: Women are eligible for the premenopausal RRSO group if:

        -  RRSO before the age of 45 years;

        -  RRSO was done 10 or more years ago; Women are eligible for the comparison group without
           premenopausal RRSO if the participant did not undergo RRSO before the age of 55 years,
           and did not have a natural or therapy induced menopause before age 50.

      Primary study outcome: To study long-term effects of premenopausal RRSO on:

        -  (subclinical) CVD

        -  BMD

        -  Cognition

      Secondary study outcome: To study long-term effects of premenopausal RRSO on:

        -  Quality of life

        -  Urogenital problems

        -  Cardiovascular risk factors

      Furthermore, the investigators will examine the influence of age at RRSO, time since RRSO,
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT), carrier ship of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and BC history
      on the outcome.

      The obtained knowledge will assist physicians in counselling women with high ovarian cancer
      risk and help them to make well-informed decisions.

        Women are eligible if they underwent RRSO before age 45 and the RRSO was done 10 or more
        years ago (early RRSO group) and women are eligible as control group if they did not
        undergo RRSO, or underwent RRSO after age 55 while reaching natural menopause after the age
        of 50 years. The comparison group will be frequency-matched with the RRSO group on
        categories of calendar year of birth, and breast cancer history. For each patient with
        breast cancer, the investigators will perform individual matching accounting for age at
        breast cancer diagnosis and carrier status. For the early RRSO group the investigators
        select women who underwent RRSO at least 10 years ago and are currently older than 55 years
        because the investigators expect subclinical atherosclerosis not to manifest earlier.
