  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Biofeedback-Surface electromyography (BIO-SEMG) is a relatively recent
      physiotherapy technique. Although its use is widespread in sports science and sports
      performance, its use for the rehabilitation of patients with neurological pathologies is less
      studied.

      Objective: The purpose of this research was to determine the changes that occur in the
      application of BIO-SEMG in the muscles responsible for the extension and the dorsiflexion of
      the hand and the foot in subjects with cerebrovascular damage.

      Design: A randomized, double-blind, two-arm parallel group study was performed.

      Patients: A sample of 28 subjects with limited extension of the hand and dorsiflexion of the
      foot as a consequence of a stroke was randomized divided in intervention or control groups.

      Methods: The subjects of the intervention group underwent 12 sessions of BIO-SEMG, of
      15-minute duration each of them, in the upper and lower members. On the other hand, the
      control group underwent another 12 sessions of 15-minute duration, in which manual
      physiotherapy techniques were performed.
