  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the possibility and the safety of performing local therapy for
      Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) using radiofrequency ablation of the tumor
      under ultrasonography (EUS) guidance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) are rare, but their incidence has significantly
      increased in the last decades. The mainstay treatment of PanNENs is surgery, which is
      associated with a significant benefit in term of survival but also with significant short-
      and long-term adverse events.

      Based on the above data, less invasive alternative therapeutic interventions to avoid short-
      and long-term adverse events of surgery are needed.

      In this context radiofrequency ablation has been reported to be effective in the treatment of
      these tumors in absence of major adverse events. However, the available studies on the matter
      are limited by small sample size and lack of standardized criteria for patient selection.

    <description>AEs will be classified as procedural when they occur during the procedure; post-procedural when they will occur up to 14 days after the procedure; late when they will occur more than 14 days after the procedure. Minor AEs will be those that need no therapy and have no sequelae (A) or have minor therapy or consequence, including overnight admission (B). Major events include those that require major therapy or hospitalization (24- 48 hours) (C); major therapy, need unplanned increase in level of care, or hospitalization &gt;48 hours (D); or result in permanent adverse sequelae (E) and death (F).</description>

    <description>The EUS-RFA system (Taewoong, Seoul, Korea) utilized for EUS-RFA consists of an 19-gauge needle electrode (140-cm long), a radiofrequency generator, and an inner cooling system that circulates chilled saline solution during the RFA procedure. The inner metal part is insulated over its entire length, with the exception of the terminal 5 to 20mm for energy delivery. The needle electrode is attached to a radio frequency current generator (VIVA RF generator; Taewoong) and to a cooling pump. The generator, in addition to providing radio frequency current, allows the control of physical power and impedance parameters.</description>
