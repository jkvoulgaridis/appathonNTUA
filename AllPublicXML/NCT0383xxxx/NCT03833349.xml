      The purpose of the study is to learn about the impact of exercise on fatigue, anxiety, and
      depression in Parkinson's disease. It is well established that exercise improves the motor
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, it is not clear which types of exercise are most
      beneficial for specific non-motor symptoms.

      This is a multi-site trial (12 patients in each site). The investigators are recruiting 24
      patients who will be randomized into either a spinning class, yoga class, dance class, or no
      exercise intervention. Classes will be conducted twice a week for 6 weeks total at times
      convenient for the patients. Patients will also be asked to complete questionnaires after
      exercise classes to see if the exercise intervention improves measures of fatigue, anxiety,
      and depression - and what exercise intervention may be superior. All participants will be
      asked to complete questionnaires each week and will be asked to wear a &quot;Microsoft exercise
      band&quot; during the course of the study. Use of the exercise band is optional.
