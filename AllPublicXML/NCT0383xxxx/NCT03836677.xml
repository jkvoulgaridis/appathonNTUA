      This is a randomised, controlled, two period cross-over, 4 weeks chronic dosing, study to
      evaluate the effects of Budesonide/Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate (BGF) and
      Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate (GFF) on airway dimensions.

      This is a randomised, controlled, two period cross-over, 4 weeks chronic dosing, study to
      evaluate the effects of Budesonide/Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate (BGF), and
      Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate (GFF), on specific image based airway volumes and
      resistance in subjects with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. In this
      study, airway dimension parameters will be calculated for each of the active compounds.

      This imaging methodology will allow an assessment of the extent of airway changes using a
      triple combination of Budesonide/Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate (BGF) and the dual
      combination Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate (GFF).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subject must be 40 years to â‰¤80 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed
        consent form at Visit 1.

          -  COPD Diagnosis: Subjects with an established clinical history of COPD

          -  Screening clinical laboratory tests must be acceptable to the Investigator.

          -  Screening ECG must be acceptable to the Investigator

          -  Individual Compliance: Subjects must be willing to remain at the study center as
             required per protocol to complete all visit assessments

          -  Patients should be on scheduled maintenance treatment with one or more inhaled
             bronchodilator therapies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As judged by the investigator, any evidence of significant diseases other than COPD,
             i.e., disease or condition which, in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable
             for the subject to participate in the trial.

          -  Spirometry Performance:

               1. Subjects who cannot perform acceptable spirometry, i.e., meet ATS/ERS
                  acceptability criteria.

               2. Repeatability: Subjects who cannot perform technically acceptable spirometry in
                  accordance with ATS repeatability criteria

          -  Cancer: Subjects who have cancer that has not been in complete remission for at least
             five years.

          -  Substance Abuse: Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, significantly abuse
             alcohol or drugs

          -  Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator are unable to abstain from prohibited
             medications including LABA/LAMAs/ICS
