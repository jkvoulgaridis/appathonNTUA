  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HNC survivors with BID will be randomized to 5-weeks of tablet-based BRIGHT (n=24) or
      tablet-based AC (electronic information about HNC recovery; n=24). Participants will complete
      the Body Image Scale (a validated measure of BID; primary outcome) and measures of
      psychological, social, and emotional wellbeing (secondary outcomes) at baseline, 1-week, and
      1-month and 3-month post-intervention to assess the preliminary clinical impact of BRIGHT on
      BID in HNC survivors.

      HNC survivors in BRIGHT or AC will complete the Body Image Coping Strategies Inventory
      (mediator; a validated measure of body image coping behavior) at baseline, 1-week, 1-month,
      and 3-months post-intervention to assess the role of image coping behavior as the behavioral
      mechanism of BRIGHT.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following screening and informed consent, eligible participants will complete baseline
      questionnaires measuring BID and psychological, social, and emotional wellbeing. Participants
      will then be randomized to BRIGHT (n=24) or AC (n=24) and undergo weekly, tablet-based BRIGHT
      or AC for 5 weeks.

      The BRIGHT intervention consists of 5 weekly, 60-minute, tablet-based, one-one telehealth
      sessions with a licensed therapist. BRIGHT Therapist: A licensed clinical psychologist
      (Consultant: Stacey Maurer, PhD) with extensive experience managing pyscho-oncologic concerns
      in patients with HNC will deliver BRIGHT. Dr. Maurer developed the BRIGHT manual and worked
      with the study team to deliver BRIGHT in our single-arm pilot study.

      The control intervention in this study will be matched to replicate the frequency, intensity,
      and delivery method of BRIGHT. Participants in the AC arm will thus undergo 5 weekly,
      60-minute, tablet-based video sessions in which they undergo non-manualized discussions with
      a non-trained member of the study team.

      Following randomization, patients in each arm will receive a study-issued, cellular-enabled
      iPad loaded with Vidyo, a video teleconference platform that allows the participant to
      connect to the study psychologist (BRIGHT) or AC. Vidyo allows face-face communication for
      tele-CBT for HNC patients who can articulate well, but also includes a within-video text
      message feature for aphonic (due to surgical removal of the larynx) or severely dysarthric
      (due to surgical removal of a significant amount of the tongue) HNC patients who are unable
      to participate in tele-CBT by speaking. The study iPads are locked to prevent downloading of
      additional applications. Participants receive a pictorial instructional booklet for logging
      on to Vidyo. No user names, logins, or URL are necessary to connect to the BRIGHT session.
      The participant simply clicks on the Vidyo application which takes the participant to the
      assigned teleconference room. At the conclusion of the 5-week intervention, participants
      return iPads to the study team in pre-addressed, stamped, padded mailers that are provided to
      the patient.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in BIS score from baseline to 1-month post intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary clinical endpoint is change in Body Image Scale (BIS) score from baseline to 1-month post intervention. The BIS is a validated, 10-item patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that assesses the affective, cognitive, and emotional aspects of body image due to cancer or its treatment over the prior 7 days. Responses include 'not at all', 'a little', 'quite a bit', and 'very much', and are scored from 0-3, respectively. Total BIS scores can range from 0-30, with higher scores indicating greater body image dissatisfaction. The BIS is a reliable PROM validated in oncology patients and has been widely used to study BID in patients with HNC.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Image Coping Strategies Inventory (BICSI) scores from baseline to 1-month post intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BICSI is a 29-item validated measure of the cognitive and behavioral responses to manage threats to body image. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale; scores range from 0-57 with higher scores indicating better coping strategies.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in IMAGE-HN scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IMAGE-HN is a psychometrically sound, 24-item, multi-domain PROM consisting of 4 sub-scales and a global scale that can be used to measure key aspects of HNC-related BID due to HNC or its treatment. Responses include 'Never', 'Rarely', 'Sometimes', 'Often', 'Always', corresponding to a Likert scale of 0-4, respectively. Total IMAGE-HN scores on the global domain (21 questions) range from 0-84, with higher scores indicated greater HNC-related body image dissatisfaction. Raw scores for each sub-scale as well as the global scale can be converted to scaled scores for each, which range from 0-100 with higher scores representing greater HNC-related BID.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Shame and Stigma Scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Shame and Stigma Scale is a 20-item, validated, unidimensional PROM that measures four domains (shame with appearance, stigma, regret, and social/speech concerns) in patients with HNC over the prior 7 days. Responses include 'never', 'seldom', 'sometimes', 'often', and 'all the time' and are scored 0-4, respectively. The total score is calculated by summing the individual responses (except for 4 questions which are reverse scored) and thus ranges from 0-80. Higher scores reflect greater shame and stigma from HNC.</description>

    <measure>Change in PROMIS SF v1.0-Depression 8a scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS SF v1.0-Depression 8a is a validated, 8-item measure developed by the NIH to assess self-reported negative mood, views of self, and decreased positive affect and engagement. Items are scored using a 5-point Likert scale from 'never' to 'always' (1-5). The total score is calculated by summing the individual responses and thus ranges from 8-40. Higher scores reflect more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in PROMIS SF v1.0-Anxiety 8a scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS SF v1.0-Anxiety 8a is a validated, 8-item measure developed by the NIH to assess self-reported fear, worry, and hyperarousal46. Items are scored using a 5-point Likert scale from 'never' to 'always' (1-5). The total score is calculated by summing the individual responses and thus ranges from 8-40. Higher scores reflect more severe anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS SF v2.0-Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities 8a is a validated, 8-item, measure developed by the NIH to assess self-reported satisfaction with performing one's usual social roles and activities. Items are scored using a 5-point Likert scale from 'not at all' to 'very much' (1-5). The total score is calculated by summing the individual responses and thus ranges from 8-40. Higher scores reflect more severe anxiety.</description>

    <description>PROMIS SF v2.0-Social Isolation 8a is a validated, 8-item, measure developed by the NIH to assess self-reported perceptions of being avoided, excluded or unknown by others. Items are scored using a 5-point Likert scale from 'never' to 'always' (1-5). The total score is calculated by summing the individual responses and thus ranges from 8-40. Higher scores reflect more severe social isolation.</description>
