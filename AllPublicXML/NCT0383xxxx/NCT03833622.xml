  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop and refine a shared decision making (SDM) intervention (decision
      aid tool) to improve and normalize high quality end of life discussions in the Emergency
      Department (ED) setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Develop a shared decision making (SDM) intervention informed by insights elicited from
      patients and clinicians to improve goals of care discussions.

      The process of decision aid design involves: (1) review and synthesis of the evidence; (2) an
      analysis of usual practice through observation of clinical encounters; (3) development of an
      initial decision aid prototype; (4) field testing in the context of clinical care to gain
      insights on both intended and unintended effects of its use in practice to facilitate patient
      centered goals of care discussions; and (5) successive iterations of the decision aid until
      thematic saturation is reached and it is ready for testing in a clinical trial.
