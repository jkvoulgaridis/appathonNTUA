  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enrol African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) women who are known to have a more
      diverse vaginal microbiome, higher rates of bacterial vaginosis with lower numbers of
      protective lactobacilli, and are at increased risk for HIV. The investigators will evaluate
      the safety, feasibility, effect on the vaginal bacterial microbiome and changes in local
      immune and inflammatory responses with the administration of vaginal estrogen alone, vaginal
      estrogen in combination with oral or vaginally administered probiotics, or vaginal probiotics
      alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women are at increased risk of HIV acquisition compared with men. A number of biological
      factors are associated with increased risk, many of which likely enhance risk by increasing
      inflammation in the female genital tract. Susceptibility to infections and immune responses
      in the female genital tract are regulated by hormones: progesterone increases inflammation
      and HIV susceptibility and estrogen decreases inflammation and enhances colonization with
      Lactobacilli.

      A Lactobacillus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with increased protection against
      HIV, while a polymicrobial vaginal flora, as seen in bacterial vaginosis, is associated with
      increased risk. About 40% of ACB women have a polymicrobial flora.

      The goal of this study is to establish a Lactobacillus dominant vaginal microbiome in ACB
      women, that will be associated with decreased inflammation and decreased susceptibility to
      HIV, by administering a low level of intravaginal estrogen to increase colonization with
      Lactobacilli together with a Lactobacillus-containing probiotic.
