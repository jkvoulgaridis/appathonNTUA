    <textblock>
      Background:

      Sacubitril/valsartan, has been found to be more beneficial than enalapril for reducing the
      incidences of sudden cardiac death, death from worsening heart failure (HF), and
      hospitalization. However, there is no prospective echocardiographic data describing the
      effects of sacubitril/valsartan on the heart functions and left ventricular (LV) reverse
      remodeling. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of
      sacubitril/valsartan on the LV functions using two dimensional (2D), three dimensional (3D)
      echocardiography and the 3D strain parameters.

      Methods:

      In 100 patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HRrEF) who have indications for the
      use of sacubitril/valsartan as recommended by recent guidelines were prospectively enrolled.
      The basal 2D and 3D echocardiographic parameters were compared to those obtained 3 months
      after starting the sacubitril/valsartan treatment.
