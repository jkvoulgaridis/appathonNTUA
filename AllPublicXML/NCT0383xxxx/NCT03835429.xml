  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is expected to determine the efficacy of using the midline traction designed
      MyTAP plus mouth shield (MyTAP + MS) oral appliance combination in decreasing the number of
      Atrial Fibrillation events. The MS is a patient comfort accessory to the MyTAP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is highly prevalent in the U.S. and possesses a greater risk in
      patients with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) versus patients without SDB. AF recurrence
      after catheter ablation is associated with 25% increased risk in patients with obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA). One hypothesis suggests that the repeated hypoxic episodes time-linked to
      OSA and central sleep apnea may act as chemo-reflex triggers that enhances brainstem
      sympathetic activity in conjunction with responses to OSA-event hypoxia. This hypothesis is
      believed to induce tachycardia and cardiovascular stress. In an animal model, episodes of
      hypoxia were shown to induce pulmonary vein burst firing and reduction of the negative
      tracheal pressure promptly restored normal sinus rhythm. The Trigeminocardiac reflex
      hypothesis implicates chemo- and mechanoreceptors in the oronasal cavity that provides
      signaling to the reticular formation via the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve
      and serves to control breathing, cardiac function, blood pH, amongst other body functions.

      The sympathetic system in patients with OSA syndrome is considered to be chronically
      hypersensitized. A hyperarousal state suggests AF patients with OSA would tend to have AF
      occur more frequently in conjunction with apnea hypopnea events. An increase in autonomic
      sympathetic cardiac dominance with a withdrawal of cardiac parasympathetic control could
      easily be driven by mechanoreceptors in the oropharynx upon airway narrowing and present as
      decreased heart rate variability. Considering that the upper airway is often the site of
      greatest airflow restriction (i.e. snoring), a potential sudden rise in autonomic sympathetic
      nerve activity in sensory afferent fibers from the oropharynx should be the first to
      communicate the airflow reduction to brainstem. This theory is supported by our own
      preliminary data and those in other reports. Oral appliance (OA) therapy that prevents
      snoring in conjunction with a mouth shield should simultaneously facilitate an open airway
      and prevent mouth breathing. The combination effect is expected to decrease vagus nerve motor
      efferent activity to the esophagus, facilitate nasal breathing, reduce sympathetic tone,
      promote stable sleep and increase HRV. In patients with AF, the MyTAP + MS intervention is
      likely to also facilitate putatively effective medical therapies, reduce noxious AF triggers,
      and maintain normal oral bacterial flora levels and cardiac functioning.
