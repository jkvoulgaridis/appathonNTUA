      An aerobic physical exercise protocol will be applied to patients admitted in ward due to
      decompensated heart failure, in order to validate the efficacy and safety of physical
      exercise in this phase of clinical stabilization, through the said training protocol - ERIC
      program.

      With the objective of validating the efficacy and safety of physical exercise as a
      therapeutic resource in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure; will be applied,
      by rehabilitation nurses, a protocol of physical exercise, with increasing levels of
      intensity. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized through an online
      program (randomizer.org) and the ERIC protocol will be applied to the test group. The control
      group will be implemented the usual care of rehabilitation nursing. The ERIC protocol
      comprises 5 levels of intensity, as following shown: Stage 1 - respiratory and calisthenic
      exercises (5-10 minutes) Stage 2 - pedal for 5-10 minutes Stage 3 - aerobic training: walking
      on the corridor for 5-10 minutes Stage 4 - aerobic training: walking on the corridor for
      10-15 minutes Stage 5 - aerobic training: walking on the corridor for 15 minutes + climbing
      stairs for 5 minutes All patients will be monitored and followed up by a rehabilitation nurse
      while they are doing the exercise. The investigator decides, depending on the patient's
      performance and clinical conditions, the form of progression in the program, but it is
      mandatory to follow the previously defined levels of intensity.

      Patients in the test group may start the program only on stage I or II according to clinical
      criteria. At admission of the patients (test group and control group) clinical and
      sociodemographic parameters are evaluated, as well as data related to Barthel's indices and
      London Chest of activities of daily living (LCADL). At the discharge date, the Barthel index
      and the LCADL scale will also be evaluated, as well as the 6-minute walking test.
