  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is widely used in the gallbladder stone, gallbladder polyp,
      gallbladder cancer and other diseases. Some of the patients would develop diarrhea after
      surgery, and studies have reported an increased risk of colorectal cancer after LC. The aim
      of the present study was to examine the effects of LC on the gut microbiota.

    <description>A special catheter was inserted into the peritoneal cavity, and then about 2-5 liters of carbon dioxide was injected. After reaching a certain pressure, four small holes of 0.5-1.5cm were opened in the abdomen to dissect the structure of the triangle of the gallbladder. The gallbladder duct and gallbladder artery were cut off and closed, and then the entire gallbladder was removed.</description>
