  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, non-interventional retrospective medical records review. The
      study will involve identification of medical records of patients with confirmed locally
      advanced unresectable or metastatic ES, who initiated systemic therapy between January 1,
      2000 and December 31, 2017.

      Data for the chart review will be extracted retrospectively from eligible subjects' charts
      (electronic or paper). Information on prior surgical treatment and neoadjuvant/adjuvant
      therapies for ES will also be collected for ineligible subjects with a locally advanced or
      metastatic ES diagnosis who did not initiated systemic therapy. Data collected will be
      anonymized by the investigators and will not be traceable back to individual subjects by the
      sponsor (i.e., no protected health information [PHI] will be collected).

      The sampling period will span from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2017. As the chart
      abstraction dates may be different across institutions due to contracting and other
      logistical issues, to avoid seeing biased outcomes that may be related to this type of
      heterogeneity, a consistent study end date will be imposed for all patients when conducting
      the analysis. Information before this study end date will be analyzed and used to conduct the
      analysis.

        The study population will consist of Epithelioid Sarcoma (ES) patients (approximately 70 to
        100) from approximately five (5) academic centers (i.e., study sites) in the US. The
        sampling period will span from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2017.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with histologically confirmed, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic
             Epithelioid Sarcoma (ES) requiring systemic therapy during between January 1, 2000 and
             December 31, 2017. The date of the confirmed locally advanced unresectable or
             metastatic ES diagnosis is designated as the index date.

          -  Patients may have a date of ES diagnosis at an earlier stage prior to 2000 and still
             be eligible for the study

          -  Initiation of treatment with any systemic anti-cancer therapy for the treatment of
             their locally advanced unresectable or metastatic ES between January 1, 2000 and
             December 31, 2017

          -  At least 10 years of age at the index date
