      This study in order to evaluate the Baicalein Tablets' safety and efficiency for audit with
      influenza, The trial designed by randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      and optimal efficiency. Subjects will be randomly assigned to low-dose group, high-dose group
      or placebo group as 1:1:1 proportionally, planned to enroll 180 subjects, each group enroll
      60 subjects. The primary indicator is the time of fever relieving, comparison after the
      second visit. The secondary indicator are symptom alleviating time of influenza, percentage
      of subjects with influenza complications, percentage of antipyretic drugs used, percentage of
      virus positive to negative, comparison at the end of the experiment.
