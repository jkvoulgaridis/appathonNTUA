    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a brief,
      virtual, group-based cognitive-behavioral intervention for breast cancer survivors taking
      hormonal therapy. The intervention (STRIDE) aims to alleviate symptoms related to hormonal
      therapy or breast cancer, optimize medication-taking (i.e., adherence), and reduce distress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The majority of breast cancer is hormone sensitive and treated with 10 years of
      adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) (i.e., tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) to reduce risk of
      recurrence and improve survival; however, adherence to AET among breast cancer survivors
      (BCS) is a challenge, with half of women becoming non-adherent within five years. Difficulty
      coping with symptoms (e.g., sleep problems, hot flashes, weight gain, fatigue) and
      psychosocial distress (i.e., depression or anxiety symptoms), and other emotional and
      logistical factors are major barriers to adherence. There is a dearth of efficacious
      interventions targeting the needs and adherence challenges of BCS prescribed AET.

      Objective: To address this gap, the proposed study, funded by the National Cancer Institute,
      employs a mixed-methods design to develop and test an evidence-based intervention (STRIDE) to
      enhance adherence to AET, improve symptom management, and reduce distress in breast cancer
      survivors.

      Specific Aims: The primary aims of this study are: 1) to examine the feasibility and
      acceptability of a tailored, small-group, virtual intervention (STRIDE) compared to a
      medication monitoring control for survivors of breast cancer taking AET, and 2) to explore
      the effects of the STRIDE intervention on adherence to AET, symptom distress, and
      satisfaction with AET.

      Study Design: Phase 1 included (1) semi-structured interviews with BCS on AET (n=30) and
      intervention development with psychologists and oncology clinicians. The intervention is a a
      brief, virtual, small-group, cognitive-behavioral intervention that aims to alleviate
      symptoms and side effects related to hormonal therapy or breast cancer, optimize
      medication-taking, and reduce emotional distress for breast cancer survivors taking hormonal
      therapy. Phase 2 will entail a run-in phase (n=5) to evaluate acceptability and further
      refine the intervention, followed by a randomized controlled pilot trial (n=75) to assess the
      feasibility of comparing the STRIDE intervention to a medication monitoring control with
      assessments and adherence monitoring over the course of six months. Participants will be
      recruited at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and three community satellite
      sites. Eligible participants will be hormone-receptor positive breast cancer survivors
      prescribed AET who are experiencing distress related to AET (e.g., adherence difficulties,
      side effects, etc.). This research study involves completing 3 questionnaire batteries at the
      time of enrollment, 10 weeks, and 24 weeks. The participant will also be asked to store their
      hormonal therapy pills in a medication bottle provided by the study team throughout the 24
      week study period. If the participants are randomized to receive the STRIDE intervention, the
      participant will have five weekly one-hour virtual (videoconferencing) sessions in small
      groups with a trained clinician followed by two 15-minute check-in phone calls later in the
      study.

    <description>Hypothesis 1: Feasibility will be assessed by recruitment (enrollment rate &gt; 50%), retention (follow-up assessment completion rate &gt; 70% of all participants who complete baseline) and attendance (attendance rate of at least 70% of participants completing at least 3 of 5 sessions [60%]).
Hypothesis 2: The study will be acceptable demonstrated by &gt;75% of participants reporting average satisfaction scores greater than the scale's mid-point (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire).</description>

    <description>Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS Caps): Participants will store mediation in the MEMS bottles to electronically monitor adjuvant endocrine therapy daily dose and timing of dose administration. Prescribed medication, dose, and timing will be identified in the Electronic Health Record and verified by the patient. Adherence will be calculated as the percentage of medication taken of the total prescribed. Monthly and weekly adherence scores will be calculated to examine different in adherence rates and changes across the 24-week study period between groups.</description>

    <description>Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5): Changes in self-reported adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy between groups will be explored using the MARS-5 at 3- and 6-months post-baseline. The MARS-5 assesses adherence to treatment and has been used specifically in the context of AET adherence. The scale consists of five items that ask about suboptimal adherence behaviors, such as &quot;I stop taking my adjuvant endocrine therapy medicine for a while.&quot; Each item is answered on a scale of 1 (Always) to 5 (Never).</description>

    <description>Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ): Changes in self-reported satisfaction with AET will be explored between groups at 10 and 24-weeks post-baseline with the Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ). The CTSQ is a previously published 21-item measure that evaluates patients' beliefs about the following aspects of medical care: expectations of the effectiveness of cancer therapy, feelings about side effects, oral cancer therapy adherence, satisfaction with cancer therapy, stopping cancer therapy, and reasons for non-adherence. Each item is scored on a scale of 1 (&quot;Never&quot; or &quot;Very inconvenient&quot;) to 5 (&quot;Always&quot; or Very Convenient&quot;). A greater score on this measure indicates greater patient cancer therapy satisfaction.</description>

    <description>Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Symptom Scale (BCPT): The investigators will examine changes in self-reported symptom distress on the BCPT between groups at 10- and 24-weeks post-baseline. The BCPT is a symptom checklist used to document physical and psychological symptoms associated with ET use. The measure includes several clinically-relevant symptom subscales and has been used broadly in previous studies on symptom distress in breast cancer patients. The BCPT asks participants to rate how much they have been bothered by several symptoms over the past week on a scale of 0 (Not at all bothered) to 4 (Extremely bothered).</description>
