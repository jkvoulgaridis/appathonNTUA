  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) is a distinct type of biliary tumor
      characterised with delicate fibrovascular stalks (papillary of villous) covered at biliary
      epithelium. The typical pathologic feature is dramatical dilation of affected bile ducts due
      to obstruction by mucin production. IPNB has a better prognosis than bile duct carcinoma, but
      the current proposed entity contains multiple definitions or categories, thus confused in
      pathology.

      Although mutations of several genes on IPNBs (such as GNAS, KRAS, APC, CTNNB1, and RNF43)
      identified in previous studies, there is still an unification at gene expression signature.

      This research trial will use whole exome sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis in
      finding causative mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from IPNBs patients.

      Using production-scale platform, this study will carry out whole exome sequencing from
      archival (FFPE) material to Identification and classification of significantly mutated genes,
      determine the somatic genomic alterations that may be relevant to the development or
      treatment of cancer, establish classification of IPNBs gene mutation signature. Next,
      analysis of gene mutation signature and IPNBs clinicopathologic outcomes, including the
      association between pathologic type, long-term oncological outcomes and gene mutation
      signature. Last, the determination of involved signal pathways at IPNB patients.
