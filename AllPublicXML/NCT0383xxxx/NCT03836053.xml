      28-day continuous intravenous infusion in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple
      myeloma, to test the 600 mcg/d dose, given as a 28-day continuous iV infusion.

      Cohort 1 will consist of 10 subjects dosed at 400 mcg/d. Cohort 2 will consist of 10 subjects
      dosed at 600 mcg/d. All doses will be given as a 28-day continuous IV infusion, followed by a
