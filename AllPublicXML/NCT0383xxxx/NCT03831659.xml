    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of migraine in infertile women and
      during in Vitro Fertilization protocol. Migraine is two to three times as common in women as
      in men. Migraine has considerable impact on quality of life. In Vitro Fertilization has
      become a common therapeutic modality in modern fertility medicines. Treatment protocols are
      associated with exaggerated hormonal fluctuations. Estrogen is considered to be closely
      linked to migraine and its fluctuations have been considered to trigger migrainous headaches.

      In Vitro Fertilization has become a common therapeutic modality in modern fertility
      medicines. Treatment protocols are associated with exaggerated hormonal fluctuations.
      Estrogen is considered to be closely linked to migraine and its fluctuations have been
      considered to trigger migrainous headaches.

      Both migraine and infertility are associated with impaired quality of life.

      Objectives: to assess the prevalence of migraine in infertile women and during in Vitro
      Fertilization protocol in order to improve the management of these patients.

      Protocol:

      Women coming to consult at the Port Royal infertility center and meeting the inclusion
      (infertile women without long-term analgesic treatment) criteria will be offered the study.
      The information note and no objection form will be given by the gynecologist receiving them
      for consultation. After collecting their non-opposition, a self-questionnaire will be given
      to them. This questionnaire is validated in the literature concerning the diagnosis of
      migraine. It includes questions about medical history and possible headaches. The patient
      fills it immediately and gives it to the investigator. As part of the usual management, and
      regardless of their answers to the questionnaire, some of the patients will be reviewed in
      consultation for the programming of an IVF. During this &quot;incoming&quot; consultation with one of
      the midwives of the unit, a schedule of migraine headaches will be given to the patients.
      They will keep it, will complete it in case of migraine, and will give it to the gynecologist
      during the embryo transfer or the doctor receiving the couple in consultation on day 7 in
      case of absence of embryo transfer.
