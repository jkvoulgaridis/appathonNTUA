      This study will evaluate maternal tolerance to several BUP dose reduction strategies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use has reached a staggering level and the associated deaths, neonatal consequences
      and economic impact are devastating. Pregnancy provides a window of opportunity for women
      with an opioid use disorder (OUD) to seek assistance by participating in a program that
      offers medication-assisted treatment (MAT), most commonly with buprenorphine (BUP) or
      methadone. BUP offers advantages over methadone including ease of administration and less
      severe neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) but has a higher discontinuation rate, especially
      during induction. The high discontinuation rate may be due to an inadequate dosing as the
      current dosing strategies are not informed by pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic (PD)
      data in pregnancy. The lack of BUP PD data hampers development of an effective dosing
      strategy and challenges the validity of the primary tools used to gauge maternal and infant
      withdrawal. Neither the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) nor the Finnegan score for
      the diagnosis of NAS considers the pharmacology of BUP and therefore may not provide a valid
      representation of opioid withdrawal. BUP PD data are critically necessary to address these
      issues and are also necessary to develop detoxification regimens. Creation of safe and
      effective detoxification regimens requires a pharmacological basis and must be developed in
      the context that the brain requires time to adjust to opioid induced changes. In this
      proposal, investigators hypothesize that determination of BUP pharmacodynamics will improve
      care for the pregnant opioid dependent mother and her baby and will fill the critical
      knowledge gaps needed for safe and effective management of women with an OUD.

      As part of the dose reduction clinical trial, investigators will compare dose reduction
      strategies for BUP in pregnancy that are based on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of BUP. The dose reduction strategies that will be evaluated in this clinical
      trial are part of a larger project including an observational study.

    <time_frame>4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will monitor plasma levels (ng/ml) of buprenorphine+metabolites (BUP+M), neurotransmitters, and cotinine levels during weekly clinic visits. The subject's weekly plasma concentrations will be compared to the VAS scores to determine the change in mu receptor sensitivity.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS questionnaire consists of 4 questions related to cravings, withdrawal, sleep quality and sleep duration. Subjects will complete this questionnaire daily and at the weekly clinic visits. Subjects will grade each category on a scale of 0-100 in increments of 10. The VAS scores will be used within and across groups to evaluate the tolerance of the dose reductions (magnitude and frequency).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The COWS questionnaire consists of 11 questions and will be completed at the weekly clinic visits. Responses to each question are graded on a scale of 0-4 and the total of all responses correlates to a particular withdrawal severity: mild (5-12), moderate (13-24), moderately severe (25-36), severe (&gt;36). COWS scores will be used to assess the subject's tolerance to the dose reductions by measuring withdrawal and satiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SOWS questionnaire consists of 16 questions and will be completed at the weekly clinic visits. Responses to each question are graded on a scale of 0-4 and the total of all responses correlates to a particular withdrawal severity: mild (1-10), moderate (11-20), severe (21-30). SOWS scores will be used to assess the current subjective symptoms of withdrawal and satiety.</description>
