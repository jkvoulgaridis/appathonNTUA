    <description>At Week 0 and at Week 12, microbiota sampling will be performed by the same sampler (technician/nurse).
Skin microbiota sample will be collected on one test site of 4 cm2 on the middle of the left cheek and using aseptic techniques under sterile airflow generated by a portable hood.
According to the results of the primary variable, the Sponsor will decide to go ahead with the microbiota analysis which will be done by INRA Transfert.
DNA will be extracted from the swabs. PCR amplification will be performed for each DNA sample. DNA will be PCR amplified. Cleaned pools will be sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform.
Sequences will be then de-replicated and a database containing one sequence for each operational taxonomic unit will be generated.
Interpretation of these results will be done by Mercurialis.</description>
