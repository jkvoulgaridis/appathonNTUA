      Population 1:

      Measure the effect of size glasses from1-9% on stereopsis

      Population 2:

      Measure the effect of size glasses from 1-9% on stereopsis in two settings:

        -  before and after cataract surgery

        -  after dilation of the eye

      Population 1:

      21 eye healthy phakic individuals. Measurements: baseline stereopsis and stereopsis after
      size glass (1-9%) is added in front of the right eye and in front og the left eye. This
      measurement provides details on how much size difference a person can endure without
      impairing stereopsis.

      Population 2:

      11 phakic eye healthy individuals awaiting cataract operation on both eyes. Measurements are
      the same as population 1 but this study group is also measured after dilating the eyes. This
      is to see if accommodation affects the measurement. A postoperative measurement six weeks
      after cataract operation is also performed to examine if cataract operation affects the
      measurement.

    <description>How many percent aniseikonia is tolerated before stereopsis is impaired. Measured by first measuring baseline stereopsis and here after adding aniseikonic (size glass) from 1-9% in front of the right and left eye to measure if stereopsis is impaired. If stereopsis is impaired at 4% sizeglas then aniseikonia tolerance is 4%.</description>

    <description>Measurement of aniseikonia tolerance before and after surgery. Measurement: before and after surgery stereopsis is measured, hereafter aniseikonic glasses (size glass) from 1-9% is added in front of the right and left eye to see if stereopsis is impaired. If stereopsis is impaired with 3% aniseikonic glass then the tolerance is 3%. After surgery the measurement is repeated to examine if the aniseikonia tolerance is the same.</description>
