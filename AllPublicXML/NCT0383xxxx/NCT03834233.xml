  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is one of the most frequent malignancies worldwide,
      and an increasing incidence has been documented over the past decades. Despite optimal
      initial approach, which can be curative in the majority of cases, a proportion of patients
      present with locally advanced or unresectable disease, leading to significant morbidity. In
      addition, metastases of cSCC may affect 2 to 5% of individuals diagnosed with this disease.
      In the setting of advanced cSCC, no standard systemic treatment has been established, and
      treatment options are frequently adapted from those applied to squamous cell carcinoma
      arising from other sites, based on a low level of evidence and often with short-lived
      benefits.

      cSCC are potentially immunogenic neoplasms with an unmet need for therapeutic options, having
      sun exposure and chronic inflammation as the most significant risk factors. Using the
      anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab to treat patients with cSCC and planned scientific
      correlates, investigators believe that the safety and efficacy of immune activating therapy
      for this disease can be assessed.

      This is a multi-center, Simon two-stage, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of the anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab for systemic-treatment-naïve patients with
      metastatic and/or locally advanced cSCC.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, as assessed by the best
      objective response rate (complete response + partial response) at 24 weeks according to
      RECIST criteria, of nivolumab in patients with advanced cSCC. Secondary objectives are to
      assess the safety/tolerability of the treatment, to determine the progression-free survival
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 24 weeks, and to evaluate the objective response
      rate as assessed by immune-related response criteria (irRC). Treatment will be given every 14
      days until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent/patient
      decision. If the patient continues to benefit from treatment with nivolumab, treatment will
      be continued for up to 12 months. Patients will be reassessed at week 12 and every 12 weeks
      thereafter until week 52, and then as per discretion of the treating investigator. A tumor
      biopsy will be performed before treatment initiation, unless contraindicated and optional
      biopsies will be performed at week 13 and following disease progression. Serial blood samples
      will be obtained at baseline, during, and after treatment.
