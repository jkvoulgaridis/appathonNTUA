  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical radiotherapy to the prostate is conventionally treated with a full bladder with the
      aim of minimising dose to the bladder and small bowel to prevent significant side effects.
      Tolerance of the bladder filling protocol varies depending on patients' baseline urinary
      function. It is not uncommon for some men to have &quot;accidents&quot; during treatment causing
      understandable distress. This can also extend the treatment time and cause knock on delays in
      the radiotherapy department.

      Several United Kingdom (UK) centres report treating with an empty bladder. The investigators
      carried out a feasibility study comparing treatment with full bladder to empty bladder to
      ascertain if the investigators can safely change our protocol to that of an empty bladder.

      50 patients receiving radical radiotherapy to the prostate were randomised using closed
      envelope technique 1:1 into 2 groups. Group A followed the conventional drinking protocol at
      our centre (200ml prior to treatment) and group B were treated with an empty bladder.
      Baseline, end of treatment and 6 week follow up scores were prospectively collected for
      International prostate Symptom Score(IPSS), Late Effects Normal Tissue Task Force -
      Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT SOMA) bowel toxicity and quality of life
      questionnaires. The investigators also looked at bowel and bladder Dose Volume Histogram
      (DVH) to ensure constraints were met.

    <description>IPSS - The International Prostate Symptom Score is a 7 question scale which assesses urinary toxicity. Each question is scored 0-5 totalling a maximum score of 35. A score of 0-7 correlates to mildly symptomatic; 8-19, moderately symptomatic; 20-35, severely symptomatic.</description>

    <description>LENT SOMA - The Late Effects in Normal Tissues Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic Scales. This is a questionnaire that assesses individual bowel symptoms asking initially whether or not they occur and then scoring the frequency, the higher the score, the more frequent the event. Each question has it's own range of score which is explained on the questionnaire. The scores will be compared for individual questions and there will not be any combining of scores between questions.</description>
