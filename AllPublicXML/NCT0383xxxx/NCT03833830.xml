  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is characterized by the abnormal growth
      of blood vessels from the choroid into the subretinal space which leads to sub- and
      intraretinal fluid accumulation, hemorrhages and subretinal fibrosis with progressive loss of
      central vision. Intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment is the standard of care. Intravitreal
      anti-VEGF application might temporarily increase intraocular pressure due to a volume effect.
      It remains unclear if repeated injections might have an impact on retinal capillary
      perfusion. Therefore this study aims to investigate the vascular microcirculation differences
      between patients who received longterm intravitreal Anti-VEGF treatment and patients who
      recently started Anti-VEGF treatment using Optical Coherence tomography Angiography (OCTA).

      Main outcome parameters are:

        -  Vessel Perfusion Area (%) of central ETDRS subfields and peripapillar region as
           evaluated by OCTA (single measurement)

        -  Blood flux index(*) of central ETDRS subfields and peripapillar region as evaluated by
           OCTA (single measurement).

        -  Peripapillary and perifoveal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (µm) as
           evaluated by OCT (single measurement)

        -  Intraocular pressure (IOP) (mmHg) (single measurement at study visit) and mean
           intraocular pressure during anti-VEGF treatment period (evaluated as mean of all
           retrospectively available IOP measures from the beginning of treatment, mmHg)

      (*)Blood flux index is automatically calculated by ARI Network as the mean flow intensity in
      the vessel area, where the blood flow signal was normalized to 0 to 1 by dividing by the full
      dynamic range of blood flow signal intensity.
