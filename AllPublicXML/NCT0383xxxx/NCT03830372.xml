    <textblock>
      Thanks to using VR googles and the phenomenon of total immersion &quot;VR Tier One&quot; allows to
      completely separate the patient from the hospital environment, provides an intense visual,
      auditory and kinesthetic stimulation. Depending on the stage of therapy it can have a calming
      and mood-improving effect or, in another part of the game, it can motivate and cognitively
      activate the patient. The additional aim of the game is to help the patients regain their
      emotional balance, let them recognize their resources in order to bring them to power in the
      rehabilitation process and trigger the natural recovery mechanisms.

      The goals of the project:

        1. The evaluation of the influence of virtual therapeutic game on the mood and wellbeing of
           the patients undergoing post-stroke rehabilitation.

        2. The evaluation of the influence of virtual therapeutic game on the acceptance of the
           illness and self-efficacy assessment of the patients undergoing post-stroke
           rehabilitation.

        3. The evaluation of the influence of virtual therapeutic game on the effectiveness of
           post-stroke rehabilitation process in relation to locomotive function as well as basic
           and instrumental activities of daily living.

        4. The analysis of possible side effects appearing while using virtual reality therapy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale is a self-report 30-items measure of well-being and mood in older adults. The patient responds in a &quot;Yes/No&quot; format. Scoring ranges from 0 to 30, where 11 and more means mood disorders. The higher score means the greater depression. GDS will be performed at the beginning and at the end of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks) as well as after 3 weeks of the follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Self - Efficacy Scale consists of 10 statements. In each question, the patient can get 4 points. The scale measures the strength of the general belief of the individual about the effectiveness of coping with difficult situations and unexpected events as well as determination in pursuing the goal. Scoring ranges from 10 to 40 points. The more points the patient gets, the better he assesses his effectiveness in dealing with problems. The GSES will be performed at the beginning and at the end of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks) as well as after 3 weeks of the follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptance of Illnes Scale (AIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptance of Illness Scale contains eight statements describing the consequences of poor health. Scoring is in the range of 8 to 40 points. A small number of points means no acceptance of the disease and a strong sense of mental discomfort, while a high score means adaptation to the situation and lack of negative emotions associated with the disease. The AIS will be performed at the beginning and at the end of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks) as well as after 3 weeks of the follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Visual Analogue Scale of Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale of Pain is a psychometric measurement for intensity of pain, assesses the pain sensation on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means no pain and 10 means unbearable pain. The VAS will be performed at the beginning and at the end of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks) as well as after 3 weeks of the follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen-item scale scoring from 0 to 3 for each item. The first seven items relate to anxiety (HADS-A), and the remaining seven items relate to depression (HADS-D). The global scoring ranges from 0 to 42 with a cut-off point of 8/21 for anxiety and 8/21 for depression. The higher the score, the greater anxiety or depression symptoms. HADS will be performed at the beginning and after four weeks of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Barthel Index (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Barthel Index is a method of assessing the basic activities of daily living. Scoring ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 means full independence in basic activities (self-dressing, undressing, washing, use of the toilet, eating meals, transferring from a bed to a chair etc.). The score below 20 means the need for round the clock care. BI will be performed at the beginning and at the end of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks) as well as after 3 weeks of the follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lawton's Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Lawton's Scale assesses the instrumental activity of daily living such as using a telephone, shopping, preparing meals, household duties, washing clothes, money managing etc. The scale contains eight questions about the instrumental activities of everyday life which the patient can do without help, with a little help or is not able to do it at all. Scoring ranges from 8 to 24. The more points the more independent the patient is. The Lawton's Scale will be performed at the beginning and at the end of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks) as well as after 3 weeks of the follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rivermead Motor Assesment (RMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Rivermead Motor Assesment measures mobility and locomotion (e.g. changing positions, transfers, walking up stairs, etc.). 13 tasks are assessed, for each of them the patient may receive one point. The higher the score, the greater the mobility of the subject. The Rivermead Mobility Index will be performed at the beginning and at the end of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks) as well as after 3 weeks of the follow-up.</description>
