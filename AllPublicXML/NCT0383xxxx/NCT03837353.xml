  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized multi-center Phase 1b/2a dose escalation and dose expansion study
      involving 85-97 patients testing DKN-01 as monotherapy or in combination with docetaxel in
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Patients need to be biomarker positive
      (Dickkopf-1 [DKK1]) either in plasma or biopsy. Other biopsies for correlative studies are
      encouraged but not mandatory. Pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of one pre-treatment blood sample
      and one post-treatment blood sample will be mandatory on Day 1 of every cycle.
