      The main objectives of this study are the following: to describe the prognostic factors of
      survival of synovial sarcoma in patients treated by the orthopedic surgery unit oncologic of
      the orthopedic surgery and traumatology service of the Hospital de Sant Pau during the years
      1983-2016.

      Another objectives of this Study are:

      To analyze exhaustively a series of cases of synovial sarcoma (as an example of classic
      subtype of soft tissue sarcoma) to analyse the complementary tests performed and their
      evolution over time.

      To analyse the results of surgical treatment and adjuvant therapies in synovial sarcoma and
      its evolution over time.

      To study the prognostic factors dependent on the patient and the applied therapeutics.

      To establish a results-based treatment and follow-up algorithm for patients diagnosed with
      synovial sarcoma.

      To describe the epidemiological characteristics of the group of patients in the study.

      To evaluate the overall survival and disease-free survival as well as the mortality of the
      disease.

      To assess the rate of local recurrence and remote dissemination of synovial sarcomas in the
      series.

      To demonstrate the influence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of
      the tumor.

      Conduct a study by age group with respect to the influence on patient survival. To carry out
      a study by tumor-sized groups with respect to the influence on the survival of the patients.

      To carry out a chronological study on the influence of the advances in the treatments on the
      survival of the patients.

      Compare the results obtained with the published literature.

        The overall sample size will be 90 cases of synovial sarcoma diagnosed and treated by the
        unit, considering a sufficient number of cases in the analysis with sufficient potency to
        respond to the issues raised methodology. Sources of information all clinical records of
        the patients will be reviewed and a total of 104 elements collected, collecting data in
        relation to the epidemiology, personal and family history, physical examination,
        complementary tests of Local and extension diagnosis, time to diagnosis and treatment,
        pathological diagnosis, surgical technique, adjuvant therapy, complications of treatment,
        staging, clinical evolution, recurrences and metastases, functional valuation and data of
        survival and follow-up.
