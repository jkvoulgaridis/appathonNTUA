  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are first to determine if the power of suggestion will decrease
      the frequency and severity of emergence reactions after procedural sedation and analgesia
      with ketamine in the setting of the emergency department. Second, to determine if people
      dream about what they were thinking about when they were induced with ketamine.

      The proposed research will be single blinded (patient) randomized controlled trial with a
      retrospective component to test the hypothesis that the power of suggestion will reduce the
      frequency and severity of emergence reactions, even in the setting of the emergency
      department.

      The study will be conducted in the emergency department at CHRISTU Spohn Shoreline Hospital.
      CHRISTUS Spohn Shore hospital is the region's primary acute care center. It houses the Chest
      Pain, Stroke, and Cancer Centers of CHRISTUS Spohn, and the only level II trauma center in
      south Texas. It is a major teaching affiliate of Texas A&amp;M medical school, and serves an
      inner-city population.

    <masking_description>During the consent for the study, the physician will do the following depending on which group the patient has been randomized to: Packet 1: The physician will be asked to instruct the patient as empathetically and confidently as possible, that the drug the patient will be given will make them feel not pain, cause them to forget the procedure, and allow them to dream the dream of their choice. The resident will specifically ask the patient what he or she wants to dream about and the resident will then write the patient's answer on the instruction sheet. Packet #2: They physician will be asked to read a written statement about how the drug they will be given will cause analgesia, amnesia, and may cause hallucinations.</masking_description>

    <description>Half of the participants will receive the sedation medication with the usual conversation while the physician is giving the medication to the patient. The other half of the participants will have a more positive conversation, (which is the study intervention), with the physician while being given the medication. Both group's emergence reactions, if any, will be compared to see if the positive conversation reduced the side effect.</description>

    <description>During induction, if the patient is in group 1, the resident performing procedural sedation will remind the patient about what the patient wanted to dream and ask them to focus on that as the ketamine is being administered. If the patient is in group 2, the resident performing procedural sedation will give no specific instruction to the patient at this point.</description>
