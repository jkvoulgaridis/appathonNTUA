      The aim of this study is to measure serum and synovial fluid levels of IL 33 and its relative
      mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)
      patients and to correlate it with the clinical and laboratory characteristics, disease
      activity and musculoskeletal ultrasound findings.

      SUBJECTS AND METHODS

      Subjects:This study will be a case-control study including sixty children with juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis attending pediatric rheumatology clinic of Benha University Hospital and
      Benha children hospital and thirty apparently healthy children as controls. They will be
      classified into:

        -  Group (I) study group:60 cases of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

        -  Group (II) Control group:60 of apparently healthy children matched for age and sex

      A)Full history taking

      B) Full clinical examination

      C) Clinical assessment of disease activity

      D) Laboratory Investigations:

      All subjects will be investigated by

        1. complete blood count.

        2. Erythrocyte sedmentation rate.

        3. C-reactive protein .

        4. Liver enzymes: ALT and AST.

        5. Rheumatoid factor.

        6. Antinuclear antibody (ANA).

        7. serum ferritin

        8. serum and synovial fluid Interleukin 33 by ELISA and its relative expression in
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells by PCR

      E) Musculoskeletal Ultrasound examination

    <description>The JADAS-27 (range 0-57) was computed by summing the scores of four core-set criteria [3]: physician's global assessment of disease activity (PGA) on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS); parent/patient global assessment of well-being on a 10 cm VAS [7]; active arthritis, defined as joint swelling or limitation of movement accompanied by pain and tenderness, assessed in 27 joints; and ESR (mm/h) normalized to a 0-10 scale, using the formula ESR − 20/10, whereby, before the calculation, ESR values &lt;20 mm/h were converted to 0 and ESR values &gt;120 mm/h were converted to 120. A higher JADAS-27 indicates higher disease activity and a lower JADAS-27 indicates lower disease activity</description>
