  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase I, single centre, open-label, non-randomised study and was designed to be
      conducted in up to 2 parts. The purpose of Part 1 was to identify a MR formulation of PCS499
      that would provide an optimal dosing regimen in patients. The purpose of Part 2 of the study
      was to generate repeat dose information for the selected MR formulation of PCS499 in order to
      provide additional PK information for future patient studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female subjects

          3. Subjects who were healthy as determined by no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, vital signs,
             12-lead resting electrocardiogram (ECG; corrected QT interval [QTc] ≤450, QRS &lt;120, PR
             &lt;220; normal morphology) performed at the screening visit and prior to each dosing

          4. Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 35.0 kg/m2 inclusive or, if outside the range,
             considered not clinically significant by the investigator and body weight &gt;50 kg

          5. Subjects who were willing and able to be confined at the clinical research centre for
             the scheduled inpatient visits

          6. Ability to swallow multiple tablets whole

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject had a clinically significant history of GI, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal,
             endocrine, hematologic, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, bronchopulmonary, neurologic,
             immunologic, and/or lipid metabolism disorders and/or drug hypersensitivity

          2. Subject had a known or suspected malignancy with the exception of basal cell carcinoma

          3. Subject had a positive blood screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis
             B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) at the screening
             visit

          4. Female subjects who were pregnant or lactating (all female subjects required a
             negative serum pregnancy test at the screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at
             each admission).

          5. Subject had active disease or symptoms within 7 days prior to Day -1, such as nausea,
             vomiting, diarrhoea, and infection

          6. Subject had undergone a hospital admission or major surgery within 30 days prior to
             the Screening visit

          7. Subjects who had taken part in Part 1 were not permitted to take part in Part 2
