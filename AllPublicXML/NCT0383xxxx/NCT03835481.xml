          -  Woman Of Child Bearing Potential (WOCBP) must be ready and able to use highly
             effective methods of birth control per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)
             M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used
             consistently and correctly from date of screening until 4 weeks after last treatment
             in this trial. A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in
             the patient information.

          -  Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque Psoriasis (PsO) who have completed the
             randomized treatment period without early treatment discontinuation in the preceding
             trial, achieved a PASI50 at Week 24 of the preceding trial, and are willing and able
             to continue treatment in this study.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with ICH-GCP and local
             legislation prior to admission to the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Nonplaque forms of PsO (including guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular), current
             druginduced PsO (including a new onset or exacerbation of PsO from, e.g., beta
             blockers, calcium channel blockers, lithium), active ongoing inflammatory diseases
             (including but not limited to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)) other than PsO that
             might confound trial evaluations.

          -  Previous enrolment in this trial.

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial or is receiving
             other investigational treatment(s) (with the exception of 1407-0030).

          -  Intake of any restricted medication or any drug considered likely to interfere with
             the safe conduct of the trial.

          -  Any plan to receive a live vaccination during the conduct of the trial.

          -  Patients not expected to comply with the protocol requirements or not expected to
             complete the trial as scheduled.

          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the investigator's opinion,
             makes the patient an unreliable trial participant or unlikely to complete the trial.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the trial.

          -  Any documented active or suspected malignancy, except appropriately treated basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ carcinoma of
             uterine cervix.

          -  Relevant chronic or acute infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
             viral hepatitis, candidiasis and tuberculosis.

          -  Evidence of a disease (including known or suspected IBD, cardiovascular disease), or
             medical finding that in the opinion of the Investigator is clinically significant and
             would make the study participant unreliable to adhere to the protocol or to complete
             the trial, compromise the safety of the patient, or compromise the quality of the
             data.

          -  Any suicidal ideation, including grade 4 or 5 in the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating
             Scale (C-SSRS) in the past 12 months (i.e., active suicidal thought with intent but
             without specific plan), or active suicidal thought with plan and intent in the past.

          -  Unwillingness to adhere to the rules of UV-light protection
