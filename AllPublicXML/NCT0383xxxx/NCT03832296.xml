  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team is currently conducting a pragmatic, community-based assessor-blinded
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) in overweight and obese adults &gt; 50 years with knee OA in
      both urban and rural counties in North Carolina. As the participants randomized to the 18
      month diet and exercise group in the WE-CAN study successfully complete the intervention (≥
      5% weight loss), the study team has the unique opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      theoretically-based tapered weight maintenance intervention. Eligible participants will be
      randomized to either the weight-loss maintenance or health education attention control
      groups.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results from the Intensive Diet and Exercise for Arthritis (IDEA) trial showed that 10%
      diet-induced weight loss combined with exercise (D+E) was twice as effective at relieving
      knee pain and improving function and mobility as previous long-term weight loss and exercise
      programs in similar cohorts. The treatment effects of D+E on these clinical outcomes were
      mediated by changes in self-efficacy over the course of the trial. However, most people tend
      to regain most or all of the lost weight in three to five years. The challenge is maintaining
      the weight loss and sustaining the efficacy of the intervention.

      Our current trial (WE-CAN) is designed to adapt the successful IDEA intervention to
      real-world clinical and community settings. As WE-CAN participants in the D+E group complete
      their intervention, the investigators will leverage our organizational infrastructure to
      maintain weight-loss without supervised intervention by increasing participant confidence to
      establish and adhere to a routine of good exercise and diet behaviors independently.

      Participants will include 212 older adults aged ≥ 51 yrs. with knee osteoarthritis (OA) who
      achieved a weight loss ≥ 5% in the D+E intervention arm of the WE-CAN trial. All WE-CAN
      participants meet the ACR clinical criteria for knee OA, which includes knee pain on most
      days of the week plus at least three of the following six: age ≥ 50 years, stiffness &lt; 30
      min/day, crepitus, bony tenderness, bony enlargement, and/or no palpable warmth. Eligible
      WE-CAN D+E participants will be randomized to either 6-month facilitated weight-loss
      maintenance or health education control interventions. The primary aim is to compare the
      effects of a 6-month weight-loss maintenance intervention grounded in social cognitive theory
      to a health education intervention on maintaining weight loss subsequent to a 12-month
      unsupervised follow-up period. Secondary aims will compare the two interventions on WOMAC
      knee pain and function, health-related quality of life (SF-36), 6-minute walk distance, and
      weight-loss maintenance self-efficacy following the 12-month unsupervised period. The study
      team will also establish the cost-effectiveness of a 6-month facilitated weight-loss
      maintenance intervention for older adults with knee OA by conducting cost-effectiveness and
      budgetary impact analyses using data from the current trial in a validated computer-simulated
      model of knee OA.

      There have been numerous attempts to prevent weight regain in adults. This study is
      significant in that it is designed to encourage older adults with knee OA that have
      experienced significant weight loss to develop strategies that will build self-efficacy for
      maintaining weight loss on their own long after the active intervention ends.

    <masking_description>Each eligible participant will be randomized to one of the two arms of the clinical trial (weight-loss maintenance, control) according to a variable block-length algorithm that will be controlled by the Data Management Group. Randomization will be stratified by intervention site to ensure nearly equal sample sizes for the two interventions to balance local population characteristics. Randomization uses a web-based system that is part of the study data management system. Intervention visits will not include any assessments and outcome assessors will remain blinded to group assignment. The lead biostatistician of the Data Management Group will develop the randomization table.</masking_description>

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life: Euroqol</measure>
    <time_frame>18 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the effects of a 6-month weight-loss maintenance intervention grounded in social cognitive theory to a health education intervention on health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. Responses results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators support data sharing and will comply with all NIH guidelines as outlined in the NIH Data Sharing Policy and Implementation Guidance document. The primary means of data sharing and dissemination will be through scientific publications and presentations. Ensuring patient privacy and confidentiality will be of primary importance in creating the files to be shared. All data files will be de-identified. De-identification procedures will meet HIPAA criteria detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, Section 164.514. The study team will create a link on our website that describes the data files. Documentation will also be provided along with the redacted data files. The documentation will include electronic versions of the protocol, data collection forms (with instructions for scoring, if needed), data dictionary, data code book, labels, and formats. Requests for data will be answered via completion of an online request form and data-sharing agreement.</ipd_description>
