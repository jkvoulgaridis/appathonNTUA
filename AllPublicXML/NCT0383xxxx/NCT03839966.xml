      This study hopes to assess whether a month long interpretation bias modification intervention
      will reduce levels of loneliness compared to a control treatment. Participants will be
      randomized into an active treatment condition or a control treatment that involves a healthy
      living and relaxation protocol. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the IBM
      condition will have lower levels of negative interpretation bias and loneliness than those in
      the healthy habits condition at post treatment and follow up. The investigators further
      hypothesize that the effects of IBM on loneliness will be accounted for by changes in
      interpretation bias.

    <description>Participants will receive eight treatment sessions. They will be presented with ambiguous training scenarios on a computer screen. Scenarios will be presented in two discrete formats: a word-sentence relatedness task (adapted from Beard &amp; Amir, 2008 and Beard, Weisberg, &amp; Amir, 2011), and a sentence completion and comprehension task (adapted from paradigms used by Mathews and Mackintosh (2000), Steinman and Teachman (2010), and Beard and Amir (2008)). Both of these formats have been used to reduce maladaptive threat interpretations and increase benign interpretations.</description>

    <intervention_name>Healthy Habits Psychoeducation and Relaxation</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will receive eight computerized sessions consisting of psychoeducation on healthy behaviors as well as relaxing video clips with pleasant music (e.g., videos of rainforests, wildlife, and space). These sessions will be matched for time with the active condition, lasting approximately 25-30 minutes each. Psychoeducation will cover the topics of exercise, diet, hygiene, social support, healthy activities, and sleep. The relaxing videos will be presented after the psycho-education in each session. At the conclusion of the study, participants will be provided with the active IBM treatment free of charge if they wish to receive it.</description>
