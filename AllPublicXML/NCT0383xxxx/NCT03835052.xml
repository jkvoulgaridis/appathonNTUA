  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational cohort study of patients who received cancer treatment (of any modality)
      in the last 18 months are evaluated by the use of a validated QOL tool (FACT-GP) and are
      evaluated via telephone or in person or both. Patients with high-risk for unmet needs or
      distress as determined by the FACT-GP are referred to an in-person Multidisciplinary Cancer
      Survivorship Clinic. This is considered standard of care at the investigator's institution
      and is part of the continuous clinical quality improvement program within the Geisinger
      Cancer Institute.
