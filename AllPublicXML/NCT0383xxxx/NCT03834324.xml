  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroscience research that has identified potential for recovery (neuroplasticity) following
      incomplete SCI has changed clinical practice away from compensation strategies towards
      optimizing recovery. Important factors include: repetitive exercise, Functional Electrical
      Stimulation (FES) and appropriate feedback. The iCycle combines repetitive exercise with FES
      and provides feedback on performance in a virtual cycle race. Unlike previous devices,
      performance in the race is determined only by voluntary effort (i.e. not torque generated by
      FES plus voluntary effort). In this study with incomplete SCI participants we will test the
      iCycle with six inpatients to refine the protocol and make technical improvements. We will
      then conduct an ABA pilot study (n=10) in which a 3G-connected iCycle is used in people's own
      homes. We will compare usual care (A) with iCycle exercise (B). Changes in neural
      connectivity (TMS evoked EMG potentials), muscle strength and walking will be measured as
      well qualitative analysis of users' views.

      Background: Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) cycling can benefit health and may lead
      to neuroplastic changes following incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Our hypothesis is that
      greater neuroplastic effects occur when electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves is
      combined with voluntary drive. In this pilot study, we will investigate the effects of a
      one-month training programme using a novel device, the iCycle, in which voluntary effort
      (cortical drive) is encouraged by virtual reality biofeedback during FES cycling.

      Methods: Eleven participants (C1-T12) with incomplete SCI (5 sub-acute; 6 chronic) will be
      recruited and undergo 12-sessions of iCycle training. Function will be assessed before and
      after training using the bilateral ISNC-SCI motor score neurological (motor) function, Oxford
      power grading, Modified Ashworth Score, Spinal Cord Independence Measure, the Walking Index
      for Spinal Cord Injury and 10m-walk test. Power output will be measured during training.
