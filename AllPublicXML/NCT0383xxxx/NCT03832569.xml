  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the study drug, pembrolizumab, and to find
      out how well it works to prevent cancer from coming back in people who have had a solid tumor
      surgically removed, but still have tumor cells in their blood. During the study, the
      participant will receive either the study drug or a placebo for as long as 12 months, or
      until the cancer comes back, or the side effects of the treatment become too severe.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Any solid tumor with MSI or MRD by IHC, PCR or NGS testing. MSKCC confirmation of
             MSI-H/MRD status is not mandatory prior to enrollment and treatment on the study. For
             patients with outside testing, if sufficient tissue is available NGS will be repeated
             at MSKCC and will not impact the patient's eligibility.

          -  Must have genetic testing of DNA from primary tumor for somatic genomic alterations
             across a minimum of 50 genes.

          -  Must have undergone a complete curative surgical resection (R0)

          -  Must have completed standard of care (SOC) surgery, neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy

          -  To be eligible for pembrolizumab or placebo therapy, the patients must have positive
             ctDNA (as defined in section 7.0) within 4 months after completion of appropriate
             standard of care therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation as appropriate). Note, if
             ctDNA has a negative result, ctDNA can be re-tested 4 weeks later, within 5 months of
             completion of standard therapy.

          -  Patients must sign informed consent within 4 weeks of positive ctDNA result

          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL

               -  Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with
                  total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN. Except patients with Gilbert's disease (≤3x
                  ULN)

               -  AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 X ULN

             MD) related to surgery.

          -  Presence of metastatic or recurrent disease.

          -  Had R1 ( microscopic residual tumor) or R2 resection (macroscopic residual tumor at
             resection margin).

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          -  Patients who have received acute, low dose, systemic immunosuppressant medications
             (e.g., dexamethasone containing antiemetic regimen or steroids as CT scan contrast

             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
