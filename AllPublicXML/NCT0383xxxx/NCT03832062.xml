  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intratumour heterogeneity is well recognized in multiple cancer types and ultimately leads to
      therapeutic resistance. It also limits the ability of small samples to represent the whole
      tumour, having implications for diagnosis, molecular analysis and understanding of the tumour
      immune microenvironment. By blending- 'homogenizing'- leftover tumour tissue in excess of
      that required for diagnosistic purposes, one may create a more representative sample for
      analysis.

      In order to establish the feasibility of homogenization as a potential companion diagnostic
      tool, our study aims to 1) evaluate how many surgical cases have left over tissue amenable to
      homogenization and 2) pilot homogenization across multiple tumour types. The molecular
      profile of the homogenate will be compared to that obtained from the diagnostic specimen
      using next generation sequencing techniques.

    <description>The molecular profile of the diagnostic block will be determined by next generation sequencing and the same will be done with the homogenized sample.
