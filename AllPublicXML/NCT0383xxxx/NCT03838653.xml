  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-lung ventilation (OLV) is used for thoracic surgical procedures to facilitate surgical
      exposure. Lung isolation is performed using a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) and
      optimal position is achieved with the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The most common
      technique used to place a left-sided DLT is the blind method technique, which consists of
      direct laryngoscopy and rotation of the DLT into the trachea with the aim to intubate the
      entrance of the left main bronchus. The DLT will be rotated counterclockwise blindly after
      the tip of the DLT passes the vocal cords under direct laryngoscopy. However, in some
      occasions, the tip of the DLT migrates into the right bronchus because the alignment between
      the trachea and right bronchus is more vertical. The identification of the misplacement can
      be challenging, which could lead to the failure of lung isolation. In order to avoid the
      unsuccessful lung isolation, Investigators are interested in identifying the factors that
      potentially influence the incorrect tube DLT placement diverting into the opposite bronchus.

    <textblock>
      Recently, multi-detector 3-dimensional computed tomography (MDCT) scan of the chest is
      becoming a routine study for patients requiring thoracic surgical procedures. On the day of
      thoracic surgery, the participant will be intubated with a left-sided DLT and investigators
      will confirm the correct insertion of the left-sided DLT at first pass under direct
      laryngoscopy. This information will be recorded and saved. After the study is completed,
      investigators will review the MDCT of the chest to review any abnormal findings and correlate
      it with the success of the insertion of the left-sided DLT into the left bronchus.
      Investigators will conduct a pilot study to determine the most influential anatomical change
      that leads to the DLT misplacement at the first pass based upon the changes of the
      tracheal-bronchial anatomy on MDCT.

    <description>Participants are divided into two groups based upon the first pass location of the L-DLT; LMB (left main bronchus) intubation group and RMB (right main bronchus) intubation group. Tracheal length as seen on MDCT images will be measured (millimeters) and compared between the two groups.</description>

    <description>Participants are divided into two groups based upon the first pass location of the L-DLT; LMB (left main bronchus) intubation group and RMB (right main bronchus) intubation group. The TLMBC as seen on MDCT images will be measured and compared between the two groups. TLMBC is measured at the Trachea LMB branch point. The center lines of the airway segments (trachea and LMB) close to the branch point are displayed. A circumscribed circle goes through three adjacent airway points centered at the branch point is produced and the curvature is calculated by the reciprocal of the circle radius. The curvature of a straight line is zero. A larger curvature indicates a sharper turning angle.</description>
