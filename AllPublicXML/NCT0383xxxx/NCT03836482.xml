  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the selective cytopheretic device on the immune
      dysregulated state of congestive heart failure(CHF) with CRS and to assess the benefit of the
      device to improve cardiovascular and renal function. The study will enroll eligible patients
      in the ICU with acute on chronic systolic heart failure and worsening renal function due to
      cardiorenal syndrome while awaiting LVAD implantation.

      In this study patients who are eligible and agree to participate will receive treatment with
      the SCD. The treatment will be for 6 hours a day up to 6 days. Additionally, participants
      will have additional study procedures and be evaluated to determine if their kidney function
      improves enough to undergo LVAD implantation.
