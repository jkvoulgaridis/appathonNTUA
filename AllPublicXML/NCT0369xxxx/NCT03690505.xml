  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that blurs the sharp, central vision you
      need for &quot;straight-ahead&quot; activities such as reading, sewing, and driving. AMD affects the
      macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail

      The purpose of the study is to describe in patients with AMD and depending on the nature of
      their pathology (neovascular or atrophic):

      (i) knowledge about their pathology (risk factors, symptoms, treatments, self-monitoring
      tool), (ii) their needs and (iii) impact on their daily lives

      This study is to make an inventory of the knowledge of patients with AMD about their disease
      and risk factors using a questionnaire (Appendix 1) and to identify their needs, the impact
      of the disease on their daily lives during individual interviews by raising the recurrent
      data and confronting them during the focus group. The information gathered will enable the
      construction of a therapeutic education program for better patient care and to strengthen the
      patient's capacities so that he becomes an actor in his change throughout his care project.

      This a 3 steps study:

        1. 200 patients will be enrolled and answer a questionnaire on knowledge of the disease

        2. Two groups of 20 patients will be selected to participate to a semi-structured
           individual interviews

        3. Two focus groups of 10 patients will be organized to assess needs, expectations,
           satisfactions or to better understand opinions, motivations or behaviors.
