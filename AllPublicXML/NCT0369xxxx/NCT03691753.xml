      A Multi-center, Randomized Controlled Trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fitaya
      Vena Cava Filter manufactured by Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen) Co., LTD. for deep vein
      thrombosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial was mainly for patients with high-risk deep vein thrombosis, and all subjects who
      passed the screening and signed the informed consent will be enrolled and be randomly divided
      into the experimental group and the control group according to the proportion of 1:1. For
      patients who will be allocated to the experimental group will be implanted with Fitaya Vena
      Cava Filters System, and for patients who will be allocated to the control group will be
      implanted with Aegisy Vena Cava Filters. Between 0 and 60 days, after the filter was
      implanted, the investigator will decide whether to withdraw the vena cava filter based on the
      subject's condition. If successfully withdraw the vena cava filter, the subject will be
      followed up for 1 month, if the withdraw is unsuccessful, the subject will be followed up for
      180 days. This clinical trial is conducted in qualified clinical trial institutions with a
      planned duration of 16-24 months. Upon completion of the clinical trial report, it will be
      submitted together with other materials for the application for listing registration in the
      China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA).

    <description>The clinically successful implantation of vena cava filter should meet the following three requirements simultaneously: 1. The filter was successfully implanted and the shape and positioning were satisfactory. 2. No symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurred in patients with permanent filter implantation within 6 months after implantation and was confirmed by Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA). No symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurred in patients who had a removal of the filter during its indwelling and was confirmed by CTPA. 3. No rupture, no displacement, no venous penetration, no vena occlusion, no filter implantation or operation-related deaths occurred in the blood vessels.</description>

             and signed informed consent, and are willing to complete the follow-up as required by
             the program.

          3. Patients diagnosed with inferior deep vein thrombosis (inferior vena cava, Iliac,
             femoral or popliteal DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), and concomitant with one or more
             of the following situation:

               1. with the existence of contraindications for anticoagulation therapy.

               2. complications such as bleeding occurred during anticoagulation therapy.

               3. pulmonary embolism still recurred after adequate anticoagulation therapy.
