      Phase III trial comparing local control and side effects after fractionated stereotactic
      radiotherapy and single session radiosurgery in patients with larger brain metastases (2-4
      cm)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter randomized trial comparing local control and side effects
      after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with 12 x 4 Gy and single session radiosurgery
      according to RTOG 9005 in patients with larger brain metastases (2-4 cm). Patients will be
      randomized to either fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with 12 x 4 Gy or radiosurgery
      with 1 x 18 Gy (2-3 cm) or 1 x 15 Gy (3-4 cm) as defined by the RTOG 9005. Randomization will
      be stratified by metastasis volume and histology.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to local progression - TTLP</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Local progression will be defined according to the RANO-BM criteria by an increase of at least 20% in the longest diameter of the metastasis relative to nadir or baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20% the lesion must increase by an absolute value of 5 mm or more.
TTLP is defined as the time from randomization until the detection of progression as per the RANO-BM criteria. Patients will be censored if they have no signs of local progression at the time of last tumor monitoring during follow-up or at the onset of one of the following competing risk events not associated with local progression: death, lost to follow up, unauthorized non-protocol treatment of the target lesion.
Confirmatory analysis of the primary endpoint variable will be performed using a p-value of p≤0.05 as the global significance level.</description>
