  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of its very high bioavailability and its specific and direct action on protein
      synthesis, the investigators hypothesize that citrulline supplementation would be an
      innovative nutritional strategy to improve the peripheral muscle mass and strength in COPD
      patients with severe chronic respiratory failure.

      This supplementation would be more effective if the pathology is severe and the chronic
      systemic inflammation important. The benefits of this supplementation could help the most
      severe patients break out of the cycle of inactivity and thus optimize their quality of life.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of 45-day nutritional
      supplementation with Citrulline (10 g / day) on the body composition (lean body mass) in
      malnourished COPD patients with severe chronic respiratory failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Denutrition in patients with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is characterized by
      muscle atrophy and loss of strength in the lower extremities. It worsens the symptomatology,
      exercise intolerance, impaired quality of life and prognosis of patients.

      Consequence of a protein deficiency associated with systemic inflammation, denutrition is
      becoming increasingly important in patients with chronic respiratory failure (CRF).
      L-citrulline is an amino acid having a direct action on muscle protein synthesis. The
      citrulline supplementation is an effective treatment to fight against muscle loss in aging
      subjects. Its impact on the functional and nutritional status of COPD patients has not been
      studied.

      Our main objective is to determine the impact of supplementation with Citrulline on mass and
      peripheral muscle strength in COPD with CRF. Our secondary objectives are to identify whether
      these benefits are dependent on the severity of the disease and if they are associated with
      increased physical activity, exercise tolerance and an improvement in symptoms and quality of
      life. This prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study will include 60 stable
      COPD patients (stage 3 and 4), with long-term oxygen therapy and / or non-invasive
      ventilation, BMI &lt;25 kg.m2 and suspicion of sarcopenia.

      For 45 days, patients will receive either citrulline (ProteoCIT®, 10mg) or placebo. The
      severity of COPD will be assessed by spirometry and blood gas data, the BODE index,
      exacerbations, comorbidities, nutritional status and systemic inflammation (CRPs,
      Fibrinogens). the investigators will evaluate before and after supplementation: body
      composition (DEXA), quadriceps strength and grip strength, walking speed, the exercise
      tolerance (6MWD), dyspnea (MMRC scales, BDI / TDI), quality of life (CAT and VSRQ
      questionnaires). Physical activity will be assessed by continuous actigraphy. This
      multicenter study will be conducted in 3 French hospitals: Grenoble, Nancy, Dijon.
