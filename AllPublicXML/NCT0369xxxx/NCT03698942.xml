  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi‐reader, multi‐case (MRMC) reader study is to evaluate reader
      performance when SoftVue™ automated breast ultrasound and screening mammography are combined,
      compared to screening mammography alone, in women with dense breast parenchyma. This includes
      obtaining information that can be used to properly plan, design, and power future ROC reader
      studies.

      This reader study will include a minimum of 6 radiologist readers and an enriched sample of
      at least 100 breast screening or diagnostic cases to be selected from the library of images
      collected under Delphinus Protocol #DMT‐2015.001 (NCT03257839). The reader study image case
      set will be enriched with cancer cases.

        Readers will evaluate mammography and SoftVue images acquired at study entry in protocol
        DMT 2015.001 and subsequently categorized into the following case types, in random order:

          -  Cancer cases, confirmed by breast biopsy with at least one lesion determined to be
             malignant during participation

          -  Non‐Cancer cases including, but not limited to benign cases, confirmed by breast
             biopsy with no lesions determined to be malignant, or normal/negative screening or
             diagnostic imaging during participation
