  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among American Indians (AIs) in
      the United States. Although healthy diet is a key component of diabetes management programs,
      many AIs face barriers to adopting a healthy diet including: difficulty budgeting for food on
      low-incomes, low literacy and numeracy when purchasing food, and limited cooking skills. The
      proposed project will evaluate a culturally-targeted healthy foods budgeting, purchasing, and
      cooking skills intervention aimed at improving the cardio-metabolic health of AIs with type 2
      diabetes who live in rural areas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research activities proposed in this application address a pressing need in American
      Indian (AI) communities - the evaluation of a culturally-tailored healthy food budgeting,
      purchasing, and cooking intervention to see whether it can improve diet and health among AIs
      with type 2 diabetes.

      This randomized clinical trial will compare the efficacy of a culturally-tailored healthy
      food budgeting, purchasing, and cooking program on: (1) diet quality (i.e., intake of
      sugar-sweetened beverages, processed foods) and (2) healthy food budgeting and cooking
      skills, among AIs with type 2 diabetes who reside in a large AI community in the
      north-central United States. Additionally, the investigators will conduct a mixed methods
      process evaluation to assess intervention reach, fidelity, and participant satisfaction.
      Curriculum will be tailored to an AI population with diabetes, and directly address major
      barriers to healthy eating that were identified by community members and tribal leaders in
      recent focus groups including: (1) difficulty budgeting for food on low-incomes; (2) low
      literacy and numeracy when purchasing food (e.g., inability to use in-store scales to convert
      foods priced &quot;per pound&quot; to dollar values); (3) limited cooking skills. The investigators
      expect that implementation of a culturally-tailored diet intervention will be effective in
      promoting positive diet change, and increase healthy food budgeting and cooking skills.

      Poorly controlled diabetes affects the health/longevity of those afflicted, and has profound
      effects on healthcare costs. Greater efforts are needed to encourage healthy eating in
      underserved communities with a high burden of diabetes. Improving healthy food budgeting,
      purchasing, and cooking skills among AIs with diabetes should improve diet and diabetes
      management. If successful, this program can be extended to other AI communities.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change (from baseline) in self-reported intake (servings/day) of sugar-sweetened beverages (measured using the Nutrition Assessment Shared Resource Food Frequency Questionnaire) at 6 months and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline, and months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Sugar-sweetened beverages include self-reported intake of fruit drinks, sugar-based energy drinks, and soda. Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages will be estimated using measures of consumption frequency and portion size. Average intakes will be calculated for each study participant using the University of Minnesota Nutrition Data Systems for Research Software by multiplying the frequency response for each beverage on the food frequency questionnaire by the recalled portion size, and then summing for all relevant beverages. Change from baseline with be assessed at 6 months and 12 months (12 months - baseline; 6 months - baseline). As the intervention hopes to decrease intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, lower (i.e., more negative) after - before differences represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>change (from baseline) in healthy and unhealthy food purchases (measured using the Healthy/Unhealthy Food Acquisition Survey) at 6 months and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline, and months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in healthy and unhealthy food purchases will be estimated using the Healthy/Unhealthy Food Acquisition Survey. The survey includes a list of 47 healthy and unhealthy foods commonly consumed in the community. At each exam (baseline, month 6, month 12), participants will report the number of times he/she acquired each of the 47 foods in the past 30 days. Change from baseline with be assessed at 6 months and 12 months (12 months - baseline; 6 months - baseline). As the intervention hopes to increase the number of healthy food purchases and decrease the number of unhealthy food purchases, higher after - before differences represent a better outcome for healthy foods and lower after - before differences represent a better outcome for unhealthy foods.</description>

    <measure>change (from baseline) in food budgeting skills (measured using the Food Resource Management Scale) at 6 months and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline, and months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in food budgeting skills will be estimated using the Food Resource Management Scale. The scale includes 4 questions related to shopping behaviors to maximize food resources. The Food Resource Management Scale is a Likert-type scale with responses ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Responses to the four questions will be assessed individually, as well as averaged (primary outcome) to create a total Food Resource Management Score. Change from baseline with be assessed at 6 months and 12 months (12 months - baseline; 6 months - baseline). As the intervention hopes to increase food budgeting skills, higher after-before differences represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>change (from baseline) in cooking skills (measured using the Cooking Confidence Scale) at 6 months and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline, and months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cooking skills will be estimated using the Cooking Confidence Scale. The Cooking Confidence Scale includes 6 questions related to confidence in preparing healthy foods. It is a Likert-type scale with responses ranging from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (very confident). Responses to the questions will be assessed individually, as well as averaged (primary outcome). Change from baseline with be assessed at 6 months and 12 months (12 months - baseline; 6 months - baseline). As the intervention hopes to increase cooking skills, higher after - before differences represent a better outcome.</description>
