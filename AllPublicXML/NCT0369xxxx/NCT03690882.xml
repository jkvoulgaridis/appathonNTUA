  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some cases of acute antero-lateral cervical pain cannot be accurately classified by medical
      imaging (ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging and/or CT-scan) : imaging rules out
      carotid dissection, carotid occlusion or vasculitis as well as musculoskeletal causes and
      thus the pain is considered &quot;of unknown origin&quot;.

      The investigators hypothesize that in such cases perivascular inflammation of the carotid may
      be involved.

      This study aims at systematically reviewing medical files (including imaging) of patients
      suffering from acute cervical pain in which carotid dissection, carotid occlusion or
      vasculitis as well as musculoskeletal causes have been ruled out by ultrasound and/or
      magnetic resonance imaging and/or CT-scan

        All adult patients from 10 centers in France, who presented from January 2009 through April
        2016 with acute cervical pain and with at least 1 diagnostic image (MR imaging, CT, or US
        including a dedicated vessel analysis) in which no clearly identified and classified
        vascular or musculoskeletal cause of the pain was found.
