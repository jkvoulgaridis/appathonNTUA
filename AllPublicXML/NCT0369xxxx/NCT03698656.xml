      Patients with acute leukaemia or lymphoma will be invited to have three interviews centered
      on spiritual issues on a six-eight months period.

      The intervention consist on 3 intervention interviews conducted at the beginning of the study
      and approximatively 2 and 4 months later (according to the program of medical care). Quality
      of life (FACT-G) and spiritual well-being (FACIT-SP12) scales will be completed at the
      beginning (before the first intervention interview) and at the end of the study
      (approximately 2 month after the third intervention interview, i.e. 6 to 8 month after the
      first interview).

      This pilot study will assess the proportion of patients who will accept to enter in the study
      and to complete it.
