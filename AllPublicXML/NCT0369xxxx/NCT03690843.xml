  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to map the early development of children with DCD and compare it to
      typically developing (TD) children.

      At first we will investigate to what extent motor delay, reduced force, higher BMI,
      behavioral, ADL and participation problems occur in toddlerhood in DCD children and how this
      relates to TD children. We will also look into the evolution of these parameters in time
      (stability of development).

      Secondly we will explore if the diagnosis of DCD can be predicted using a standardized test
      before the age of five.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A longitudinal study design enables us to assess children at three different ages (3y, 4y and
      5y).

      Assessment scores (AIMS or/and BSID) before the age of three will be retrieved
      retrospectively in the clinical group.
