  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High grade glioma is a rare disorder affecting children at all ages with a high mortality
      rate. Overall survival is estimated at 40%, depending on the type of treatment administered.
      Major late sequelaes are experienced with the irradiation in this population under 5 years.
      Therefore, the current recommendations by The French Society for Childhood Cancers are based
      on a treatment including surgery followed by chemotherapy and avoiding radiotherapy as long
      as patients present no sign of treatment failure. The results published in 2006, underlying
      the fact that some patients treated exclusively with surgical resection and chemotherapy can
      achieve long term survival, are showing evidence of an acceptable long-term strategy. Few
      studies concerning evaluation of treatment toxicity and long term outcomes are available.
      Therefore, it is important to collect retrospective data concerning those small patients with
      high grade glioma in order to understand the reasons of treatment success or failure and
      treatment toxicities. This retrospective study will evaluate long term survivals
      comparatively to clinical, radiological and histological features at diagnosis and the
      treatment toxicities including neurological, endocrine and hearing impairment to go further
      and propose new potential guidelines and chemotherapy schedules
