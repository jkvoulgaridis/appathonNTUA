  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the effects of a digital meditation intervention in a sample
      of high stress UCR employees. We will randomize UCR employees to 8-weeks of either a digital
      mindfulness intervention (using the commercially available application Headspace) or a
      waitlist control condition.

      Participants assigned to the intervention group will be asked to download and use the
      Headspace mobile application for 10 minutes per day for 8 weeks. They will be asked to fill
      out short (no longer than 30 minutes long) questionnaires at baseline, week 4, week 8 (post
      intervention), and a 4-month follow up period. Participants who are randomized to the digital
      meditation intervention will also take part in a 1-year follow up. All activities will take
      place online (via computer or smartphone), and on the participants' own time.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High levels of psychosocial work-related stress have major implications for both the employee
      and the employer. Epidemiological studies consistently demonstrate associations between high
      work stress and worse self-reported mental and physical health, including depression,
      anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes.

      Job strain, a combination of high demands and low control, is a common model used to define
      psychosocial stress at work. Job strain is associated with worse mental and physical health,
      including anxiety and depressive disorders and increased blood pressure.

      Past studies show the value in mindfulness applications. For example, participants who
      completed 25 or more meditation sessions over 8 weeks also had significantly lower
      self-measured systolic blood pressure over the course of one day compared to the control
      condition participants at the follow-up time point. This trial suggests that almost daily
      brief mindfulness meditations delivered via smartphone can improve outcomes related to
      workplace stress and well-being, with potentially lasting effects.

      In this study, investigators hope to determine if a stress-reduction mindfulness application
      is more effective than a waitlist control condition in employees who are experiencing mild to
      moderate levels of stress in various health and productivity-related outcomes.
