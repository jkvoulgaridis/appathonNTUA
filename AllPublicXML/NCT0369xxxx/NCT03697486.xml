  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gut hormones, such as PYY and ghrelin, are associated with appetite control and obesity.
      Protein is thought to be the most satieting nutrient and could affect production of several
      gut hormones. This study's objective is to find the effect of breakfast with different
      protein composition on PYY, ghrelin, and ad libitum intake four hours after breakfast.

      The research methodology was used a clinical trial with 22 obese women participants. Subjects
      were given three types of breakfast: low protein consumption (12.4% protein), medium protein
      (23.5% protein), and high protein (40,6% protein). PYY and ghrelin level were measured at 0,
      15, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after breakfast. Ad libitum meal was given four hours after
      breakfast and measured after.

    <description>Participants should not eat within the last 10 hours. Participants could drink mineral water up to 2 hours before intervention. Breakfast given is a milk-based formula which has to be finished within 15 minutes, and subjects could only consume 600 mL of mineral water within the next 4 hours after intervention. Participants' blood was taken before intervention, and 15, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after intervention, then examined in laboratory to measure ghrelin and PYY level. Breakfast given is adjusted to participants' energy requirement. Energy requirement is calculated by adding basal metabolic rate (BMR) with additional energy from physical activity. Different composition of protein, carbohydrate and fat were given to each arm depends on their group.
After 4 hours, participants were given ad libitum meal. After the participants done eating, the calorie in meal taken by participants was measured.</description>
