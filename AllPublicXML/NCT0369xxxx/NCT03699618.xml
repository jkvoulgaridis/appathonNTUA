      This study will define the limits of subretinal hemorrhage parameters that are consistent

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the limits of subretinal hemorrhage parameters that
      are consistent with a good visual outcome with aggressive anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor (anti-VEGF) treatment, thereby providing guidance as to when it is reasonable to treat
      with anti-VEGF and when it is necessary to displace the hemorrhage in addition to treating
      with anti-VEGF.

      This is a prospective study that will enroll 98 patients with subretinal hemorrhage in the
      fovea [also known as subfoveal hemorrhage (SFH)] secondary to neovascular AMD at the Wilmer
      Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins Hospital (Downtown campus and all other Eye Care Network
      clinics). The primary endpoint is at month 12 and the secondary endpoint is at month 24. The
      duration of the study is 24 months.

      Study visits will include a baseline visit, then monthly visits for 12 months, followed by
      standard care treatment visits in the second year until month 24. The patients will be
      stratified into two groups based on standard of care management: 1. Patients receiving
      intravitreal (IVT) anti-VEGF injections; 2. Patients undergoing SFH displacement followed by
      IVT anti-VEGF injections. Patients will receive monthly anti-VEGF injection for 12 months,
      followed by anti-VEGF at standard of care treatment interval during months 12-24; or SFH
      displacement (at investigators' discretion) followed by monthly IVT anti-VEGF injections for
      12 months, and standard of care treatment interval during months 12-24.
