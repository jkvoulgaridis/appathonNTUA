      A single-center prospective study. Patients undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve
      surgery between February 2016 and December 2018 at the Karolinska University Hospital in
      Stockholm, Sweden are eligible. Femoral cannulation was performed either with surgical
      cut-down and arterial puncture under direct vision or percutaneously with planned
      percutaneous arteriotomy closed using a plug-based arteriotomy closure device (MANTA,
      Essential Medical Inc., Malvern, Pennsylvania). Data regarding preoperative clinical
      characteristics and operative details were obtained by medical records review and from the
      Swedish Web system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence based care in Heart disease
      Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) electronic data collection
      platform.
