      The aim of this study was to compare haemodynamic changes, total dose of ephedrin
      requirement, and level of sensory blockade between fractionated dose and single dose spinal
      anesthesia injection in obstetric patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension who underwent
      Caesarean section

      Approval from Ethical Committee of Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia was acquired
      prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study
      and randomized into two groups; single dose (SD) and fractionated dose (FD). All subjects
      will receive spinal anesthesia with 2,5 ml of 10 mg bupivacaine hyperbaric 0,5% and fentanyl
      25 mcg. After IV cannulas (18 - 20 G) were properly placed, premedication with intravenous
      (IV) ranitidine 50 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg were given. Additional IV access was added if
      MgSO4 must been continuously administered intravenously perioperatively. Standard monitor
      device were placed after patients had been transferred to operating room. Additional
      premedication such as intravenous midazolam 0.02 mg/BW or fentanyl 1 mcg/BW were given if the
      patients were anxious or in pain. Baseline haemodynamic measurement was done two minutes
      after premedication. Spinal anesthesia was performed while patients in sitting position at
      L3-4 or L4-5 level with median or paramedian approach, with total dose 2,5 ml of 10 mg
      bupivacaine hyperbaric 0,5% and fentanyl 25 mcg. After skin wheal of lidocaine at the
      intended spinous interspace were placed, spinal needle (SpinocanR, B Braun, 27 G) were
      inserted and advanced until subarachnoid space were reached. In group FD, 1,5 ml of total
      dose followed by 1 ml remaining dose after 90 s interval were given. In SD group, 2,5 ml
      total dose were given with 0.2 ml/second rate, and subjects were asked to remain sitted for
      90 seconds. If there were more than three injection attempts, the patients were excluded from
      the study. Co-loading 5 - 10 ml/kg ringer lactate in 20 minutes were given for all subjects.
