  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Te hypothesized that two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking
      surgery would improve survival in advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian, and primary
      peritoneal cancer because reduction of one cycle of chemotherapy can lead to the removal of
      more tumor burden, compared with three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      So the investigators aim to compare survival, rate of successful optimal cytoreductive
      surgery, post-operative complications, and quality of life between two and three cycles of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery for advanced epithelial
      ovarian, fallopian, and primary peritoneal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard treatment
      for advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian and primary peritoneal cancer. However, three or
      four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS)
      has been introduced in clinical setting because four randomized controlled trials related
      have shown a lower rate of complications in NAC followed by IDS despite the similar efficacy
      between PDS and NAC followed by IDS in advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian and primary
      peritoneal cancers. However, these trials have some limitations that the rate of optimal
      cytoreduction defined as the size of residual tumor &lt;1 cm was about 40%, which was a
      disappointed result not showing the surgical effect improving survival. Nevertheless, more
      treatment strategies using NAC followed by IDS should be investigated because NAC followed by
      IDS has been already known as another standard treatment due to the safety.

      A recent meta-analysis has reported that reduction of one cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      may increase overall survival of 4.1 months because it can induce surgical resection of more
      visible tumors with drug-resistant. Moreover, a related clinical trial has shown that
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) may increase survival in patients with
      advanced ovarian cancer who received three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy because HIPEC
      can kill drug-resistant invisible tumor cells which were not resected during IDS. Thus, the
      investigators designed a phase 3, multicenter, randomized controlled trial for comparing
      survival, clinical outcomes and quality of life between two and three cycles of NAC followed
      by IDS, and thereby will investigate the efficacy and safety of reduction of one cycle of
      NAC.
