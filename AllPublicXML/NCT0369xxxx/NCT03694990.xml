  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative assessment and debridement are key components in patient care for surgery
      patients. However, a standardized protocol for management after endoscopic skull base surgery
      is unavailable. In this study, investigators will observe the effect of various follow-up
      schedules on the patient's quality of life after surgery. Patients who received surgery for
      pituitary adenoma will be placed randomly in 1 of 3 groups (short-term = follow-up in 2 weeks
      and 8 weeks after surgery; intermediate = 4 weeks and 8 weeks; long-term = 8 weeks). At each
      visit, patients will be asked to complete a packet of surveys and questionnaires that provide
      metrics on their quality of life in addition to receiving standard patient care
      (post-operative assessment and nasal debridement). Researchers hope to find that a follow-up
      schedule that has patients visiting the clinic closer to their surgery date will increase the
      patient's quality of life after surgery.
