  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to describe the effectiveness of Flublok Quadrivalent
      vaccine compared to standard dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV) in adults 18 through
      64 years of age. During this study, Flublok Quadrivalent or SD-IIV will be administered
      according to the guidelines in the Prescribing Information materials and only to persons for
      whom it is indicated. The 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021 formulations of recombinant
      influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine) and SD-IIV will be evaluated for outcomes
      including all polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed influenza, PCR-confirmed hospitalized
      influenza, hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia and cardio-respiratory events.

    <description>Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine is a recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine indicated for active immunization against disease caused by influenza A subtype viruses and type B viruses contained in the vaccine for adults 18 years of age and older. Use of recombinant DNA techniques to produce vaccine antigen expressed in cell culture is a method that avoids growing the influenza viruses in embryonated hen's eggs.</description>
