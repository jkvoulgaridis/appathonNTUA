          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18-42 kg/m2 (both inclusive) at screening.

          -  Initial confirmation of endometriosis by laparoscopy or laparotomy within the last 10
             years before the run-in visit.

          -  Transvaginal ultrasound documenting a uterus with no clinically significant
             abnormalities and presence of at least one ovary with no clinically significant
             abnormalities (e.g. no evidence of endometrioma greater than 3 cm in diameter) at the
             run-in visit.

          -  Having moderate to severe endometriosis-related pain.

          -  Willing to use a non-hormonal barrier method (i.e. condom) for contraception from
             randomization to the end-of-trial. This is not required if adequate contraception is
             achieved by vasectomy of the sexual partner or surgical sterilisation of the subject.

          -  Willing to avoid the use of vaginal douches or any other intravaginally administered
             medications or devices from randomization to the end of treatment.

          -  Willing to change usual analgesics to rescue analgesics as permitted by protocol for
             endometriosis-related pain from the start of run-in to the end-of-trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) within 10 months of the start of
             run-in.

          -  Use of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (3 months depot) or dopamine
             agonists within 6 months of the start of run-in.

          -  Use of GnRH agonists (1 month depot) or intrauterine device within 3 months of the
             start of run-in.

          -  Use of GnRH antagonist, combined oral contraceptive pill or progestin-only pill within
             1 month of the start of run-in.

          -  Undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.

          -  History of no relief of endometriosis related pain after any medical therapy or
             surgery. However, history of partial pain relief, discontinuation due to side effects
             are not exclusionary.

          -  Known bone diseases (e.g. osteoporosis, Paget's disease and osteomalacia) affecting
             bone resorption or bone formation markers.

          -  Any significant abnormal findings of heart examinations before randomization.
