    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new intervention (CARES: Cognitive Adaptations to
      Reduce Emotional Stress Associated with Type 1 Diabetes) designed to reduce caregiver
      depressive symptoms in families of children with T1D. This is a pilot, single-arm study, in
      which all enrolled parents/caregivers will be placed in the intervention group to assess
      initial pre- to post-treatment impact of the intervention on parent/caregiver depression,
      distress, and diabetes-related outcomes (e.g., glycemic control).

    <description>Participants in the intervention will participate in 12 weekly group-based telemedicine intervention sessions (up to 60 minutes each) with other parents/caregivers of children with T1D. Intervention sessions focus on cognitive-behavioral therapy to treat depression, including identifying cognitive distortions, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, coping strategies, and learning diabetes management skills.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parent/primary caregiver of a child diagnosed with T1D between 5-12 years old

          -  Parent/caregiver elevated depression symptoms on the CESD-R (score â‰¥ 16 at time of
             screening)

          -  Child with T1D receiving intensive insulin regimen by multiple dose injections (MDI)
             or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (pump)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child with T1D currently in foster care or not living with legal guardian

          -  Child with evidence of type 2 diabetes or monogenic diabetes

          -  Child with a co-morbid chronic illness (e.g., renal disease) that requires ongoing
             care beyond T1D

          -  Children who are chronically using medications that may impact glycemic control (i.e.,
             systemic steroids)

          -  Parents/caregivers who do not speak English (currently there is no way to recruit
             non-English speaking families because the study questionnaires are only available in
