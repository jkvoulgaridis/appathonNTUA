  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular Dysfunction - TMD is considered the main cause of orofacial pain of
      non-dental origin, and a public health problem. Due to their complexity there are already
      treatments using various forms of therapy. Photobiomodulation using different light sources,
      in a single or combined form, makes it possible to use it as another therapeutic resource to
      be explored. The objective of this study will be to evaluate the effects of
      photobiomodulation with simultaneous use of light emitting diodes (LEDs), red and infrared,
      on clinical aspects in individuals with TMD. A randomized, controlled and blind clinical
      trial is proposed, which will involve 33 individuals (n = 11 per group) of both genders, aged
      18-45 years in three groups: Group 1 - LED; Group 2 - placebo and Group 3 - control,
      submitted to 6 nonconsecutive sessions of photobiomodulation totaling 2 weeks of treatment.
      The Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders - RDC/TMD will be used to
      determine the TMD and evaluate the participants. Pain will be assessed using the visual
      analog scale (VAS), mandibular range of motion will be determined with the aid of a digital
      caliper, and the electrical activity of the masticatory muscles will be verified by
      electromyography. A mixed plate of 18 red LEDs - 660 nm and 18 infrared LEDs - 850 nm with
      power of 3.5 mW per LED, 4.45 mW/cm2, radiant exposure of 5,35 J/cm2, irradiated area of
      14.13 cm2, and energy of 75.6 J, in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) region and in the
      masseter and temporal muscles, bilateral in 6 sessions. Participants from all groups will be
      reassessed after the first therapeutic intervention, and again at the end, following the same
      evaluation procedures used initially.

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Fourteen days.</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is an instrument that allows easy measurement of pain intensity, and consists of a straight line 10 cm long, whose extremities have a verbal description (no pain and worse pain already felt, respectively), in which the participants will be asked to perform a perpendicular trait between the two extremes that represents the level of pain he/she presents at that moment. This will be evaluated at baseline, immediately after treatment and at the end of the treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Fourteen days.</time_frame>
    <description>A digital Starrett速 caliper will be used to assess mandibular range of motion (in millimeters), that is, measure mouth opening, lateral deviations (right and left) and protrusion. This procedure composes the clinical evaluation of RDC/TMD. This will be evaluated at baseline, immediately after treatment and at the end of the treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electromyography</measure>
    <time_frame>Fourteen days.</time_frame>
    <description>The electrical signals of the right and left masseters and anterior temporal muscles will be captured. We will use an EMG System do Brasil速 signal conditioning module, with eight channels (module 830 C), using frequency bandpass filter between 20-1000 Hz, common mode rejection index&gt; 120 db. All data will be collected and processed using a 16-bit analog / digital converter (EMG System do Brasil速). This will be evaluated at baseline, immediately after treatment and at the end of the treatment.</description>

    <description>LED photobiomodulation will be applied at 36 points, bilaterally, in the temporomandibular joint regions, around these joints, and in the regions of the masseter muscles and anterior part of the temporal muscles, three times a week, totaling 6 treatment sessions, in 2 weeks. The LED apparatus is composed of a flexible rectangular plate (10cm/12cm), which adapts to the format of the area to be treated containing 18 red LEDs - 660 nm and 18 infrared LEDs - 850 nm, with a power of 3.5 mW by LED, 4.45 mW/cm2, radiant exposure of 5.35 J/cm2, radiated area of 14.13 cm2, and energy of 75.6 J.</description>
