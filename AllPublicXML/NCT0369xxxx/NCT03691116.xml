  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients, who have booked a first appointment with a psychologist or counselor at two
      primary care clinics, are asked to fill out a lifestyle screening questionnaire within the
      Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. Up to 150 patients will be screened. The patients who
      have filled out the first screening and given informed consent are randomized to either Group
      A: A digital health check-up, with more questions and brief feedback; or Group B: Treatment
      as usual.

      The digital health check-up is based on &quot;Hälsoprofilen&quot;, a material that successfully has
      been used with thousands of patients in Western Sweden. This material generates brief
      feedback to the patients about the status of their lifestyle behavior and indicates the need
      for change when necessary for better health. After 10 weeks, the patients fill in the first
      short screening again. Outcome analyses will compare the two groups.
