  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad aim of this study is to implement and evaluate the efficacy of Graded Exposure
      Treatment (GET Living) to target elevated pain-related fears in children with chronic pain at
      the Stanford Pediatric Pain Management Clinic (PPMC). The investigators will evaluate the
      effectiveness and acceptability of this intervention for children with high levels of
      pain-related fear and functional disability. If proven efficacious, it will allow for the
      dissemination of this innovative treatment model to others working with children and
      adolescents with chronic pain.

      The treatment intervention to be tested in this clinical trial is Graded in-vivo Exposure
      Treatment (GET Living) compared to Typical Pain Management (TPM) in adolescents with chronic
      musculoskeletal pain. Participants will be randomized into GET Living or TPM, and will be
      instructed to not seek new treatments for pain for the duration of the study. Both treatments
      consist of 12 1-hour patient sessions delivered twice a week across 6- weeks and 3
      parent-only sessions.

    <intervention_model_description>Adolescents will be randomized to either GET Living or TPM and stratified on fear (moderate/high; FOPQ-C: moderate [35-49] high [50-96]) and disability (moderate/high; moderate [13-29] severe [30-60]), to minimize the possibility of imbalance between the two treatment arms. To allow the use of small blocks while minimizing the probability of a blinded staff member predicting the next assignment we will use blocks of size two and four and randomly choose block sizes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>TPM is a treatment intervention that is representative of current standards of care in a multidisciplinary pain clinic setting. It consists of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Physical Therapy (PT) sessions, delivered separately by a pain psychologist and a physical therapist.</description>

Phase I-III are conducted with the psychologist, physical therapist, adolescent, and parent (as developmentally appropriate). Patient and parent will complete daily diaries and patients will wear the Actigraph throughout the duration of treatment.</description>

    <description>The protocol consists of 12 multidisciplinary sessions, 1-hour each, delivered twice a week, for an average of 6 weeks. Sessions will alternate between psychological CBT sessions and Physical Therapy sessions. Patient and parent will complete daily diaries and patients will wear the Actigraph throughout the duration of treatment. The parent will also participate in 3 additional parent-only sessions with the psychologist to address parental coping skills.</description>
