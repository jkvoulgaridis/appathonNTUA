  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center study to determine the pharmacokinetics and
      safety of intravenous Eravacycline in Children with Suspected or Confirmed Bacterial
      Infection. Male and Female subjects from 8 to &lt;18 years of age who fulfill the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single dose study to evaluate PK, safety, and tolerability of
      IV eravacycline in children with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection who are receiving
      systemic antibiotic therapy, other than eravacycline. The study design will allow for
      evaluation of PK and safety of IV eravacycline in a pediatric population at exposures
      predicted to be comparable to those already studied in adults. The study design is depicted
      in Figure 1.

      Two cohorts defined by age group will be enrolled simultaneously:

        -  Cohort 1: 12 to &lt;18 years of age (adolescents)

        -  Cohort 2: 8 to &lt;12 years of age (younger children) Eravacycline will be administered as
           a single IV dose using the optimum dosage determined from PK-PD modeling and model-based
           simulations of phase 1, 2, and 3 adult data. Blood samples will be collected for PK
           analysis at predetermined timepoints.
