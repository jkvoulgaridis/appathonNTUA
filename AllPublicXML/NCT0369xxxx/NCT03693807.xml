    <textblock>
      This study is being done to answer the following question:

      Is the combination of the Medtronic pump and the Codman catheter device a safe alternative to
      the C3000 Codman pump for delivering chemotherapy directly into the liver of patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer or cholangiocarcinoma?

      Group 1 unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer

      - Patients will receive either FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, Irinotecan or Irinotecan/oxaliplatin (anti-
      EGFR agent may be added to any of the systemic treatments) on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle,
      however initiation with systemic chemotherapy will not take place until 4 weeks post-surgery
      for pump placement, so the first doses of systemic chemotherapy will be given on Cycle 1, Day
      15, and then every 2 weeks thereafter. CT C/A/P every 2 months. A window of +/- 3 weeks for
      scans is allowed in order to accommodate patient schedules.

      Group 2 resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer

      - Patients will receive either FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, Irinotecan or Irinotecan/oxaliplatin on Days
      1 and 15 of each cycle, however initiation with systemic chemotherapy will not take place
      until 4 weeks post-surgery for pump placement, so the first doses of systemic chemotherapy
      will be given on Cycle 1, Day 15, and then every 2 weeks thereafter. Treatment will continue
      for 6 months in the absence of toxicity or patient withdrawal. CT C/A/P every 3 months. A
      window of +/- 3 weeks for scans is allowed in order to accommodate patient schedules.

      Group 3 unresectable cholangiocarcinoma

      - Patients will receive Gemcitabine (800 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes) and Oxaliplatin (85 mg/ m2
      IV over 120 minutes) or Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes) alone on Days 1 and 15 of
      each cycle, however initiation with systemic chemotherapy will not take place until 4 weeks
      post-surgery for pump placement, so the first doses of systemic chemotherapy will be given on
      Cycle 1, Day 15, and then every 2 weeks thereafter. A CT C/A/P every 2 months during
      treatment. A window of +/- 3 weeks for scans is allowed in order to accommodate patient
      schedules.

          -  History of other malignancy, except:

               1. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present
                  for ≥3 years prior to registration and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by
                  the treating physician
