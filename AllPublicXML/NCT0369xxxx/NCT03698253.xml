      The survey is a retrospective study to evaluate the prognotic value of EGFR expression, KRAS
      mutations and tumor sideness in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
      regorafenib and FOLFIRI as a third- or fourth-line setting.

      Primary objective:

      Progression-free survival

      Secondary objecive:

      Overall survival, best objective response, disease control rate and adverse events

      Number of Subjects: 41 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib
      and FOLFIRI as a third- or fourth-line setting.

      Plan of the Study:

        1. This is a retrospective study.

        2. Study Schedule Study date: the time getting approval letter issued by both regulatory
           authority and institutional review board (IRB). Duration of the study: 5 years.

    <description>Regimen for treatment consists of irinotecan (180 mg/m2 as a 120-min IV infusion for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA6) and UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA7); 120 mg/m2 as a 120-min IV infusion for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA7/TA7)), followedby Leucovorin (400 mg/m2 IV infusion over 2 hours), and 5-FU (2800 mg/m2 IV infusion over a 46-hour period), repeated every 2 weeks.
After every 2 cycles of each different dose of irinotecan, if adverse events (AEs) are under the grade 2, we will escalate the dose of 30 mg/m2. The estimated maximal dose of irinotecan is 260 mg/m2 for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA6); 240 mg/m2 for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA6/TA7); 180 mg/m2 for UGT1A1 genotyping (TA7/TA7).
Regorafenib is administered at adjusted doseage of 120 mg daily for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle.</description>
