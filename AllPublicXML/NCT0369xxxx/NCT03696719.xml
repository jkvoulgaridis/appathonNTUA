  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research regarding the effects of anesthesia on the central nervous system remain
      controversial with some studies suggesting a neurotoxic effect and others indicating a
      neuroprotective effect.

      In recent years numerous neuronal proteins have been found to be useful tools for diagnosis
      and prognosis of cerebral tissue damage. Among these neuronal proteins are the following
      markers: Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE), Tau protein, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP),
      Ubiquitin Carboxy-Hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1).

      BIS is a non-invasive brain monitoring technology which monitors the depth of anesthesia.

      In this randomized clinical trial, we aim to examine the effect of anesthetic method (General
      anesthesia and neuroaxial anesthesia) on neuronal damage as measured by NSE serum levels.

      One hundred and forty patients aged 18 and above undergoing Transurethral resection of the
      prostate, Trans Urethral Resection of the Bladder Tumor, Tension Free Vaginal Tap , Trans
      Obturator Tension Free Vaginal Tap and pelvic floor repair surgeries will be enrolled in the
      study.

      Patients will randomly be assigned to undergo the study either under general anesthesia or
      with neuroaxial anesthesia.

      Participants will be monitored using the BIS monitor, to measure the depth of anesthesia.

      Additionally, 9 cc of venous blood be collected from each participant in the surgery room
      prior to anesthesia induction, throughout anesthesia and one hour following surgery in the
      PACU in order to assess NSE levels.

      I

      Specific Aim:

      Primary Endpoint Our primary endpoint is to compare the effect of anesthetic method (GA vs.
      NA) on plasma level of neuronal damage biomarker NSE.

      Study Design:

      This is a prospective, single center, randomized controlled trial that try to assess the
      effect of anesthetic method on neuronal damage biomarker level. The study will be conducted
      at the Rabin Medical Center (Beilinson Campus), Petach Tikva, Israel, a tertiary university
      hospital.

      One hundred and forty patients aged 18 and above, undergoing elective TURB, TURBT, (TVT-O)
      and pelvic floor repair surgeries, will be enrolled in the study following providing their
      consent for participation.

      Index procedure:

      After consenting to participation patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following
      study groups:

        1. Patients undergoing surgery under GA

        2. Patients undergoing surgery with NA. Anesthetic regime will be subject to standard
           clinical guidelines and to clinical judgement of the attending anesthesiologist.

      Intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic monitoring will be according to standard
      departmental and clinical guidelines. Data will be recorded and stored electronically by
      Metavision system (iMDsoft company).

      BIS monitoring:

      In addition to the standard monitoring prescribed by the American society of
      Anesthesiologists, all study participants will be monitored with the BIS, a noninvasive
      monitoring device which measures the depth of anesthesia. The monitoring is performed using
      noninvasive electrodes placed on the forehead.

      Blood tests:

      Venous blood will be collected from each participant in the surgery room prior to anesthesia
      induction, throughout anesthesia and one hour following surgery in the PACU in order to
      assess cerebral biomarkers according to the ELISA method requirements. At each one of the
      assessment points 9 cc of venous of blood will be taken from each of the study participants,
      while routine blood tests are taken.

      Data Collection

      For each participating patient the following data will be collected and recorded through the
      study duration:

        1. Demographic data

        2. Each participant medical history including concomitant medications.

        3. Hemodynamic data including heart rate, automatic non-invasive blood pressure
           measurements, temperature as well pulse oximetry as routine procedures will be recorded
           and stored by Metavision system.

        4. Anesthetic data: anesthetic method, anesthetic agents given throughout surgery,
           anesthetic complications.

        5. Opioid use in the first 24 hours after surgery.

        6. Duration of stay in the PACU.

        7. Duration of hospital stay

        8. Functional status upon hospital release.
