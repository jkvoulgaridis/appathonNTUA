  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare a dyadic intervention (Recovering Together) with an attention
      placebo educational control in dyads of patients with acute neurological illnesses and their
      caregivers at risk for chronic emotional distress. The primary aim of this study is to
      determine the feasibility, credibility, and satisfaction with Recovering Together. The second
      aim is to show proof of concept for sustained improvement in emotional distress, post
      traumatic stress (PTS), resiliency and interpersonal communication outcomes in patients and
      caregivers.

      The investigators aim to improve the care of patients (pts) admitted to the Neuroscience
      Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and their family caregivers (cgs) by conducting a pilot
      feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=80 dyads; 60 completers) of the dyadic
      resiliency program (&quot;Recovering Together&quot;) to prevent chronic emotional distress in both pts
      and their cgs. Eligible dyads include adult, English speaking pts with acute neurological
      injury (ANI) admitted to the NICU, cleared medically and cognitively for participation by the
      nursing team, and their primary cgs. Dyads who are randomly assigned to &quot;Recovering Together&quot;
      will receive 6 manualized sessions (2 in person at hospitalization and 4 through live video
      after discharge, to reduce burden and facilitate access to care) led by a clinical
      psychologist. Dyads who are randomly assigned to the attention placebo educational control
      condition will receive 6 manualized sessions (2 in person and 4 through live video with a
      clinical psychologist), modeled after the Recovering Together program that will control for
      the dose of the intervention and support from therapist. Dyads will complete assessment
      surveys before, after the intervention and 3 months later. Clinical data on demographics,
      diagnosis, ANI severity, and any medical complications will be extracted from electronic
      health records.

    <description>Dyads who are randomly assigned to the Recovering Together program will receive any usual clinic care as determined by their clinicians. Additionally, dyads will be invited to participate in 6 30-minute skills sessions. All sessions will include both pt and cg. A clinical psychologist will deliver the majority of sessions while the PI will deliver at least 10% of the sessions. The main intervention goal is to provide dyads with resiliency and interpersonal communication skills necessary to optimize their recovery and reduce emotional distress and PTS.</description>

    <description>Patients randomly assigned to the control condition will receive an educational program that mimics the dose and duration of the Recovering Together Program but without teaching any of the resiliency or interpersonal communication skills that are hypothesized to be responsible for improvement in emotional distress. The control will entail 2 in-person dyadic visits in the NICU and 4 dyadic virtual visits after discharge.</description>
