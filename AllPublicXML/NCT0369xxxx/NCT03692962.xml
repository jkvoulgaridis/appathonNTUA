  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate whether enhancing sleep intensity locally in the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) can counteract a deterioration of cognitive control and therefore the
      previously described increase in risk seeking during chronic sleep restriction. To this end,
      a controlled, counter-balanced study, consisting of two weeks of sleep restriction will be
      performed. During one of the sleep restriction weeks, sleep intensity in the PFC will be
      non-invasively enhanced by acoustic stimulation of slow waves during sleep.
