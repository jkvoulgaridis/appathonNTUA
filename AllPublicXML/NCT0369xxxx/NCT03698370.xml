      This phase II trial studies how well gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 and gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2
      positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) work in diagnosing
      participants with prostate cancer that has come back. Diagnostic procedures, such as gallium
      Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 and gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 PET/MRI, may help find and diagnose prostate
      cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 (68Ga-NeoBOMB1) and gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2
      (68Ga-PSMA R2) PET/MRI for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial therapy in
      patients meeting the criterion of biochemical recurrence.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 intravenously (IV) and 45 minutes
      later, undergo PET/MRI. Within 2 weeks, participants receive gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 IV then
      undergo PET/MRI 45-60 minutes later.

      ARM II: Participants receive gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 IV and 45-60 minutes later undergo
      PET/MRI. Within 2 weeks, participants receive gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 IV then undergo
      PET/MRI 45 minutes later.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 12 months.

    <description>The number of lesions detected on Ga- NeoBOMB1 positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Ga PSMA R2 PET/MRI, and conventional MR will be compared. Outcome will be reported as number of lesions detected per patient for each imaging method.</description>

    <measure>Predictive value of malignancy</measure>
    <time_frame>After 1 year clinical follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The predictive value of Ga- NeoBOMB1 PET/MRI and Ga PSMA R2 PET/MRI imaging will be evaluated based on biopsy and/or imaging results during 12 month standard clinical follow-up. Outcome will be reported as percentage of detected lesions that were confirmed to be malignant for each imaging method.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven prostate adenocarcinoma.

          -  Rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after definitive therapy with prostatectomy or
             radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy).

             a. Post radical prostatectomy (RP) - American Urological Association (AUA)
             recommendation.

             (i) PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL measured after at least 6 weeks from radical
             prostatectomy.

        (ii) Confirmatory persistent PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL (total of two PSA measurements
        greater than 0.2 ng/mL).

        b. Post-radiation therapy ? American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
        (ASTRO)-Phoenix consensus definition.
