      Dental overglaze is consist of colorless glass powder and applied to the fired crown surface
      to provide a glossy surface. Natural glaze is a vitrified layer that is formed on the surface
      of the porcelain containing a glass phase when the porcelain is heated to a glazing
      temperature for a specific time, Adjustment procedure break the production of the glaze layer
      through a natural glaze or overglaze process and create a rough surface, The color of
      porcelain restorations is affected by surface roughness because rough surface reflects light
      irregularly and less than a glazed surface . Therefore, glazing or polishing after adjustment
      procedures is important to enhance the appearance of the restoration .

      Although glazed surfaces appeared whiter, the CIE L* value measured with the specular
      component excluded (SCE) geometry was lower than that of polished surfaces (28).Several
      reports have investigated different polishing techniques that support the use of polishing as
      an alternative for glazing of ceramic restorations .

      Polishing can reduce chair time, eliminates laboratory procedures, infection control may be
      obtained . Polishing is also important for the porcelain surface for esthetic so several
      different techniques have been described for repolishing porcelain surfaces in the mouth .
