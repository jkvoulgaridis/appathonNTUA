    <textblock>
      The research objective is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of spleen ultrasound stimulation
      in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a blinded and randomized controlled trial.
      Specific Aims include:

        -  Measure RA disease activity and functional metrics during and after a 2- week course of
           spleen-directed daily ultrasound treatments (within-arm and between-arm assessments);
           and

        -  Monitor adverse events during and after daily ultrasound treatments.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a controlled, randomized, double-blinded trial of short-term (14 days) treatment with ultrasound stimulation (therapeutic energy dose) or sham (no energy dose) delivered to the spleen.
Participants will be provided a portable ultrasound device or sham device for at home use. Participants will be trained on how to use the device and will be instructed to use it for 30 minutes per day, at approximately the same time each day for 14 days.
Participants will be assessed at several time points before, during and at the end of treatment as well as a one-week follow-up visit.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and Females aged 18-85.

          2. Must carry a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, as defined by the American College of
             Rheumatology in 2010:
             (https://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/2010_revised_criteria_classification_ra.
             pdf).

             Classification as &quot;definite RA&quot; is based on the confirmed presence of synovitis in at
             least one joint, absence of an alternative diagnosis that better explains the
             synovitis, and achievement of a total score of 6 or greater (of a possible 10) from
             the individual scores in 4 domains: number and site of involved joints (score range
             0-5), serologic abnormality (score range 0-3), elevated acute-phase response (score
             range 0-1), and symptom duration (2 levels; range 0-1).

          3. Exhibiting symptoms or signs of inadequate disease control according to one of 2
             measures:

             Modified HAQ score of greater than 0.3 and DAS28-CRP greater than 3.2
             (http://www.phusewiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Disease_Activity_Score_-_CRP_(DAS-CRP).

          4. Participants should have home access to broadband internet, such that online video
             conversations can occur with study personnel via study-provided personal digital
             assistive devices.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active bacterial or viral infection.

          2. Pregnant women or presence of active malignancy.

          3. Inability to perform minimal daily self-cares associated with feeding/dressing,
             according to HAQ.
