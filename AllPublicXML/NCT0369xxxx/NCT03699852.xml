  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental studies show that photobiomodulation modulates cell activity, angiogenesis,
      synthesis and collagen deposition. The aim of the study is to compare the time to
      reepithelialization of the partial thickness skin donor area treated with LED versus
      Membracel®. This is a clinical, descriptive and analytical randomized study with data
      collection in the Burned Unit of the &quot;Dr. José Pangella&quot; General Hospital of Vila Penteado, a
      public hospital in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Patients will be identified by Arabic
      numerals. The sample will consist of 36 patients, 18 from the Membracel® treatment group and
      18 from the Membracel® group and photobiomodulation (LED). The patients with
      partial-thickness skin graft area of 18 years or older, regardless of gender and skin color
      or comorbidities, may participate in the study. Data will be analyzed using descriptive and
      inferential statistics and compiled in tables and / or graphs, with the help of SPSS version
      24.0. The normality of the data will be tested and the tests will be performed. The
      significance level for the statistical analysis will be set at 5% (p &lt;0.05).

    <textblock>
      The experimental studies show that photobiomodulation modulates cell activity, angiogenesis,
      synthesis and collagen deposition, leading to faster burn closure when compared to non-PBM
      treated groups. Clinical studies are scarcer, but they have also shown reduction of the graft
      donor area, improved blood supply and healing of the graft recipient area in a shorter time
      and a significant decrease in the graft receptor areas dehiscence rate. The aim of the study
      is to compare the reepithelialization time of the LED-treated partial thickness skin donor
      area versus Membracel. This is a clinical, descriptive, analytical and randomized study with
      data collection in the Burning Unit of the General Hospital Dr. José Pangella from Vila
      Penteado, a public institution hospital in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The sample will
      consist of 36 participants, 18 from the control group, who will receive only conventional
      treatment (Membracel) and 18 from the LED group; Participants with partial thickness skin
      graft donor area, aged 18 years or older, regardless of gender and skin color or
      comorbidities, could participate in the research. Participants will be identified by Arabic
      numbers. The participants' wounds will be evaluated in the immediate postoperative period,
      1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th postoperative days and once a month after hospital discharge for 3
      months. Data will be analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics and compiled in
      tables and / or graphs, with the help of SPSS version 24.0. Data normality will be tested and
      further testing will be performed. The significance level for the statistical analysis will
      be set at 5% (p &lt;0.05).

    <measure>Change in the Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every two days until wound reepithelialization</time_frame>
    <description>This scale evaluates size, depth, edges, detachment, type and amount of necrotic tissue, type and amount of exudate, edema and hardening of the peripheral tissue, skin color around the wound, granulation tissue and epithelization. The measurement scale is of the Likert type, with five points, with 1 indicating the best condition of the wound and 5, the worst condition. The total score is obtained with the sum of all the items and can vary from 13 to 65 points, with the highest scores indicating the worst conditions of the wound. The items: size, depth, edges, and detachment should be scored with zero when the lesions are healed. The instrument contains two items: location and form - which are not part of the total score.</description>

    <time_frame>Every two days, until the 7th day after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale allows for &quot;validation&quot; by the participant, as he or she experiences pain and is therefore an expert on the pain pattern, location, intensity and nature.</description>

    <description>The LED Group and Control Group donor areas were evaluated for time to reepithelialization. They were considered completely reepithelized when no exudate was noted, the participant reported no pain with exposure of the wound to ambient air and was completely devoid of Membracel coverage and hematic crusts.</description>

    <description>The volunteer will be positioned so that the skin graft donor area is accessible. In addition to Membracel®, a porous regenerating membrane of crystalline cellulose (conventional treatment), LED photobiomodulation will be performed in this group. The LED board will be covered with waterproof and transparent film and re-covered with sterile, waterproof and transparent film to prevent contamination. The LED board will cover the entire skin donor area and will be irradiated with radiant exposure of 1.53J / cm2 and irradiance of 2.55 mW / cm2 for 10 minutes. The LED board will be applied in contact with the operative wound in the immediate postoperative period and applied through the Membracel® in the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th postoperative days.</description>
