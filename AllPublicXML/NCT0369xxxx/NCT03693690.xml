    <textblock>
      Laser thermotherapy can increase the stiffness of vaginal wall. It has been reported that
      vaginal laser therapy can be used to treat stress urinary incontinence. However, factor
      affecting treatment efficacy of vaginal laser therapy remains unknown. Thus the main aim of
      this study is to elucidate factors affecting treatment efficacy of vaginal laser therapy.
      Besides, the durability of vaginal laser therapy will be assessed. The above knowledge should
      be helpful for clinical decision making.
