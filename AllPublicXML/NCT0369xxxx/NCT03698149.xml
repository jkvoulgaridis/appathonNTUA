  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Test the feasibility of using electrocorticography (ECoG) signals to control complex devices
      for motor and speech control in adults severely affected by neurological disorders.

      ECoG is a type of electrophysiological monitoring that uses electrodes placed directly on the
      exposed surface of the brain to record electrical activity. With this ECoG-based neural
      interface, study patients will undergo training and assessment of their ability to control a
      complex robotic system and to determine if ECoG brain signals can be used to produce speech.
