  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is a newly-defined trunk block performed with local anesthetic
      injection by imaging the abdominal muscles with ultrasonography (US) guidance; thus,
      analgesia is expected to be ensured from the T7-L1 dermatomal segment level.

      In the study, the aim was to compare the postoperative analgesic effect of quadratus lumborum
      block in pediatric patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included in the study were randomly divided into 2 groups. Cases were assessed as
      intravenous opioid with 1 mg/kg tramadol HCl (Group O, n=20) or ultrasonography-guided
      quadratus lumborum block (Group B, n=20).

      Total analgesic amounts in 24 hours and first analgesic requirement times recorded.
