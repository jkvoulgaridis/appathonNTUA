  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to assess the prevalence of acute injuries in amateur and elite mountain bikers a
      questionnaire was created in accordance to existing literature. The questionnaire was
      translated in several languages by bilingual people familiar with mountain biking. The
      questionnaire focussed on demographic data, training volume, number of races per year, number
      of injuries since practising mountain biking, wearing of protective gear items and accident
      mechanism. The survey was conducted during the Swiss Epic Mountain Bike Event in 2017. All
      riders were asked to voluntarily participate in the survey.

    <description>The prevalence of acute injuries in amateur and elite mountain bikers was assessed by the questionnaire used. The riders mentioned the number of acute injuries, the number of races and training volume per year and years practising mountain biking. Further, the protective gear items were asked.</description>

    <measure>Differences in training and racing volume between amateur and elite mountain bikers.</measure>
    <time_frame>During the Swiss Epic Mountain Bike Event 2017 lasting from the 11th to 16th September</time_frame>
    <description>The number of races per year was multiplied by the factor 4 to transform the number of races into training hours. Then, both values were added to get the training volume per year. To detect the difference in training volume per year between amateur and elite mountain bikers statistical tests were used.</description>
