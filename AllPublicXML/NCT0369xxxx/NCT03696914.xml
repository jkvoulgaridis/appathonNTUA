  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In asthma, the type and importance of the inflammatory response in the airways has allows
      identification of different phenotypes. Of these, one of the most common is eosinophilic
      asthma, based on induced sputum differential cell count. Patients with severe asthma and an
      eosinophilic asthma phenotype have different pathophysiological characteristics than those
      seen in patients with with mild asthma. However, few studies have compared patients with
      eosinophilic phenotype according to the severity of asthma. In addition, the stability of the
      phenotype based on the sputum results has been criticized.

      This study aims to describe the characteristics of patients with eosinophilic asthma
      phenotype according to the severity of asthma and determine the stability of the phenotype.

             guidelines (36):

               1. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) increase by at least 12% (and ≥200
                  ml) after administration of a bronchodilator

               2. Current asthma symptoms and a methacholine provocative concentration inducing a
                  20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) &lt;16 mg/ml

               3. A respirologist's current diagnosis of asthma found in the patient's medical
                  report 3. Non-smokers or smokers/ex-smokers defined as someone with a smoking
                  history &lt;10 pack-years 4. With sputum differential cell count result 5.
                  Considered to receive optimal treatment for their disease (as per current
                  guidelines except for patients included in exploratory objective 1.

                  6. Stable asthma and asthma medication for at least 4 weeks before data analysis
