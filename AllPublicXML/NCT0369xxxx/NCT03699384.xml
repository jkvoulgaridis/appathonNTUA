  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I / II study. The purposes of this study are to: 1) find out what effects,
      good and/or bad, the combination of the experimental drug avelumab and the drug azacitidine
      has on people with AML and MRD, and 2) test if the two drugs, avelumab and azacitidine, are
      effective in getting rid of AML MRD when the drugs are given together in combination.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Up to 6 pre-allo SCT patients who are evaluable for DLT will be enrolled, with the first 3 patients enrolled in a sequential manner with a 1-week interval between the start of dosing for each patient. If the regimen appears tolerable in the first 3 patients (i.e., ≤ 1 of the first 3 patients enrolled experiences a DLT), then the next 3 patients will be enrolled concurrently. If more than 1 out of 6 in the pre-alloSCT group has a DLT, the trial will stop accrual. The combination will be considered safe in pre-allo SCT patients if one or no patient has a DLT out of the six patients. If the combination is safe in pre-alloSCT patients, additional pre-alloSCT patients will begin enrollment for the expanded phase II portion of the study, and accrual of 6 post-alloSCT patients for separate safety evaluation will begin. Toxicity will be graded on a scale of 1 to 5 as described by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be ≥18 years of age.

          -  Subjects must have a history of AML as defined by WHO criteria. AML patients with any
             cytogenetic abnormalities are eligible except for patients with t (15;17) (acute
             promyelocytic leukemia). AML patients who have never undergone allogeneic stem cell
             transplant must have adverse-risk AML by ELN criteria77 to be eligible. Patients with
             a history of therapy related AML, myeloid sarcoma, or patients whose AML evolved from
             an antecedent MDS or MPN are also eligible. Patients with any molecular mutations are
             eligible.

          -  Subjects must have received therapy for AML and have a bone marrow biopsy within 28
             days prior to registration that demonstrates a morphologic complete remission (CR) or
             morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) as defined
             by European Leukemia Net (ELN) criteria. Patients with prior myeloid sarcoma must have
             no residual evidence of extramedullary leukemia.

          -  Subjects may have received any prior therapy for AML including cytotoxic agents,
             hypomethylating agents, or other therapeutics to achieve morphologic CR or CRi.

          -  Subjects must have MRD in a bone marrow aspirate within 28 days prior to registration
             from the same bone marrow sample which demonstrates morphologic CR. MRD is identified
             by multiparameter flow cytometry as a cell population showing deviation from normal
             antigen-expression patterns seen in specific cell lineages at specific stages of
             maturation. Any level of residual flow cytometric disease is considered MRD positive.

          -  Subjects must be amenable to serial bone marrow biopsies, peripheral blood sampling,
             and urine sampling during the study.

          -  Subjects or their legal representatives must be able to understand and sign an
             informed consent.

          -  Subjects must have ECOG PS of 0 to 2. 9. Subjects must have adequate hematological
             function defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 × 10^9/L, platelet count ≥
             50 × 10^9/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (may have been transfused)

          -  Subjects must have adequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5
             × the upper limit of normal (ULN) range and AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 × ULN

          -  Subjects must have adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine
             clearance ≥ 30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula

          -  Subjects must be recovered from any clinically relevant toxic effects of any prior
             surgery, radiotherapy, or other therapy intended for the treatment of cancer.
             (Subjects with residual Grade 1-2 toxicity, for example Grade 1-2 peripheral
             neuropathy or residual alopecia, are allowed with approval of the principal
             investigator.)

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at screening for women of childbearing potential.

          -  Subjects must use highly effective contraception for both male and female subjects if
             the risk of conception exists. (Note: The effects of the trial drug on the developing
             human fetus are unknown; thus, women of childbearing potential and men able to father
             a child must agree to use 2 highly effective contraception, defined as methods with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Highly effective contraception is required at
             least 28 days prior, throughout and for at least 60 days after avelumab treatment.)

             alopecia, vitiligo, and sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2 is acceptable

             a. Subjects with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by
             treatment with Avelumab and/or Azacitidine (e.g., hearing loss) may be included after
