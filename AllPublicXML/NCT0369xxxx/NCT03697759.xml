  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study precedes a larger randomized controlled trial, to be starting in February
      2019.

      In this pilot study all participants are allocated to the intervention group.

      The intervention consists of a digital decision support system delivering a weekly plan of
      suggested activities that the participant can use to self-manage their low back pain. The
      plan is presented to the participant in the selfBACK app.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The selfBACK intervention consists of the selfBACK system, that provides the participants
      with an individually tailored weekly plan of suggested activities to use in their
      self-management of low back pain.

      The SELFBACK system constitutes a data-driven predictive decision support system that uses
      Case-Based Reasoning methodology to capture and reuse participant cases in order to suggest
      the most suitable self-management plan for participants. The selfBACK system is an
      intelligent system that will adjust the suggested self-management plan to the individual
      participants by using the information available on the participant (baseline questionnaires),
      weekly self-reported of changes in health status through the app, and data on physical
      activity via the step-detecting wristband.

      The weekly plan includes three categories of content; 1) information/education, 2) physical
      activity monitoring through wearing a step-detecting wristband, and 3) strength and
      flexibility exercises.

    <description>The selfBACK intervention is a digital Decision Support System (DSS) for self-management of LBP provided to the participant via a smartphone app (selfBACK app). In addition, the participant is provided with a step-detecting wristband (Xiaomi Mi Band 2) that interacts with the selfBACK app.
The DSS provides individually tailored self-management plans including content from three categories; 1) information/education, 2) physical activity monitoring through wearing the step-detecting wristband, and 3) strength and flexibility exercises. The weekly plans are individually tailored to the specific patient, using the data available from the patient, and each week the patients report back their progress on physical activity (step count) and exercise (volume completed). These data are matched with the patients follow-up data to create a self-management plan that is up to date and adaptable to variation in health-status of the individual patient.</description>
