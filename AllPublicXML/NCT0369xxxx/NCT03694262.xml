      To demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the combination of rucaparib, bevacizumab and
      atezolizumab in recurrent, progressive endometrial carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>

      The combination of the three proposed agents offers the opportunity to explore synergistic
      relationships between antiangiogenic and immunotherapy and antiangiogenic and PARPi.
      Increasing genetic instability by PARPi and double-strand breaks may lead to a
      proinflammatory state that would enhance the activity of immunotherapy, leading to
      synergistic response in a category of solid tumors that lack active therapy. It is expected
      that increased double-strand breaks may lead to increased expression of immunogenic antigens,
      increasing the effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy. Phase I data combining the PD-L1 inhibitor
      durvalamab with either olaparib or cediranib showed good tolerability and evidence of
      response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have recurrent or persistent/progressive endometrial carcinoma, which is
             refractory to curative therapy or established treatments. Histologic confirmation of
             the original primary tumor is required. Stained slides of either the primary or
             recurrent tumor are required. If primary FFPE samples are not available, a biopsy
             demonstrating recurrent disease must be obtained. Pathologic Slides/Blocks will be
             reviewed at the primary site for confirmation.

          2. Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible:
             Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear
             cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma not otherwise
             specified (N.O.S.), mucinous adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, transitional
             cell carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma (MMT).

          3. Patients must have had one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for management of
             endometrial carcinoma. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation
             as a radio-sensitizer WILL be counted as a chemotherapy regimen. Patients may have
             had, but are not required to have received, a second chemotherapeutic regimen for
             recurrent disease.

          4. All patients must have measurable disease, as defined by RECIST 1.1. Measurable
             disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each target lesion must be ≥ 10 mm
             when measured by

             CT or MRI. Lymph nodes must be &gt; 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI.

          5. Patients may be enrolled if they do not have a target lesion (&gt;= 10 mm lesion or &gt;=15
             mm lymph node), if they have measurable disease. This is defined by RECIST 1.1 as a
             suspicious lesion &lt;10mm or a lymph node &gt;=10mm but &lt;15mm.

          6. Patients must have an EGOG Performance Status of 0, 1.

          7. Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy

          8. Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception
             of uncomplicated UTI).

          9. Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one
             week prior to registration.

         10. Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy and
             immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to first cycle of
             treatment.

         11. Any prior radiation therapy must be completed at least four weeks prior to first cycle
             of treatment.

         12. Prior hormonal therapy is allowed. There is no limit on the number of prior hormonal
             therapies allowed. Hormonal therapy will not be counted as a line of therapy for
             purposes of this trial.

         13. Patients must have a urine protein of 2+ on dipstick. If dipstick is &gt;2+, 24-hour
             urine protein must be obtained and should be &lt; 1g for patient to be eligible.

         14. Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting
             release of personal health information for study purposes.

         15. Patients must meet pre-entry requirements, as specified in section 5.
