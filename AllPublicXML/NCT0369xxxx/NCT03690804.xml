  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mother-infant separation, as a result of hospitalization, leads to stress and anxiety for
      both parent and infant, lowers feelings of maternal competency and corrupts bonding process.

      Kangaroo Care (KC), is as a widespread procedure in which the naked newborn is placed on the
      parent's bare chest. KC is known to enhance neonatal outcome by improving temperature
      regulation, cardiorespiratory stability or psychomotor development. It also promotes
      mother-infant interactions and enhances parental psychological well-being.

      Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is a non-invasive tool able to consider autonomic
      nervous system activity. Previous studies have shown that pleasant feelings are associated
      with an increase of high frequencies variations index (HFnu index) reflecting a prevalence of
      parasympathetic activity. This one can be assess by a new monitor called NIPΣ (Neonatal index
      of parasympathetic activity) in newborns and ANI (Analgesic nociception index) in adults can
      provide a comfort index by quantifying the parasympathetic tone.

      The investigators hypothesize that kangaroo care could induce an autonomic co-regulation
      between newborn and parent by increasing parasympathetic activity.

      The study will involve 40 preterm or term newborns and their parent, performing a one hour
      kangaroo care session in intensive unit and neonatal intensive care unit from hospital of
      Saint-Etienne (France).
