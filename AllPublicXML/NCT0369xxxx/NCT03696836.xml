  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AIR Study is a multi-center, prospective, interventional clinical trial with the
      objective to evaluate the safety and performance of the Trammpolin® meniscus prosthesis
      system.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Trammpolin® meniscus prosthesis is intended to replace the native medial meniscus to
      provide pain relief in the medial compartment of the knee joint, when this is caused by
      medial partial meniscectomy.

      Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and who are implanted with the Trammpolin®
      meniscus prosthesis will be followed for 2 years. The patient reported outcome measures for
      knee pain and function, and knee clinical condition by MRI and X-ray is assessed
      post-operative compared to pre-operative.

          3. Is between age 30 and 65 years (inclusive) at the time of screening

          4. Has neutral alignment ± 5° of the mechanical axis, i.e., the angle formed by a line
             drawn from the center of the femoral head to the medial tibial spine and a line drawn
             from the medial tibial spine to the center of the ankle joint, as confirmed by X-ray

          5. Is willing to be implanted with the Trammpolin® meniscus prosthesis.

          6. Is able to do the study required follow up visits, questionnaires, X-rays, CT-scans,
             and MRI's

          7. Is able and willing to understand and sign the study Informed Consent Form

          2. Has evidence of a modified Outerbridge Grade IV cartilage loss on the medial tibial
