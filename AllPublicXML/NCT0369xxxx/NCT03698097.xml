      The practice of patient surveys for quality management is revised at the University Hospital
      Basel (USB). One aspect is a more versatile data acquisition via online portals and/or paper
      questionnaires, another aspect is the content of questions and the assessment of demographic
      data. In this situation a tentative survey on their preferences in this context was realised
      in patients who were treated in autumn 2016 at the Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma
      Surgery (DOTS) using a cover letter informing them about the nature of the survey. They were
      asked to provide few basic demographic data, they were furthermore asked whether they
      favoured surveys by the USB and if so with which focus. Finally they had the option to name
      three central topics for feedback and to quantify the number of questionnaires they had so
      far received by the USB. The survey could be completed in a paper and survey monkey based
      internet version accessible via a Quick Response (QR) code or link.
