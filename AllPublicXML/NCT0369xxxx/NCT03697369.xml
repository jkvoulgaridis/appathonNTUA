      Background: The use of insulin pumps in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes(T1D) has
      expanded, with lack of data comparing between the different devices.

      Objective: to compare prospectively glycemic control, technical difficulties and quality of
      life (QOL) between 3 pump devices during the first year of use .

      Methods: a prospective observational trial, based on clinical data retrieved during 12 months
      of follow- up. Inclusion criteria included T1D patients, ages 1-18 years, who started pump
      therapy as part of their clinical care in 4 university affiliated medical centers. The
      devices fully reimbursed by national health insurance are: MiniMed™ 640G , MiniMed® Veo™,
      Animas® Vibe®, and Abbott Omnipod®. Comparison parameters included quality of life (QOL),
      frequency of technical difficulties, skin reactions, discontinuation rate, glycated
      hemoglobin (HBA1C), mean glucose, total daily insulin dose (TDD) , pump setting parameters
      and BMI.
