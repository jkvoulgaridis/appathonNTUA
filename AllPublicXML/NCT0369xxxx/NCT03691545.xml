  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participating in regular physical activity and consuming a diet high in fruits and vegetables
      can aid in the management of various acute and chronic side effects of cancer treatment;
      however, few rural-dwelling young adult cancer survivors are active enough and consume enough
      fruits and vegetables to accrue benefits. Telehealth interventions show promise for helping
      these young adults increase their motivation to participate in these behaviours by addressing
      barriers associated with accessing face-to-face behaviour counselling services (e.g., time
      commitment, travel distance). Yet, few researchers have examined the feasibility and
      acceptability of a telehealth intervention that provides motivational support grounded in
      self-determination theory for these health behaviours in rural-dwelling young adult cancer
      survivors. Based on previous research, the researchers reasoned that rural-dwelling young
      adult cancer survivors' physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption would be more
      likely to increase if they participated in a telehealth intervention therefore, the
      researchers aim to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the
      intervention. The researchers also aim to assess if changes in perceived basic psychological
      need satisfaction, behaviour regulation, and perceived autonomy support are associated with
      changes in physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption.
