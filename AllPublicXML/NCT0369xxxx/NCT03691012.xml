      To demonstrate that detectable ctDNA in peripheral blood following debulking of the primary
      tumour or following completion of adjuvant treatment for is associated with subsequent
      disease recurrence in stage I-IV epithelial, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer
      (Ovarian Cancer)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective,multi-centre study involving serial blood collections from 100 stage
      I-IV debulked (or to be debulked in the case of neoadjuvant chemotherapy) high grade serous,
      endometrioid and clear cell ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer patients
      (EOC) or ovarian carcinosarcoma planned to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Tumour samples will
      be made available following patient enrollment for the primary debulking group, and following
      surgery for the neoadjuvant group for mutation analysis. Ascites will not be accepted. Up to
      four blood samples in the primary debulking group and up to five blood samples in the
      neoadjuvant group will be collected from each patient over a 6-8 month period for ctDNA and
      Ca125 analysis Choice of chemotherapy will be platinum based treatment at the treating
      clinician's discretion as per standard of care.

      Using the Safe-SeqS assay, the fraction of total DNA fragments (mutant and wild-type) of a
      given gene that contains the queried mutation will be determined. In cases where mutations
      are acquired in the tumour, mutant DNA fragments are expected to represent only a small
      fraction of the total DNA fragments in the circulation. In cases with germline BRCA
      mutations, where normal or non-tumour cells also harbour the specific DNA changes, we would
      expect to find the fraction of mutant DNA for a given gene to be much higher. If unexpected
      results are found for mutations, indicating the possibility of an inherited mutation, the
      patient will be informed of the result by their treating doctor and the potential
      implication.
