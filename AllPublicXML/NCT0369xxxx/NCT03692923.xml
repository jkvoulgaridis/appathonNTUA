  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to investigate the effect of exclusive peer-to-peer virtual support on
      pregnant women's well-being including physical symptoms, depression, social support, maternal
      attachment, and pregnancy adaptation.

    <textblock>
      The pregnancy period is marked by not only the joy and excitement of bonding with her baby
      but also dramatic changes in her body. The Internet's convenience and anonymity provide great
      possibilities for pregnant women to create a social network for sharing personal stories,
      seeking information and asking questions, and expressing own emotions and concerns.

      Although health-related online communities are emerging rapidly around the globe, little is
      known about the impact of a virtual peer community on pregnant women's well-being.

      The study enrolled 138 pregnant women, who were assigned to either the experimental or
      control groups. After obtaining informed consent from participants, we asked them to fill out
      the baseline questionnaires (Time 1). The first and second follow-ups (Times 2 and 3) were
      conducted at 22-24 and 36-38 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Participants in the
      experimental group received ordinary prenatal care in addition to virtual community
      participation, and those in the control group received only ordinary prenatal care.

    <description>Used to investigate the changes in the scores of pregnancy adaptation. Items are scored from 0 to 3 and they are summed to compute a total score ranging from 0 to 84. Higher scores indicate better pregnancy adaptation.</description>

    <measure>The Edinburgh Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>repeated measured at second trimester (22-24 weeks of pregnancy), and the third trimester (36-38 weeks of pregnancy).</time_frame>
    <description>Used to investigate the changes in the scores of depression. Items are scored from 0 to 3 and they are summed to compute a total score ranging from 0 to 30. The cut-off point for depression is a total score of 12 or above.</description>

    <measure>The Symptoms Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>repeated measured at second trimester (22-24 weeks of pregnancy), and the third trimester (36-38 weeks of pregnancy).</time_frame>
    <description>Used to investigate the changes in the scores of pregnancy-related physical symptoms. Items are scored from 1 to 4 and they are summed to compute a total score ranging from 22 to 88. Higher scores indicate experiencing more symptoms.</description>

    <measure>The Social Support Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>repeated measured at second trimester (22-24 weeks of pregnancy), and the third trimester (36-38 weeks of pregnancy).</time_frame>
    <description>Used to investigate the changes in the scores of social support perception. Items are scored from 1 to 5 and they are summed to compute a total score ranging from 20 to 100. higher scores indicate perceived higher social support from family, peer pregnant women, friends, and healthcare providers.</description>

    <measure>The Maternal-Fetal Attachment Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>repeated measured at second trimester (22-24 weeks of pregnancy), and the third trimester (36-38 weeks of pregnancy).</time_frame>
    <description>Used to investigate the changes in the scores of maternal-fetal attachment. Items are scored from 1 to 5 and they are summed to compute a total score ranging from 39 to 195. Higher scores indicate higher maternal-fetal attachment.</description>
