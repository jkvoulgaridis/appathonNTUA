    <measure>Loneliness Scale for the Elderly</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The loneliness scale for the elderly was developed to determine the sense of loneliness. The two subscales in the scale are: emotional and social loneliness subscales. There are 11 items in the binary Likert type scale. Minumum and maximum scores are 0 and 22 points, respectively. The total score is obtained by collecting the scores from the subscales. Loneliness can be divided into four levels according to the score. &quot;0-4 scores&quot; do not feel loneliness, &quot;5-14 scores&quot; acceptable loneliness, &quot;15-18 scores&quot; feeling very loneliness and &quot;19-22 scores&quot; feeling very lonely. Levels increase the level of loneliness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>There are 7 questions in the short form of the questionnaire. This measure assesses the types of intensity of physical activity. The items in the short form were structured to provide separate scores on walking, moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity activity. Computation of the total score for the short form requires summation of the duration (in minutes) and frequency (days) of walking, moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity activities. Standard MET values for activities were established. Total Work MET-minutes/week =sum of Walking+Moderate+Vigorous MET-minutes/week scores at work. The score obtained is classified as non-physical activity (MET-600 energy level), insufficient physical activity level (MET = energy level between 600-3000) and adequate physical activity level (MET ≥ 3000 energy level).</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This index evaluates the general emotional state. There are five items in the six-point likert type index. Questions that ask individuals how they often feel in the last two weeks are scored from 0 to 5. In this index, the points taken from the questions are collected and multiplied by four to 0-100 points. As the score from the index increases, it means that the emotional situation is good.</description>
