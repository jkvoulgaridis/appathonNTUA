      This is a phase 1/2a, randomized, double blind, single-center study comparing standard care
      alone to standard care with Aggrastat in patients diagnosed with aneurysmal subarachnoid
      hemorrhage. The investigational plan is to explore the safety profile of Aggrastat
      administered continuously over 7 days, beginning at least 12 hours after a clinically
      indicated Endovascular Coil Embolization procedure.

      As a part of the study, qualifying subjects will undergo two MRI scans, one at baseline and
      again prior to discharge. A neurological exam and vital signs will be administered at
      baseline, daily during drug administration, and at follow-up visits. Additional assessments
      include administration of the following questionnaires: mRS score, IADL, and QOLIBRI-OS.

             IVH); Grade 2 (minimal or thin SAH with IVH), Grade 3 (thick cisternal clot without
             IVH), Grade 4 (thick cisternal clot with IVH)

          -  Placement of EVD on admission.

             responsible for the hemorrhage must be secured in the following manner prior to

             not show a related intracranial hemorrhage.

          -  A likely hemorrhage event preceding the ictus due to the increased risk of early
             vasospasm. Prior sentinel headache with negative CT or prior sentinel headache where

             ruptured aneurysm.

          -  A medical diagnosis that requires continuous use of clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or
             tirofiban during study drug infusion.

          -  Antiplatelet therapy using clopidogrel, ticagrelor or tirofiban during the

          -  Immunosuppression therapy including chronic corticosteroid usage.

          -  Remote history of previous ruptured cerebral aneurysm.
