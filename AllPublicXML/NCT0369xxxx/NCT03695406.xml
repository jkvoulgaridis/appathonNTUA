    <measure>Feasibility (i.e., retention at initial follow-up assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (approximately 5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary metric for assessing Feasibility will be retention at the initial follow-up assessment. Reasons for ineligibility, refusal, or dropping out will be measured.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>During intervention group sessions (approximately 2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary metric for assessing Acceptability will be a five-item, investigator developed self-report questionnaire. Following each study session, participants will be asked to rate (1=not at all to 5=very much) the enjoyableness, convenience, helpfulness, relevancy, odds of future use, and overall satisfaction of the session.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of Cancer Recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (Post-intervention), 1 month follow-up, 3 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory. Validated self-report measure of fear of cancer recurrence. 42 items across 7 subscales (triggers, severity, psychological distress, coping strategies, functioning impairments, insight, and reassurance). Higher scores indicate more fear of recurrence. Severity subscale score â‰¥13 indicates clinically-elevated FCR.</description>
