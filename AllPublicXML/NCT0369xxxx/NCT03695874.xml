  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare inherited genetic disease of autosomal
      dominant inheritance with a prevalence of 1/6000. It is manifested by haemorrhages,
      mucocutaneous telangiectasias and visceral arteriovenous malformations. These symptoms
      significantly affect the daily lives of patients, their social relationships and their
      working lives.

      HAS (Haute Autorité de Santé) national recommendations focus on assessing and improving the
      quality of life (QOL) of patients. Many scales for measuring QOL exist but they are most
      often general and therefore have the disadvantage of not taking into account the
      particularities of pathologies and their symptoms and do not allow to have a precise vision
      of their impact on QOL.

      It is important to be able to evaluate this impact, to determine its nature and to quantify
      it so that health professional can adapt their proposal for the management of HHT patients.
      And only the development of a specific and validated QOL measurement scale will allow them to
      access this information.

      The aim of this study is to develop a scale of measurement of quality of life in HHT disease
      and to validate it, a scale specific to HHT, simple and fast to fill by the patients
      themselves.

Group 1: the purpose is to simplify a 75 items scale by a statistical analysis of the data collected from 400 patients. The statistical purification will allow to finalize an abbreviated scale (20-25 items).
Doctors specialized in Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia may suggest that patients enter the study. After submission of the information notice and collection of their non-opposition, patients will have the choice to fill out the paper version or the electronic version of the scale and questionnaires.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires.
Group 2: the purpose is to validate the abbreviated scale by a statistical analysis of the data collected from 200 patients. The statistical validation will allow to check the consistency and correlation of the abbreviated scale with other scales: a general Quality Of Life scale (SF36), an anxiety and depression scale (HAD), a social support scale (SSQ6) and a scale of regulation emotional (CERQ) and to test and re-test to check fidelity of the abbreviated scale.
