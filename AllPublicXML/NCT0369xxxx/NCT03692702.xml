    <textblock>
      Wellness Enhancing Physical Activity for Young Children (WE PLAY) is a teacher training that
      is based online and was designed to support early childhood educators' efforts to promote
      physical activity (PA) through structured and unstructured active play with preschoolers. WE
      PLAY includes six components: (1) online training; (2) video library; (3) game sheets; (4)
      teacher self-assessment; (5) supervisor support; and (6) activity packs that are designed to
      work synergistically. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of WE PLAY on
      children's levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during school hours. We
      hypothesized that children whose teachers received WE PLAY would have higher levels of MVPA
      during school hours at post-intervention relative to pre-intervention and relative to
      children whose teachers did not receive WE PLAY. A second purpose was to examine the impact
      of WE PLAY on teacher outcomes (i.e., knowledge, intentions, perceived behavior control,
      subjective norms, perceived power beliefs, normative beliefs, and moral norms). We
      hypothesized that teachers who participated in WE PLAY would demonstrate higher scores on
      each of these variables at post-intervention relative to pre-intervention and to teachers in
      the control group. A cluster randomized controlled trial was used in this study. Six Head
      Start preschools were pair matched and randomized to the intervention (WE PLAY) or control
      groups. Preschool children (N=57) and their teachers (N=25) participated. Child MVPA was
      measured using accelerometers for 5-day periods at pre- and post-intervention. Teacher
      variables were measured using online surveys.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in teacher knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 1; both groups). The WE PLAY group's knowledge was assessed again immediately following the online training (week 2). The control group's knowledge was measured a second time at the post-intervention assessment (week 4).</time_frame>
    <description>12 knowledge items were developed for this study and were drawn from content covered in the online training. Scores ranged from 0-12. Higher scores indicate higher levels of knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived behavioral control</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 1) and post-intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Items (n=4) were from a previously developed scale. Scores ranged from 4-24. Higher scores indicate more positive perceptions about one's ability to promote physical activity with students.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective norms</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 1) and post-intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Items (n=3) were from a previously developed scale. Scores ranged from 3-18. Higher scores indicate that promoting physical activity with children is viewed as important by the people most important to the respondent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in moral norms</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 1) and post-intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Items (n=4) were from a previously developed scale. Scores ranged from 4-24. Higher scores indicate a stronger moral obligation to promote physical activity with students.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in normative beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 1) and post-intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Items (n=5) were from a previously developed scale. Scores ranged from 5-30. Higher scores indicate that important people surrounding the respondent think that promoting physical activity with students is important.</description>
