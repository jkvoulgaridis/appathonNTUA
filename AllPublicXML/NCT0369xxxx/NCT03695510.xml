        Inclusion criteria

          1. Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity, oropharynx,
             hypopharynx, or larynx.

          2. The recurrent disease is not suitable for curative surgery or definitive
             chemoradiation, and/or metastatic diseases which are not amenable to surgery and/or
             curative radiotherapy.

          3. Tumor progression or recurrence within 6 months of last dose of platinum therapy in
             the adjuvant (ie with radiation after surgery), primary (ie, with radiation),
             recurrent, or metastatic setting. Clinical progression after platinum therapy is an
             allowable event for entry and is defined as progression of a lesion at least 10 mm in
             size that is amenable to caliper measurement (eg superficial skin lesion as per RECIST
             1.1) or a lesion that has been visualized and photographically recorded with
             measurements and shown to have progressed.

          4. Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously
             irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such
             lesions.

          5. Age ≥ 20 years

          6. ECOG performance status: ≤ 2

          7. Adequate organ function

          8. Recovered from any previous therapy related toxicity to ≤Grade 1 at study entry
             (except for stable sensory neuropathy ≤Grade 2 and alopecia)

          9. Agree to take biopsy before and during the treatment

         10. The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written
             informed consent for the trial.

         11. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required.

         12. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception, for the course of the study through 60 days after the last dose of
             study medication.

             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred
             contraception for the subject.

         13. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 150 days after
             the last dose of study therapy.

        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception
        for the subject.

        3.3.3 Exclusion criteria

          1. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma or nasal cavity malignancies other than HNSCC

          2. Concurrent malignancies other than HNSCC

          3. Prior exposure to anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4, or other immune checkpoint
             inhibitors

          4. Prior exposure to gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, osimertinib, or other known EGFR TKI
             inhibitors

          5. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as positive anti-HCV) infection.

          6. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          7. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy 14 days before signing informed
             consent.

          8. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.
             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted
             for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.

          9. Major surgery within 4 weeks before starting study treatment or scheduled for surgery
             during the projected course of the study.

         10. History or presence of clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormalities such as
             uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure NYHA classification of ≥ 3,
             unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia as determined by the investigator.
             Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to randomisation.

         11. Has known history of pneumonitis requiring steroids, or any evidence of active,
             non-infectious pneumonitis, or other known interstitial lung disease

         12. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

         13. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a

             treatment.

         14. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         16. Any history of or concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would compromise the patient's ability to comply with the study or interfere with the
             evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the test drug

         17. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.
