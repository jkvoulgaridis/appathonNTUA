    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM in cutaneous LP as assessed
      by the change in Physician Global Assessment (PGA), Body Surface Area (BSA), Index Treatment
      and Control Lesion by Clinical Assessment Scale of Severity for Index Lesion Signs and
      Symptoms (CAILS) score, Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), and Skindex-16. To predict
      responses through the identification of unique biomarkers of LP at week 0 and utilizing RNA
      sequencing on responsive and non-responsive tissue at week 4.

      This is a single center, exploratory, open-label, single-arm design study of 12 patients.
      Treatment naïve and treatment refractory patients with LP will be treated with INCB018424
      PHOSPHATE CREAM. Patients who are non-responders, to physician choice standard of care, will
      undergo a washout period and will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of 3 epochs:
      screening/washout period (of at least 1 week and up to 4 weeks), treatment epoch (of 8 weeks
      from screen/washout), and follow up epoch (of 4 weeks). The screening and washout period will
      allow for treatment naïve/ new diagnosis LP to undergo evaluation and diagnosis and for
      treatment refractory to undergo a washout. The total duration of the study will be 13-16
      weeks.
