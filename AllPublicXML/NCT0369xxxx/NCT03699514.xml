  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to collect data that will aid in future scientific and engineering
      exploration of correlations between clinical assessments and BNA scores. The results are
      primarily intended for scientific inquiry and engineering development purposes, and may be
      used in future regulatory submissions.

      A multi-center study in which subjects that had completed or are completing a BNA test with
      the Auditory Oddball task (or other tests that will be commercially cleared at any given
      time), will have the option to complete additional investigational tasks and optional
      clinical assessments and questionnaire forms. At each site, these additional assessments will
      be suggested by the site's study doctor or clinician and will be collected with the site's
      ePRO device. The study will include up to 10,000 subjects which had completed or will
      complete a standard BNA test. Authorized personnel will offer the subjects to participate in
      the study immediately after testing or contacting subjects that had completed the test in the
      past. Procedure of consent will be performed by the PI or delegates.
