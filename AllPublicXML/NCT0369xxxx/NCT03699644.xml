  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two of the most common types
      of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Identifying at-risk patients and gauging disease
      progression in a non-invasive manner would be invaluable. Early and correct diagnosis is
      crucial for coordinating supportive care, patient expectations, caregiver arrangements and
      family planning. In addition, as treatments become available, beginning therapy early in the
      disease before symptoms become severe will be important. Multimodal ocular imaging (MOI)
      includes an ophthalmic (eye) exam and eye photographs to evaluate different layers of the
      retina, which is the light sensing layer of the eye. Newer technologies make it possible to
      visualize the disease process occurring in AD and FTD by using MOI to look at the retina,
      since the retina is fundamentally an outward extension of the brain itself. This study will
      attempt to correlate signs of disease in the retina, as determined by MOI, with plaque
      buildup in the brain as seen by imaging. This will demonstrate the sensitivity and
      specificity of MOI for diagnosing AD and FTD in a noninvasive manner.
