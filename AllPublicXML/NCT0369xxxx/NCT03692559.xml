    <textblock>
      The goal of our study was to investigate whether different methods of dressing could lower
      catheter-associated bloodstream infections.

      The study method was experimental in design and recruited 331 medical intensive care unit
      patients with placement of central catheters in one regional hospital in northern Taiwan. The
      investigators used block randomization to assign patients to the study group or control
      group. In study group which included 163 participants, the investigators used aseptic
      coverings during dressing and in the control group which included 168 participants the
      process of dressing was as routine. Study period started from the first day of catheter
      insertion and ends with either the removal of catheter or discharge from intensive care unit.
      The investigators defined the infection outcome according to culture results, and the
      guidelines by Infectious Diseases Society of America and Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention, USA. Analysis was done by SPSS version 23. The investigators used percentage and
      average to study characteristics of participants. The investigators used Chi-Square or
      Fisher's exact test and Poisson distribution to analyze the incidence rate of bloodstream
      infections and the infection density. The investigators used Kaplan-Meier curve to
      demonstrate the catheter infection-free days and the catheter redness symptoms days of the
      two groups. The investigators used logistic regression model to analyze factors associated
      with development of bloodstream infections.
