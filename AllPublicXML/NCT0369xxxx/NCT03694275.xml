    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of TAK-935 on the frequency of motor
      seizures for participants with 15q duplication syndrome or CDKL5 deficiency disorder during
      the Maintenance Period.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935 (OV935). TAK-935 is being tested to
      treat people with 15q duplication syndrome or CDKL5 deficiency disorder. This study will
      assess the effects of TAK-935 on seizure frequency, safety.

      The study will enroll approximately 30 participants. Participants will be enrolled into 2
      groups based on their diagnosis as: 15q duplication syndrome or CDKL5 deficiency disorder.

      All participants will be asked to take TAK-935 tablets twice daily with or without food.

      The study comprises of 2 periods: Screening/Baseline Period and Treatment Period (Dose
      Optimization and Maintenance). The overall time to participate in this study approximately 30
      weeks, including 4 to 6 weeks Screening/Baseline Period, 20 weeks Treatment Period, 2 weeks
      Taper, and 2 weeks safety follow up period. Participants completing this study will have an
      option to enroll in the open-label extension (OLE) study, under a separate protocol.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
