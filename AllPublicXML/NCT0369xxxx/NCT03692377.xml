  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who present to the emergency department often require painful procedures
      (intravenous catheterization, laceration repair, fracture reduction, etc.). Virtual reality
      (VR) has been presented as a way of managing pain and anxiety in children undergoing painful
      procedures but most studies are limited to children 6 or older. The present study seeks to
      determine the youngest age (2-6) of future subjects in research of VR and clinical care.

      Virtual Reality is an immersive experience using sight, sound, and position sense. Using VR
      may enhance distraction during the painful procedure and may reduce attention to pain.

      Investigators will instruct and observe children age 2-6 in using a VR device and document
      how easy the device is to use for the child. The children will have the opportunity to select
      an application and play with the device for 10 minutes before being asked about their
      experience with the device. Parents/Guardians will also be asked about their child's
      experience with the device.

    <time_frame>Recorded during Stage 4 of the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The research assistant will assess how the child reacts to wearing VR as measured by a five point scale:
- Child tries to use the headset themselves with no help
- Child helps the research assistant to put the headset on their face
- Child is passive while the research assistant to put the headset on their face
- Child resist by pushing the research assistant's hands
- Child significantly resist/ cry/ wave arms / push feet</description>

    <measure>Willingness to Return VR as measured by a three point scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Recorded during Stage 6 of the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The research assistant will record willingness to return VR as measured by a three point scale:
- Give away the headset after requested to do so once
- Give away the headset after requested to do so several times
- Want to continue playing and does not give the set away</description>

    <measure>Patient experience questions as measured by a 4 point scale and open ended question</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention (within 10 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The research assistant will ask the patient four questions on a four point scale:
How easy or hard it was to wear the VR goggles [1-very hard …………. 4-very easy] How easy or hard it was to see the video [1-very hard …………. 4-very easy] Do they want their parents to also try the VR goggles [1-not at all …………. 4-yes, immediately] Would they like to play again with the VR goggles [1-not at all …………. 4-yes, immediately]
One open ended question will be asked about any problems with VR.</description>

How easy or hard it was for your child to wear the VR goggles [1-very hard …………. 4-very easy] Do they want their child to try the VR goggles next time they need a procedure in the hospital
[1-not at all …………. 4-yes, immediately]
