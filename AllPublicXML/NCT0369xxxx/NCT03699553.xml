  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects millions of Americans but integrative as well as conventional treatments
      fall short in terms of alleviating this pain. The investigators are testing a tailored online
      positive affect skills intervention through a high-quality, randomized controlled trial for
      people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The proposed work holds promise as an effective,
      low cost, easily disseminated intervention to help people cope with chronic pain, decrease
      depression and distress that pose barriers to optimal adherence, and potentially boost the
      efficacy of integrative as well as conventional pain treatments.
