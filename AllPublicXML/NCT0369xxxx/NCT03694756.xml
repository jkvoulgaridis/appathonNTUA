      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of a new imaging technology in the
      management of breast cancer. Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis - Magnetic Resonance
      imaging (TMEM-MRI) has the ability to detect tumor areas with more leakiness (perfusion),
      where cancer cell enter blood vessels to travel to other sites. This novel TMEM-MRI has
      potential to be used in clinical practice to identify tumors with high leakiness that might
      have higher chances to recur after breast cancer treatment. In addition, TMEM-MRI can
      potentially be used to assess response to preoperative treatments (chemotherapy, hormonal
      therapy) over time.

    <measure>Tumor permeability assessed by TMEM-MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>It will take you about 24 months to complete this research study outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor permeability will be assessed by TMEM-MRI, and is defined as a number of Uth units (the number of tumor voxels with permeability density above threshold divided by the number of all tumor voxels) that will be obtained from the permeability map and TMEM-MRI algorithm.</description>

    <measure>TMEM density in breast cancer patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>It will take you about 24 months to complete this research study outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>TMEM density is defined as the number of TMEM units visualized by triple immunohistochemistry in 10 high power fields (40X). TMEM density will be measured with a fully automated and scalable clinical assay for identification and enumeration of TMEM utilizing digital pathology methods coupled with image analysis</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MenaCalc</measure>
    <time_frame>It will take you about 24 months to complete this research study outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>MenaCalc is calculated by subtracting the Z-score value of Mena11a from the Z-score value of pan-Mena, obtained by quantitative immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tumor specimens. MenaCalc can also be measured by qRT-PCR in cancer cells obtained by FNA</description>

    <measure>MenaInv</measure>
    <time_frame>It will take you about 24 months to complete this research study outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>MenaInv is calculated as pixel intensity obtained by quantitative immunofluorescence per area of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. MenaINV can also be measured by qRT-PCR in cancer cells obtained by FNA</description>

    <description>Patients identified by a radiologist at the time of diagnostic evaluation. Once consent is obtained, the TMEM-MRI will be scheduled. After TMEM-MRI, the patient will undergo core biopsy as per usual radiology procedure, with additional FNA at the time of core biopsy (preceding the core biopsy). MenaINV and MenaCalc will be calculated from the FNA material. After the breast biopsy confirms the suspected diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma, the patient will be referred to breast surgery and a treatment plan devised, as per NCCN/ASCO guidelines. TMEM density, MenaCalc and MenaINV will be also calculated from the specimen obtained at the time of definitive surgery. Uth qTPERM will be correlated with TMEM density, MenaCalc and MenaINV.</description>

    <description>FNA: The patients who are recruited prior to biopsy (Cohort A) will have had TMEM-MRI performed prior to biopsy. They will then present to radiology for ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the breast mass. FNA will be performed during this procedure. The FNA will be performed after local anesthetic is administered but prior to insertion of the core biopsy needle. FNA will be performed by the radiologist under direct sonographic visualization of the mass. Five passes will be obtained with a 25 gauge needle. The FNA material will be expelled into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing phosphate buffered saline with EDTA.</description>
