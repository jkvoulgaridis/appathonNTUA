  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the feasibility and potential effects of a simple, home-based daily
      meditation intervention on breast cancer survivors' cognitive and psychological functioning
      as well as inflammatory regulation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two home based 8-week interventions (Kirtan Kriya meditation vs.

      relaxing instrumental music listening) in 40 breast cancer survivors ages 21-75 who completed
      chemotherapy 3 months to 5 years prior.

    <intervention_name>Kirtan Kriya meditation</intervention_name>
    <description>The program incorporates song with visualization and mudras, and is a multi-faceted, multisensory exercise that appears to engage several areas of the brain implicated in cognitive decline, yet is simple to learn and practice. The meditation includes a repeated Kirtan or song, a mudra or physical/motor component, and a visualization component. The meditation sound file will contain a user friendly introduction to the Kirtan Kriya meditation technique along with detailed instructions and meditation tracks. Three tracks will contain 12 minute guided meditations with the same female voice, and 2 with nature sounds, 2 without any additional sounds. Another 2 tracks will provide only the timing cues (1 with nature sounds, 1 without) so that the participant can conduct the meditation session without guidance if they chose.</description>

    <description>The participants will receive audio files and an instruction sheet to facilitate their practice.
The audio tracks are 12 minutes in length and contain relaxing instrumental music from Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, and Pachebel. Participants are instructed to sit comfortably with their eyes closed and listen to a track of their choice for 12 min daily, for 8 weeks and to record each session on their practice log.</description>
