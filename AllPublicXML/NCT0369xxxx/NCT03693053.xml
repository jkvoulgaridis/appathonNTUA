      Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that affects coronary, cerebral, and lower-extremity
      arteries. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the manifestation of atherosclerosis in the
      legs. Three different stages can be found: asymptomatic stage (stage 1), exercise ischemia
      stage (stage 2) and rest ischemia stage (stage 3). The risk factors for PAD are similar to
      those for coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CBVD), like high blood
      pressure, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia and obesity. But cigarette smoking is the single
      most important risk factor for the development and progression of PAD.

      PAD is a serious illness and an important predictor of cardiovascular disease with major
      medico-economic consequences.

      A low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with higher cardiovascular mortality and
      morbidity. In these vulnerable populations, there is an increase in the prevalence of
      cardiovascular risk factors, particularly for smoking.

      The main objective of this study was to assess the level of precariousness in patients with
      symptomatic PAD and compare it to the level of precariousness in the general population.

      Patients were recruited from vascular medicine and surgery department of Grenoble university
      hospital or therapeutic education outpatient consultation.

      The analysis of socio-economic and environmental data resulted in:

      - EPICES score: (Evaluation of the Deprivation and Inequalities of Health in Healthcare
      Centers score). The EPICES score is a quick and validated questionnaire to assess
      precariousness at the individual level, developed by considering all the material and
      psychosocial dimensions of precariousness.

      Precariousness, according to the EPICES score, in the general population is estimated at 40%.

      - INSEE parameters. The investigators completed the EPICES score with more traditional
      indicators derived from The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE)
      collects, analyses and disseminates information on the French economy and society. The
      investigators collected the level of education and professional practice based on the
      nomenclature of socio-professional categories defined by INSEE.

      Cardiovascular risk factors were also collected to measure the links between the level of
      precariousness and cardiovascular risk factors.

    <description>The level of precariousness is measured by EPICES score : It consists of 11 items related to isolation, health insurance status, economic status, social support and leisure activity. For each item, a binary response Yes/No is expected from the patient. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, from lack to the highest social deprivation. Patients were considered precarious if their score is superior to threshold of 30.</description>

    <description>Cardiovascular risk factors were:
Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, or current use of antihypertensive drugs.
Hypercholesterolemia was defined as LDL cholesterol levels of 0,7 g/l or higher or current use statin.
Subjects were considered to have diabetes mellitus if they reported a physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, were taking prescription medications for diabetes mellitus (either insulin or oral agents).
Subjects were classified into groups of current smokers, former smokers (smoking cessation for more than 9 months) and non-smokers.</description>
