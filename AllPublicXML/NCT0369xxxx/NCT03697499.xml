    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether dietary supplementation with fish oil can protect against
      the cardiopulmonary effects induced by ozone exposure.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial among 64 healthy young adults in
      Shanghai, China. The eligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 2*2 factorial
      design to 1 of 4 groups: 1) fish oil and ozone exposure, 2) fish oil and shame exposure, 3)
      soy oil and ozone exposure, or 4) soy oil and shame exposure. The participants who take fish
      oil would receive 2.2 g/day (two 1.1-g capsules daily) in divided doses, and other
      participants will take the same amount of soy oil capsules. Two hour ozone exposure (200 ppb
      ozone) or shame exposure (0 ppb ozone) will be conducted in a chamber after four weeks of
      supplementation. Ozone is generated by a silent electric discharge method (HTU-500, AZCO
      Industries Ltd., Canada) and introduced into the chamber. The temperature and relative
      humidity in the chamber are maintained at 22±1℃ and 50%±5%, respectively. During the 2-hour
      exposure, each subject alternate 15 minutes of exercise on a treadmill and 15 minutes of
      rest. The exercise workload would be adjusted to achieve the targeted ventilation of 20±1
      L/min/m2 body surface area. Health examinations will be conducted immediately prior to
      exposure, immediately after exposure, 2 hours after exposure and again the next morning.
