  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart disease (CHF) can frequently cause transudative pleural effusions, some of
      which do not completely resolve with diuretics alone. These effusions can cause significant
      morbidity, leading to ongoing dyspnea and hypoxia, resulting in additional office and
      hospital visits. TREAT-CHF is a randomized trial studying tunneled pleural catheter (TPC)
      versus standard medical management for the treatment recurrent symptomatic pleural effusions
      secondary to CHF that are refractory to maximal medical therapy. TREAT-CHF will study whether
      the addition of a TPC can improve quality of life and minimize health care utilization over
      the one year following insertion.

      TREAT-CHF is a randomized trial studying tunneled pleural catheter (TPC) versus standard
      medical management for the treatment recurrent symptomatic pleural effusions secondary to CHF
      that are refractory to maximal medical therapy. All trial participants will be adults with
      congestive heart failure (CHF) already managed with maximal medical therapy, as determined by
      their cardiologist or primary physician. Patients will demonstrate recurrent transudative or
      pseudoexudative pleural effusions caused solely by CHF that have not been controlled with
      medical therapy alone. Included patients must also show documented subjective symptomatic
      relief with thoracentesis.

      Patients will be randomized to the intervention group or control group. The intervention
      group will receive a tunneled pleural catheter (TPC) in addition to their current medical
      treatment. The control group will continue with medical therapy by their referring physician
      and serial thoracenteses when clinically appropriate. Patients will then be followed over the
      course of once year after enrollment. The TPC will be drained daily for symptomatic relief.
      Several outcomes, including quality of life based on periodic self-survey and healthcare
      utilization determined by chart review (emergency room visits and hospital stays), will be
      studied. Adverse outcomes of TPC insertion and sequelae of frequent pleural space drainage
      will be documented.
