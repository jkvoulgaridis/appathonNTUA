      This is a Phase II, open-label, multi-centre study to determine safety of a fixed dose of
      Durvalumab (MEDI4736) (1500 mg) monotherapy in participants with unresectable Stage III NSCLC
      who have not progressed following definitive, platinum-based sCRT. Approximately, 150
      participants will be treated with the study drug in Europe and North America. Participants
      will be in complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or have stable disease (SD)
      following definitive, platinum-based sCRT, as assessed by the Investigator and further
      supported by the screening imaging radiological assessment. Participants must not have
      progressed following definitive, platinum-based sCRT; radiation therapy must be completed
      within 42 days prior to first Investigational product (IP) dose administration. Participants
      must have histologically- or cytologically-documented NSCLC and locally-advanced,
      unresectable Stage III disease. Participants will be treated with the study drug in 2
      cohorts: approximately 100-120 participants in the World Health Organization/Eastern
      Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (WHO/ECOG PS) 0 to 1 Cohort and up to 30
      participants in the WHO/ECOG PS 2 Cohort.

             assessed RECIST 1.1 criteria. . In order to assess disease progression, the baseline
             imaging (CT/MRI) used for Screening purposes should be compared against the most
             recently performed scan that allows physician assessment as per RECIST 1.1 criteria.
             If an intermediate scan taken between chemotherapy and radiotherapy is available and
             that scan is suitable for physician assessment as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, then this
             scan should be used.

               2. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease.

               3. Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease.

          8. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

          9. History of active primary immunodeficiency.

         10. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis testing in
             line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B surface antigen
             [HbsAg] result), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients with a past or resolved hepatitis B virus
             (HBV) infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and
             absence of HbsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C antibody are
             eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).

         11. Any unresolved toxicity of NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with
             the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the
             inclusion criteria.

               1. Patients with Grade ≥2 neuropathy or Grade ≥2 lymphopenia will be evaluated on a
                  case-by-case basis after consultation with the Study Physician.

               2. Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by
                  treatment with durvalumab (MEDI4736) may be included only after consultation with
                  the Study Physician.

         12. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to durvalumab (MEDI4736) or any of the IP
             excipients.

         13. Patients who have received cCRT for locally-advanced NSCLC, or who received sCRT with
             at least 2 concomitant CRT cycles. Prior surgical resection (ie, Stage I or II) is
             permitted.

             Note: Patients whose platinum-based chemotherapy contained gemcitabine and who
             received sCRT with at least 1 concomitant CRT cycle are excluded from this study.

         14. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP.

             Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine while receiving IP and up
             to 30 days after the last dose of IP.

         15. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the
             first dose of IP.

             Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable.

         16. Prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy, including but not limited to, other anti
             CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti PD L2 antibodies, excluding therapeutic
             anticancer vaccines.

         17. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of IP. The following are exceptions to this criterion:

               1. Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (eg, intra
                  articular injection);

               2. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of
                  prednisone or its equivalent;

               3. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, CT scan
                  premedication).

         18. Previous IP assignment in the present study.

         19. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational
             (noninterventional) clinical study or the follow-up period of an interventional study.

         20. Participation in another clinical study with an IP during the 4 weeks prior to the
             first IP dose administration.

         21. Prior randomisation or treatment in a previous durvalumab (MEDI4736) ± tremelimumab
             clinical study regardless of treatment arm assignment.

         22. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from
             screening to 90 days after the last dose of IP.

         23. Judgment by the Investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and
             requirements.

         24. Genetic research study (optional):

        Exclusion criteria for participation in the optional (DNA) genetic research component of
        the study include:

          1. Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

          2. Non-leukocyte-depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample
             collection.
