  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to
      report the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin for the treatment of adults with immune
      thrombocytopenia (ITP).

      The investigators anticipate to undertaking a parallel group, single-centre, randomised
      controlled trial of 30 ITP adult patients, which have no indications of glucocorticoid
      therapy (platelets count &gt; 30*10^9/L )from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China.15
      of the participants are randomly selected to receive atorvastatin in 20 mg/d combining with
      10 mg/d for 6 months. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and
      after treatment, adverse events are also recorded throughout the study in order to report the
      efficacy and safety of atorvastatin for the treatment of adults with ITP.
