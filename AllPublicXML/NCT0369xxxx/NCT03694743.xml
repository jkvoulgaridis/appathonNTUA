  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain after endodontic treatment is considered the most disturbing problem facing both the
      patient and the dentist especially in cases of symptomatic pulpitis as the patient is
      expecting to relief the pain that already exists.Therefore, this study aims to find a
      solution for the post-operative pain felt by the patient with symptomatic pulpitis in
      mandibular molars through comparing post-operative pain following use of 2Shape and Protaper
      Next rotary systems.

    <textblock>
      Root canal preparation is the most important step in endodontic treatment. For successful
      treatment, pulp tissue, dentin debris and microorganisms should be completely eradicated from
      the root canal system.However, it has been reported that all the instrumentation techniques
      (manual or mechanical) cause debris extrusion into the periradicular tissue resulting in
      periapical inflammation that causes post-operative pain and flare up.

      Instrumentation technique and instrument design were found to be related to the amount of
      debris extruded which is the main cause of post-operative pain. It has been reported that
      rotary NiTi systems cause less debris extrusion than manual instrumentation.

      Within NiTi systems, instrument design, taper and tip size were found to affect debris
      extrusion. Therefore, new innovations in the instrument designs are introduced in order to
      reduce post-operative pain and flare up incidence.

      Therefore, this study is established to compare the effect of 2 different rotary systems on
      postoperative pain in patients with symptomatic pulpitis.

      The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of rotary instrumentation using Protaper
      Next rotary system versus 2Shape rotary system on postoperative pain and the number of
      analgesics taken by the patient following single visit root canal treatment in mandibular
      molars with symptomatic pulpitis.

      Primary objective:

      Comparing the intensity of post-operative pain using Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) immediately
      after root canal treatment and post-appointment at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72hours.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  The need for / and number of analgesic tablets taken within 3 days after end of
           endodontic treatment.

        -  Instrument separation during instrumentation.
