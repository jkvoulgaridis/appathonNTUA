    <description>Youth will be assessed using actigraphy at baseline, and will then be asked to exercise for 1) a duration of 10 minutes &gt; MVPA at baseline with 2) HR&gt;120 while being monitored by a Fitbit. Youth will be asked to exercise daily, and intensity and duration will be increased every few days for a goal of 60 minutes per day at a HR&gt;140 (low end of MVPA). The intervention will be 6 weeks in duration.</description>
