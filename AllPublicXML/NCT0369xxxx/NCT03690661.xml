  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a small-scale randomized control trial comparing the
      intervention game to an active control game, and will assess outcomes at multiple time points
      (pre-, post-, 6-month follow-up). These outcomes will include a wide range of behaviors that
      are measured along a continuum from controlled lab-based tasks to uncontrolled, real-world
      social interactions between dyads.

      The investigators will conduct a small-scale randomized control trial comparing the
      intervention game to an placebo control game, and will assess outcomes at multiple time
      points (pre-, post-, 6-month follow-up). These outcomes will include a wide range of
      behaviors that are measured along a continuum from controlled lab-based tasks to real-world
      social interactions between dyads. The aims are evaluating 1) changes in the target
      mechanisms (social attention to faces, sensitivity to eye gaze cues) for the intervention
      relative to active control group, 2) engagement of intermediate mechanisms, including
      face-processing behaviors and real-world social communication behaviors, and 3) the relation
      between engagement of the target and intermediate mechanisms and symptom outcomes. Evidence
      of changes in autism social symptoms resulting from changing visual attention to faces and/or
      improved ability to understand eye gaze cues will provide clear evidence to inform a &quot;go&quot;
      decision about the therapeutic target for further clinical development.

    <measure>Primary Target Eye Gaze Mechanisms - Performance Accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Social Symptoms - Social Skills Inventory System (SSIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Social skills and problematic behaviors will be assessed via parent- and self-reported responses on the SSIS. These measures will be administered at multiple time points including pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3 months after the intervention (ie 6 months from pre-intervention).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Autism Behaviors - Social Responsiveness Scale 2nd Edition (SRS-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess potential changes in autism-like behaviors and symptoms, parents will complete the SRS-2 at each of 3 time points (pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3-month follow-up after intervention completion).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intermediate Face Processing Mechanisms - Face Identity (CFMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy in face recognition will be assessed via standardized measures including Cambridge face memory task (CFMT) at each time point including pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3 months after the intervention (ie 6 months from pre-intervention).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intermediate Face Processing Mechanisms - Object Identity (CBMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy in object recognition will be assessed via standardized measures including Cambridge bike memory task (CBMT) at each time point including pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3 months after the intervention (ie 6 months from pre-intervention).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intermediate Face Processing Mechanisms - Face Expression Identification - (CAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy in face expression identification will be assessed via standardized measures including the face portion of the Cambridge Affective Memory task (CAM) at each time point including pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3 months after the intervention (ie 6 months from pre-intervention).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intermediate Face Processing Mechanisms - Face Expression Identification - (RMET)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy in face expression identification will be assessed via standardized measures including the face portion of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) at each time point including pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3 months after the intervention (ie 6 months from pre-intervention).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Face-to-Face Social Interactions - Visual Fixations</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Eye tracking measures (ie visual fixations) will be collected during a naturalistic social conversation. Additionally, eye tracking measures will be collected during an interactive cued eye gaze task, which requires participants to select the object that a real person is looking at. These measures will be assessed at multiple time points including pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3 months after the intervention (ie 6 months from pre-intervention).</description>
