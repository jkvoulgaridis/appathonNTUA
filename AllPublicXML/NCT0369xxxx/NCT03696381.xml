  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of tRNS while undergoing
      computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy to conclude if this combination of therapies
      would be effective for the cognitive rehabilitation of patients with acquired brain damage,
      such as traumatic brain injury. We want to study the therapeutic potential of tRNS to enhance
      the therapeutic outcome of cognitive training, studying its global effect over the
      rehabilitation of attention, memory and executive functions, compared to sham tRNS.

    <description>The treatment consists of a set of 1-h sessions, three sessions per week for 8 weeks. A series of cognitive exercises of attention, memory, and executive functions will be conducted in each session. During the first 20 minutes of each cognitive training session, patients will receive bi-frontal and bi-parietal tRNS. It has a start and end ramp of two seconds in each case to avoid the slight unpleasant sensation that occurs in the first moments of the introduction of direct current DC.</description>

    <description>The treatment consists of a set of 1-h sessions, three sessions per week for 8 weeks. A series of cognitive exercises of attention, memory, and executive functions will be conducted in each session. We will apply a sham tRNS for the first 20 minutes of each cognitive training session. The subjects will receive sham tRNS and will perform the same type of cognitive training as the rest of patients and will receive the same type of adverse reaction questionnaire. Subjects receiving simulated stimulation will receive the same type of ramps at the beginning and end of the session to ensure triple-blind maintenance .</description>
