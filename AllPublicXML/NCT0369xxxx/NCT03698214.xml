  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A systolic blood pressure (SBP) lower than the heart rate (HR) could indicate a poor
      condition in trauma patients. In such scenarios, the reversed shock index (RSI) is &lt;1, as
      calculated by the SBP divided by the HR. This study aimed to clarify whether RSI could be
      used to identify high-risk adult patients with isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI).

        Adult patients having isolated TBI with a head abbreviated injury scale (AIS) ≥ 3 and
        without severe injury to other regions (other AIS ≤ 1) were included. We excluded patients
        younger than 18 or older than 65 years of age. Patients were grouped and analyzed according
        to RSI (&lt; 1 or ≥ 1).
