      This is a retrospective cohort study aiming to collect data on patients' characteristics,
      resource utilization, adverse events management and calculate costs attributed to current
      treatments of advance RCC patients who have received at least one prior VEGF-targeted therapy
      in Taiwan from National Health Insurance (NHI) perspective.
