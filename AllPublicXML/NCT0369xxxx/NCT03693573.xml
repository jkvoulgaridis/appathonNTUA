      Study MO39939 is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial in patients with unresectable,
      locally-advanced or metastatic, clear or non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have
      not received prior systemic therapy (who are treatment naïve in either the [neo]adjuvant or
      advanced/metastatic setting for clear and non-clear cell RCC). The study consists of a
      Screening Period, a Treatment Period, an End of Treatment Visit occurring approximately 30
      days after the last dose of study medication, and a Follow-Up Period of 4 years after last
      patient enrolled.
