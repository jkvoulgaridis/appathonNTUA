  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is often associated with various comorbidities that may influence its clinical
      expression. Among those, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) is observed in
      5% of cases. Asthmatic patients with CRSwNP appear to have more severe and poorly controlled
      asthma, as well as greater bronchial and systemic inflammation, especially those using
      inhaled corticosteroids as control medication. However, this remains to be validated. In the
      last decade, there has been interest labeled for phenotyping of asthma and CRSwNP. However,
      there is scarce data on the phenotype of asthma with CRSwNP.

      This study aims to describe the phenotype of asthmatic patients with CRSwNP according to the
      clinical, physiological and inflammatory characteristics and whether there is a more severe
      phenotype related to the dose of inhaled corticosteroids and the percentage of induced sputum
      eosinophils.

      This study will compare the characteristics of asthmatic patients with CRSwNP with those

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Aged 18 years and over 2. With a proven diagnosis of asthma as defined by one of
             the above criteria of current guidelines:

               1. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) increase by at least 12% (and ≥200
                  ml) after administration of a bronchodilator

               2. Current asthma symptoms and a methacholine provocative concentration inducing a
                  20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) &lt;16 mg/ml

               3. A respirologist's current diagnosis of asthma found in the patient's medical
                  report 3. Non-smokers or smokers/ex-smokers defined as someone with a smoking
                  history &lt;10 pack-years 4. Stable asthma and asthma medication for at least 4
                  weeks before data analysis 5. Written informed consent obtained for inclusion in
                  the database

                  Patients with CRSwNP

                  1. With a proven diagnosis of CRSwNP, based on endoscopy and defined as the
                  presence of endoscopically visible bilateral polyps growing from the middle
                  meatus with or without involvement of the nasal cavities

                       before data analysis. Patients who administer nicotine in other forms
                       (patches, chew tobacco, e-cigarette, etc.) will be excluded

                    3. Unstable asthma medication &lt;4 weeks before index date
