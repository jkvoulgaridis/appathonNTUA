      ANAIS is a therapeutic education programme for type 1 diabetes based on a flexible insulin
      regime adjusted to the patient's food intake. Participants are randomised in two groups, to
      attend the training course immediately (immediate ANAIS) or a year later (delayed ANAIS). The
      main outcome was HbA1c at one year.

      ANAIS (Alimentación Normal con Ajuste de InSulina) is a Spanish version of the DAFNE
      programme, performed in patients with type 1 diabetes. ANAIS is a randomised, controlled,
      parallel trial.

      ANAIS is a group-based, therapeutic education programme for type 1 diabetes based on a
      flexible insulin regime adjusted to the patient's food intake.

      Participants with type 1 diabetes and an HbA1c between 7 and 10% were recruited from the
      outpatient clinics in a tertiary care center. They were randomised (opaque, sealed envelopes,
      2:1 ratio) to attend the training course immediately (immediate ANAIS) or a year later
      (delayed ANAIS).

      The main outcome was HbA1c at one year. Secondary outcomes included lipids, weight,
      hypoglycemic events, treatment satisfaction, quality of life and self-defined objectives.

    <description>ANAIS is a structured therapeutic education programme aimed at providing the patients with the necessary skills to manage their diabetes independently and confidently. The programme particularly promotes dietary freedom, in an intensive insulin regime, by enabling effective carbohydrate counting and accurate prandial insulin dose adjustment and avoiding hypoglycaemia.
ANAIS was organised as a five day (Monday to Friday), seven-hour, outpatient programme using principles of adult education, with explicit learning objectives, in a group setting.</description>
