      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ADCT-602 in treating patients
      with B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as ADCT-602, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ADCT-602 in patients
      with relapsed or refractory B-cell (B)-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Phase 1.

      II. Determine the recommended dose of ADCT-602 for Phase 2. III. Evaluate the efficacy
      (complete response [CR] with incomplete marrow recovery [CR/CRi] rate) of ADCT-602 in Phase
      2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the clinical activity of ADCT-602, based on duration of response (DOR), overall
      survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).

      II. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ADCT-602. III. Evaluate the
      immunogenicity of ADCT-602. IV. Characterize the effect of ADCT-602 exposure on the QT
      interval.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain preliminary data on the correlation between the clinical activity and PK profile of
      ADCT-602 with the baseline expression of CD22 and other cluster of differentiation (CD)
      markers in peripheral blood.

      II. Assess the impact of soluble CD22 (sCD22) on ADCT-602 PK.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive ADCT-602 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
      21 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve
      CR/CRi receive ADCT-602 every 28 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks for up to 1 year.
