  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system
      leading to the impairment of motor, visual and cognitive functions. A standardized
      rehabilitation of cognitive functions can be provided by a systematized treatment program
      devised to improve neurological patients' quality of life. The degree of difficulty of the
      computerized tasks was adapted to a patient's predispositions and modified once a desirable
      improvement in the practiced skill has reached.

      The aim of the study was to assess the influence of cognitive therapy by means of the
      cognitive software on manual dexterity in patients with multiple sclerosis. We also attempted
      to establish whether factors like age, sex and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores
      contribute to the outcomes of that therapy. All patients enrolled will have a documented
      history of MS disease prior to study enrollment. The EDSS scores varied between 1.5-4 (mean
      score 2.1). The Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), administered to all of the patients, was used to
      evaluate the subjects' manual dexterity. Having been administered the NHPT test the initial
      86-patient group was reduced to a cohort of 40 subjects qualified for the study, who were
      subsequently randomly divided into two groups - the study and the control - each consisting
      of 20 subjects. Three times a week the study group received the upper limb treatment by means
      of the cognitive function platform. They were expected to achieve 96 levels of visuo-motor
      coordination in 3 months or the treatment was to be terminated. After completing each task
      the patient would move on to a higher level of difficulty. Failure meant having to redo that
      particular task. One training session lasted 20 min., after which the patient could take a
      break.

      Having completed the training each patient was administered the NHPT test again in view of
      assessing the efficiency of their upper limb. Due to progressive deterioration of health and
      other factors only 10 patients managed to complete the training.

    <description>The initial group comprised 86 subjects including. The Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), administered to all of the patients, was used to evaluate the subjects' manual dexterity. The standardized scale enabled obtaining scores of high validity (right: r= 0.984, left: r = 0.993). Having been administered the NHPT test the initial 86-patient group was reduced to a cohort of 40 subjects qualified for the study, who were subsequently randomly divided into two groups - the study and the control - each consisting of 20 subjects. Three times a week the study group received the upper limb treatment by means of the cognitive function platform. They were expected to achieve 96 levels of visuo-motor coordination in 3 months or the treatment was to be terminated. Prior to the first session of the treatment the patients were provided with all relevant instructions and information about the test displayed on the monitor. They could also choose which hand they would start with.</description>
