  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical performance (using the modified Ryge criteria) and patient satisfaction ( using
      VAS questionnaire) of pressed BioHPP PEEK based posterior single crowns compared to zirconia
      based crowns are questionable as the peek is considered as a new material and need to be
      tested for future clinical application.

      The study is held to evaluate the clinical performance (using the modified Ryge criteria) and
      patient satisfaction ( using VAS questionnaire) of pressed BioHPP PEEK based posterior single
      crowns compared to zirconia based crowns after one year follow-up. Patients requiring
      posterior single crowns are collected. After teeth preparation to receive single full
      coverage crowns, secondary impressions were taken. The patients were divided randomly into
      two groups ;one group will receive pressed BioHPP PEEK single crowns (the intervention) and
      the other group will receive veneered zirconia single crowns (the control). Fracture of
      restorations (1ry outcome) using modified Ryge criteria and the marginal adaptation (2ry
      outcome) using modified Ryge criteria and finally the patient satisfaction (3ry outcome)
      using a questionnaire, all outcomes will be evaluated every 2 months with total period of
      follow-up of one year.

    <masking_description>Double blinding (trial participants and outcome assessor)
Dental colleague assessors who are blinded about the aim of the study and participant's allocation will be responsible for assessing the outcomes of this study.
The level of intra- and inter-examiner reliability will be determined for each assessor by the performance of a calibration session prior to the start of the trial. A training exercise to the assessors with the main investigator will help to standardize measurement techniques and parameters. An interactive calibration session will enable the investigator to quantitate the measurement variability among and between assessors and enable the optimization of the measurement process. The main supervisor will solve any conflict that may arise between the assessors by repeating the assessing and giving the final opinion.</masking_description>

    <description>ZrO2, a ceramic material used for medical devices, displays good esthetic appearance, high mechanical strength, and high biocompatibility and is used in a wide range of indications, such as frameworks, implants, and abutments. In addition, it's very good long-term stability and reliability was proven in a 10-year clinical study. These excellent material properties and the transformation behavior are explained by the yttrium oxide stabilization of ZrO2.</description>
