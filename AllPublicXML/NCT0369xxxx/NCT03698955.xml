  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, cross-over trial aims to assess changes in body weight, plasma lipids,
      insulin sensitivity, and postprandial metabolism with a low-fat, plant-based diet and a
      Mediterranean diet, both followed for 4 months.

    <textblock>
      In a 36-week cross-over trial, overweight adults will consume a low-fat vegan diet and a
      Mediterranean diet in two separate 16-week phases. Changes in body weight will be the primary
      dependent variable. In addition, plasma lipid concentrations, insulin sensitivity, and
      postprandial metabolism will also be assessed and changes over time will be compared between
      the two diets.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to start either a low-fat vegan diet or a
      Mediterranean diet for 16 weeks. Both groups will receive weekly classes and support, and
      will be asked to make no changes to their exercise patterns for the study period. After a
      4-week washout period, participants will cross over to the second dietary intervention for
      another 16 weeks.

    <measure>Metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in metabolism from Baseline at 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to report to the laboratory within 60 minutes of waking and after a 12-hour fast. Following 30 minutes of quiet rest in a dimly lit room, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be measured. REE will be measured for 20 minutes through indirect calorimetry (Cosmed Quark RMR, Chicago, IL) utilizing a ventilated hood system. The laboratory temperature will be maintained at 23 degrees C throughout, and precautions will be taken to minimize any disturbances that could affect the metabolic rate.
For premenopausal women, measures will be timed so as to occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Postprandial metabolism will be measured for three hours after the standard meal.</description>
