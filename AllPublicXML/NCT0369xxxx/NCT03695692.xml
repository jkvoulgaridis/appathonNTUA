  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>overactive bladder symptoms measured by Overactive Bladder Questionnaire_V8</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline bladder symptoms at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overactive Bladder Questionnaire_V8 assessing severity of overactive bladder symptoms will be used. This scale includes items on urgency, incontinence, nocturia and voiding frequency, as defined by the International Continence Society, referring to the previous four weeks. The final score is the sum of the partial scores obtained for each of the eight questions, ranging from 0 to 40. Patients with a final score of eight or more are considered as having Overactive Bladder symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>urgency complaint assessed with The patient's Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline urgency complaints at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale assessing urgency complaints will be used. This scale is scored on 0 and 4 points (the best score is '0' and the worst score is '4') based on urgency complaints. Higher scores indicate more severe urgency complaints.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>quality of life assessed with King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline quality of life at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>King's Health Questionnaire assessing quality of life related to urinary problems will be used. This questionnaire consists of two parts and 32 items. The first part (21 items) contains two single-item questions that address General Health Perception and Incontinence Impact and the following seven multi-item domains: Role, Physical, and Social Limitations, Limitations in Personal Relationship, Emotional Problems, Sleep and Energy Disturbances associated with UI, and Severity Measures for UI. The second part has an 11-item Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) that assesses the presence and severity of urinary symptoms. While the entire SSS is scored from 0 (best) to 30 (worst), the minimum possible score is 0 (best health) and the maximum possible score is 100 (worst health) for all other KHQ domains.</description>

    <measure>pelvic floor muscle strength measured with perineometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline pelvic floor muscle strength at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>change in pelvic floor muscle strength as measued with perineometer</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>diurnal urinary frequency, nocturia, maximum urinary volume, the number of urinary leakage and pad changes measured with voiding dairy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline diurnal urinary frequency, nocturia, maximum urinary volume, the number of urinary leakage and pad changes at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be also instructed to keep voiding diary for three days. In this diary, diurnal urinary frequency, nocturia, maximum urinary volume, the number of urinary leakage and pad changes will be recorded.</description>
