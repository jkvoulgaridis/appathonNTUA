  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of therapeutic pain education and
      myofascial induction therapy on pain and function in patients with chronic low back pain. In
      the literature, studies on myofascial induction therapy in patients with chronic low back
      pain are very limited and there is no study comparing therapeutic pain training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar pain has become a major health problem which is growing and is very common in all
      societies and negatively affects the full well-being of the individual. It has been reported
      that 80% of the population experienced low back pain at any time in their lives. The
      prolongation of this painful process affects the physical, mental and psychological state of
      the patient and limits its daily functions. The acute or chronic pain determines the nature
      and duration of pain. Low back pain lasting 12 weeks or more is defined as chronic. In
      chronic diseases, lumbar pain, which is the first one, restricts the daily activities of the
      person due to current chronic pain or deterioration of functional status and causes loss of
      labor force.

      Myofascial induction therapy is a therapy concept focused on optimizing function and balance
      within the fascial system. The approach aims at global recovery, local correction and
      painless body use.

      Superficial procedures are directed to surface and / or local restrictions that can be
      directly detected by palpation. Deep myofascial induction therapy is a method that eliminates
      the limitations of the myofascial system and the three-dimensional pressures.

      Therapeutic pain education is a training intervention that aims to reduce pain and disability
      by helping patients better understand the biological processes that support pain states. The
      neurobiology of pain and pain processed by the nervous system is explained to the patient in
      detail. Changes the patient's olab viewpoint to pain. For example, the patient believes that
      the cause of pain is caused by tissue damage. The patient who receives pain education
      understands that the cause of pain is the hypersensitive central nervous system. As a result,
      the patient's fear avoidance behavior decreases and he starts to move more easily. Because
      the sensitivity of the central nervous system will be alleviated, the perceived pain will
      decrease.

    <measure>Mc Gill pain survey</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) is a self-reporting measure of pain used for patients with a number of diagnoses. It assesses both quality and intensity of subjective pain. Seven words are selected from the following categories: dimension 1 to 10 (pain descriptors), three words; dimensions 11 to 15 (affective components of pain), dimension 16 (evaluation of pain) one word, and dimension 17 to 20 (miscellaneous) one word. Scores are tabulated by summing values associated with each word; scores range from 0 (no pain) to 78 (severe pain). Qualitative differences in pain may be reflected in respondent's word choice</description>

    <measure>Roland Morris Disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire[1] is designed to assess self-rated physical disability caused by low back pain. There are different questionnaires available, which differ from each other in the number of statements: 24-, 18- and 11-item questionnaire. The patient is asked to tick a statement when it applies to him that specific day, this makes it possible to follow changes in time. The end score is the sum of the ticked boxes. The score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 11, 18 or 24 (max. disability) depending on the questionnaire that is used.</description>

    <measure>Survey of fear avoidance beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) is a patient reported questionnaire which specifically focuses on how a patient's fear avoidance beliefs about physical activity and work may affect and contribute to their low back pain and resulting disability. The questionnaire consists of 16 items in which a patient rates their agreement with each statement on a 7-point Likert scale. Where 0= completely disagree, 6=completely agree. There is a maximum score of 96.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of mobility (finger ground test)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>fingertip-to-floor (FTF) test as an outcome measure on the great majority of my patients presenting with lumbo-pelvic pain, for the simple reason that forward bending is one of the more painful and limited movements, especially in those with neural symptoms.
The FTF test has been shown to have excellent reliability without the use of standardized instructions and patient positioning.
It must be stated that the FTF test has been criticized for not measuring isolated lumbar flexion range of motion, with the argument that forward bending range is also based on pelvic, hip, thoracic spine, dural and shoulder mobility.</description>

    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a multi-purpose survey designed to capture adult patients' perceptions of their own health and well-being. Based on a much longer survey developed in the 1980's by Ware, J.E., the SF-36 has 36 items grouped in 8 dimensions: physical functoning, physicial and emotional limitations, social functioning, bodily pain, general and mental health.</description>

    <measure>Ultrasound examination of thoracolumbar fascia</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>thoracolumbar fascia Measurements and evaluation of TLF were obtained using single blind method when investigator didn't know any clinical information about a patient. Thickness of TLF was measured from both sides of a spine in the direction perpendicular to the skin. According to methodic of Langevin mentioned above TLF was divided to subdermal (SD) and supramuscular (SM). The general thickness of TLF is defined as the distance between deep border of the dermis and the superficial border of the muscle. TLF is hyperechogenic one or several layers (planes) structure which thickness is measured as a distance between the muscle and subdermal part of fascia.</description>
