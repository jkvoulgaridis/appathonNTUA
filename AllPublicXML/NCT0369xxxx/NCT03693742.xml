  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-DCFPyL is an agent that binds to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Due to high
      levels of PSMA in prostate cancer, treatments targeting PSMA have been developed to deliver
      therapy to these specific target cells. Unfortunately when this treatment is delivered there
      is radiotracer uptake in the salivary glands and kidneys, not related to cancer, which causes
      dry mouth and causes patients to stop treatment. It is proposed that having tomato juice
      containing monosodium glutamate (MSG) may reduce radiotracer uptake in the salivary glands
      and kidneys and reduce damage to these tissues.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single cohort study to evaluate the utility of MSG in reducing salivary
      gland radiotracer uptake, in patients who undergo an 18F-DCFPyL Positron Emission tomography
      / Computer Tomography (PET/CT) scan.

      18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans Each participant will receive 2 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans at the BC
      Cancer - Vancouver Centre, as part of this research sub-study. Each participant will receive
      tomato juice before each appointment. One visit they will have tomato juice containing MSG
      and the other will be a placebo (standard tomato juice).

      Each study participant will receive a bolus intravenous dose of 18F-DCFPyL. The participant
      will rest in a comfortable chair for 120 minutes and will then be taken to the PET/CT scanner
      for images.

      24 hour follow-up All participants will be requested to either return to the functional
      imaging department approximately 24 hours (acceptable range 16-28 hours) after the injection
      of 18F-DCFPyL and tomato juice consumption or agree to be contacted by phone. The
      participants will be asked if they experienced any undesirable effects following the
      administration of 18F-DCFPyL and tomato juice, or in the intervening 24 hours. The local site
      attending nuclear medicine physician will then make an assessment as to whether these effects
      are likely related to 18F-DCFPyL and/or tomato juice administration.

      The study is expected to take approximately 1 year for accrual.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective double blind intra-participant comparison of [18F]-DCFPyL PET/CT scans performed after orally administered MSG or placebo. The participants will receive oral administration of MSG or placebo, in two different examination sessions, 30 minutes before [18F]-DCFPyL injection.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>For randomization, a computer generated random list will determine the order of the scans (MSG first, placebo first). Sealed envelopes will be prepared. A study coordinator or technologist not involved in measuring vital signs or collecting adverse events will prepare the tomato juice solution based on the randomization envelope. The rest of the team will not be informed of which tomato juice is used (placebo or MSG) but this information will be recorded and will be immediately accessible should a participant experience a severe adverse event.</masking_description>
