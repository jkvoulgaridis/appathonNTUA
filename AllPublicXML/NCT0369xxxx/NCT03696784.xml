    <textblock>
      This research study combines 2 different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells.
      Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers, and both have
      shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study
      combines both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The treatment
      being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted
      against the CD19 antigen (ATLCAR.CD19) administration.

      Prior studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells and will increase their
      ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this
      study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells
      because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD19. For this study, the
      anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it
      is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called
      a chimeric receptor. These CD19 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to
      kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of
      fighting the cancer are unknown.

      Preliminary results have shown that subjects receiving this treatment have experienced
      unwanted side effects including cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxocity. In this study,
      to help reduce cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity symptoms, the ATLCAR.CD19 cells
      have a safety switch that, when active, can cause the cells to become dormant. These modified
      ATLCAR.CD19 cells with the safety switch are referred to as iC9-CAR19 cells. If the subject
      experiences moderate to severe cytokine release syndrome and or neurotoxicity as a result of
      being given iC9-CAR19 cells, the subject can be given a dose of a second study drug, AP1903,
      if standard interventions fail to alleviate the symptoms of cytokine release syndrome and/or
      neurotoxicity. AP1903 activates the iC9-CAR19 safety switch, reducing the number of the
      iC9-CAR19 cells in the blood. The ultimate goal is to determine what dose of AP1903 can be
      given that reduces the severity of the cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity, but
      still allows the remaining iC9-CAR19 cells to effectively fight the lymphoma.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving iC9-CAR19 cells is safe
      and tolerable in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I dose finding trial to determine if chimeric antigen receptor T
      (CAR-T) cells targeting the CD19 antigen and containing the inducible caspase 9 safety switch
      can be safely administered to adult subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell Lymphoma. The
      safety of iC9-CAR19 cells will be investigated using the 3+3 design. The starting dose of 1 x
      106 transduced cells/kg (dose level 1) will enroll at least 3 subjects in the initial cohort.
      If there are no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) within 4 weeks of the cell infusion in these
      3 subjects, then the next cohort will evaluate 2 x 106 transduced cells/kg. If there is
      toxicity in 1/3 subjects in the initial cohort, the cohort will be expanded to enroll up to 6
      subjects. During iC9-CAR19 T cell dose exploration, AP1903 (0.4 mg/kg), a dimerizing agent
      that is designed to engage and activate the caspase 9 safety switch to trigger iC9-CAR19 T
      cell death by apoptosis will be given to subjects who develop grade 4 cytokine release
      syndrome (CRS) or grade ≥3 CRS that is unresponsive to standard of care interventions, and to
      subjects who develop grade ≥3 CAR-T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) or grade 2
      CRES that does not improve to grade ≤1 within 72 hours with standard of care interventions,
      and subjects with grade 4 ICANS of any duration that have evidence of cerebral edema and/or
      generalized convulsive status epilepticus. After the tolerable cell dose (TCD) of iC9-CAR19 T
      cells has been determined, up to 18 additional adult subjects may be enrolled in an expansion
      cohort at the TCD. Rimiducid will be given to subjects in the expansion cohort who develop
      grade ≥3 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) that does not improve
      to grade ≤1 within 72 hours with standard of care interventions, and subjects with grade 4
      ICANS of any duration that have evidence of cerebral edema and/or generalized convulsive
      status epilepticus. Subjects in the expansion cohort who experience ≥grade 2 CRS that remains
      ≥grade 2 twenty four hours after an initial dose of tocilizumab may be part of the sub-study
      of rimiducid. These subjects will receive one of two assigned dose levels of rimiducid with
      their second tocilizumab infusion. The percent reduction in CAR T cells will be measured in
      these subjects. If the subjects' CRS is unresponsive to tocilizumab and the assigned dose
      level of rimiducid, subjects with ≥grade 3 CRS will then be given a full dose (0.4 mg/kg) of
      rimiducid.

      Cell Procurement

      Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL (in up to 3 collections) will be obtained from subjects for
      cell procurement. In subjects with low T-cell count (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry
      less than 200/μL) in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate
      sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be up to 2 blood volumes

      Lymphodepleting Regimen

      Subjects will receive a &quot;pre-conditioning&quot; cytoreductive regimen of bendamustine 70 mg/m2/day
      administered IV followed by an IV dose of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered over 3
      consecutive days. These agents will be administered per institutional guidelines. Prophylaxis
      (e.g., hydration, antiemetics, etc.) needed prior to fludarabine and bendamustine
      chemotherapy will be provided per institutional guidelines. At the discretion of the clinical
      investigator, subjects with a known history of intolerance to bendamustine may be considered
      for lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day administered by IV followed by an IV
      dose of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered over 3 consecutive days. These agents will be
      administered per institutional guidelines.

      Administration of iC9-CAR19 T cells

      Post lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will
      receive iC9-CAR19 T cells within 2 - 14 days after completing the lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy regimen. We will administer iC9-CAR19 post lymphodepletion at dose levels
      specified in the table in section 4.1. A recently published trial in refractory DLBCL
      established that a dose of 2 x 106 CAR19+ T cells/kg was safe and associated with significant
      in vivo expansion and we anticipate similar results with iC9-CAR19+ T cells.

      Duration of Therapy

      Therapy in this study involves 1 infusion of iC9-CAR19 cells.

      Duration of Follow-up

      Subjects who receive a cell infusion will be followed for up to 15 years for
      replication-competent retrovirus evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects
      who are removed from study and do not receive the cellular therapy product due to
      unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse
      event.

The PRO-CTCAE is a patient-reported outcome measurement system developed to characterize the frequency, severity and interference of symptomatic treatment toxicities. Each of the symptom terms included in the PRO-CTCAE is assessed relative to one or more distinct attributes, including presence/absence, frequency, severity, and/or interference with usual or daily activities. Responses are provided on a 5-point Likert scale: Frequency item: How OFTEN did you have? (Never / Rarely / Occasionally / Frequently / Almost constantly); Severity item: What was the SEVERITY of your at its WORST? (None / Mild / Moderate / Severe / Very severe);Interference item: How much did INTERFERE with your usual or daily activities?

    <measure>Change in physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Short Form 20a v1.0. assesses one's ability to carry out activities that require physical actions, ranging from self-care (activities of daily living) to more complex activities that require a combination of skills, often within a social context. &quot;Physical Function&quot; is inclusive of the term &quot;disability&quot; and includes the full spectrum of physical functioning from severe impairment to exceptional physical abilities. Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five, resulting in a total score (T-score) from 0 to 100. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For positively-worded concepts like Physical Function, a T-score of 60 is one SD better than average. By comparison, a Physical Function T-score of 40 is one SD worse than average.</description>

    <measure>Change in health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health measures assess an individual's physical, mental, and social health. The measures are generic, rather than disease-specific, and often use an &quot;In General&quot; item context as it is intended to globally reflect individuals' assessment of their health. Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five, which are summed into T-score values for physical and mental health. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. Thus, a person who has T- scores of 60 for the Global Physical Health or Global Mental Health scales is one standard deviation better (more healthy) than the general population.</description>

          -  Active infection with HIV, HTLV, HBV, HCV (can be pending at the time of cell
             procurement; only those samples confirming lack of active infection will be used to
             generate transduced cells) defined as not being well controlled on therapy. Subjects
             are required to have negative HIV antibody, negative HTLV1 and HTLV2 antibodies,
             negative Hepatitis B surface antigen, and negative HCV antibody or viral load. In
             addition, subjects with positive Hepatitis B core antibody, will have Hepatitis B
             viral load tested and subjects with positive Hepatitis B viral load will also be
             excluded.

          -  Subject must either have core antibody negative HBV (results can be pending at the
             time of cell procurement) OR if a subject is hepatitis B core antibody positive they
             must have their hepatitis B viral load checked. These subjects will be excluded if
             their viral load is positive at baseline. Subjects who are core antibody positive and
             viral load negative at baseline will be considered eligible.

                  active disease.

               -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to procurement or
                  documentation that the subject is post-menopausal. Post-menopausal status must be

             prior to lymphodepletion.

          -  Imaging results from within 7 days prior to lymphodepletion. Imaging must occur at
             least 3 weeks after most recent therapy (used as baseline measure for documentation of
             progression before the lymphodepletion) to document measurable or assessable disease.
             Imaging does not need to be repeated if it is within 7 days prior to lymphodepletion.

          -  Evidence of adequate organ function as defined by:

        The following are required within 72 hours prior to lymphodepletion:

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L and platelets ≥75 x 109/L). Subjects

               -  Subject is not taking a prohibited or contraindicated medication prior to
                  lymphodepletion. Contraindicated medications should be discontinued at least two
                  weeks prior to the scheduled lymphodepletion or by at least 5 half-lives of the
                  contraindicated medication, whichever is shorter.

               -  Subject is not taking strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine,
                  ciprofloxacin) as these may increase plasma concentrations of bendamustine, and
                  decrease plasma concentrations of its metabolites. See
                  http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ for an updated list of strong
                  inhibitors of CYP1A2. (This applies to subjects who receive bendamustine for
                  lymphodepletion (required) up through 72 hours after the last dose of
                  bendamustine).

               -  Subject has not received chemotherapy within the previous 3 weeks prior to
                  lymphodepletion.

        Eligibility criteria to be met prior to cell infusion after lymphodepletion:

          -  No evidence of uncontrolled infection or sepsis.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy within 7 days of cell infusion (does not need to be repeated
             if pre-lymphodepletion pregnancy test is within window).
