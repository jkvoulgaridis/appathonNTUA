      Shoulder: The superior labrum (fibrous cartilage) and biceps anchor improve joint stability
      by acting like a secondary stabilizer to the shoulder. Labral injuries are usually associated
      with anterior shoulder dislocation. When conservative treatment fails, such as physical
      therapy, strengthening programs, anti-inflammatories and activity modification to improve
      symptoms, surgical intervention may be required. Surgical treatments can include simple
      debridement (the medical removal of dead damaged or infected tissue), stabilization of the
      biceps-labrum complex through repair, or biceps tenodesis where the end of a tendon is joined
      surgically to the bone. Outcomes of SLAP (superior labral tear from anterior to posterior)
      repairs have been reported good throughout the literature, with reported success rates
      ranging from 71-97%.

      Hip: The labrum of the hip is a fibrocartilaginous tissue that connects to the bone edge of
      the acetabulum (the socket of the hip bone), and deepens the acetabular socket while
      extending coverage of the femoral head; it also aids in hip stabilization. The goal of
      surgical intervention is to restore normal hip mechanics and treat existing damage. In an
      epidemiology study published in 2017, labral pathology was the most common diagnosis at 82%
      of the population. Of the 1,124 tears reported, 75.3% were repaired, 13.7% were reconstructed
      and 7.2% were debrided.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has consented to participate in the study by signing the EC-approved informed
             consent form

          -  Subject condition meets proposed indication to SUTUREFIX ULTRA and SUTUREFIX CURVED
             Suture Anchor

          -  Subject requiring shoulder or hip arthroscopic labral repair surgery from physical
             findings, subject symptoms and radiographic finding Hip subjects

          -  FAI (Femoroacetabular Impingement) Shoulder subjects

          -  Subject with a history of recurrent dislocation/subluxation of the shoulder

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in the treatment period of another clinical trial within thirty (30)
             days of Visit 1 (pre-operative)

             would compromise secure anchor fixation

          -  Pathological conditions in the soft tissues to be attached that would impair secure
             fixation by suture

          -  Comminuted bone surface, which would compromise secure anchor fixation Hip subjects
             Dysplasia latera/central less than 20° Shoulder subjects
