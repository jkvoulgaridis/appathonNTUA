  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the blocking of [18F]JNJ-64511070 binding in the
      brain at the time after administration of a drug when the maximum plasma concentration is
      reached; when the rate of absorption equals the rate of elimination (tmax) of JNJ-64140284
      and determine the exposure/receptor interaction of JNJ-64140284 in healthy male participants
      following single oral dose administration of JNJ-64140284.

    <description>Participants in cohort 1 will receive single oral dose of JNJ‑64140284 at a starting dose of 0.5 milligram (mg) under fasted conditions. The dose levels of JNJ‑64140284 will be escalated sequentially based on the decisions of an independent Data Review Committee (iDRC), the clinical team and the investigator. First 3 participants will also receive an intravenous (IV) bolus injection of [18F]JNJ-64511070 at a dose of 185 megaBecquerel (MBq). Participants with no measurable brain receptor occupancy will receive second (escalated) dosing with JNJ-64140284 and subsequent positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan.</description>
