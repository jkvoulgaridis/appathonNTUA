    <textblock>
      This trial studies biomarkers obtained by bronchoscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage and lung
      brushings) to determine the effect of smoking e-cigarettes on the lungs. Studying samples of
      lung cells from participants who smoke e-cigarettes may help doctors learn more about changes
      that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess inflammatory changes over 6 weeks for lung and urine biomarkers in smokers in a
      clinical trial where smokers are randomized to continued use (n=32), complete switching to
      the nicotine standardized research electronic cigarettes (e-cig) (SREC) (n=32), complete
      switching to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (n=32), dual use (cigarettes [cigs] +
      nicotine SREC) (n=32), or nicotine-free SREC (n=32).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 5 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants undergo bronchoscopy over 30-60 minutes at baseline. Participants
      continue to smoke their usual brand of cigarettes. Participants undergo a second bronchoscopy
      on day 71.

      GROUP II: Participants undergo bronchoscopy over 30-60 minutes at baseline. Beginning 1 week
      after bronchoscopy, participants learn to use the SREC with nicotine for 2 weeks and switch
      completely to the SREC with nicotine starting day 15 for 8 weeks. Participants undergo a
      second bronchoscopy on day 71.

      GROUP III: Participants undergo bronchoscopy over 30-60 minutes at baseline. Beginning 1 week
      after bronchoscopy, participants learn to use the SREC without nicotine for 2 weeks and
      switch completely to the SREC without nicotine starting day 15 for 8 weeks. Participants will
      be offered varenicline to aid cessation. Participants undergo a second bronchoscopy on day
      71.

      GROUP IV: Participants undergo bronchoscopy over 30-60 minutes at baseline. Beginning 1 week
      after bronchoscopy, participants learn to use the nicotine-containing SREC for 2 weeks and
      use both their usual brand of cigarettes and the nicotine-containing SREC starting day 15 for
      8 weeks with the intention of smoking reduction to 5 cigarettes or less per day. Participants
      undergo a second bronchoscopy on day 71.

      GROUP V: Participants undergo bronchoscopy over 30-60 minutes at baseline. Beginning 2 days
      before the day 15 quit date, participants stop smoking using NRT comprising either patch,
      gum, or lozenge for 8 weeks. Participants undergo a second bronchoscopy on day 71.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 months.

    <description>Obtained via bronchoscopy with saline bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial brushings. Descriptive statistics and clustering (e.g., principal components analysis [PCA]), will be performed for all biomarker data measured at the different visits. Baseline data (1st bronchoscopy) will then be compared between the five groups (4 conditions and control) using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous or ordinal variables) or the chi-square test (categorical variables) will be applied when the normality assumption of the data is not met. Controls will be compared to complete substitution with the standardized research electronic cigarettes (SREC) (with and without nicotine) or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), or dual use conditions. Generalized linear models (GLM) will be employed with measurement (cell count, gene expression, etc.) as the dependent variable, a covariable for baseline measure, and a main effect of arm.</description>

    <measure>Changes in messenger (m) ribonucleic acid (RNA) and microRNA (miRNA) gene expression analyzed using sequencing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Total RNA containing small RNAs will be extracted from bronchial brushing specimens using commercially available kits and used for both gene expression using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array and for miRNA expression using the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA Array. Expression will separately be assessed through RNA sequencing. Total RNA will be extracted from lavage cells and saliva for comprehensive profiling of microbiome using commercially available kits. The ?omics? (miRNA, mRNA, and metabolomics) analysis and visualization of the data will be performed in the R statistical language. Data will be log2-transformed and normalized using either quantile normalization for gene expression (miRNA and mRNA) or normalization for metabolomics. Unsupervised clustering analysis, including PCA and hierarchical clustering will be performed to visualize natural clusters in the dataset and evaluate data quality.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Total DNA will be extracted using commercially available kits and used for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. Total DNA including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) will be extracted using commercially available kits and used for mtDNA mutation using Hiseq Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and for mtDNA contents using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). For preliminary identification of patterns in DNA methylation, unsupervised hierarchical clustering among the groups of samples will be performed. The Euclidian distance among the groups of samples will be calculated by the average linkage. In order to assess variance among samples, PCA will be done.</description>
