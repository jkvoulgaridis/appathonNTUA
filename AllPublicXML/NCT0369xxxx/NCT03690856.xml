  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a frequent disease which can be marked by therapeutic resistance. It is
      described as one of the most disabling disease with high cost for society. World Health
      Organization pointed out that 350 million people are suffering from depression in the world.
      This pathology is considered underdiagnosed, with inadequate care resources and
      stigmatization.

      There is a wide range of evidence in current literature that anxiety is one of the most
      important factors involved in biological mechanism of treatment resistance in depression. To
      date, there is a lack of knowledge on this topic. A better understanding of the role of
      anxiety in the maintenance of depressive state will allow to i) identify quickly and more
      accurately patients at risk of pejorative evolution and ii) develop specific therapeutics
      targeting this dimension which remain badly controlled with actual therapeutics.

    <description>Montgomery Äsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS): is a scale of depression (diagnosis + follow-up evolution, therapeutic response criteria). It consists of 10 items rated from 0 to 6 from a semi-structured interview, to obtain a total depression score of 0 to 60 (0 no depression, 60 maximum depression intensity). Items evaluate: apparent sadness, expressed sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, difficulty concentrating, weariness, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, thoughts of suicide ;</description>

    <description>STAI (State Trait Anxiety Inventory) form A and B: is an anxiety scale. The first part concerns state anxiety and consists of a self-questionnaire of 20 items, the subject having to score on a 4-point Likert scale (not at all, little, moderately, much) his current anxiety level. The second part concerns trait anxiety and consists of a self-questionnaire of 20 items, the subject having to score on a 4-point Likert scale (almost never, sometimes, often, almost always) his level of background anxiety. Two scores varying between 10 (minimum anxiety) and 40 (maximum anxiety) are therefore obtained;</description>

    <description>Maudsley Staging Method (MSM): The Maudsley method allows an evaluation of the degree of pharmacological resistance integrating the main parameters related to the notion of resistance (duration, initial severity of depression, number and types of treatments tested). A treatment must be prescribed at least 6 weeks to be considered as adequate and according to the observed situations an overall score is determined. A score between 3 and 6 characterizes a mild resistance, between 7 and 10, moderate and finally 11 to 15, severe.</description>

    <measure>Beck</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12, 24, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short Beck Questionnaire: is a self-assessment scale. The subject is asked to complete the questionnaire by circling the number corresponding to the chosen proposal. It can surround, in a series, several numbers if several propositions are suitable. Each item consists of 4 sentences corresponding to 4 degrees of increasing intensity of a symptom: from 0 to 3. In the stripping, it is necessary to take into account the strongest coast chosen for the same series. The overall score is obtained by adding the scores of the 13 items. The range of the scale is from 0 to 39. The higher the score, the more the subject is depressed.</description>

Each item is rated from 0 to 4 from the absence to the maximum incapacitating intensity. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60.

The contributor is asked to choose the intensity that best suits the patient's clinical condition.</description>

    <measure>CGI</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12, 24, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>CGI (Clinical Global Impression): are three scales that evaluate punctually the severity of the disease, the evaluation of overall improvement and the measurement of the therapeutic index. These three scales were developed as part of the research on schizophrenia and the effect of drugs. These global clinical impressions, however, are not reserved for a specific type of pathology. The first CGI is scored from 0 to 7, 0 corresponding to not evaluated, 1 corresponding to normal, 7 corresponding to among the sickest patients. The second CGI is rated from 0 to 7, 0 corresponding to not evaluated, 1 corresponding to very strongly improved, 7 corresponding to very strongly aggravated. The third CGI for the therapeutic index evaluates the therapeutic effect and the side effects. The CGI are fast (5 minutes).
The longitudinal clinical evolution will be evaluated by:

    <description>Verbal fluences: This test tests the action planning abilities, the implementation of semantic memory search strategies and the oral language. The subject has two minutes to give as many words as possible starting with the letter P or in the category of animals. We record the total number of words generated in two minutes in thirty-second increments for each of these conditions.</description>

    <description>STROOP test: evaluation of executive functions. This test evaluates the resistance to interference, ie the ability of the patient to inhibit some over-learned and automated responses. It consists of three parts: color denomination where the subject must name the color (red, green or blue) of rectangles presented on a board, reading words where the subject must read names of color (red, green or blue) that appear in black characters on a second board and interference where the subject must name the color printed without reading the color name written on a third board. Each board has 100 items. The participant must read column by column. We report for each board the number of correctly named items in 45 seconds. We also calculate an interference index.</description>

    <measure>Trail Making Test(TMT) Part A and B</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12, 24, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Trail Making Test (TMT) part A and B: evaluation of executive functions. This test assesses mental flexibility and visual exploration capabilities. It is divided into two parts. In Part A, the patient must link the figures in ascending order as quickly as possible. In Part B, the patient must link the numbers and letters in ascending order by following an alternating rule. The time (in seconds) put by the participant to take part A and B and the number of errors will be recorded. For Part B, the examiner also records the number of perseveration errors, that is, when the participant did not follow the alternation rule. Finally, the examiner makes a calculation (time taken for Part A subtracted from the time taken for Part B) to tell whether the participant has a mental flexibility disorder.
The oral version of this test (Oral Trail Making Test, TMT) will be used for patients over 65 years old with cognitive impairment prior to the depressive episode.</description>

    <time_frame>at 6, 12, 24, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Card Sorting test (MCST): assessment of the capacities of conceptualization, attention and mental flexibility. It consists in proposing to the participant a classification of cards according to rules which he must find himself. There are three ranking possibilities that the participant must repeat twice after holding each ranking for six cards. The examiner records the number of correctly found and maintained categories, the total number of errors and the number of perseverative errors.</description>

It is suggested to the patient to hold his attention for 20 minutes. Letters appear on a screen at different speeds and rhythms. The patient must click on the space bar as quickly as possible at each appearance of letters except when the letter X is displayed. The scores evaluate the reaction time as well as the number of errors.</description>
