  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adverse effects of current ambient air pollution on cardiovascular and respiratory health
      have been demonstrated in an extensive series of epidemiological, observational and
      experimental studies. Similar cardiovascular responses seen post diesel exposure have been
      shown to occur following biodiesel exhaust exposure as well. In the current project the
      investigators aim to determine whether an acute exposure to biodiesel exhaust (rapeseed
      methyl ester) causes impacts on sympathetic nervous system activation in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brief as well as chronic exposures to ambient air pollution have been linked with increases
      in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that the strongest associations
      between air pollution exposure and adverse cardiovascular effects are found for
      combustion-derived particulate matter, especially in the fine and ultrafine ranges such as is
      found in diesel engine emissions as well as biodiesel exhaust (RME, rapeseed methyl ester).
      Despite a greater understanding of the cardiovascular effects of air pollution, the
      underlying mechanism through which exposure to fine and ultrafine particulate air pollution
      alters vascular function has yet to be determined. Microneurography is a method that records
      nerve impulse traffic in human peripheral nerves, allowing for the assessment of sympathetic
      nervous activity. The current study will employed microneurography techniques to evaluate
      autonomic function in association with inhaled biodiesel exhaust exposure in healthy human
      volunteers.
