  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FFR has been introduced for determination of physiological ischemia in myocardium for many
      years. Nowadays, FFR-guided PCI is highly recommended for assessment of physiologic ischemia
      in intermediate coronary lesions. FFR-guided PCI has been performed in National Taiwan
      University Hospital(NTUH) for many years. Nevertheless, the method of FFR measurement in NTUH
      is different from that in literature. In this study, the investigator would like to evaluate
      the effectiveness and safety of NTUH experience in FFR prospectively. First, the investigator
      will record any intracoronary (IC) adenosine-related complications, such as bradyarrhythmia
      or chest discomfort. Second, the investigator will follow up on the clinical outcome of the
      participants for 2 years, record if any target lesion failure, target vessel failure, target
      vessel-related myocardial infarction, and cardiac death. Finally, left ventricular diastolic
      pressure, serum pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) and high sensitivity C- reactive
      protein (hsCRP) will be checked and determined their relationships with the maximum dosage of
      IC adenosine.
