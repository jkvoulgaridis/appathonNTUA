  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized pilot study is to evaluate whether subchondroplasty
      combined with knee arthroscopy is more effective at reducing knee pain and improving knee
      function compared to knee arthroscopy alone. All knee function outcomes will be assessed at
      initial presentation, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months following surgery using
      validated questionnaires. Patient-reported pain will also be recorded at 2 weeks after
      surgery.

      The secondary objective of the study is to determine whether the subchondroplasty and knee
      arthroscopy group has better bone quality and bone micro-architecture compared to the group
      receiving knee arthroscopy alone. Bone quality/micro-architecture will be evaluated at
      baseline, 3 months, and 12 months following surgery using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      and High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) imaging and at baseline, 3 months,
      12 months, and 24 months after surgery using X-rays.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving subchondroplasty combined with
      arthroscopy will have reduced knee pain, improved knee function, and improved bone quality
      and micro-architecture compared to patients receiving arthroscopy alone who have symptomatic
      early osteoarthritis with the presence of at least one BML observed on MRI.

      Patients who provide informed consent to enroll in the study will be scheduled for knee
      surgery and randomized to receive subchondroplasty and arthroscopy or arthroscopy alone. Knee
      function outcomes will be assessed at initial presentation, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months,
      and 24 months following surgical intervention. Patient-reported pain will also be recorded at
      2 weeks following surgical intervention. The evaluation of bone quality and
      micro-architecture will occur at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months following surgical
      intervention. X-rays will also be evaluated at the 24-month time-point.

    <measure>Change in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery), 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months post-surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire scores for knee pain and knee function.
The KOOS questionnaire consists of 5 different sub-scales including Symptoms (7 questions), Pain (9 questions), Activities of Daily Living (17 questions), Sports/Recreation (5 questions), and Quality of Life (4 questions). A normalized score from 0-100 (100 indicates no problems/symptoms and 0 indicates extreme problems/symptoms) is calculated for each sub-scale individually.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery), 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months post-surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Knee pain and function will also be evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form scores.
The IKDC includes three different domains including Symptoms (7 questions), Sports Activities (2 questions, 1 multi-part question), and Function (1 multi-part question). A total score from 0-100 (100 indicates no problems/symptoms and 0 indicates extreme problems/symptoms) is calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Pain scores on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery), 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months post-surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Knee pain will also be evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for patient-reported pain.
The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) consists of a 10 cm long straight line that starts from the lowest value of 0 (no pain) at one end, and the highest value of 10 (worst pain possible) at the other. Patients are asked to mark a place on the line that represents the severity of their pain. Scores are recorded in millimetres from 0-100 with 0 indicating no pain and 100 indicating the worst pain possible.</description>

    <description>The bone quality and micro-architecture of the bone marrow lesion(s) in the knee, and the knee overall, will be evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI will be used to identify the presence of bone marrow lesion(s) in the knee at baseline before surgery using a T2 weighted fat-suppression sequence and evaluate the bone marrow lesion(s) post-surgery.</description>

    <description>The bone quality and micro-architecture of the bone marrow lesion(s) in the knee, and the knee overall, will also be evaluated using High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) imaging. HR-pQCT imaging will be used to evaluate the bone micro-architecture of the knee and the bone marrow lesion(s) before and after surgery.</description>

    <description>Subchondroplasty® (SCP®) is a procedure performed along with minimally-invasive arthroscopy. The bone marrow lesion(s) will be located using pre-operative MRI combined with fluoroscopy (intra-operative X-ray) and a small, drillable AccuPort® Delivery Cannula will be placed in the appropriate position. The cannula will then be drilled into the bone marrow lesion(s) and a flowable, synthetic, calcium phosphate bone substitute (AccuFill® Bone Substitute Material, Zimmer Biomet) will be injected into the lesion(s). The calcium phosphate bone substitute will then harden, improve the structural integrity of the damaged subchondral bone, and will gradually be resorbed and replaced with new bone.</description>

    <description>Knee arthroscopy is a surgical procedure that involves the orthopaedic surgeon making small incisions in the knee and then inserting a small camera into the joint. Following the insertion of the camera, multiple procedures can be completed to treat a number of different conditions such as repair or partial/complete removal of the meniscus, debridement, lavage, removal of a loose body among others.</description>
