  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injuries to the midfoot tarsometatarsal joint, or Lisfranc joint, are notoriously
      debilitating. Poor functional outcomes following Lisfranc injuries have motivated surgeons to
      look for potential improvements in post-operative care. There are currently no evidence-based
      guidelines to direct implant removal for patients with operatively treated Lisfranc injuries.
      Routine implant removal has significant implications related to health care costs, lost time
      from work, potential surgical complications, and possibly functional impairment. Therefore,
      stakeholders including patients, surgeons, employers, and administrators will benefit from
      evidence-based guidelines for implant removal following operatively treated Lisfranc
      injuries. To date, there has not been a prospective randomized study evaluating the efficacy
      of implant removal compared with implant retention for Lisfranc injuries. The aim of this
      study is to directly compare patient-reported and radiographic outcomes, in order to provide
      robust evidence for optimal post-operative treatment regimens regarding implant removal or
      retention for operatively treated Lisfranc injuries.

  <detailed_description>

      This study is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing implant retention (Retention
      Group) to scheduled implant removal (Removal Group) in 100 skeletally mature patients with
      Lisfranc injuries previously treated with screw and/or plate fixation. The primary outcome
      measure is the validated, patient-reported Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) at 1-year
      post initial Lisfranc injury. Secondary outcome measures include: 1. American Orthopedics
      Foot and Ankle Midfoot Score (AOFAS), 2. patient-reported Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for
      Foot and Ankle, 3. range of motion, 4. radiographic assessment of Lisfranc reduction, 5.
      comparative cost analysis between treatment groups. This study will follow patients for
      1-year post-injury.

      Patients, surgeons, employers, and administrators will benefit from an evidence-based
      approach to implant removal following operatively treated Lisfranc injuries. This study will
      allow orthopaedic surgeons to counsel patients regarding the advantages and disadvantages of
      implant retention compared with removal. This study will provide robust data to inform
      clinical decision making for surgeons and provide patients with information regarding
      expected functional outcomes following Lisfranc injuries.

    <measure>Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>FAAM is a patient-reported outcome tool used to assess physical function at 24 months post initial Lisfranc surgery. This instrument includes 2 sub-scales: activities of daily living sub scale of 21 items and sport sub scale of 8 items. Answers for both scales are based on a Likert scale (4-0) of: 4) No difficulty, 3) Slight difficulty, 2) Moderate difficulty, 1) Extreme difficulty, and 0) Unable to do. Questions for which &quot;N/A&quot; is indicated are not counted. Two scores are reported, one for each sub scale. To calculate the score for either sub scale, the total number of points are added, divided by the number of possible points (84 for ADL and 32 for sports), and multiplied by 100. Higher scores reflect a higher level of physical function.</description>

    <measure>American Orthopedics Foot and Ankle Midfoot Score (AOFAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>AOFAS is a surgeon-administered questionnaire, used for assessment of pain, function and alignment. The total score is reported. Scores range from 0 to 100, with a healthy midfoot receiving 100 points</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Foot and Ankle</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>VAS for Foot and Ankle is a validated tool for assessing pain intensity specific to foot injuries. The patient is asked to mark their current situation on a 10 cm line with anchor statements on the left (negative outcome) and on the right (positive outcome). Longer distances (from the &quot;negative outcome&quot; anchor point) represent a better outcome.</description>
