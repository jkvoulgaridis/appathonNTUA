  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the main objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three groups of epidurals
      with three different programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB)settings.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a PIEB, the concentration of local anesthetics administered is standardized in the
      services according to the recommendations. What is left to the judgement of the clinician,
      taking care of the patient during the work, is the administered dose. This often varies
      according to clinician deductions that take notice of height, weight, previous pregnancies In
      the CHU of Rennes, three dosages are used in common practice. The objective by comparing
      these three dosages is to show if there is a significant difference between the groups.
