  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, inpatient study to examine
      the efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of KarXT in adult subjects diagnosed with
      DSM-5 schizophrenia who are in an acute exacerbation phase. The primary objective of the
      study is to assess the efficacy of KarXT (a fixed combination of xanomeline and trospium
      chloride) (xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg twice daily [BID]) versus placebo in reducing
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores in adult inpatients with a
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of schizophrenia. The
      secondary objectives of the study are to assess overall safety and tolerability of KarXT in
      adult inpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia.

    <description>The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales.

The dose is increased to xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg BID on days 8-34 unless the subject is experiencing adverse events from the xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg dose. Subjects who were increased to xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg will have the option to return to xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg depending on clinical response and tolerability. Dosing must not change after Visit 7 of the study (at 21 ± 2 days of dosing) and may be decreased for tolerability reasons no more than once during the study.</description>
