  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disease under study is acute coronary syndrome with ST segment elevation, defined as
      patients presenting chest pain of anginal characteristics of more than 20 minutes of
      duration, with changes in the electrocardiogram consisting of ST segment elevation of 1 mm in
      two contiguous limb leads or 2 mm in two contiguous leads precordial. In a review carried out
      on patients treated in the investigator center with SCACEST, invetsigators found that, in a
      cohort of 250 patients, 85% of them presented alterations Segments of left ventricular
      contractility at 4 months after the acute episode. To verify that the Levosimendan
      administration reduces that percentage, at least 65%, investigators require to include in the
      study 83 patients in the experimental group and 83 in the control group, for a power of 80%
      and a confidence level of 95%. Assuming 10% of lost patients, it is required to include in
      the study 92 patients in the experimental group and 92 patients in the group control .

      The patients will be included randomly, until the calculated sample size is completed. A
      recruitment period of 12 months is estimated from the beginning of the study. From the date
      of inclusion of the first patient, the final duration of the study will be 1.5 years.

      The study will end when performing the last cardio-resonance and echocardiography that should
      be performed 6 months after the inclusion of the last patient in the study.

      Upon arrival of the patient at the Coronary Unit, he will receive, in a randomized and
      double-blind manner, without a loading dose, the 24-hour infusion of Levosimendan, or
      placebo.

      The continuous infusion of levosimendan 0.1 micrograms / kg / min will be administered during
      24h. If the initial dose is tolerated and a greater hemodynamic effect is needed, the
      infusion rate can be increased to 0.2 micrograms / kg / min. The dose of Levosimendan
      infusion can be reduced to 0.05 μg / kg / min in case of clinical intolerance or systolic
      hypotension &lt;90 mmHg.

      Continuous perfusion of the placebo 0.1 micrograms / kg / min will be administered for 24h.
      If the initial dose is tolerated and a greater hemodynamic effect is needed, the infusion
      rate can be increased to 0.2 micrograms / kg / min. The dose of infusion of the placebo can
      be reduced to 0.05 μg / kg / min in case of clinical intolerance or systolic hypotension &lt;90
      mmHg.
