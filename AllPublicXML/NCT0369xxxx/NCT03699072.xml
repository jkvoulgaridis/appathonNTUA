  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a First in Human clinical study on the safety and effectiveness of DermaRep™ wound
      contact dressing. Patients with venous leg ulcers will be treated with standard of care
      dressings and compression for 4 weeks to establish a baseline wound healing response. All
      patients will then be treated with DermaRep™ wound contact dressing in addition to standard
      of care for a further 8 weeks. If the wound has not healed, patients will continue treatment
      with standard of care only for a further 4 weeks. All patients will be assessed at the 16
      week timepoint, the primary endpoint.
