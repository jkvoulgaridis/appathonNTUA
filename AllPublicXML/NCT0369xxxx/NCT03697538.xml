  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, blinded study with a parallel design and an allocation
      ratio of 1:1 for the treatment groups. The investigators seek to determine if femoral nerve
      block (FNB) improves the quality of recovery and improve postoperative analgesia compared
      with adductor canal block (ACBs) for patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty.

      This is a prospective, randomized, blinded study with a parallel design and an allocation
      ratio of 1:1 for the treatment groups. A prospective study design will allow both FNBs and
      ACBs to be accurately assessed in an effective manner without introducing unnecessary
      confounding factors. Furthermore, randomization and a parallel design with equal allocation
      ratio will ensure timely enrollment of patients while also minimizing temporal confounders
      that may occur with institutional changes to clinical care protocols. Patients, nurses on the
      floor and physical therapists will be blinded to the nature of the patient assignment (FNB or
      ACB)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of recovery-15 item questionnaire (QoR): QoR-15</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary objective will be to determine if FNBs will result in improved quality of recovery (QoR-15) compared with ACBs (at 48 hours).
The questionnaire is 15 questions with a scale from 0-10 on each and composed of two parts; part A and Part B scoring for questions in part A ( questions from 1-10) are scored from 0-10 where 0=none of the time( poor), and 10= all of the time (excellent). Part Bare questions from 11-15 where they are scored from (10-0) where 10=none of the time ( excellent) and 0=all of the time ( poor). The sum of all answers are added together</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid requirements during hospitalization will be measured. Total opioid consumption during this time period after surgery will be standardized to morphine equivalent doses and calculated on a milligram basis for this time period or until discharge, whichever occurs first</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain score measurement: we will use Numeric rating scale for measurement (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) where 0= no pain and 10= the worst pain ever. the scores will be assessed every 8 hours from nursing documentation through 48 hours or until discharge, whichever occurs first</description>

    <description>A 20g catheter will be introduced and advanced 2-3 cm beyond the tip of the needle under ultrasound visualization. After needle withdrawal, catheter placement will be checked by visualizing local anesthetic spread under ultrasound. 0.5% ropivacaine will be used for catheter placement. At the conclusion of surgery, the catheters will be connected to a pump that will infuse ropivacaine 0.2% at 6 mL/hr with a patient controlled bolus of 5mL and a lockout of 30 minutes.</description>
