  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When people learn and remember information, it is often accompanied by a feeling of
      subjective confidence about whether or not information has been learned and accurately
      remembered. These subjective feelings of confidence are often related to actual memory
      performance, but are sometimes incorrect. The investigators have previously shown that
      applying high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex leads to more accurate feelings of subjective confidence, at
      least when subjects are asked for their confidence about future memory performance. Accurate
      confidence judgments are useful in that they may later subsequent behavior, and inaccurate
      ones may be costly. For example, a student who erroneously believes that studied material was
      learned may stop studying and not do well on a test. Individuals who have a
      feeling-of-knowing about the answer to a general knowledge question will continue to search
      their memory, whereas individuals who do not have a feeling-of-knowing will stop searching
      their memory. Individuals who are confident they know the answer to a question are more
      likely to answer it. In this study, the experimenters are testing the effects of brain
      stimulation on subjective awareness of memory (termed metamemory monitoring) and how people
      use those subjective judgments (termed metamemory control). The approach taken is to have
      participants visit the laboratory on 3 visits and receive brain stimulation while completing
      memory and metamemory tasks.

    <description>This indexes the memory advantage for choosing which general knowledge question one receives a hint about the answer to versus having the experimenter choose which general knowledge question one receives a hint about the answer. The investigators will subtract the proportion of correctly recognized general knowledge answers for experimenter-chosen questions from the proportion correctly recognized for participant-chosen questions</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Feeling of knowing ratings are given on a scale. To assess the accuracy of these ratings, the subjective ratings are compared to objective accuracy, using signal detection based measures. Differences in feeling-of-knowing ratings and their accuracy are compared between each condition (each active HD-tDCS and sham).</description>
