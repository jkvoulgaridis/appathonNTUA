  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study on a cannabis-based medicine
      extract (MediCabilis CBD Oil), in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or Motor
      Neurone Disease. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive MediCabilis CBD
      Oil or placebo oil. The treatment duration is 6 months with one-month safety follow up.
      Participants will be checked every month either face to face or via telephone and will be
      assessed to collect data for study objectives such as ALSFRS-R, Forced Vital Capacity, pain
      and spasticity score, and quality of life. Thirty (30) participants will be randomised.
