    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205
      (BMS-986205) when given together with nivolumab and how well it works as first or second line
      therapy in treating patients with liver cancer. BMS-986205 may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      BMS-986205 and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with liver cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain the safety and tolerability of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab in
      unresectable / metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the first or second line setting
      using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (V)5.0 criteria.

      II. To determine efficacy as defined by objective response rate (ORR) of BMS-986205 in
      combination with nivolumab in unresectable / metastatic HCC in the first or second line
      setting using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression free
      survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) by RECIST 1.1 and ORR using immune RECIST (iRECIST)
      of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab in unresectable HCC. (Phase II) II. To further
      evaluate safety of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab in unresectable HCC. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days, and then every 3
      months thereafter.
