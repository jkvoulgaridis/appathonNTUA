  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most adults do not achieve the US aerobic physical activity (PA) guidelines (â‰¥150
      minutes/week of at least moderate intensity PA). Inadequate PA is considered a major risk
      factor for cardio-metabolic diseases and other poor health outcomes. Recommendations now
      endorse PA in reducing risk for certain diseases. Unfortunately, low PA levels are seldom
      identified and treated within clinical practice. This study will build on previous prevention
      efforts by focusing on the identifying and treating low PA levels in adults clinical care
      patients and referring them to an intervention that is feasible for delivery through clinical
      care.

    <textblock>
      This study involves designing/ implementing a patient-centered, individually-focused physical
      activity (PA) intervention designed for integration into clinical care. We will recruit adult
      patients (aged 21-70; n=80) from the general internal medicine practice of a local health
      system who are not meeting the US aerobic activity goal of 150 minutes/ week of at least
      moderate intensity PA and who can safely increase PA without supervision. As low PA levels
      have been associated with numerous poor health outcomes, the primary intervention goal will
      be achievement of the US PA goal. A secondary goal will be to reduce sedentary behavior
      (SED), which is related to poor health outcomes (independent of PA achievement). Intervention
      materials will be developed using a patient/provider centered approach and delivered weekly
      over 3 months via an existing online platform with participants self-tracking behavior
      outcomes will be examined using a three month wait-listed control design in which all
      participants will eventually receive the intervention.

    <description>Participants will receive the ActiveGOALS 13 week, online self-directed intervention for increasing aerobic physical activity and decreasing time spent sitting. The intervention is based on social-cognitive theory models of behavior changes and utilizes barrier recognition, problem solving, and monitoring of behavior to initiate behavior change. They will also receive weekly feedback from a coach and be provided with online, paper, and wearable tracking devices. They will also be provided with links to tools that support physical activity.</description>
