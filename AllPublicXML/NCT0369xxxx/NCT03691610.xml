      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the vaccine
      seroresponse to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following administration of 2 doses
      of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to 2 doses of MENVEO® when given concomitantly with
      routine pediatric vaccines to infants and toddlers 6 to 7 months of age and 12 to 13 months
      of age.

      The secondary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the percentage of subjects
      with antibody titers to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W ≥ 1:8 following
      administration of 2 doses of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to 2 doses of MENVEO® when
      given concomitantly with pediatric routine vaccines to infants and toddlers at 6 to 7 months
      of age and 12 to 13 months of age.

      The study also includes as an observational objective to describe the safety profile of
      MenACYW conjugate vaccine and MENVEO® when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric
      vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers.
