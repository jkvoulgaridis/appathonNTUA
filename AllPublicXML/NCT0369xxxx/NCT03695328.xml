  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peak bone mass acquisition through childhood and adolescence has been associated with lower
      risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis in the elderly. The main factors that influence bone mass
      are the non-modifiable, such as genetics, ethnicity and sex, and the modifiable ones which
      are nutrition and physical activity or exercise. In the literature are references that
      demonstrates positive effects of high physical activity, adequate intakes of macro- and
      micronutrients on bone mass both in adults and in children. Bone mineralization is more
      adaptive in childrens' growing bones and this is an opportunity for stronger effects by
      mechanical stimuli during physical activity. The presence of a diet complete of nutrient
      intakes seems to strengthen the effects of mechanical loads on bone growth and
      mineralization. The present trial aimed to evaluate the effects of physical activity and
      nutrition intakes on bone mass in pre-pubertal children.

      The sample of this study was healthy pre-pubertal boys and girls (N=210) who had training age
      0-1 years. Data collection included anthropometric measurements, blood sampling, body
      composition, bone measurements and physical performance measurements. Nutritional intake was
      recorded for seven consecutive days in order to evaluate nutrient intakes using an
      appropriate software and habitual physical activity was measured for the same days using
      accelerometers. Pubertal stage determined by Tanner scale. All measurements were made only
      once at the beginning of school year.
