  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors help the immune system fight cancer. When the
      effectiveness of these drugs wears off, it may be possible to renew their effectiveness by
      combining it with a special type of radiation therapy called stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT). SBRT is a commonly used type of radiation therapy that gives high dose
      radiation with high precision to tumors in 1-5 treatments. Radiation therapy, such as SBRT
      can also treat sites of metastases. The use of checkpoint inhibitors in combination with SBRT
      has been suggested to improve the immune response against cancer but has not been tested in a
      formal clinical trial. Up to three lesions can be treated with SBRT. This study only allows
      checkpoint inhibitors that are already approved by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) for the
      treatment of your disease. All radiation therapy will be done on machines which are FDA
      approved.

             and head/neck cancers.

          -  Patient has been receiving treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor including but
             not limited to ipilimumab, nivolumab, avelumab, durvalumab, pembrolizumab,
             atezolizumab, and tremelimumab for at least 2 months. A combination of these therapies
             is also permitted. No max prior lines of therapy.

          -  Patient has evidence of limited progression (up to 5 lesions either new or increase in
             at least 25% in the cross-sectional diameter of a known lesion) on most recent
             systemic imaging as determined by the treating physician. Patients with greater than 5
             lesions can be included after discussion with the study investigators.

          -  Patient must be eligible to continue to receive an immune checkpoint inhibitor after
             radiotherapy.

          -  Subjects must have at least two lesions:

               -  One lesion must be safely amenable to irradiation in the opinion of the treating
                  radiation oncologist. This can be a lesion that was previously irradiated if it
                  is deemed appropriate by the treating physician and principal investigator.

               -  At least one, not-to-be-irradiated lesion measurable by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1
                  criteria.

          -  Prior palliative or curative radiotherapy must be completed at least 14 days prior to
             treatment.

          -  Immunosuppressive doses of systemic medication, such as steroids or absorbed topical
             steroids (doses &gt;10mg/day prednisone or equivalent) must be discontinued at least 14
             days prior to radiotherapy administration.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum within 7 days prior to
             treatment, or urine pregnancy test (within 24 hours) (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or
             equivalent units of HCG). Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow
             instructions for method(s) of contraception from time of enrollment for the duration
             of treatment.

             failure rate of less than 1% per year.

        Notes:

          -  Women who are not of childbearing potential i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically
             sterile as well as azoospermia men do not require contraception.

          -  Azoospermic males, and women of childbearing potential who are continuously not
             heterosexually active, are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, they still

                  defined below) or leptomeningeal disease are not allowed. Subjects with brain
                  metastases are eligible if these have been treated and there is no MRI (or CT if
                  MRI contraindicated) evidence of progression for at least 8 weeks after treatment
                  for these metastases is complete and within 28 days prior to first study
                  treatment.

               -  Any medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, might increase the
                  risk associated with study participation or interferes with the interpretation of
                  study results.
