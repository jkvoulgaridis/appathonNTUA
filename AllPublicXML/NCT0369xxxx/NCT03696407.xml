  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical experience with cabozantinib is limited in the UK and Ireland and there is anecdotal
      evidence of there being variability between clinicians in terms of where cabozantinib is used
      in the treatment pathway. The present study aims to collate and report the experiences of a
      sample of National Health Service (NHS) Trusts that enrolled patients onto the managed access
      programme. The study will describe the positioning of cabozantinib in the treatment pathway,
      associated clinical outcomes and characteristics of patients with advanced RCC receiving
      cabozantinib in this early clinical experience setting. The results will provide valuable
      information for collective learning on how to prescribe and manage cabozantinib and its
      optimal positioning in the patient pathway. Overall, the findings will contribute to a better
      understanding of how best to manage patients with advanced RCC in routine practice.
