  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common diseases in the world.
      Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) refers to an exaggeration of the symptoms of the disease.
      Currently, the 3 Anthonisen criteria appear to be most satisfactory in defining the AECOPD:
      The increase in the volume of sputum, the alteration of its appearance which becomes purulent
      and The increase in dyspnea. Our recent study, showed that administration of levofloxacin is
      superior to placebo in the treatment of AECOPD; it is accompanied by a substantial reduction
      in mortality and a significant reduction in the residence time in hospital.The choice of
      antibiotic to be used in this situation is challenging to the clinician who must choose
      between traditional antibiotics (cyclins, aminopenicillins, cotrimoxazole...) and new
      antimicrobial agents. Antibiotic treatment duration was not based on a strong scientific
      rationale. Yet at the time of the dramatic emergence of bacterial resistance, reducing the
      selection pressure by reducing the exposure to antibiotic should be a major issue. In
      addition, the decrease in costs and associated side effects reinforces the interest of short
      treatments.

      Unfortunately, few studies with a satisfactory methodology are available in the literature.
      In fact, we present the rational and the interest in shortening the durations of antibiotic
      treatment of AECOPD by levofloxacin in patients admitted to the emergency for exacerbation of
      COPD and to study the epidemiology of viral and bacterial AECOPD.

      This study is a randomized prospective double-blind, accomplished with sealed envelopes ,with
      two groups :

        -  Group A: Short treatment duration: 1 tablet Levofloxacin 500mg / day hang two days
           completed by 1 tablet Placebo Levofloxacin 500mg / day for 5 days.

        -  Group B: Standard treatment duration (control group): 1 tablet Levofloxacin 500mg / day
           for 7 days.

      The study is started by recruitment AECOPD patients to collect their blood samples and sputum
      samples and we made them up for control. These samples will be used for the inflammatory
      analyses and the study of bacterial and viral serology. The results were seized by the
      SPSS.18.0 software.
