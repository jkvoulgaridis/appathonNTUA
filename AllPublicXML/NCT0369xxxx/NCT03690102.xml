  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of telephone assistance and standardized
      basic life support courses on the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use
      of automated external defibrillator (AED).

      The investigators hypothesize that bystanders can provide compressions in correct frequency
      and use an AED correctly as well as safely from telephone instructions but that correct and
      successful ventilations including correct open airway require training on a course.

      The study aims at answering the following research questions:

        1. How is the quality of CPR and use of AED when performed by an inexperienced bystander
           who receives telephone assistance compared to the quality when performed by a trained
           bystander, who has passed a standardized European Resuscitation Council (ERC) course in
           basic life support (BLS) but does not receive telephone assistance?

        2. How is the quality of CPR and use of AED when performed by a trained bystander who has
           passed a standardized ERC course in BLS and who receives telephone assistance compared
           to the quality when performed by a trained bystander who does not receive telephone
           assistance?

      The questions are sought answered through simulated cardiac arrest scenarios in non-classroom
      settings.

      Participants are recruited from ERC courses in BLS.

      Participants are randomised to one of three groups (stratified for course type using
      computer-generated randomisation lists with blocks of variable sizes):

        1. Cardiac arrest scenario test before BLS course with telephone-assistance.

        2. Cardiac arrest scenario test after BLS course, no telephone-assistance.

        3. Cardiac arrest scenario test after BLS course with telephone-assistance.

Participants are randomized to one of three groups (stratified for course type, using computer-generated lists with variable block sizes):
Participants are given a cardiac arrest scenario test either before or after a European Resuscitation Council standardized basic life support course. Two of the groups receive instructions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation from a dispatcher when they call the Emergency Medical Services.</intervention_model_description>
