  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 59 U.S. children have been
      diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Peer relationships, social skills, and
      repetitive behaviors are a challenge for those with ASD. Exercise in the ASD population has
      been examined as a means to improve some of these challenges for children with ASD. This
      research study will try to see if a structured exercise program called CrossFit Kids can help
      with these challenges. This study is potentially beneficial in developing an exercise program
      for children with ASD that can help promote social skill development, reduce stereotypical
      behaviors, and provide overall health benefits.

    <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd edition is a parent questionnaire that describes difficulties in socialization, communication, and repetitive/restricted interests. The SRS includes parent and teacher evaluations and provides quantitative subscales that can distinguish the presence of ASD from other child psychiatric conditions. Scale will be administered pre CrossFit Kids intervention, after the 14 weeks of CrossFit Kids and then 8 weeks after the intervention of CrossFit Kids. Total T-score ranges 59 and below=within normal limits; 60-65 =mild range, 66-75 =moderate range, 76 or higher = severe range. Lower T-score means participant is less affected.</description>

    <description>The Behavioral Symptoms Index on the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, 3rd edition (BASC-3). Parent report is a parent rating scale that will be used as a general behavioral screen for comorbidities (hyperactivity, other externalizing behaviors, depression, etc.). Scale will be administered pre CrossFit Kids intervention, after the 14 weeks of CrossFit Kids and then 8 weeks after the intervention of CrossFit Kids. T scores are as follows 60 or less= within normal limits, 60-70 =at risk, 70 or higher= clinically significant. Lower T-score means less behavioral symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised (RBS-R) is a parent questionnaire that measures six subscales of repetitive behavior including: Stereotyped Behavior, Self-injurious Behavior, Compulsive Behavior, Routine Behavior, Sameness Behavior, and Restricted Behavior in those with ASD. Scale will be administered pre CrossFit Kids intervention, after the 14 weeks of CrossFit Kids and then 8 weeks after the intervention of CrossFit Kids. Higher total scores on repetitive behavior scale are associated with higher amounts of repetitive behaviors.</description>
