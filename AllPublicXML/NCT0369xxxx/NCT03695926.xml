      The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate [18F]MNI-1054 as a Lysine-specific
      histone demethylase 1A (LSD1) enzyme targeted radiopharmaceutical. The specific objectives
      are:

        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]MNI-1054 in brain using positron
           emission tomography (PET) in healthy volunteers.

        -  To measure blood metabolites of [18F]MNI-1054 in the healthy volunteers and to perform
           invasive as well as non-invasive modeling to assess its ability to measure LSD1 in the
           brain.

        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]MNI-1054

        -  Evaluation of [18F]MNI-1054 PET reliability (test/retest) of the tracer parameters in
           healthy volunteers.

          -  Are males or females &gt; 18 years of age and &lt; 50 years of age.

          -  Are in good health as determined by the investigator based on clinical evaluations
             including past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram,
             and laboratory tests at screening and prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Are a current nonsmoker who has not used tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (eg,
             nicotine patch) for at least 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug or first
             invasive procedure.

          -  Are a female subject of nonchildbearing potential, documented by medical records or
             physician's note to be either surgically sterile (by means of hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or post-menopausal for at least 1 year (i.e. 12
             consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause) or, if they
             are of child-bearing potential, must commit to use two methods of contraception, one
             of which is a barrier method for the duration of the study.

          -  Are a male subject who is sterile or agrees to use an appropriate method of
             contraception, including a condom with or without spermicidal cream or jelly, from the
             first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug. No
             restrictions are required for a vasectomized male subject provided the subject is at
             least 1-year postbilateral vasectomy procedure prior to the first dose of study drug.
             A male subject whose vasectomy procedure was performed less than 1 year prior to the
             first dose of study drug must follow the same restrictions as a nonvasectomized man.
             Appropriate documentation of surgical procedure should be provided.

          -  Male subjects must not donate sperm for the study duration and for 30 days following
             the last dose of study drug.
