  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhalation drugs are essential in the treatment of COPD, in controlling symptoms and
      preventing exacerbations. The aim of this pilot study is to collect data necessary for the
      planning of future efficacy trials. We plan to assess the value of providing training in
      inhalation technique to hospitalized COPD patients. Data on rehospitalizations will be
      collected from the hospital's medical records and from the National Patient Registry . The
      inhalation technique of all recruited patients will de assessed at baseline. The patients
      will then be randomised 1:1 to the intervention or standard care group. The intervention
      consists of a drug counselling, focusing on inhalation technique. In addition patients in the
      intervention group will have their medicines personally delivered from the hospital pharmacy
      at discharge (discharge service). Patients will be asked to fill in questionnaires evaluating
      the inhalation training and the discharge service
