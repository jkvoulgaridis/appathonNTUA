    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the effect of two hamstring strengthening programmes on hamstring
      muscle strength in Gaelic footballers. 26 Gaelic footballers were recruited and randomly
      assigned to one of two 4-week hamstring strengthening programmes, namely the hip extension
      exercise programme and the Nordic hamstring exercise protocol. Isokinetic hamstring and
      quadriceps strength were measured before and after the intervention.

      Recruitment:

      Participants were recruited from the local university sports clubs. Club chairpersons were
      asked to send an email to club players. Players interested in participating in the study
      expressed an interest by replying to the email. Potential participants were asked to attend a
      meeting where they had the study explained to them. Those who were interested were then
      assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Group allocation:

      A four block randomisation method was used to allocate participants to the Nordic hamstring
      exercise protocol or the hip extension exercise protocol.

      Interventions:

      The Nordic hamstring exercise protocol or the hip extension exercise protocol

      Testing procedure:

      The isokinetic strength of the participants' hamstrings and quadriceps were recorded before
      and after the exercise intervention.

      A 10 point visual analogue scale was used to record the level of muscle soreness experienced
      after each training session.

    <measure>Peak isokinetic eccentric hamstring strength at 60°.s-1</measure>

    <measure>Functional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio at 60°.s-1</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline assessment at six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This was calculated by dividing the peak isokinetic, eccentric hamstring strength at 60°.s-1 by the peak isokinetic, concentric quadriceps strength at 60°.s-1</description>

    <measure>Between limb, isokinetic eccentric hamstring strength asymmetries</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline assessment at six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Between limb eccentric strength percentage asymmetries were calculated as a non-dominant/dominant ratio converted to percentage difference using log transformation.</description>

    <measure>Muscle soreness rating following exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute at the end of each intervention session</time_frame>
    <description>Participants used a 10 point visual analogue scale to record the level of muscle soreness experienced after training sessions.
The scale consisted of a single scale of 0 to 10 where 0 was no soreness at all and 10 was the greatest soreness they could imagine. A higher score indicated a worse outcome. There are no subscales included in this.</description>

    <description>Participants were required to kneel on a gym mat keeping their hips in a slightly flexed position and to slowly lower themselves in a controlled manner as far as they could towards the ground. When they could no longer lower themselves as such, they were instructed to utilise their arms to buffer the fall and touch their chest off the ground, while maintaining tension in their hamstrings. Once their chest touched the ground they were instructed to immediately return to the starting position by pushing up with their hands.</description>

    <description>The participant lay on an exercise bench at a 45° angle with their hips held just over the top of the bench, their trunk erect and hips extended and their heel supported. Participants slowly flexed their hip until they reached 90° from the starting position and were then required to return to the starting position by extending through the hip while maintaining a neutral pelvic and trunk posture throughout. This exercise was then repeated on the opposite leg</description>
