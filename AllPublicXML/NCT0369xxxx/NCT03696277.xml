  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic kidney cancer patients on systemic therapy often develop resistance to limited
      sites that leads to changing of the systemic therapy. Local therapy to the sites of
      progression may allow patients to continue on the same systemic therapy that is otherwise
      effective and being tolerated well.

      Hypothesis:

      Stereotactic ablative radiation (SAbR) can delay the change of systemic therapy with
      oligoprogressive renal cell cancer (RCC) and improve progression free survival (PFS).

      Primary Objectives:

      • To evaluate the benefit of SAbR for oligo-progressive mRCC (Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer).

      Secondary Objectives:

      • To measure the toxicity, safety and tolerance of concurrent systemic therapy and SAbR for
      mRCC patients and its impact on quality of life.

      The study is a prospective phase II, single arm, open label trial evaluating Stereotactic
      Ablative Radiation Therapy (SAbR) for patients with oligo-progressive RCC (Renal Cell
      Cancer).

      Problem Statements:

        -  Can local therapy (SAbR) for oligoprogression delay the change of systemic therapy if
           progression is minimal to the progressive sites?

        -  Safely delaying the change of systemic therapy can have significant quality of life
           benefits for patients with oligo-progressive RCC.

        -  Can SAbR potentially improve progression free survival in oligoprogressive RCC patients?

      Primary Endpoint:

      • Time to change of systemic therapy.

      Secondary Endpoint:

        -  To measure the toxicity, safety and tolerance.

        -  To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) on subsequent systemic therapy after
           progression on SAbR.

        -  To measure the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

        -  To evaluate local control of SAbR for RCC

      Sample Size: 20 Patients

      Statistical Analysis: Time to event will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach along
      with the 95% confidence interval.
