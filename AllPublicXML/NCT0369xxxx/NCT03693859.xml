  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity (Body Mass Index â‰¥ 30 kg/m2) is associated with diminished executive functioning. The
      primary objective of this randomized, controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a
      behavioral weight loss program coupled with enhanced executive functioning training via
      serious gaming on weight loss and weight loss maintenance in adults with obesity and
      executive functioning deficits compared to adults undergoing standard behavioral treatment
      alone (N = 200). Serious gaming interventions that target the specific cognitive functions
      needed for weight-loss maintenance may improve long-term weight-loss success.

      This randomized, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral weight loss
      program coupled with enhanced executive functioning training via serious gaming (BWL+GAMING)
      on weight loss and maintenance in adults with obesity and executive functioning deficits
      compared to standard behavioral treatment alone (BWL) at two urban Philadelphia
      university-based clinics (PCOM [Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine] and Temple
      University). Participants will be recruited from the community. All participants (N = 200)
      will complete 12 weeks of behavioral weight loss treatment. Intervention participants will
      also complete 30-minutes (5 days per week for 8 weeks) of a serious gaming program, which
      will feature online games developed specifically to enhance executive functions. The primary
      outcomes are weight change and weight change maintenance, which will be measured at 12 and 52
      weeks, respectively. Neuropsychological testing will evaluate the proposed mechanism of
      action, changes in executive functioning, before and after treatment (12 and 52 weeks).
