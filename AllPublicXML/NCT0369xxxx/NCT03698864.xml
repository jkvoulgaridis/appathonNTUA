  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study that will evaluate the safety of PCS499 for the treatment of
      necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) and will inform the design of future studies. Approximately 12 NL
      patients (6-9 patients without ulceration and 3-6 patients with ulceration) who also meet
      other inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. The primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of PCS499 in patients with
      Necrobiosis Lipoidica.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients age 18 to 80 years of age, inclusive, at Screening.

          2. Biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of NL. Biopsies of continually active lesions performed
             outside of this clinical study will need to be reviewed and the diagnosis confirmed by
             the study pathologist. For patients with no previous history of biopsy, no biopsy
             within the previous 5 years, a biopsy that is not confirmed to be NL, or newly active
             lesion, a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of NL will be performed at the Screening
             visit.

          3. Reference NL lesion with a score of 2 or greater on the Investigator Global
             Assessment: Necrobiosis Lipoidica (IGA:NL) Activity scale AND surface area with
             minimum size of 10 cm2. If more than one lesion is present, the reference lesion area
             is the lesion with the highest disease severity.

          4. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the
             Screening Visit and a negative urine pregnancy test at Baseline before dosing.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must use one of the following acceptable methods of
             contraception throughout the study: oral contraceptive medication, intrauterine device
             (IUD), hormonal implants, injectable contraceptive medications, double-barrier
             methods, or tubal ligation.

          6. Females who are postmenopausal (age-related amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months and
             increased follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 mIU/mL. If necessary to confirm
             postmenopausal status, an FSH will be drawn at Screening) or who have undergone
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy are exempt from pregnancy testing.

          7. Male patients must be willing to use appropriate contraceptive measures and refrain
             from sexual activity with any female who is pregnant or lactating.

          8. Patient must be willing and able to swallow whole tablets.

          9. Patient must be willing and able to comply with study procedures.

          1. Current or previous (within 4 weeks of Baseline) treatment with:

               1. Oral, topical, or intralesional corticosteroids;

             infection cured for at least 2 weeks prior to Baseline.

          9. History of sarcoidosis, pyoderma gangrenosum, or any other disorder (in the judgment
             of the Investigator) that would interfere with the evaluation of NL or require

             renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary,
             neurological, psychiatric, substance abuse, and/or any other clinically significant
             disease or disorder, which in the opinion of the Investigator (by its nature or by
             being inadequately controlled), may put the patient at risk due to participation in
             the study, influence the results of the study, and/or affect the patient's ability to
             complete the study.
