  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at defining the role of soluble CD95 Ligand in the physiopathology of a rare
      group of inflammatory diseases: ANCA associated vasculitis. Soluble CD95 Ligand might have a
      prognostic and diagnostic interest as well as potential for the discovery of new therapeutic
      strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ANCA associated vasculitis are a rare group of diseases and potentially life-threatening
      inflammatory conditions. There is an urgent need to describe prognostic factors and to
      discover new therapeutic pathways. Soluble CD95-L is a cleaved part of CD95-L which binds the
      CD95 Death receptor. s-CD95-L has pro-inflammatory properties for Th17 lymphocytes and
      Neutrophils, two cells implicated in ANCA associated vasculitis. It also plays a role in
      systemic lupus erythematosus (which present with the same type of renal glomerulonephritis as
      ANCA-associated vasculitis). Finally, it has already be found elevated in this group of
      diseases. The investigators hypothesized that s-CD95-L levels might be a prognostic factor in
      ANCA associated vasculitis and the study of the molecular mechanisms involved could provide
      new therapeutic targets.

      The study will recruit 50 patients with ANCA associated vasculitis followed in Bordeaux
      University Hospital. Among classical disease activity information, blood and urine samples
      will be collected at each visit to study s-CD95-L. Fundamental research will be realized on
      patients' sample to study molecular mechanisms involved.

      Clinical and biological disease activity, treatment and outcomes will be studied in
      correlation with s-CD95-L to describe their potential prognostic role. Patients will be
      followed at regular intervals, as their usual follow-up would request. No extra visit will be
      needed and blood samples will be drawn at the same time as those drawn for clinical purposes.

    <description>Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score - Version 3 (BVAS 3.0) The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) is a method for assessing the activity of vasculitis. Note that scoring ranges are higher when any of the features are new or worse. Creatinine levels can be scored at patient's first assessment only. The maximum score is 63 points for present symptoms and 32 points for new symptoms or symptoms which had worsened within the previous weeks.</description>
