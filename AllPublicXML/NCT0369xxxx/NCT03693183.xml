             investigator could interfere with study measurements or subject compliance;

         10. Are currently taking (at Visit 1) any medication known to cause ocular drying that has
             not been used on a stable dosing regimen for 30 days prior to Visit 1;

         11. Are currently pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy;

         12. (For women of childbearing potential) Are unwilling to submit a urine sample for a
