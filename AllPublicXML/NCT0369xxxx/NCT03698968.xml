      The study is being conducted to evaluate the safe and effective use of the PICO 7 system in
      surgically closed incision sites and wounds requiring closure by skin graft or flap as part
      of the PMCF plan for this product, for the purpose of continuing CE (Conformité Européene)
      Mark approval in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12-2

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although evidence exists which supports the positive effects of NPWT on take of skin grafts
      and flaps, there is limited evidence in relation to single-use systems such as PICO. Most
      previous studies have used traditional NPWT systems as part of their design. Though the
      technical applications of the traditional and newer single-use systems are comparable it is
      possible that some of the features of the latter may influence clinical outcomes. In addition
      to the limitations highlighted above, the cited studies have seldom assessed the ease of
      management and acceptability of NPWT systems. Although clinical outcomes may be considered
      paramount, these usability factors could also play a key role in ensuring compliance with
      negative pressure protocols.

      The study is being conducted to evaluate the safe and effective use of the PICO 7 system in
      surgically closed incision sites and wounds requiring closure by skin graft or flap as part
      of the PMCF plan for this product, for the purpose of continuing CE (Conformité Européene)
      Mark approval in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12-2.

      The PICO system has recently been updated with minor modifications that make the system
      silent during wear. S &amp; N also wish to collect PMCF data in the indications of knee and
      abdominal incisions in order to make retrospective comparisons with data previously collected
      for these indications.

      The aim of this study is therefore to assess whether the PICO 7 system is a safe and
      effective therapy for surgically closed incisions, skin grafts and flaps. Effectiveness will
      be defined by the ability of the system to deliver negative pressure and handle exudate and
      by percentage of successful skin graft or flap survival at Day 14.

      A summary of known and potential risks and benefits to humans of each test article can be
      found in the Instructions for Use of PICO 7.

             dressing supplied.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications (per the PICO 7 IFU) or hypersensitivity to the use of the
             investigational product or their components (e.g. silicone adhesives and polyurethane
             films [direct contact with incision], acrylic adhesives [direct contact with skin],
             polyethylene fabrics and super-absorbent powders [polyacrylates]) within the
             dressing).

          -  Subjects with extremely fragile skin who require the use of SECURA non-sting barrier
             skin wipes and have hypersensitivity to the ingredients in the wipes

             days of operative visit or during the study.

          -  Subjects with skin features (e.g. tattoos, skin colour, pre-existing scarring) which
             in the opinion of the Investigator, will interfere with the study assessments.

             surgery).

          -  Subjects with incisions or skin grafts that are actively bleeding unless haemostasis
             has been achieved (to be confirmed during surgery).

          -  Subjects with infected skin grafts or incisions at the time of surgery (except for
             those with perforated bowel or peritonitis).

             needed for healing (based on clinicians expertise).

          -  Subjects with a medical or physical condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude safe subject participation in the study.
