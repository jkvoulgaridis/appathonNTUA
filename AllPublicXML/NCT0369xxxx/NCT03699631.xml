  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open-label trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of tocilizumab in
      improving GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (alloHCT) for hematologic malignancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research team earlier hypothesized and demonstrated that tocilizumab could attenuate the
      incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) after myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced intensity
      conditioning (RIC) Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), using matched
      sibling or unrelated donor. In this study, the research team hypothesizes that longer term
      interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibition through treatment with tocilizumab by repeated dosing would
      mediate a beneficial effect not only on the risk of aGVHD, but also on chronic GVHD. This
      will be achieved by administering an additional dose of tocilizumab at Day +100 post-alloHCT,
      besides the pretransplant dose, as done in our previous clinical trial, thereby providing
      total prophylaxis against both acute and chronic GVHD.

    <description>Tocilizumab will be administered intravenously (IV) at a dose of 8 mg/kg (maximum dose of 800 mg) once on the Day -1 approximately 24 hours prior to the estimated time of the hematopoietic cell infusion, and subsequently, on Day +100 (+/- 14 days, i.e., Days +86 to +114) post-alloHCT. The infusion will be administered over 60 minutes through a dedicated IV line and must not be administered by IV bolus.</description>
