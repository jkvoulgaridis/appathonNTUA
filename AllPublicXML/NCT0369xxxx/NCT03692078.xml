  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in exposure to selected harmful and
      potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) by measuring biomarkers in adult smokers who
      partially or completely switch from smoking cigarettes to oral tobacco-derived nicotine
      (OTDN) products compared to those who continue exclusive smoking cigarettes or stop using all
      tobacco products.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, 6 parallel-group clinical study evaluating changes in
      exposure to selected HPHCs, subjective effects, and product use behavior in adult smokers
      relative to continued smoking who are randomly assigned to continue smoking, partially or
      completely switch to oral tobacco-derived nicotine products, or stop using any tobacco
      products for 7 days.

    <measure>Questionnaire of Smoking Urges-Brief</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 5 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>The QSU-Brief is a 10-item instrument (Cox et al., 2001) intended to capture urge to smoke. Participants respond to the 10 items using a 7-point Likert-type rating scale ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. Both a total score (reflecting urge to smoke) and two factor scores (Factor 1: Intention to smoke with smoking perceived as rewarding; Factor 2: anticipation of relief from negative affect with an urgent desire to smoke) will be calculated by averaging the items.</description>

    <measure>Modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 5 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>The modified cigarette evaluation questionnaire (mCEQ) is a 12-item instrument intended to capture the degree to which a person experiences the reinforcing effects of smoking from 1 (Not at All) to 7 (Extremely) (Cappelleri et al., 2007). Scores for the five mCEQ subscales range from 1 to 7, with higher scores reflecting greater smoking satisfaction, psychological reward, aversion, enjoyment of respiratory tract sensations, and craving reduction.</description>

    <description>The &quot;Use this Product Again Questionnaire&quot; is a single-item bipolar visual analogue scale (VAS). Subjects are asked to respond to this item using a 100 mm VAS with three labeled points: &quot;Definitely Would Not,&quot; &quot;Don't Care&quot; and &quot;Definitely Would&quot;.</description>
