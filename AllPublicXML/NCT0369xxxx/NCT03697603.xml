    <measure>Mean changes from baseline in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores at last visit of the double-blind period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale which evaluates the level of depression. The MADRS consists of 10 items assessing apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, suicidal thought. Each item is scored from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects who score 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I Scale is a clinician-rated scale which assesses the total improvement of the patient's condition compared to that at baseline. Scores range from 0 to 7:0 = Not assessed, 1= Very much improved, 2 = Much improved, 3= Minimally improved, 4= No change, 5= Minimally worse, 6= Much worse, 7= Very much worse. Higher scores indicate worse condition.</description>
