  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is designed to increase healthy behaviours (e.g. physical
      activity, healthy eating, smoking abstinence) and reduce risk factors (e.g. high blood
      pressure &amp; cholesterol) in order to improve quality of life and health among people with
      heart disease. Unfortunately, few patients attend CR, often reporting several barriers to
      access including travel distance, parking fees and lack of time. Advances in technology have
      the potential to improve accessibility and delivery of CR programs, and improve patient
      empowerment. The University of Ottawa Heart Institute has developed an e-health program
      called the Virtual Cardiac Rehabilitation Program (VCRP); an online cardiovascular health
      management system (website &amp; Smartphone app) that provides strategies for the control and
      management of risk factors. The goals of VCRP are to: empower and educate patients; foster
      better communication between patients and their health care team; stimulate shared decision
      making; and, facilitate care coordination leading to better health outcomes. The VCRP
      provides patients with: real-time access to their health information, as well as tracking of
      risk behaviours and factors through integration with devices; a wellness plan; access to a
      personal on-line health coach; goal-setting notifications; on-line community forums; and,
      circle of care access to information. The aim of this project is to evaluate the effects of
      VCRP (with integrated fitness tracker) compared to a standard, home-based CR program. The
      study will look at changes in: patient empowerment; health behaviours; risk factors; quality
      of life; clinical outcomes; and, costs. The study will improve our understanding of: patient
      and provider needs; program usability; and shared decision-making. Results will inform the
      use of e-health programs such as VCRP into healthcare settings to improve patient
      empowerment, shared decision-making, and the ability to integrate wearable monitors to
      improve health behaviours.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient activation will be measured by the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) questionnaire.This 10-item tool assesses the degree to which a patient is engaged or disengaged with their health and how likely they are to self-manage it.The total score of the tool classifies a participant into one of 4 categories; disengaged and overwhelmed (level 1), becoming aware but still struggling (level 2), taking action (level 3) and maintaining behaviors and pushing further (level 4). Higher levels mean participants are becoming better at, or have fully begun to self-manage their health behaviors.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tobacco smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked 2 questions about tobacco smoking. The first asks about tobacco smoking in the last 6 months. The second asks about tobacco smoking in the last 7 days. If the participant has recently quit smoking we will ask for their quit date. This intervention is not providing smoking cessation counseling however, we are interested in participants cessation attempt as a health behavior change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - 22 weeks</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary behaviors will be measured by the Starting the Conversation questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 8 questions asking about frequency of fast food/snack consumption, fruit, vegetable, fat consumption, snacking and sodium intake. The participant's total score at baseline (sum of all answers, answers ranging from 0-2) will be compared to their total score at week 22. A change is considered a reduction in this score (0-16) between the two study time points. Higher values equate to a diet that could require a change in eating habits (reduction of salty foods or snacks, increase in vegetables/fruits).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Generic Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Generic health-related quality of life will be collected by the Short form Health Survey (SF-36, V1). This is a 36-item questionnaire assessing eight health concepts (physical functioning; role limitations because of physical health problems; bodily pain; social functioning; general mental health (psychological distress and psychological wellbeing); role limitations because of emotional problems; vitality (energy/fatigue); and general health perceptions). Questions are scored on a Likert scale which are then summed to a total between 0-100. Scores are then matched against norm tables.
to produce raw scale scores for each health concept which are then transformed to a 0 - 100 scale</description>

    <measure>Patient Experiences with the VCRP Intervention and online Platform</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's experiences will be assessed through focus group sessions. Participation is optional. Participants will be asked about their experiences with the VCRP, their acceptability and satisfaction with the VCRP, and suggestions for improvement. Participants will all be asked specific questions related to the VCRP platform but then given time to provide more general comments. The focus group questions will all be assembled by one of the Co-Investigators who has experience conducting focus group sessions. The Co-I will transcribe all focus group conversations and generate common themes. There are no score-able questionnaires being used during focus group sessions. These sessions are qualitative in nature.</description>

    <description>This group will receive access to the NWC (NexJ Connected Wellness TM (NCW) and will be provided with a fitness tracker (Garmin Vivofit 3) to monitor their exercise, sedentary behaviours, and sleep patterns. The NWC platform includes components for education (health library, workbooks etc), collaboration (personal care plan, appointment scheduler, secure messaging system etc), and motivation (motivational messages on their homepage etc). With the Health Coach, participants will engage in: reviews of their risk factor profile and health priorities; goal setting and action planning; problem solving and skill building; and discussions of relapse prevention. Participants will receive a total of seven hours of health coaching delivered across nine sessions over a 26-week period</description>

    <description>The Case Managed Home Program (CMHP) is delivered primarily via telephone. Following their CR intake, patients are linked with their CMHP Health Coach and attends their visit (in person or over the phone) which includes a comprehensive review of their health history, current symptoms, medications, activity, and individual concerns. Following this visit, participants will receive a total of 10 individualized telephone calls over a 26 week period. The program action plan is individually formulated based on the participant's goals and learning needs. Participants are provided with educational kits (exercise, nutrition, stress management or prevention) that are based on the principle of single point learning and incorporate behavioural change techniques.</description>
