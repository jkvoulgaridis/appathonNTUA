    <intervention_model_description>Young adults born premature, recruited either from the National Lung Project Cohort or the general public, will undergo Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging before and after medication administration. This will occur twice, on two separate visits. Subjects will be given sildenafil in between imaging scans at one visit, and will receive intravenous metoprolol in between scans at a separate visit. These visits can occur in either order.</intervention_model_description>

               1. Participant in the Newborn Lung Project (birth year 1988-1991, birth weight &lt;1500
                  g)

               2. Non-NLP participant, with birth weight &lt;1500 g and gestational age 32 weeks or
                  less, verified by medical records

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating

          2. Use of prescribed medications that would interfere with study medications

               1. Sildenafil: Use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil,
                  vardenafil), nitrates, soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor (riociguat) within 48
                  hours of study visit

               2. Metoprolol: Use of nodal blocking agents including beta blockers,
                  non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (i.e. diltiazem), and
                  anti-arrhythmics (i.e. amiodarone)

          3. Presence of known comorbidities for which these therapeutic interventions would be
             contraindicated:

               1. Moderate to severe heart failure

               2. Severe bradycardia (heart rate &lt;45), or second or third-degree heart block

               3. Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or &gt;190 mmHg

               4. Angina

               5. Severe peripheral arterial circulatory disorders

               6. History of severe bronchospasm

          4. Presence of any implanted device incompatible with CMR imaging

          5. Known allergic or hypersensitivity reaction to components of the study medications

          6. Any other reason for which the investigator deems a subject unsafe or inappropriate
             for study participation.
