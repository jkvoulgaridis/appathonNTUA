    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to pilot a WOOP (Wish Outcome Obstacle Plan) intervention for
      spouses of persons with early stage dementia for the purposes of future research. The
      investigators will be using two cohorts. One who will get the intervention and the other who
      will be wait listed and receive the intervention at a later date. Spouses of persons with
      dementia will use WOOP, a brief goal attainment sequence, every day for 16 days. Participants
      will complete surveys before the intervention, at Day 16, and at a 3-month follow-up. The
      outcome measures are goal attainment, emotion regulation skills, psychological health, and
      support quality.

    <measure>change in positive affect</measure>
    <time_frame>day 16; 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nine self-reported positive emotions (e.g., amusement, gratitude, hope) on a 1-5 scale over the past week using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (25 items). Higher scores indicate more positive emotions.</description>

    <measure>change in depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>day 16; 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression Scale (CESD). Participants rate on a scale from 1 to 4. Higher numbers indicate more depressive symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in emotion regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>day 16; 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; 2004). Participants rate 36 emotion regulation skills on a scale from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate more difficulty regulating emotions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in support quality</measure>
    <time_frame>day 16; 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will also assess both partners' perceptions of support quality using a 10-item measure developed and validated by Brooke Feeney. Items include &quot;My spouse is always there for me whenever I need him/her&quot;, and &quot;I can count on my spouse to comfort and help me when I need it.&quot; Items are rated on a scale from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly). Greater numbers indicate greater support quality.</description>

    <measure>change in caregiver burden</measure>
    <time_frame>day 16; 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spouses only will complete the short form Zarit Burden Interview which consist of 12 items rated from 0 (never) to 4 (nearly always). Items include, &quot;Do you feel that because of the time you spend with your relative that you don't have enough time for yourself?&quot; and &quot;Do you feel angry when you are around your relative?&quot;</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>day 16; 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) will be used to examine participants' stress over the past week. There are 10 items rated on a scale from 0 to 4. Greater scores indicate greater stress.</description>

    <description>1. Wish or goal: A wish (e.g. &quot;responding calmly when the partner asks a question repeatedly&quot;). 2. Outcome: The most positive outcome of realizing the wish or goal (e.g. &quot;both partners feel respected and happy&quot;). Then the participant vividly imagines the outcome. 3. Obstacle: The most critical internal, controllable, obstacle (e.g., &quot;feeling impatient&quot;). Then the participant vividly imagines the internal obstacle occurring. 4. Plan: The participant answers the following question: What action can I take or what thought can I think to overcome the obstacle (e.g., &quot;take a deep breath, take my partner's perspective, and answer the question calmly&quot;); then he or she forms an &quot;if&quot; [specified obstacle - when I feel impatient], &quot;then I will&quot; [specified action or thought to overcome obstacle - take a deep breath, take my partner's perspective, and answer the question calmly] plan.</description>
