  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, prospective, open label, single arm, phase II-study for the
      evaluation of efficacy and feasibility (as determined by safety and tolerability) of
      olaratumab and doxorubicin rechallenge in anthracycline pretreated locally advanced
      (unresectable) or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until now, rechallenge with anthracyclines in patients with metastatic STS which had a
      benefit from prior anthracycline containing therapy was never investigated in a prospective
      study.

      Due to the very promising effect of olaratumab and doxorubicin in anthracycline-naïve
      patients and further taking into consideration the results of the retrospective anthracycline
      rechallenge study, there is a clear rationale to evaluate the effects of olaratumab and
      doxorubicin also in anthracycline pretreated patients by conducting a prospective clinical
      trial.
