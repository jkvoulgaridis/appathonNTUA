      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of NY-ESO-1 T cell receptor (TCR)
      engineered T cells and how well they work with NY-ESO-1 TCR engineered hematopoietic stem
      cells (HSCs) after melphalan conditioning regimen in treating patients with ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back (recurrent) or does not
      respond to treatment (refractory). The melphalan conditioning chemotherapy makes room in the
      patient's bone marrow for new blood cells and blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow.
      Giving NY-ESO-1 TCR T cells and stem cells after the conditioning chemotherapy is intended to
      replace the immune system with new immune cells that have been redirected to attack and kill
      the cancer cells and thereby improve immune system function against cancer. Giving NY-ESO-1
      TCR engineered T cells and HSCs after melphalan may work better in treating patients with
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of autologous peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) that have been
      genetically modified ex vivo to express NY-ESO-1 TCR, following a myeloablative conditioning
      regimen.

      Ia. Assessment of toxicities using Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) and definition of a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. TCR engineered hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment. II. Functional assays for TCR
      transgenic cells. III. Progression-free survival (PFS) (compare with the duration of the PFS
      in the last treatment regimen).

      IV. Durable tumor response in at least 30% of the patients defined as immune-related complete
      response (irCR) or immune-related partial response (irPR) by immune-related Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) criteria at 6 months.

      V. Long-term persistence of TCR transgenic cells (regardless of cell origin) as evidenced by
      &gt; 5% of CD3 lymphocytes being NY-ESO-1 specific by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
      tetramer assay at 3 and 6 months.

      VI. Discrimination of TCR transgenic cells resulting from retrovirally-transduced mature
      lymphocytes and lentivirally-transduced HSCs and their phenotyping.

      VII. Long term monitoring for replication competent retrovirus and lentivirus. VIII. Analysis
      of viral insertion sites in long term persisting NY-ESO-1 TCR clones: absence of a clonal
      expansion of TCR transgenic cells with a particular transgene insertion site (defined as a
      clone comprising &gt; 20% of all PBSC-derived gene-marked cells).

      IX. Gut microbiota pre and post treatment to evaluate the role of microbiota on the
      therapeutic efficacy of the proposed therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous NY-ESO-1-specific CD8-positive T
      lymphocytes.

      Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day -1. Patients then
      receive autologous NY-ESO-1 CD4-TCR CD34+ HSC IV on day 0 and autologous NY-ESO-1-specific
      CD8-positive T lymphocytes IV between days 7 and 21. Patients also receive aldesleukin
      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) for 14 days on the following day after the T cell
      infusion (between days 8 and 22).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years,
      then annually for up to 15 years.

             Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed
             consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure

          -  Participant must agree to and arrange for a caregiver (age &gt;= 18 years old) available

             by the treating physician

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Known cases of clinically active brain metastases (brain magnetic resonance imaging
             [MRI] as clinically indicated). Prior evidence of brain metastasis successfully

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Use of chronic corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, or immunomodulating agents (e.g.,
             interleukin 2, interferon alpha or gamma, granulocyte colony stimulating factors,

               -  NOTE: Recent or current use of inhaled steroids and topical steroids are not
                  exclusionary. If subjects are prescribed a brief course of oral corticosteroids,
                  the use should be limited to less than 7 days. Use of steroids before apheresis
                  and immune assessment blood draws should be discouraged as it will affect white
                  blood cell function

          -  Active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV),
             hepatitis C virus (HCV), or cytomegalovirus (CMV) as defined below, due to the
             immunosuppressive effects of chemo-conditioning used and the unknown risks associated

               -  Active hepatitis C. Patients will be screened for HCV antibody. If the HCV
                  antibody is positive, a screening HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) by any reverse
                  transcriptase (RT) PCR or branched deoxyribonucleic acid (bDNA) assay must be
                  performed at screening by a local laboratory with a Clinical Laboratory
                  Improvement Act (CLIA) certification or its equivalent. Eligibility will be
                  determined based on a negative screening value. The test is not required if
                  documentation of a negative result of a HCV RNA test performed within 60 days
                  prior to screening is provided.

               -  Serology (CMV IgG) positive for active CMV

             [MI] in the past 6 months, significant cardiac arrhythmia, stage III or IV congestive
             heart failure [CHF]). Cardiac stress test will be done if clinically indicated. (The
             specific test to be chosen at the discretion of the principal investigator [PI])

          -  Patients with pulmonary function test abnormalities as evidenced by a forced
             expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 70% of predicted
