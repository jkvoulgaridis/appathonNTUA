  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect of repeated doses of DS-8500a on
      the single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of rosuvastatin.

      The total length of time (from screening to follow-up) for each participant is approximately
      7 weeks.

      It is expected that repeated oral doses of DS-8500a will not have a significant effect on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of rosuvastatin.

    <description>In treatment Period 1 (Day 1 through Day 4), on Day 1, participants receive a single dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg orally with food, and in Period 2 (Day 1 through Day 16), starting on Day 1, participants receive DS-8500a 75 mg orally qd with food for 16 days with concomitant administration of a single dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg qd on Day 14.
In both the periods, rosuvastatin and DS-8500a are administered after an overnight fast of 8 hours and within 10 minutes after consuming a standardized breakfast of 500 calories.</description>
