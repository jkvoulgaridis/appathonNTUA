    <textblock>
      The study examines the efficacy of Metacognitive Training for depression in later life
      (MCT-Silver). The study intends to investigate the extent to which MCT-Silver leads to a
      significant reduction in depressive symptoms compared to an active control group
      (mybraintraining©) (primary outcome: change in clinician-assessed depressive symptoms from t0
      to t1 and t2). Secondary outcomes include change in self-reported depressive symptoms and
      dysfunctional (meta) cognitive beliefs, as well as quality of life, rumination, self-reported
      anxiety, attitudes toward aging and neuropsychological functioning from t0 to t1 and t2. The
      study design is a randomized-controlled trial with one intervention group and one active
      control group.

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD-24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Total Time Frame is 5 months. Outcome is assessed at two points: baseline to post-assessment (8 weeks) and baseline to follow-up (5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The 24-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is an established clinician-rated assessment of depressive symptom severity and assesses psychological as well as somatic symptoms (scores range from 0-2 or 0-4) of depression. The clinician rates the severity of these symptoms based on the patient's report and his or her own observation. Scores range from 0-54. Based on the first 17 items, a score of 8-13 indicates mild depression, 14-18 indicates moderate depression, 19-22 indicates severe depression and scores greater than 23 indicate very severe depression. The scale has demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity among older adults (Mottram, Wilson &amp; Copeland, 2001). The reliability and validity among older adult samples has also been confirmed (Korner et al., 2006). In terms of assessing change for the current trial, a greater reduction in depressive symptoms (i.e., change score) indicates better outcome.</description>

Each item is endorsed on a 7-point scale (Range: 0-7) such that a total score of 126 is possible with higher scores indicating dysfunctional beliefs which are held more strongly. The total score is comprised of two subscales (perfectionism (Range 0-56); need for social approval (Range 0-21)), which are summed along with 7 other items to calculate the total scale score.</description>

    <measure>Stroop Color-Word Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Total Time Frame is 5 months. Outcome is assessed at two points: baseline to post-assessment (8 weeks) and baseline to follow-up (5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in executive functions as measured by the Stroop Color-Word test from baseline to post-assessment (8 weeks) and follow-up (5 months). The Stroop Color-Word test is comprised of three trials: Word Reading, Color Naming and Color-Word (CW) Naming. Per the Golden administration guidelines, total score for each subscale is the number of items completed within 45 seconds. For each condition, a raw score of 100 is possible (with a higher score indicating a better performance). For the current study, the Interference score will also be calculated, which is the difference between the expected CW Naming score and the predicted CW Naming score (which is predicted based on age and education; range is -29 to 30 such that larger scores indicate better performance).</description>

    <description>Metacognitive training for depression in later life is a cognitive-behaviorally based group therapy, which focuses on helping participants gain (metacognitive) distance from their thought patterns that contribute to depression. Over 8 modules, MCT-Silver addresses issues specific to depression in later life, such as coping with physical changes and loss, as well as adapting to new (social) roles. The program also includes modules on identifying and (re-)defining values in later life and how one may move toward acceptance of situations that cannot be prevented or changed. MCT-Silver addresses cognitive and metacognitive biases that contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression through fun and engaging exercises, as well as using examples from daily life.</description>
