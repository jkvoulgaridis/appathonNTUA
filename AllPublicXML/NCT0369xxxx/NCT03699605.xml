  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was conducted to develop the verbal expressive skills management programme
      (VESMP) to enhance verbal expressive skills of patients with severe Broca aphasia. To
      determine the efficacy of VESMP in improving the quality of life and level of satisfaction of
      aphasic stroke patients.Control group received traditional therapy and experimental group
      received therapy through VESMP programme on their smart phones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Speech therapy makes an integral part of the non-pharmacological, conservative management of
      Post stroke aphasia. Routine speech therapy aims to improve comprehension and verbal skills
      and also develop functional communication skills through augmentative Alternative
      communication devices. Disorders of communication, including aphasia (mainly post stroke)
      caused by the left hemisphere brain damage, is a major community health issue. Aphasia is a
      language disorder occurring mainly as a result of stroke. It is an acquired impairment of
      language that weakens people's ability of comprehension and expression, it does not show any
      affect to intellect ability. The verbal expressive skills management programme (VESMP) is the
      software which developed augmented management for patients to enhance verbal expressive
      skills for patients with severe Broca's aphasia from different geographic areas.

    <intervention_model_description>The two groups were included for speech therapy. For any given subject, aphasia severity evaluations were completed on the same day.includes patients that are 40+ years old, and have three months of post stroke with diagnosis of chronic Broca's Aphasias, each patient received treatment for 4 months that includes 04 VESMP sessions per week with each session being 30-45 minutes long. The measurement will be taken at 0 week (baseline) after 16 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Battery (BDAE) was administered to all participants pre-and post-VESMP. The BDAE is a comprehensive standardized test of language performance for individuals with aphasia that includes measures of spoken language, naming, auditory comprehension, reading and other modalities.</description>

    <description>Participants used VESMP at least half hour session thrice a week over an average of 4 months. The instruction before every domain included using it independently on the participant's own smart phone, or with a trained person either in the clinic or on their phone brought to the participant's home.
Total 25 patients with diagnosis of severe non-fluent aphasia included, ages 40+, at least 3 months post-onset of single unilateral CVA affecting the language dominant hemisphere at the time of baseline testing also including, Participant demographics, aphasia classification and severity. All subjects participated in an intensive 2-week VESMP treatment program prior to beginning the individualized programs.</description>

    <description>. The application contains following seven domains: spontaneous speech, comprehension, naming, reading, writing, imitation and automated speech. The programme was developed in Urdu language which contains different daily functional words, phrases and sentences. Treatment stimuli consisted of images of objects along with auditory sounds of person and actions cues. The voice output can operate by pressing the selected picture with index finger. Participants received 1-16 weeks of therapy using software of two domains with different difficulty levels. Specifically the programme included seven domains within the software comprising of eight 30-45 minutes sessions (4 days per week for total 16weeks). The measurement will be taken at 0 week (baseline) after 16 weeks.</description>
