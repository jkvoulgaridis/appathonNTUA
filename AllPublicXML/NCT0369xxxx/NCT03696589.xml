  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, in regards to acceptability and
      implementation, of the Pre-Active PD intervention for increased high intensity goal-directed
      aerobic exercise engagement in people with early-stage Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr
      stage I &amp; II). In addition, the study aims to explore the effect estimates of the Pre-Active
      PD intervention on self-efficacy, motivation, stage of behavior change, and physical activity
      levels in people with early stage Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 14 individuals with early stage Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and
      Yahr stage I &amp; II). The investigators will conduct a single arm cohort. (pre and post
      intervention) pilot feasibility study over 4 months with embedded process analyses of
      Preactive-HD, a physical activity coaching intervention program. Previous studies conducted
      by the investigators will be utilized to adapt the Engage-HD physical activity coaching
      program to people with early stage PD. The intervention will include a participant/coach
      interaction and disease-specific workbook grounded within the framework of self-determination
      theory. The coaching sessions will be conducted by an occupational therapist and will entail
      six coaching sessions (either face-to-face or remote video sessions via secure Webex
      connection via computer or smart phone, or phone call if internet/smart phone is not
      available to participant). The first session (approximately 45 min) will lay the groundwork
      for the program, and the remaining sessions will serve to provide directed support in
      relation to regular physical activity and exercise. Participants will develop physical
      activity goals and will be supported with individual physical activity progression.
      Participants will be given Fitbit devices as a motivational tool and to track activity
      progression.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Moderate-Vigorous Physical Activity using Actigraph at 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using Actigraph accelerometer, levels of moderate-vigorous physical activity will be measured, as well as number of steps and sedentary behavior.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) of the Behavioural Regulation In Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-2) at 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BREQ-2 is a 19-item questionnaire that measures each of the subscales of the self-determination continuum: external, introjected, identified, and intrinsic regulations, as well as amotivation. Each subscale is represented by 4 questions, except for introjected regulation which has 3. Questions are scored using a 5-point Likert scale; Answers range from 0 (not true for me) to 4 (very true for me). Subscale scores (sum totals of the 3 or 4 questions) will be reported and compared across participants. Subscales have a maximum score of 16 (12 for introjected regulation) and a minimum score of 0. An overall score (RAI-score, Relative Autonomy Index) for motivation quality will also be constructed. This is done by weighting each regulation subscale and summing them. The relative RAI is a single score derived from the subscales that gives an index of the degree to which respondents feel self-determined. Higher RAI scores denote more self-determined (autonomous) motivation.</description>

    <description>The Perceived Autonomy Support Healthcare Climate Questionnaire is from the Health-Care, Self-Determination Theory Questionnaire Packet that was designed to assess constructs encompassed within Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as it applies to health-care behavior. This is a measure of acceptability of the intervention. Scores on this 15-item questionnaire are calculated by averaging the individual item scores. Higher average scores (15 max) represent a higher level of perceived autonomy support.</description>

    <description>Based in the self-determination theory, participants will be coached on beneficial exercises, how to utilize supports and overcome barriers to PA engagement. Emphasis of exercise coaching will be on increasing aerobic exercise engagement and will include us of Fitbit devices to facilitate uptake and monitor aerobic exercise. Intervention will be delivered by a physical or occupational therapist, who will work with the participant to develop a plan, set goals and targets, and track changes. Additional resources that will support exercise engagement will be provided. Participants will have the choice to receive their face-to-face session either in person or remotely via secure video-based service.</description>
