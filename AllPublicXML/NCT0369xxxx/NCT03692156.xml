  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided nerve block has the characteristics of high success rate, few
      complications, and high patient satisfaction. It has been widely used in brachial plexus and
      lumbar plexus nerve blocks. Studies of ultrasound-guided superficial cervical plexus block
      are mostly unsatisfactory, and may be due to anatomic localization of the puncture site
      rather than real-time ultrasound guidance. The great auricular nerve is the largest branch of
      the superficial cervical plexus and may be identified under ultrasound. The aim of this study
      is to establish the success rate of identification of the great auricular nerve by combining
      ultrasound imaging with transcutaneous nerve stimulation. In addition, we will study the
      relationship between the success rate of identification and the related factors of patients.
      Another purpose of this study is to locate the position where the great auricular nerve
      emerges the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The relationship between this
      point and the midpoint of posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and adjacent
      structures will also be studied.
