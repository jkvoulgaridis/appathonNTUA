  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication errors represent the most common cause of patient injury and one of the most
      frequently reported health related deviation in Norway. The addition of a dedicated clinical
      pharmacist throughout the hip fracture patient pathway (patient pathway pharmacist) is
      believed to improve patient safety and ensure optimal drug-related patient care. The
      pharmacist will perform medication reconciliation at admission to hospital, medication review
      after surgery and assist physicians with discharge summary. Six weeks after discharge the
      patient pathway pharmacist will perform a second drug reconciliation and medication review.
      This study will assess the pharmacists' place and specific tasks in the patient pathway,
      describe areas where the pharmacist contribute to increased quality of care and assess the
      benefits and/or disadvantages experienced with introducing a patient pathway pharmacist. The
      estimated number of patients included is 60. Current practice will be determined by
      investigating the last 50 patients' medical record and a questionnaire to health care
      professionals involved in treatment of hip fracture patients. Data from medication
      reconciliation and drug review will be collected and compared to current practice. After the
      inclusion period, focus group surveys and/or semi-structured interviews will be executed to
      describe the perceived improvement in the quality of care. Primary endpoints are: 1)
      Medication reconciliation score at admission 2) Number of inappropriate drugs for elderly 3)
      Discharge summary score 4) Discharge summaries following procedure. Secondary endpoints are
      readmissions and mortality after 30 and 90 days. Qualitative endpoints: 1) Health care
      professionals experience of current drug-related practice 2) Experienced advantages and
      disadvantages of a patient pathway pharmacist.

    <intervention_model_description>An intervention group is compared to a cross-sectional retrospective group.
A group of 60 patients with hip fracture will get an intervention by a clinical pharmacist who performs medication reconciliation and medication review during hospitalisation, they will receive a discharge summary where the medication part is optimised. After six weeks the patients will be get a follow-up with a second medication reconciliation and - review. This group will be compared with the last 50 patients with hip fracture who did not get the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
