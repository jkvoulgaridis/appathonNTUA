  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit pre-diabetic patients to see if continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
      with a low carbohydrate diet can reduce the percentage of time the CGM readings are above the
      normal range. Through this study it will demonstrate the feasibility of using CGM with a low
      carbohydrate diet to reduce weight and risk of developing diabetes in patients with
      pre-diabetes.

      Patients that appear to be eligible will be recruited from Michigan Medicine in the Family
      Medicine Clinic at the Livonia Center.

    <measure>Participant Satisfaction With Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)</measure>
    <time_frame>33 days after day 1 (visit 3 completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction is measured using responses to the post intervention survey question, &quot;How likely are you to recommend that a friend or family member with pre-diabetes wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)?&quot;. A 5 point scale was used, ranging from 1 to 5, where a score of 1 is &quot;extremely likely&quot; and 5 is &quot;would not recommend&quot;. Satisfied respondents answered either 1 or 2 on the scale.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, day 22</time_frame>
    <description>The Low Carbohydrate Knowledge Scale ranges from 15-41, where 15 is a low score and 41 is a high score. Participants were asked to report knowledge at baseline and completion. A positive score indicates an increase from baseline in knowledge, while a score of 15 indicates no change and a negative score indicates a decrease in knowledge from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cravings From Day 11 to Day 22</measure>
    <time_frame>11 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded cravings in food logs. Craving rating scale ranges from 1 to 5, where a score of 1 is low and a score of 5 is high.</description>

    <measure>Intention to Continue Low Carbohydrate Eating</measure>
    <time_frame>day 22</time_frame>
    <description>The completion survey asked participants a question, &quot;How confident are you that you can maintain a low carbohydrate diet for the next 12 months?&quot; Intention to Continue Low Carbohydrate eating used a scale of 1 to 5, where a score of 1 was not confident at all and a score of 5 was very confident.</description>

    <measure>Utility of CGM Feedback for Changing Diet</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days (30 days after visit 3 completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Utility of CGM feedback is expressed as the number of participants who qualitatively indicated that CGM feedback helped them to change their diet. Themes were identified and coded from qualitative interviews around this topic. Two qualitative coders identified themes that supported this construct.</description>

Patients will wear a CGM sensor (with real time feedback) for 11 days; document what they eat on a food log; and rate their postprandial fatigue and cravings; document their blood sugar before and two hours after eating (as well as before breakfast and before going to bed).</description>

        <description>The Low Carbohydrate Knowledge Scale ranges from 15-41, where 15 is a low score and 41 is a high score. Participants were asked to report knowledge at baseline and completion. A positive score indicates an increase from baseline in knowledge, while a score of 15 indicates no change and a negative score indicates a decrease in knowledge from baseline.</description>
