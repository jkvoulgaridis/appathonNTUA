  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A research team from King's College London are investigating how diet can be used as a
      treatment for Crohn's disease. The investigators have designed a new diet and eventually wish
      to test whether the diet can be used to manage Crohn's disease and reduce gut inflammation.
      Before doing this, the investigators need to find out how practical it is for people to
      follow the diet for 14 days by conducting this 'feasibility' study. A feasibility study is a
      small study that aims to highlight any issues before informing the design of a larger
      research trial.

      The diet the investigators have designed is called the Crohn's Diet. The evidence for this
      diet is based on recent research which suggests that certain food ingredients may be involved
      in triggering gut inflammation.

      The study's primary aim is to assess the practicalities of following the Crohn's Diet. It
      will also assess compliance to the Crohn's Diet and if following it changes the nutritional
      balance from the normal diet.

        Inclusion Criteria will include:

          1. Adults aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease

          2. Stable Crohn's disease (as defined as self-reported: no change in Crohn's disease
             medication in the last 3 months; no Crohn's disease surgery in the last 6 months; no
             hospital admissions related to Crohn's disease in the last 6 months; no new perianal
             Crohn's disease in the last 6 months).

          4. Individuals able to give informed consent

          5. Individuals able to understand and read English

          6. Individuals willing to provide consent in this study which involves a dietary change
             for 14 days

        Exclusion Criteria will include:

          1. Unexplained/unintentional weight loss in the past 6 months

          2. Major co-morbidities; for example, diabetes, coeliac disease, major active psychiatric
             conditions or current eating disorders.

          3. Current Crohn's disease therapy with any of the following: corticosteroids, exclusive
             or partial enteral nutrition (liquid nutrition), and any participants prescribed oral
             nutrition supplements for nutrition support.

          4. Individuals who report to be pregnant or lactating

          5. Individuals with specific, complex dietary needs (based on the dietitian's judgment),
             such as multiple food allergies, in which the additional burden of the Crohn's Diet
             would pose a nutrition risk.
