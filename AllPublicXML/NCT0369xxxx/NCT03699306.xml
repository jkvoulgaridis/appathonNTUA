      Background and Aim: Tubular feeding is used, in patients who cannot take food through their
      mouths, but the digestive system has the ability to digest food. This method is safe and
      affordable for the patient and results in maintaining the function of the digestive system
      and reducing the risk of infection and sepsis. The purpose of this study was to compare the
      three methods of the NG tube placement in intubated patients in the emergency department of
      university-affiliated hospitals of Isfahan from2016 to 2018.

      Materials and Methods: This study was a randomized and prospective clinical trial. The
      statistical population of this study was all patients who had been referred to the emergency
      department of Al-Zahra and Ayatollah Kashani hospitals in Isfahan between2016and2018. The
      sample size was 25 in each group, and in total 75 subjects. The first group was NG tube
      insertion by the conventional method, the second group was using brake cable and the third
      group was embeddedby highwayman's hitch or draw hitch, using a silk thread. For all patients,
      demographic characteristics and possible complications were recorded. Finally, the data were
      analyzed using SPSS20 software at two statistical levels of descriptive and inferential.
