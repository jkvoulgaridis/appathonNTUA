  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improvement in morbidity and mortality observed with kidney transplantation is often
      curtailed by post-transplant weight gain, which is common among kidney transplant recipients
      (KTR). Post-transplant weight gain is associated with serious health issues such as
      cardiovascular disease, new onset diabetes after transplantation, and graft failure. Although
      these adverse effects of post-transplant weight gain are well recognized, interventions that
      target the modifiable risk factors of diet and physical activity to address
      post-transplantation weight gain are lacking. The purpose of this study is to test the
      feasibility of an in-home, televideo health coaching to increase the healthy behaviors of
      KTRs who are 6 months post-transplantation.

    <measure>Change in diet quality assessed by Healthy Eating Index Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in dietary quality will be determined by calculating Healthy Eating Index- 2010 scores from 3 day food records. A total HEI-2010 score will be calculated, which is comprised of a summative score across 12 subscales, with higher scores indicative of a better diet quality (maximum score 100).</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life-Kidney Transplant Questionnaire (KTQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the Kidney Transplant Questionnaire, a 25-question disease-specific questionnaire with 5 dimensions measured- physical symptoms, fatigue, uncertainty/fear, appearance, and emotions. A higher score indicates a greater quality of life. A change in score greater than 0.5 in each domain is clinically significant.</description>
