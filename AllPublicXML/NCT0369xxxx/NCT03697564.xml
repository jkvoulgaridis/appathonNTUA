  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of nivolumab + cabiralizumab +
      gemcitabine can give prolonged disease control in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer
      compared to gemcitabine alone.

      Cabiralizumab is an antibody (a type of protein) that binds to a molecule called CSF-1r.
      CSF-1r is a molecule present on different types of cells in your immune system that controls
      parts of your immune system. Blocking CSF-lr could potentially stop the cancer cells which it
      appears on from escaping the immune system, which could then act to kill the cancer cells.

      Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 antibody that boost the body's immune system. It works by attaching
      to and blocking a molecule on white blood cells called PD-1. PD-1 is a protein that is
      present on different types of cells in your immune system and controls parts of your immune
      system by shutting it down. Antibodies that block PD-1 can potentially prevent PD-1 from
      shutting down the immune system, thus allowing immune cells to recognize and destroy cancer
      cells.

      Gemcitabine is currently used to treat advanced or metastasized (spread) pancreatic cancer.
      It is used in patients whose disease cannot be removed by surgery and who have already been
      treated with other chemotherapy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastasis

          -  Must be off their prior cytotoxic regimen a minimum of two weeks but no more than four
             weeks from initiating trial treatment.

        Demonstrate adequate organ function

        Normal Vitamin D level.

        Able to submit an archival tumor specimen (primary or metastatic site). Patients with
        cytology only that do not have adequate archived tumor specimen available, will require a
        baseline biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is currently participating and receiving trial therapy or has participated in a trial
             of an investigational agent and received trial therapy or used an investigational
             device within 3 weeks of the first dose of trial treatment.

          -  Hypersensitivity to cabiralizumab, nivolumab, or gemcitabine or any of its excipients.

             additional therapy is required during the study period.

          -  Evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis

          -  Participants with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease.
