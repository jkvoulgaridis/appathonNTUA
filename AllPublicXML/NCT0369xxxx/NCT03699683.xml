  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Bariatric surgery (BS) causes large weight reductions and improvements in
      cardiovascular risk (CVR), although, there are also decreases in fat-free mass (FFM).
      However, the effects of exercise after surgery on these variables remains to be determined.

      Methods: 38 patients who underwent BS were divided into two groups: an experimental group
      (EG, n = 19) and a control group (CG, n = 19). Body composition, physical fitness, CVR and
      CVR factors were assessed in both groups one month after the surgery (T1), at 7 months (T2)
      and at 13 months (T3). Between T1 and T2, the EG performed a 6 month monitored aerobic and
      resistance combined training.

      Forty adults that underwent BS (sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass) were invited to
      participate in the study along two years (between 1-4 patients per month). After the initial
      interview, two patients refused to participate in the study. The participants provided
      written informed consent before starting the study. The study was approved by the Ethics
      Committee of the University in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were
      divided into two groups (experimental, EG; and control, CG) depending on when the BS was
      performed. The first 10 patients of each year were the EG (n=19) and the other mine patients
      were the CG (n=19). A 6-month supervised and individualized program that combined aerobic and
      resistance training (CART) was only conducted with the EG. Both groups followed a nutritional
      supervision and were evaluated in 3 different time periods: Test 1 (T1), before the
      intervention period (approximately 1 month after BS) with no differences in any variable
      measured; Test 2 (T2), after the intervention period (7 months after BS) and Test 3 (T3) to
      evaluate a retention period (13 months after BS). The tests included in the evaluation were:
      blood sample, body composition, blood pressure, physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness,
      isokinetic and isometric strength measures of the lower limbs) and CVR. The test protocols
      were divided into 3 days: 1) between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM., a blood sample was collected. 2)
      24 hours after, at the same hour, body composition and resting blood pressure were measured.
      In the afternoon (between 5:00 P.M. and 8:00 P.M.), muscle strength measures were obtained.
      3) at least 72 hours after the second testing session day, a cardiorespiratory fitness test
      was performed. Body composition, blood pressure and strength and cardiovascular tests were
      conducted at the facilities of the Sports Research Centre (Elche, Spain), in a climatically
      controlled laboratory, with a temperature between 22-24º and relative air humidity between
      45-60%. Before any testing, all participants attended two familiarization sessions to
      introduce testing procedures and minimize the learning effects over the measures

    <description>The maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) was determined indirectly following the protocol previously published (YMCA) on a cycle ergometer (Technogym Bike Med, Technogym, Gambettola, Italy). The VO2max was calculated using the following formula: VO2max (ml·Kg-1·min-1) = 1.8 *(6.12 * Wpeak) / BW + 3.5 + 3.5 (in which &quot;BW&quot; is body mass in kilograms and &quot;Wpeak&quot; is the power output in watts). Additionally, VO2max was expressed in absolute values (VO2max abs), relative to FFM (VO2max/FFM) and relative to each individual's body weight (VO2max/BW). A digital sphygmomanometer (Tango+, Suntech, USA) was used for the assessment of blood pressure and an electrocardiogram was also administered. An experienced exercise physiologist together with a cardiologist supervised all the cardiorespiratory tests.</description>

    <description>Participants performed 3 sets of 4 concentric contractions (flexion-extension) of lower body (knee), at an angular speed of 60º/s, with 90 s rest between repetitions. The knee motion ranges were within 105° to 10°. The participants were verbally encouraged to perform and maintain maximal effort in every contraction. The peak torque (N·m) of each set was analyzed and the average of the last three sets was calculated. Additionally, the peak torque was normalized to the individual's body weight (N·m·kg-1∙100) and relative to FFM (N·m·FFM-1∙100).</description>

    <description>Participants completed four repetitions of a Maximum Voluntary Contraction trial (15 s rest between repetitions), during which they were verbally encouraged to perform a maximal effort for 5 s. The first repetition was a submaximal familiarization trial. The angles used for assessing quadriceps and hamstrings were of 105º and 75º, respectively. As there was one set per exercise, the peak torque (N·m) was analyzed and normalized to each participant´s body weight (N·m·kg-1∙100) and individual FFM (N·m·FFM-1∙100).</description>
