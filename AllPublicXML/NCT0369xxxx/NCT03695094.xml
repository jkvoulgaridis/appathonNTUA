  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of stable coadministered oxcarbazepine
      (OXC), on the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability of padsevonil (PSL) and the plasma
      PK of PSL metabolites, UCB1431322-000 and UCB1447499-000, in study participants with epilepsy
      compared with study participants co-medicated with stable doses of levetiracetam (LEV),
      lamotrigine (LTG) or brivaracetam (BRV) therapy.
