  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether photobiomodulation therapy improves muscle endurance and
      decreases inflammation in persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. We will also
      investigate mechanisms for any improvements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) MS commonly experience muscle weakness and fatigue which
      may contribute to the commonly reported symptomatic fatigue. Photobiomodulation therapy
      (PBMT) induced with light in the visible red to near infrared (VIS/NIR) region of the
      spectrum (600-1000 nm) can stimulate cytochrome c oxidase and improve mitochondrial function.
      PBMT is an emerging therapeutic modality for soft tissue injury, chronic inflammation,
      neurodegeneration , and retinal diseases. PBMT has also been used to enhance muscle
      endurance, strength and recovery in healthy adults. We propose that in persons with MS, PBMT
      will 1) enhance regional muscle endurance after acute treatment and 2) enhance functional
      endurance after extended treatment. We will also test to determine if improvements are due to
      central or peripheral neuromuscular or cardiovascular mechanisms. Final, we will explore if
      regional PBMT can result in systemic anti-inflammatory effects.
