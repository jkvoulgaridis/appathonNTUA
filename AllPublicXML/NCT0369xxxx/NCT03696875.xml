      Objectives: To demonstrate the efficacy of care transition holistic intervention (Multilevel
      Guided Discharge Planning, MGDP) in reducing 30-day adverse outcomes among frail older
      patients with acute heart failure (AHF) discharged from Emergency Departments (EDs) and to
      validate the results of MGDP in real life.

      Method: Investigators will select frail patients ≥70 years with primary diagnosis of AHF
      discharged from EDs. The intervention will consist of MGDP implementation: 1) checklist that
      includes clinical recommendations and resources activations; 2) scheduling of early visit
      with the specialist; 3) communication with primary care; 4) providing a written instruction
      sheet to patient or caregiver. Phase 1: matched-pair cluster randomized clinical trial. EDs
      were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 10) or control (n = 10) group. Investigators
      will compare the outcomes between intervention and control groups. Phase 2: a
      quasi-experimental study. The 20 EDs will carry out the intervention. Investigators will
      compare the outcomes between phase 1 and phase 2 of intervention group and between phase 1
      and phase 2 of control group. The main outcome is a 30-day composite endpoint (ED revisit or
      hospital admission for AHF and cardiovascular death) after being discharged.

    <description>EQ-5D measures of health-related quality of life. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.</description>
