    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of STABLOR® consumption on
      visceral fat mass compared to placebo, in persons with metabolic syndrome during 12 weeks of
      consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is expected that the food product STABLOR will reduce visceral fat mass in subjects with
      metabolic syndrome and therefore will improve cardiometabolic risk factors. The aim of the
      current study is to assess the impact of a 12-week intake of STABLOR, compared to a placebo,
      on visceral fat in patients with metabolic syndrome. The primary objective of the study is to
      assess the efficacy of 12-week STABLOR® consumption on visceral fat mass compared to placebo,
      in persons with metabolic syndrome. The Secondary outcomes include Anthropometric
      measurements and body composition, metabolic syndrome status, STABLOR® metabolism,
      Cardiovascular biomarkers, Systemic inflammation, Quality of life and Behavior.
