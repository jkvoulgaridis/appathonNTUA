    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the long-term
      safety and efficacy of fenebrutinib in participants with Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)
      who have completed the treatment period in a fenebrutinib CSU parent study. Participants may
      enroll in this OLE study at any time after completing the treatment period of the parent
      study. Participants will receive open-label fenebrutinib at a dose of 200 milligram (mg)
      orally twice a day. Treatment may continue until the end of the study.

             determined by the investigator or Medical Monitor

          -  For participants receiving treatment with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2-receptor
             antagonists (H2RAs), agreement to maintain treatment at a stable dose for the first 12
             weeks of the study

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study or within

          -  Any significant changes (e.g., events, changes in medication) occurring after
             completion of participation in the parent study that, in the investigator's judgment,
             would increase the risk of adverse events in this OLE study
