  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor treatment may benefit patients with endometrial
      cancer (EC) based on the following observations: 1) an overwhelming presence of PD-1 in ECs;
      2) the well-known effect of obesity which activates pro-inflammatory white blood cells and
      promotes the development of ECs; and 3) the high prevalence of a specific gene pattern (ie,
      microsatellite instability hypermutated [MSI high]) among ECs that may be particularly
      sensitive to this class of drugs. To identify potential biomarkers of response to PD-1
      inhibitors in EC, we will conduct a window of opportunity study of pembrolizumab in 20
      patients with clinical stage 1, grade 3 EC, encompassing endometrioid, serous and clear cell
      histologies. Eligible patients will undergo a research biopsy for collection of fresh tissue
      at the time of enrollment, in addition to the routinely performed endometrial biopsy that led
      to the diagnosis of their cancer. Patients will receive a single dose of pembrolizumab (200
      mg IV) prior to undergoing their scheduled hysterectomy with surgical staging three weeks
      later. As per standard of care, adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin will be
      recommended after hysterectomy/surgical staging for women with endometrioid tumors and stage
      III disease or women with serous/clear cell tumors at all stages of disease. However, in this
      study pembrolizumab will be added to adjuvant paclitaxel and carboplatin for EC.
      Pre-treatment endometrial biopsy specimens (fresh frozen tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin
      embedded (FFPE)) and a post-treatment hysterectomy specimen (fresh frozen tissue and FFPE)
      will be collected for translational studies. Blood, fecal and vaginal samples will be
      collected pre-treatment, at the time of surgery and following 3 cycles of adjuvant
      pembrolizumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment.

      The primary objective of the trial is to measure the change in number and phenotype of
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including delineation of effector and regulatory T cells,
      before and after one cycle of pembrolizumab treatment. Other correlative secondary objectives
      include investigation of associations among pre-treatment TIL numbers, clonality of TILs and
      change in number and phenotype of TILs with samples collected after pembrolizumab treatment
      between MSI and DNA polymerase (POLE) ultramutated ECs versus MSI low/stable ECs versus copy
      number high (CNH) ECs, among others. To assess the complex interplay between obesity,
      molecular subtype, the microbiome and immune regulation, gut, vaginal and uterine microbiota
      profiles will be characterized and potential associations with body mass index (BMI),
      pre-treatment TIL numbers, clonality of TILs and change in the number and phenotype of TILs
      will be investigated. Secondary clinical objectives include (1) of the pathologic response
      rate after one cycle of pembrolizumab following hysterectomy and surgical staging in stage
      I/II, serous/clear cell EC and stage III, G3 (serous, clear cell or endometrioid histologies)
      EC and (2) characterization of the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab pre-hysterectomy and in
      combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin as adjuvant therapy for EC.
