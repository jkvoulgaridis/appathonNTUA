  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no consensus on the adequate concomitant treatment to apomorphine pump in
      Parkinson's disease (PD). In practice, some centers withdraw all dopaminergic agonists when
      initiating apomorphine pump therapy, whereas others combine the two. To date, there has been
      no study led to determine the best strategy for efficiently treating motor and nonmotor
      symptoms, as well as improving patients' quality of life (QoL). This preliminary study,
      entitled AGAPO, aims at identifying significant differences in patients' evolution (nonmotor
      symptoms and quality of life), over a course of 6 months, depending on the two strategies
      adopted in French centers (apomorphine pump with or without dopaminergic agonists), through
      the Non Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS, Chaudhuri et al, 2017).

      The recruitment period will be 24 months. The duration of the study will be 6 months for each
      patient due to adjustments of apomorphine pump parameters and oral medication as well time
      needed for motor and nonmotor changes to develop and influence QoL.

      This study will be done without any modification of the planned treatment plan for each
      patient included. The treatments are administered in accordance with their marketing
      authorization and according to the usual practices of each center. No additional visits are
      expected.

    <measure>Difference in the Non Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) between the Baseline assessment and the assessment at 6 months' follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) measures the frequency and severity of a range of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease, through 30 questions grouped into 9 domains: cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, gastro-intestinal tract, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous (pain, taste/smell, weight change, excessive sweating). Severity is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Frequency is rated on a scale from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent). Item scores are calculated as the product of severity and frequency; the total score is obtained by summing the item scores. The NMSS total score ranges from 0 to 360 with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms (reduced score).</description>

    <measure>Change in the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ39) between the Baseline assessment and the assessment at 6 months' follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39): the 39-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is a commonly used measure of self-appraisal in PD. It is a measure of health status and quality of life, by assessing difficulties in 8 dimensions of daily living: mobility (10 items), activities of daily living (6 items), emotional well-being (6 items), stigma (4 items), social support (3 items), cognition (4 items), communication (3 items) and bodily discomfort (3 items). The frequency of each event is determined by selecting one of 5 options: never (scored 0) / occasionally (scored 1) / sometimes (2) / often (3) / always (4). Each dimension total score range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting better quality of life.</description>

    <description>The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is the standard validated tool for the assessment of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This combined scale includes subsections collecting data regarding: nonmotor experiences of daily living (part I), their motor experiences of daily living (part II) an examination of the motor features of PD (part III), and motor complications arising from the use of dopamine replacement (part IV). The Part I include 13 items (6 semistructured interview items and 7 self‐reported items) scored on a scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Higher scores reflect worse condition.</description>

    <description>The Lille apathy rating scale (LARS) is a measure of apathy through nine domains (each corresponding to a clinical manifestation of apathy: everyday productivity, interests, taking the initiative, novelty seeking, motivation - Voluntary actions, emotional responses, concern, social life &amp; self-awareness) and 33 queries. The interview is structured, with a precise scoring mode for each reply (-2 to 2); when an item does not apply to the patient or the reply cannot be classified, it is scored &quot;0&quot; (for non-applicable and/or non-classifiable) The scale's overall score ranges from -36 to +36, with highest scores reflecting apathy severity. 4 factorial sub-scores (intellectual curiosity, emotion, action initiation and self-awareness) are calculated from sub-scale scores.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline in hyper and hypo dopaminergic symptoms scores will be assessed through the Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease (ASBPD). It is designed for assessing mood and behavior with a view to quantifying changes related to Parkinson's disease, to dopaminergic medication, and to non‐motor fluctuations. Its 21 items address nonmotor symptoms and are grouped into four dimensions: general psychological assessment, apathy, nonmotor fluctuations and hyperdopaminergic behaviors, with a 5-point rating scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Severe). A score ≥ 2 is considered as a warning sign.</description>
