  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, residents commonly experience dehydration and poor nutrition during nighttime duty
      hours as a result of heavy work load, lack of time to take nutrition and hydration breaks, or
      limited or no access to healthy food and drinks which may affect residents' work performance.
      The goal of this study is to compare the effects of two different meal compositions with no
      typical dietary practices (existing conditions) on work performance of the on-call residents
      during night shifts.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of dietary modifications on resident
      physicians' work performance during night shifts.

      Specific objectives are:

        1. To assess the effects of macronutrient composition of the test meals on cognitive
           performance, self-reported sleepiness and fatigue of resident physicians during
           night-time duty.

        2. To compare to no intervention, the effects of providing meals before 22:00 hours, and
           only providing chewing gum, tea, coffee and water onwards to on-call residents, on
           cognitive performance, self-reported sleepiness and fatigue of resident physicians
           during night-time duty.

There are two possible combinations and the order will be randomized using a computer-generated random-number sequence. There will be at least a 24-hour wash-out period between study nights to minimize the carry-over effects of the cross-over design as well as learning effects of the computerized cognitive tests.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Motor Praxis scores between conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>Two time points (beginning and end of night shifts) on each night for a total of 3 nights</time_frame>
    <description>Motor Praxis is a validated neurocognitive test that assesses sensory-motor speed. This test takes approximately 30 seconds to complete and will be measured at two time points (beginning and end of each night shift) in each of the 3 conditions . Differences in accuracy (percentage of correct responses, a higher percentage is better), duration (in milliseconds, lower duration is better), reaction time (in milliseconds, lower reaction time is better) and composite scores (0-1000, higher score is better) will be reported and compared.</description>

    <time_frame>Two time points (beginning and end of night shifts) on each night for a total of 3 nights</time_frame>
    <description>Fractal 2-Back is a validated neurocognitive test that assess working memory. This test takes approximately 2 minutes to complete and will be measured at two time points (beginning and end of each night shift) in each of the 3 conditions. Differences in reaction time (in milliseconds, lower reaction time is better) , accuracy (percentage of correct responses, a higher percentage is better) and composite scores (0-1000, higher score is better) will be reported and compared.</description>

    <description>Balloon Analog Risk is a validated neurocognitive test that assess risk decision making. This test takes approximately 2 minutes to complete and will be measured at two time points (beginning and end of each night shift) in each of the 3 conditions. Differences in risk propensity (higher scores indicative of greater risk-taking propensity), duration (in milliseconds, lower reaction time is better) and composite scores (0-1000, higher score is better) will be reported and compared.</description>

    <description>Psychomotor vigilance test is a validated neurocognitive test that assess vigilant attention. This test takes approximately 3 minutes to complete will be measured at two time points (beginning and end of each night shift) in each of the 3 conditions. Differences in reaction time (in milliseconds, lower reaction time is better), lapses (number, less is better) and composite scores measured (0-1000, higher score is better) will be reported and compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Degree of sleepiness between conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>Two time points (beginning and end of night shifts) on each night for a total of 3 nights</time_frame>
    <description>Will use validated Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) developed by William C. Dement, M.D., Ph.D. SSS a self-rating scale used to quantify progressive steps in sleepiness at a certain point in time. It is a seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from &quot;feeling active, vital alert, or wide awake&quot; (score = 1) to &quot;no longer fighting sleep, sleep onset soon and having dream-like thoughts&quot; (score = 7). Selected scores by the participants will be reported each time. This test takes approximately 15 seconds to complete. Differences in degree of sleepiness measured at two time points (beginning and end of each night shift) in each of the 3 conditions will be reported and compared.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Work Exhaustion between conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>Two time points (beginning and end of night shifts) on each night for a total of 3 nights</time_frame>
    <description>Work Exhaustion scale, developed and modified by Mickey Trockel MD, PhD, to explore the degree of work related fatigue in residents and fellows. It has 4 questions with a 5 point Likert scale ranging from not at all to extremely. This test takes approximately 30 second to complete. The total score is the average scores of the 4 items and falls between 0 and 4. Scores equal to higher than 1.33 indicate work-related fatigue. Differences in Work Exhaustion scores measured at two time points (beginning and end of each night shift) in each of the 3 conditions will be reported and compared.</description>
