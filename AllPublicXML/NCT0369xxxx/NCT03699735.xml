  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A methodical evaluation of sound changing principles in CE-labelled Sonova brand hearing
      instruments (e.g. Phonak hearing instruments) is intended to be conducted on hearing impaired
      participants. These sound changing principles are enabled by respective hearing instrument
      technologies and hearing instrument algorithms. The aim of the study is to investigate and
      asses strength and weaknesses of these sound changing principles in terms of hearing
      performance to determine their application in hearing instruments (Phase of development).
      Objective laboratory measurements will be carried out. This will be a controlled, single
      blinded and randomised active comparator clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono
      centric at Sonova AG Headquarter based in Stäfa

    <description>Device: Hearing Aid beam former principle_A (simulation of real ear condition). Each participant will be fitted with the 3 different beam former (directionality change) principles on the same hearing aid, saved to 3 manual programs. Beam former principle is a sound processing algorithm to focus to a target source in a noisy situation to improve the speech intelligibility and comfort. The experimental conditions vary in their parametrization to result in different degrees of beam forming and good speech quality.</description>
