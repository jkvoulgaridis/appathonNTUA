  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemocoagulation management in perioperative bleeding is nowadays based on standard
      coagulation testing: activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT),
      fibrinogen, D-dimers, platelets. An interest about viscoelastic coagulation testing methods
      is rising - use of rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is mentioned in the newest European
      guidelines for hemostasis management. ROTEM has more advantages then standard tests. However,
      both tests have only grade 1C recommendation, and most of trials have been done on adults.
      The goal of the study is to compare a relationship between standard tests and ROTEM in
      pediatric patients in perioperative period to find out which test has better correlation with
      clinical status, to compare therapeutic strategies and time necessary for gain both of tests
      and to compare the difference in blood loss and blood products consumption in group treated
      by ROTEM versus standard tests. Reduced blood loss and amount of blood products transfusion
      is expected to be found in ROTEM group, representing lowering risk for the patient, all due
      to early evaluation of hemocoagulation and targeted therapy guided by ROTEM.

      Pediatric patients who underwent spine surgery (under 18 years old) will be recruited in our
      study.

      Retrospective data will be analysed from these patient who underwent scoliosis surgery before
      ROTEM implementation to daily practice and after ROTEM implementation do daily practice in
      our department.

      Time to available results of ROTEM versus aPTT/PT tests will be compared. Blood loss and
      blood products used in these both groups will be analysed and compared between 2 groups.
