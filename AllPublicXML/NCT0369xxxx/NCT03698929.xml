  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Physicians Committee is carrying out a research study to improve the investigator's
      understanding and expand the literature to quantify the effect of foods on blood cholesterol.
      This study will measure changes in low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration, sometimes
      called &quot;bad cholesterol,&quot; over 2 study periods of 4 weeks each, with 1 rest week in between.
      Approximately 50 subjects will participate in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 9-week double-blind, crossover trial, participants will consume baked goods with either
      2 egg yolks or an isocaloric egg-free product daily for 4 weeks. After a one-week washout
      period, participants will cross to the other dietary intervention. Participants will be asked
      not to make changes to their exercise patterns or diet, apart from consuming the provided
      products, for the study period. Changes in LDL cholesterol concentrations will be the primary
      dependent variable.

      Study evaluations, known as health assessments, will be held at the Physicians Committee's
      office.

      Group assignment: After the study entry, will be assigned by chance, like the flip of a coin,
      to one of two groups. The participant will have an equal chance of being assigned to either
      group. Each group will be asked to consume baked goods daily. The two groups will consume the
      same baked goods, but in a different order. The baked goods will be made from wheat flour
      with a small amount of sugar, salt, yeast, and other ingredients that are common to baked
      goods. There will be no animal-derived ingredients, except that some products will contain
      egg. Each week, the participant will be given a week's worth of baked goods.

    <description>In a randomized, 9-week crossover trial, we will test the effects of dietary cholesterol in individuals without baseline cholesterol intake through two 4-week dietary intervention periods, using baked goods containing egg yolks or egg-free baked goods. During the egg phase participants will consume two egg yolks a day for four weeks. Each week, participants will be given a week's worth of baked goods containing two egg yolks each.</description>
