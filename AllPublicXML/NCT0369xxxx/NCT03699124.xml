  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 multicenter trial to evaluate safety and immune response of three
      consecutive production lots of freeze-dried (FD) MVA-BN smallpox vaccine. The vaccine will be
      given to healthy subjects who do not have a smallpox scar.

      Approximately 1110 subjects will be randomly enrolled into one of three groups:

      Group 1 will include 370 subjects, who will receive two separate injections (shot) with a
      short needle, given below the skin of the upper arm with 0.5 mL FD MVA-BN (Lot 1).

      Group 2 will include 370 subjects, who will receive two separate injections (shot) with a
      short needle, given below the skin of the upper arm with 0.5 mL FD MVA-BN (Lot 2).

      Group 3 will include 370 subjects, who will receive two separate injections (shot) with a
      short needle, given below the skin of the upper arm with 0.5 mL FD MVA-BN (Lot 3).

      The primary objective of the trial is to show that the immune response elicited (produced) by
      three consecutively produced MVA-BN lots are statistically (numerically) comparable.

             acceptable method of contraception during the trial, and must avoid becoming pregnant
             for at least 28 days after the last vaccination. A woman is considered of childbearing
             potential unless post-menopausal (defined as ≥ 12 months without a menstrual period)
