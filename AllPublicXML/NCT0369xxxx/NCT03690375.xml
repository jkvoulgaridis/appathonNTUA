  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There will be five subjects, each with at least one ecchymotic lesion on each arm measuring
      at least one cm, who will be randomized to undergo 4 Sciton Broad Band Light (BBL) treatments
      on either their left or right arm one week apart followed by 4 treatments of both BBL and
      radiofrequency microneedling (RFM) on the opposite arm 2 weeks apart. Subjects will fill out
      questionnaires, have pictures of their lower arms taken, and will be graded and measured by
      evaluators regarding the number and size of their ecchymoses as well as side effects such as
      blistering, pain, erythema, and swelling. One day after their 4th treatment on each arm,
      subjects will have biopsies done to be analyzed for changes in histology and gene expression.
      The subjects will follow up 1 month and 3 months after their last treatments for final
      pictures of their lower arms and evaluations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, prospective, split-arm clinical study in which 5 subjects will
      be randomized to which arm will be treated with Sciton's BBL only and the other arm will be
      treated with both Sciton's BBL and Cutera's RFM.

      All subjects will have their arms shaved prior to the procedure and cleaned thoroughly with
      alcohol. After the procedure a zinc-based sunscreen will be applied to both arms.

      Before each of the four treatments, 1 month, and 3 months after the last treatment, the
      subjects' number and square area of ecchymoses will be measured by an evaluator and
      photographs will be taken. Side effects will be measured the same day as the treatment as
      well as 1 day, 2 days, 7 days, and 14 days after the first treatment

      A final assessment will be done by taking two skin biopsies from the subjects with sterile
      instruments, one on treated skin and one on untreated skin. The skin specimens will be
      bisected and one half will be submerged immediately in 10x volumes of formalin while the
      other half of the biopsy will be submerged immediately in 10x volumes of RNAlater (Thermo
      Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). These specimens will then be coded and sent to blinded
      evaluators that will embed half in paraffin sections and then stain them with hematoxylin and
      eosin (H&amp;E), von Giesen and or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS).

      Epidermal thickness will be measured on H&amp;E-stained sections using the AxioVision image
      analysis software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY). The epithelial thickness may vary
      from area to area within the biopsy. The thickness of the epithelium in µm will be measured
      at 6 points in each biopsy and averaged. Von Giesen-stained sections will be examined for
      elastosis, and PAS-stained sections will be examined for collagen.

      Total RNA will be extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and
      the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA will be reverse transcribed using qScript™
      cDNA Synthesis Kit (QuantaBio, Beverly, MA). Real-time qPCR reactions will be carried out
      using PerfeCTa SYBR® Green SuperMix (QuantaBio, Beverly, MA) in triplicates. Gene expression
      levels will be normalized to a housekeeping gene, and analyzed using t test of means and SEM.
      Potential analysis include various biomarkers for dermal remodeling (e.g., collagen type I,
      elastin), epidermal differentiation (e.g., keratin 1, filaggrin), and vascular changes (e.g.,
      endothelin, Ang).
