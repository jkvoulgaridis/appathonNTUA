  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is essential for return of spontaneous
      circulation (ROSC) in patients with cardiac arrest. However, some factors are known to be
      related with delays in chest compressions such as bed transfer, setting of CPR device, pulse
      and rhythm checks. This study aims to evaluate the potential impact of ultrasound on CPR
      quality by using retrospective video analysis.

      All CPR scenarios in our department were recorded and masked for the purpose of video
      analysis. The investigators will record in-scene resuscitation manpower, the factors to
      interrupt chest compressions and whether introducing ultrasound into resuscitation process is
      related with delays in chest compressions. In addition, the investigators collect the
      patient's sex, age, initial rhythm and prognosis, including ROSC, survival to admission and
      survival to discharge.
