    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, controlled, adaptive phase II/III clinical study. The aim
      is to compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy of Docetaxel，Oxaliplatin combined with S-1(DOS) versus
      Oxaliplatin combined with S-1(SOX) in locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma

    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in patients with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. Eligible
      patients are randomized into two arms at 1:1 ratio to receive Docetaxel, Oxaliplatin combined
      with S-1(DOS) for 4 cycles or Oxaliplatin combined with S-1(SOX) for 3 cycles as neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. All eligible patients will receive D2 gastrectomy if possible. Then, all
      eligible patients will also received DOS for 4 cycles or SOX for 3 cycles within 8 weeks
      after surgery. Study evaluation time is until death of patients or deadline set by the
      researchers.
