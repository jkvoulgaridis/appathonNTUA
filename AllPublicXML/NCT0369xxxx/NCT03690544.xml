  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a pilot study using apremilast 30mg orally twice daily, for treatment of
      RAS in males and females between 18 and 70 years old.

      Subjects will be recruited from the clinical practice of the Department of Dermatology or
      Division of Rheumatology at Mayo Clinic Florida. Fifteen males and females with RAS will be
      enrolled.

      The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a 16 week treatment phase and an 8
      week posttreatment observational follow-up phase.

      The screening phase will consist of: obtaining informed consent, demographic information,
      medical history, inclusion and exclusion criteria, prior and concomitant medication use,
      adverse events; collecting vital signs and weight; performing complete physical examination
      and limited physical examination; obtaining hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis,
      pregnancy test and providing contraception education.

      During the 16-week treatment phase, all subjects receive apremilast.

      All subjects who complete the active treatment phase are to enter the 8-week posttreatment
      observational follow-up phase.

    <description>Apremilast is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 that works intracellularly to modulate a network of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. PDE 4 is a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-specific PDE and the dominant PDE in inflammatory cells. PDE4 inhibition elevates intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn down-regulates the inflammatory response by modulating the expression of TNF-alfa, IL-23, IL-17 and other inflammatory cytokines. Cyclic AMP also modulates levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Apremilast has immunomodulatory activity and, therefore, has the potential to be effective in the treatment of RAS.</description>
