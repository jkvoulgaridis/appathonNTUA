  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is believed that final glazing yields the most acceptable ceramic surfaces in terms of
      smoothness. However, since reglazing must be performed in a dental laboratory with the use of
      a thermal furnace, it requires multiple office visits. Repeated firings have a destructive
      effect on ceramic surfaces and can cause deformation. Conversely, polishing is easy and
      simple and can be accomplished in a single session.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients from 18-50 years old who are able to read and sign the informed consent
             document.

          -  Physically and psychologically able to tolerate conventional restorative procedures.

          -  Have no active periodontal or pulpal diseases, have teeth with good restorations.

          -  Patients have no temporomandibular disorders.

          -  Each participant needed a crown on either a first or second premolar or first or
             second molar in any arch.

          -  Teeth selected shoud include:

        restorability with a crown:root ratio of at least 1:1. presence of an opposing natural
        tooth which was non-restored or minimally restored.

        the presence of two non-restored or minimally restored teeth opposing each other on the
        same quadrants as the crowned tooth and the opposing to serve as enamel controls. Minimally
        restored was defined as teeth which have no restoration greater than a Class II amalgam
        restoration.

        - Willing to return for follow-up examinations and evaluation.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Patients in the growth stage with partially erupted teeth.

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Psychiatric problems or unrealistic expectations.

          -  Lack of opposite occluding dentition in the area intended for restoration.

          -  Patients with temporomandibular disorders.
