  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different clinical conditions can require urinary bladder augmentation or replacement. Tissue
      engineered bladder has been clinically evaluated but is not recommended due to diverse side
      effects. Thus, there is a real interest for the development of regenerative approach with
      innovative scaffolds and cell transplantation.

      The investigators propose the use of urothelial cells obtained by Trans-Urethral Resection of
      Prostate or bladder (TURP) to obtain a tissue engineered urothelium in association with
      different scaffolds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder biopsies will be obtained during cystoscopy, conserved in culture medium (DMEM®),
      digested by dispase and sowed on collagen-coated culture support. Keratinocyte Serum Free
      Medium (KSFM) will be used for proliferation. Microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RNA
      extraction, Reverse Transcription and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) will
      be performed during passages. Cell culture conditions will be optimized to improve
      proliferation and avoid loss of differentiation. The investigators will develop scaffolds
      based on sodium alginate hydrogels, followed by freeze-drying to generate porous sponges (at
      -20°C and -80°C). Cultured cells will be associated to these original scaffolds and to other
      scaffolds, for example alginate hydrogels or Collagen Cell Carrier (CCC), cultivated for 28
      days and analyzed. Histological and immunohistological appearance of cellularized scaffolds
      will be compared to assess the effectiveness of each scaffold for tissue engineering in
      urothelium.

      Cellularized scaffolds will be studied in vitro (Transepithelial Electrical Resistance,
      impermeability, ability to be stitched, resistance to urine) and in vivo in ectopic location
      (subcutaneous location in Nude mice) or in orthotopic location (bladder augmentation in small
      animal).

    <description>Transurethral resection of the prostate is a urological operation used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is performed by visualising the prostate through the urethra and removing tissue by electrocautery or sharp dissection with a resectoscope. This is considered the most effective treatment for BPH. This procedure is done with spinal or general anaesthetic. A triple lumen catheter is inserted through the urethra to irrigate and drain the bladder after the surgical procedure is complete. Outcome is considered excellent for 80-90% of BPH patients.</description>
