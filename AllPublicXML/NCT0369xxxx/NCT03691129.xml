    <description>Glycoproteins in human plasma are known to be deeply associated with multiple diseases, cell differentiation, aging, and etc.
The efficacy of elderly yoga will be assessed by identifying and comparing the number of glycoproteins in blood between before and after participation in an elderly yoga program for both the Advanced group and Beginner group.</description>
