  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the results of a deep learning approach to diabetic
      retinopathy assessment with results from (1) an in-person examination with an
      ophthalmologist, and (2) the assessments of optometrists involved in a teleretinal screening
      program.

      This study represents the third aim of a grant with five aims. The study will compare and
      evaluate the predictive accuracy of: (a) machine learning models developed to grade diabetic
      retinopathy and assess the presence or absence of diabetic macular edema and (b) the
      assessments of optometrist readers, both from digital retinal images, against standard of
      care dilated retinal examinations by board-certified ophthalmologists and/or
      retinal-specialty fellows for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a Los Angeles County reading
      center.

      For the study, the investigators will recruit 300-500 eligible diabetic patients for
      in-person eye examinations performed by board certified ophthalmologists and/or
      retinal-specialty fellows at Los Angeles County reading centers. The study will take place
      over the course of two visits: a teleretinal screening and an in-person eye examination.

      The in-person dilated eye examinations that the study participants will participate in and be
      compensated for follow the usual standard of care that patients receive in a setting that
      does not utilize teleretinal screening. Yearly dilated eye examinations are standard of care
      for all persons with diabetes.

        The study population comprises patients with Type I or Type II diabetes who are normally
        seen at LACDHS clinics and usually screened for diabetic retinopathy via teleretinal
        screening.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with Type I or Type II Diabetes

          -  Patients who are over the age of 18 years

          -  Patients who have not previously been seen in the current year by the LACDHS
             Teleretinal Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program and Reading Center

          -  Patients whose teleretinal screening exam images yield readable results

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under the age of 18 years

          -  Patients with gestational diabetes

          -  Patients who have previously been seen in the current year by LACDHS's Teleretinal
             Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program and Reading Center

          -  Patients whose teleretinal screening exam images do not yield readable results, as
             gradable images are needed for later comparison against ophthalmologist reads.

          -  Previously eligible patients who do not return for an in-person eye exam within 3
             months of receiving a teleretinal screening (In order for the results of the
             teleretinal screening and in-person eye examinations to yield similar information,
             patients who do not return for their in-person eye exam within 3 months of their
             teleretinal screening will not be able to remain in the study. This is because
             significant eye changes not documented by the teleretinal screening may occur after a
             3-month period).
