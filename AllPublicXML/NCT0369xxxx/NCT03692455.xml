  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that surgical techniques primarily designed for weight loss,
      ameliorates gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in morbidly obese patients.

      Therefore the present study intends to evaluate such impact on patients submitted to two of
      the most common techniques available, the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Vertical Sleeve
      Gastrectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to determine if weight loss surgeries do indeed ameliorate GERD in morbidly obese
      patients, esophageal syndromes will be evaluated following the Montreal Consensus, where
      troublesome symptoms were defined as score â‰¥ 2 on a validated questionnaire of symptoms for
      Portuguese language along with esophageal syndromes with injury assessed through upper
      endoscopy.

      Esophageal acid exposure will be determined through 24h pH monitoring. Increased acid
      exposure will be characterized when total esophageal pH &lt; 4 for at least 4% of its total
      monitoring time.

    <description>Prevalence of typical reflux syndrome as classified according to the Montreal Consensus.
This Consensus institutes that GERD can be outlined when troublesome symptoms and/or complications induced by reflux of the gastric content back to the esophagus are present.
In order to assess such troublesome symptoms a validated questionnaire translated into Portuguese language will be used.</description>

    <description>The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure involves creating a stomach pouch out of a small portion of the stomach and attaching it directly to the small intestine, bypassing a large part of the stomach and duodenum. Not only is the stomach pouch too small to hold large amounts of food, but by skipping the duodenum, fat absorption is substantially reduced.</description>

    <intervention_name>Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy</intervention_name>
    <description>VSG surgery restricts food intake and decreases the amount of food used. Most of the stomach is removed during this surgery, which may decrease ghrelin, a hormone that prompts appetite. Lower amounts of ghrelin may reduce hunger more than other purely restrictive surgeries, such as AGB.</description>
