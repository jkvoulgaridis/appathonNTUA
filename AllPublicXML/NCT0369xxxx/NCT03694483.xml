  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men over 50 years old in
      Western societies, with an incidence that is steadily increasing in most countries. The
      current, most commonly used biomarker for prostate cancer is prostate specific antigen (PSA),
      which has well known limitations in accuracy and requires additional testing. However,
      prostate cancer cells secrete exosomes, also known as prostasomes, which are only detectable
      in the blood of prostate cancer patients. The presence of prostasomes in the blood is in
      itself a prostate cancer diagnosis. However, the assay that has been designed for the
      purification of prostasomes requires additional testing for evaluating its robustness and
      usefulness in the clinical setting. Additionally, the evaluation of the cargo of the purified
      prostasomes may provide more information on the nature of the prostate cancer, which may help
      develop a molecular assay for a prostate cancer liquid biopsy rather than a tissue biopsy.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is two-fold: a validation phase where the purification
      of prostasomes will be tested on plasma collected from prostate cancer patients and a
      molecular testing phase where the contents of the purified prostasomes will be evaluated on
      their ability to determine the grade of the prostate tumors.

        All male patients with elevated PSA and suspected for prostate cancer or patients with
        diagnosed prostate cancer but prior to treatment will be invited to participate. Depending
        on the results from the diagnostic MRI-guided biopsy, participants will be assigned to
        either the control cohort (if biopsy is negative) or the patient cohort (if biopsy is
        positive).

             type of treatment

          -  Patients with another primary cancer within the past five years of prostate cancer
             diagnosis. However, superficial skin cancers such as basal cell or squamous cell
             cancers would not exclude a patient.
