      Background The progression and associations of central and peripheral musculoskeletal pain,
      frailty, disability and fracture risks are not well known. This study aims to characterise
      the development and progression of different frailty, pain and disability phenotypes and
      their individual associations.

      Methods A prospective cohort of 10000 people aged &gt; 18 will be recruited from general
      practice surgeries, secondary care and the general public. Data collection waves will be at
      baseline,and then annual follow-ups for up to five years. Data will be collected using a
      questionnaire asking about demographic characteristics, pain severity (0-10 scales), pain
      distribution (a pain Mannikin), pain quality (the McGill Pain Questionnaire), central pain
      (the CAP-Knee Scale), fracture risks (a modified version of the FRAX instrument), frailty
      (the Fried Criteria and the FRAIL scale) and disability (the FRAIL scale).

      Discussion Participant data will be analysed to determine phenotypic subgroups of frailty,
      pain and disability. Further to this, the progression of these characteristics and their
      influences upon health and wellbeing will be quantified.

        Participants will be recruited from a broad range of sources, including the community,
        primary and secondary care health services. Diverse recruitment pathways will enable
        enrichment of the cohort with participants from a range of backgrounds and suitable for a
        range of potential interventions aiming to reduce frailty, pain or disability. Participants
        may be recruited from GP surgeries, community based clinics, Musculoskeletal Pathway
        (Physiotherapy and occupational health clinics in primary care), hospital patient waiting
        lists, hospital outpatients' lists and physiotherapy services, or as participants from
        previous studies undertaken by the University of Nottingham or Nottingham University
        Hospitals NHS Trust who have expressed an interest in future research, and people who
        respond to online material.
