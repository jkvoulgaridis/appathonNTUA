  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combination treatment of Durvalumab with chemoradiotherapy is ongoing for head/neck cancer,
      renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer (NCT02318771) and pancreatic
      cancer (NCT02305186).Combining Durvalumab with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a promising
      strategy to improve clinical outcome in stage III lung cancer. Using serial biopsied and
      surgically resected fresh tissue through the novel/high-throughput RNA sequencing
      technologies, we want to identify the change immune signature in tumor microenvironment of
      NSCLC patients after Durvalumab treatment. With hypothesis that PD-1 inhibitor as a component
      of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery could increase complete pathologic
      response rate and disease free survival, and overall survival, we suggest adding Durvalumab
      to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in stage II/III resectable NSCLC. And with immune marker study
      using FACS, whole exome sequencing, or RNAsequencing, we can find the potential predictive
      biomarker for anti-PD-L1 blockade. And in this study, we can get &quot;whole&quot; surgical specimen
      not biopsy sample after Durvalumab treatment so the analysis for immune marker, tumor
      microenvironment, and various tumor infiltrating immune cells and their changes will be
      available.

Surgery Chest CT and/or PET CT with appropriate other diagnostic method (ex. Bronchoscopy) will be performed before surgery and type of surgery Follow-up period There is every 4 month visit with chest CT and abdominal CT is done at 1,2,5 post-op year. Other diagnostic method can be performed if indicated.</description>
