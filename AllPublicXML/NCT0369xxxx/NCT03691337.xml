  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of minimal-incision techniques for total hip arthroplasty (THA) with
      preservation of soft tissue is generally associated with reduction of postoperative pain and
      increased patient comfort. Although this technique requires a smaller incision than other
      approaches used for hip surgery, adequate postoperative pain management remains crucial for
      enhanced recovery and early rehabilitation. The fascia iliaca block (FIB) is commonly used to
      enhance analgesia after hip replacement surgery, however the effect of FIB volume on
      analgesia quality and sensory-motor blockade have not been adequately studied. In this study,
      total postsurgical opioid consumption (morphine equivalents IV in hospital and oral at home)
      through the first postoperative week will be compared and extent and duration of sensory
      motor block through the 2-day inpatient stay will be evaluated.
