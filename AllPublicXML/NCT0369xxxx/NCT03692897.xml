  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TARGET-HBV study engages an observational research design to conduct a comprehensive
      review of therapeutic outcomes for patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) who are currently
      taking tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) relative to those patients following other treatment
      regimens. The study will address important clinical questions regarding the management of HBV
      with TAF and other oral therapies by collecting and analyzing data from patients at academic
      and community medical centers. TARGET-HBV creates a robust database of real-world data
      regarding the natural history, management, and health outcomes related to TAF.

        The study will include adults who have a positive HBV diagnosis (currently HBsAg+) or are
        on antiviral therapy for hepatitis B as determined by the treating physician. The first
        cohort of participants to be enrolled are those with a medical history of tenofovir
        alafenamide (TAF) for HBV management. A cohort of additional adult patients treated with
        NAs who have not been exposed to TAF may also be enrolled, however this will occur in a
        subsequent phase of this study.
