  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LO MAPT is an 18-month, phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2 parallel
      groups trial, followed by a 18-month open-label extension phase, to evaluate the efficacy of
      omega-3 supplementation on cognitive decline in older adults with low DHA/EPA status and
      subjective memory complaints or family history of Alzheimer disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LO-MAPT will also assess the effect of an audiovisual aid, compared with traditional paper
      participant information sheet only, on participants' understanding of the protocol, as well
      as on drop-out, adherence and clinical outcome in older adults at risk of cognitive decline.
      In addition to the main LO-MAPT study procedures, in two centers, half of the subjects will
      receive an audiovisual aid in addition to the standard information sheet.

      The primary objective of LO MAPT is to demonstrate the efficacy of a 18-month intervention
      with a supplementation of omega-3 (DHA+EPA) on cognitive decline as measured by a composite
      score of neuropsychological assessments in older adults with low DHA/EPA status (RBC DHA/EPA
      index ≤ 4.83%) and subjective memory complaints or family history of Alzheimer's disease.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following 2 groups: (i)
      DHA+EPA supplement or (ii) placebo. A computer-generated randomisation procedure will be used
      with stratification by centre. A centralised Interactive Voice Response System will be used
      to identify which group to allocate and which lot number to administer. A document describing
      the randomization procedure will be kept confidentially by the Methodology and Data
      Management Centre. All participants and study staff will be blinded to DHA+EPA
      supplement/placebo assignment: all participants will receive soft capsules of exactly the
      same appearance and taste.

    <masking_description>This study will be a double-blind trial. The packaging, presentation, and labelling of products will ensure the blinding of both the medical team and the patient. The treatment arms in this study will be differentiated only by treatment numbers. Treatment arms will be allocated treatment numbers according to the previously established randomisation table.
Neither the investigating doctors nor the patients will be aware of the treatment arm to which the patients have been allocated until the end of the study.</masking_description>

    <description>This composite score will be built of Z-scores of these components. As this criterion will be assessed during each visit (the enrolment visit and the 4 follow-up visits), the analysis will be carried out by taking repeat measurements, taking the correlated of the data into consideration, evaluating Change from Baseline</description>

    <description>Tests included in the composite score will be analyzed independently The Free and Cued Selective Reminding test (FCSRT) is a memory test that controls attention and acquisition : Verbal learning with 16-word free and indexed recall test. Each word is identified by a semantic category. Word encoding is controlled. The total learning score is equal to the sum of the free and indexed recall. The maximum score is 48.</description>
