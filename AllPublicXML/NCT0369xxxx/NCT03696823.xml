      This prospective cohort study aims to assess feasibility and safety of the approach of
      critical view of safety during laparoscopic cholecystectomy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the introduction and routine use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the 1990s, the
      reported incidence of biliary injuries has doubled to 0.4%.

      Many factors have been shown to influence the risk of biliary injury including patient
      factors (obesity, older age, male gender and adhesions), local factors (severe gallbladder
      inflammation/infection, aberrant anatomy and haemorrhage) as well as surgeon experience.

      Identifying the common bile duct as the cystic duct is the commonest cause of major bile duct
      injury Active identification of cystic structures within Calot's triangle is the key to a
      reduction in biliary injury. Strasberg first coined the term 'critical view of safety' (CVS)
      in 1958 and this approach of identification of cystic structures has been adopted by many
      surgeons as the standard of operative technique to reduce the incidence of biliary injury.

      To fulfil the criteria for a CVS requires Calot's triangle to be cleared free of fat and
      fibrous tissue ('fat cleared'), for the lowest part of the gallbladder to be dissected free
      from the cystic plate ('liver visible') and for there to be only two structures entering the
      gallbladder ('2 structures').

      The published rate of bile duct injury with this approach is very low However more studies
      are needed to assess risk benefit rate of this approach.
