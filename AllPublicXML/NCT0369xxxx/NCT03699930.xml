  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one million people in the United States are living with aphasia, an acquired
      neurologic disorder affecting the ability to use and/or understand language. This
      communication impairment affects up to 40% of stroke patients. Stroke victims usually
      prioritize speaking, writing, and walking as the three most important rehabilitation goals,
      two of these goals therefore involving communication. Conventional speech therapy strategies
      have nevertheless limited effectiveness in post-stroke aphasia. Indeed, approximately half of
      those affected will remain in this state despite intensive speech therapy. Effective novel
      treatment is therefore warranted to improve recovery in these patients.

      A double-blind randomized controlled design will be conducted. Participants will randomly be
      assigned either to the tDCS group or to the sham (placebo) group. The only person knowing
      about this assignment will be the research coordinator. Both groups will include five
      consecutive days of 20 minutes session. Behavioral, EEG and DTI MRI data acquisition will be
      performed within a week before/after the tDCS/sham intervention. Behavioral measures will be
      performed again 3 months following tDCS/sham treatment to assess long-term benefits.

      Using a B-Alert wireless EEG system, the investigators will perform electrophysiological
      recordings and EEG resting state with eyes open. Each recording session should last less than
      an hour (including set up time). Fast and Fourier power spectrum analyses will be performed
      using EEGLAB.

      MRI scan will be acquired on the Siemens Magnetom Verio 3T at the Casa Colina Diagnostic
      Imaging Center using (i) T1-weighted (MPRAGE), and (ii) Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) in
      order to assess changes in terms of structural connectivity. Each recording session should
      last an hour (including set up time). Data will be analyzed in collaboration with Prof. M.
      Monti, UCLA Department of Psychology, using FMRIB Software Library (FSL).

      Behavioral assessment will be performed by a trained speech therapist and will include
      outcome measures such as the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
      (MOCA), the Communication Outcomes after Stroke (COAST), and the PROMIS Scale (v1.2 - Global
      Health). Each assessment session should last an hour. Behavioral data will be analyzed using
      SPSS.

      A follow up assessment will be performed by phone or in person 6 months after completion of
      the study using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSe). This interview should last around
      30 minutes.
