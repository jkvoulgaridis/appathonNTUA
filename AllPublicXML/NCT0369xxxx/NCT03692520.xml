      This open label, multicenter phase Ib study is designed to evaluate Objective Response Rate
      (ORR) in advanced solid tumors (gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer, hepatocellular
      carcinoma,pancreatic cancer,gallbladder cancer/bile duct cancer，renal cell carcinoma，ovarian
      cancer，or other advanced solid tumor) treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody SCT200.
