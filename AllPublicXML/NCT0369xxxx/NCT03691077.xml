  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocrelizumab is a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that showed in phase III trials a
      powerful effect on relapse rate and lesion load accumulation in the relapsing form of
      multiple sclerosis (RMS). This therapeutic agent also showed for the first time a significant
      reduction of disability progression in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS)
      patients, whereas all other anti-inflammatory drugs had failed to do so in well-conducted
      studies. This raises the possibility that ocrelizumab, beyond its effects on the adaptive
      immune system activation underlying white matter lesions and clinical relapses, could
      beneficially influence other mechanisms involved in the progressive phase of the disease,
      such as the innate immune microglial cells activation, that has been described to persist in
      a diffuse manner in the Central Nervous system (CNS). To date the activation of these cells
      is not accessible to classical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques, impeding the full
      investigation of the therapeutic efficacy of drugs such as ocrelizumab.

    <textblock>
      The first dose of ocrelizumab will be administered as two 300-mg IV infusions (600 mg total)
      in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride each separated by 14 days (i.e., Days 1 and 15), followed by
      one 600-mg IV infusion in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride every subsequent doses (i.e., every 24
      weeks) for 72 weeks.

      Premedication with 100 mg of methylprednisolone (or an equivalent) approximately 30 minutes
      prior to each ocrelizumab infusion and additional premedication with an antihistaminic drug
      (e.g., diphenhydramine) approximately 30 - 60 minutes before each infusion of ocrelizumab to
      reduce the frequency and severity of infusion-related reactions (IRRs). The addition of an
      antipyretic (e.g., acetaminophen/ paracetamol) may also be considered.

      Patients will undergo PET scan with 18F-DPA714 and MRI exams at different time points as
      mentioned in the assessment table.

      Disease will be clinically monitored at different time points with classical tests including
      EDSS, MSFC, BICAMS.

      Laboratory analyses on complete blood count, lymphocytes subsets count, neurofilament will be
      done. Analyses will not be limited to the above mentioned list.

      Pregnancy tests and genetics will be done. An optional lumbar puncture will be performed at
      baseline to assess cytokinic profile predictive of disease evolution and cortical pathology.
      Patients who refuse to have a lumbar puncture can be included in the clinical trial if they
      have eligibility criteria.

      TSPO polymorphism will be checked at baseline with other screening lab tests.

                  weeks

               7. Previous treatment with azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate

               8. Previous treatment with teriflunomide, unless an accelerated elimination
                  procedure is implemented before screening visit. Accelerated elimination
                  procedure after stopping treatment with teriflunomide:

                    1. cholestyramine 8g is administered 3 times daily for a period of 11 days, or
                       cholestyramine 4g three times a day can be used, if cholestyramine 8g three
                       times a day is not well tolerated,

                    2. alternatively, 50g of activated powdered charcoal is administered every 12
                       hours for a period of 11 days

               9. Previous treatment with natalizumab in the last 12 weeks

              10. Previous treatment with fingolimod or dimethyl fumarate if at baseline the
                  lymphocyte count is below lower limit of normality (LLN). Apart from the
                  lymphocytes count within normal ranges, 12 weeks of a washout period of
                  fingolimod or dimethylfumarate would be required before the start of ocrelizumab
                  administration

              11. History of recurrent aspiration pneumonia requiring antibiotic therapy

              12. Treatment with fampridine/dalfamipridine (Fampyra®)/Ampyra®) unless on stable
                  dose for ≥ 30 days prior to screening. Wherever possible, patients should remain
                  on stable doses throughout the 96-week treatment period

              13. Treatment with β interferons, glatiramer acetate, plasmapheresis, or other
                  immunomodulatory therapies within 4 weeks prior to baselinei

        Healthy volunteers:

          1. Inability to complete an MRI (contraindications for MRI include but are not restricted
             to weight ≥ 140 kg, pacemaker, cochlear implants, presence of foreign substances in
             the eye, intracranial vascular clips, surgery within 6 weeks of entry into the study,
             coronary stent implanted within 8 weeks prior to the time of the intended MRI,
             contraindication to acid gadoteric etc.)

          2. Impossibility to complete a PET scan: pregnancy, nuclear medicine irradiation in the
             year preceding baseline visit for clinical research

          3. Known presence of any neurological disorders

          4. Pregnancy or lactation

          5. Lack of peripheral venous access

          6. Significant, uncontrolled disease, such as cardiovascular (including cardiac
             arrhythmia), pulmonary (including obstructive pulmonary disease), renal, hepatic,
             endocrine or gastrointestinal infectious, neoplasic or any other significant disease
             that may preclude patient from participating in the study

          7. History of alcohol or drug abuse within 24 weeks prior to baseline

          8. TSPO polymorphism indicating a low affinity profile.

          9. Treatment with Flumitrazepam, triazolam, diazepam
