    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of imaging angle on the measurement of fetal
      cisterna magna (CM) in the second trimester.

      Fetal CM will be prospectively measured in women at 18-24.6 weeks' gestation. Measurements
      will be made on different angles between the transducer and fetal cerebellar axial plane with
      internal landmarks.

      Design: Observative, cross sectional

      Patients and methods: women with low risk single pregnancy will be studied. Fetuses with
      multiple pregnancies, maternal chronic disease and severe congenital anomalies except mega
      cisterna magna (MCM) will be excluded from the study. Measurements will be performed on the
      axial cerebellar plane.The anteroposterior measurement will be made between the posterior
      border of the cerebellar vermis and the internal face of the occipital bone.

      The primary outcome variables will be cisterna magna length measured on different angles
      between the transducer and the axial cerebellar plane of the fetal head.

      Cisterna magna length measurement related to fetal presentation and gender will be secondary
      outcomes.

    <description>The length measurement on the CM with an angle of 0° between the transducer and the axial cerebellar plane of the fetal head (midline structures will be perpendicular to the ultrasound beam). After that, CM will be measured again after moving the transducer approximately 30° towards the fetal occiput. Measurements of the anteroposterior diameter Will be obtained along straight lines between the posterior border of the cerebellar vermis and the internal face of the occipital bone.</description>

    <description>The length measurement on the CM with an angle of 0° between the transducer and the axial cerebellar plane of the fetal head (midline structures will be perpendicular to the ultrasound beam). After that, CM will be measured again after moving the transducer approximately 30° towards the fetal occiput. Measurements will be made in fetuses with cephalic and breech presentation. Another measurement will be made in fetuses with cephalic presentation that had converted to breech presentation or viceversa in less than 24 hours.</description>

    <description>The length measurement on the fetal cisterna magna (CM) with an angle of 0° between the transducer and the axial cerebellar plane of the fetal head (midline structures will be perpendicular to the ultrasound beam). After that, CM will be measured again after moving the transducer approximately 30° towards the fetal occiput.
Measurements will be performed on the axial cerebellar plane using internal landmarks including the cavum septi pellucidi, thalamus, third ventricle, cerebral peduncles and cerebellar hemispheres.The anteroposterior measurement will be made between the posterior border of the cerebellar vermis and the internal face of the occipital bone.
All the ultrasonography examinations were performed abdominally, using 3-5 megahertz (MHz) transducers.</description>
