    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of an intervention with galvanic
      electrical current on the number of attacks , temperature, pain, peripheral blow flow and
      upper limb functionality in patients with Raynaud's Phenomenon in comparison to a control
      group that will maintain their habitual treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Raynaud's Phenomenon is a disorder that causes pain and functional limitation in people who
      suffer it.

      Investigators considerer that the application of an electrotherapy intervention with galvanic
      current, thanks to its vasodilator action, will produce clinically significant improvements
      in the number of attacks, temperature and blood flow of patients with Raynaud's Phenomenon,
      which can lead to a decrease in pain associated, frequency and severity of ischemic attacks
      and therefore an improvement in the functionality of the upper limbs.

      The experimental group will receive an electrotherapy treatment using galvanic current. To
      apply the treatment, we will place the patient seated, with their hands inside two containers
      filled with water up to the limit of their nails without touching them. Next we will connect
      the electrodes and apply a galvanic current for 10 minutes, there will be a minute of rest
      for the patient while we change the polarity of this current and we will apply it another 10
      minutes. The intensity of the current depends on the threshold of the patient.

      The control group will maintain their usual conservative and pharmacological treatment
      without receiving electrotherapy
