  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some surgeries, such as tonsillectomies, are particularly painful postoperatively because
      they are not very accessible to a complementary technique of loco-regional anesthesia and
      require the use of opioids in the postoperative period.

      The use of opioids, in combination with usual analgesics, is common after this surgery.
      However, some risks are associated with the use of morphine in children, including more
      frequent respiratory distress, nausea and vomiting, and can cause hemorrhagic complications
      and lengthen the duration of hospitalization. Decreasing the consumption of morphine drugs is
      therefore a real challenge.

      Although there is no randomized controlled study on the use of standard analgesics with or
      without morphine to date, a number of studies suggest that the use of morphine should not be
      systematic after a surgery.

      The need for opioids after tonsillectomy as well as the level of pain vary between patients.
      Some teams use morphine at the end of general anesthesia to prevent pain on waking and others
      use it only if needed, once the child is awake.

      Pain assessment scales are used in the Post-interventional Monitoring Room (PIMR) to adapt
      these analgesic therapies according to the intensity of pain. One of the validated and
      frequently used scales in pediatric PIMR is FLACC (Face Legs Activity Cry Consolability).
      Monitoring tools are also available to evaluate the quality of intraoperative analgesia in
      unconscious children :

        -  the analysis of the pupillary variation in response to a painful stimulus by
           videopupillometry,

        -  and the ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) which consists of estimating the
           sympathetic-parasympathetic balance by a complex analysis of cardiac rhythm variability.

      These two types of monitoring could predict which children will require post-operative
      morphine treatment.

      To date, no study has demonstrated the relationship between videopupillometry and
      postoperative morphine consumption. The average ANI has already been evaluated in children as
      correlated with FLACC but both monitoring devices have never been compared for a predictive
      purpose.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of the PPI® (Pain Pupillary Index) scale of
      Algiscan® and the average ANI measured by the PhysioDoloris® monitor in children still
      sedated at the end of the intervention could have a prognostic value on post-operative
      morphine prescription.
