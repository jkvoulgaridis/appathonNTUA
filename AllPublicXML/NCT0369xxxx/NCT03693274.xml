  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study will be to determine the feasibility of utilizing a web-based
      mindfulness program in adult patients with chronic pain with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia or
      central sensitization.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain has a substantial economic cost and rate of impairment. Patients who suffer from
      fibromyalgia and other pain conditions leading to central sensitization have limited
      treatment options. The only medications currently approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of fibromyalgia includes pregabalin, milnacipran and
      duloxetine. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) also recommends the
      implementation of an exercise program and cognitive behavioral therapy. A previous
      meta-analysis found weak evidence to support Mindfulness-Based Stress Reductions (MBSR) in
      fibromyalgia patients, however more robust clinical studies are needed. In the midst of an
      opioid crisis, MBSR provides a safer alternative for the treatment of chronic pain.
      Unfortunately, an instructor lead MBSR program is both costly and largely unavailable in
      rural areas of the country. This web-based mindfulness program provides a treatment option
      for patients who would otherwise, not have access to alternative medicine therapies.

    <measure>Change in mean Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of mean score of FFMQ at baseline and 17 weeks of study participation. FFMQ is a self administered 39 item validated comprehensive instrument for assessing different aspects of mindfulness. Respondents rate statements according to how true the statement is to them on a scale of 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). Total scores are between 39 and 195 and higher scores indicate greater mindfulness.</description>

    <measure>Change in median Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems-29 (PROMIS_29) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of mean PROMIS-29 score at baseline and 17 weeks of study participation.
The PROMIS-29 (version 2) is a self administered validated instrument to assess seven health domains: physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain interference, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. Each of the seven domains has four questions which are scored on a five-point Likert scale. In addition, pain intensity is measured with a single item on an 11-point numeric scale (NPRS) that ranges from 0 to 10. A score of 50 points represents the population average for each scale, and 10 points represent one standard deviation. Higher scores mean more of the specific scale's construct, which may indicate a desirable or an undesirable outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of mean PCS score at baseline and 17 weeks of study participation. The PCS is measured with a self-administered questionnaire. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale is a 13-item inventory that measures 3 elements of the perception of the intensity of pain (rumination, magnification, feeling helpless). Participants indicate the degree to which they agree with statements related their pain by selecting 0 = not at all, 1 = to a slight degree, 2 = to a moderate degree, 3 = to a great degree, 4 = all the time. There are three subscale scores assessing rumination, magnification and helplessness. All subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating the participant is having more thoughts about the pain they feel helplessness. All subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating the participant is having more thoughts about the pain they feel.</description>

    <measure>Global Change</measure>
    <time_frame>17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Global change measured by Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). The PGIC evaluates aspects of patients health and assesses if there has been an improvement or decline. The patient reports change in activity limitations, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life on scale from 1 (No change) to 7 (a great deal better), and the degree of change on a scale from 0 (much better) to 10 (much worse).</description>
