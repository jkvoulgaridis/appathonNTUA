      Mucosal healing or histological remission is an important target for the treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, patients with mucosal healing are defined as a
      control group, observing their clinical outcomes for 3 years, and describing the recurrence
      rate. The secondary objective is to study the operative rate, glucocorticoid utilization
      rate, treatment escalation rate, hospitalization rate and incidence of related complications.
