  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This RCT is testing the efficacy of apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intubation in the
      emergency department. Currently the standard practice in the ED when performing endotracheal
      intubation is that some providers use apneic oxygenation (the application of a nasal cannula
      at 15LPM) throughout the intubation procedure, while others do not apply apneic oxygenation.
      Initial literature in the operating room showed that apneic oxygenation helps prevent
      desaturation during the procedure. However, the latest literature conducted in critical care
      settings (one study in the ICU and one in the ED) questions the efficacy of this intervention
      in critically ill patients; however, no harm has been shown. Our study aims to test this
      intervention further by adding in a special subset of patients that was excluded from prior
      studies, precipitous intubations, or those patients that have to be intubated quickly and
      cannot have adequate pre-oxygenation. We hypothesize that apneic oxygenation will be more
      efficacious in this subset than in the overall ED population. We will randomize patients
      requiring endotracheal intubation into intervention (apneic oxygenation) and control (no
      apneic oxygenation). We will measure the lowest arterial oxygen saturation from the start of
      the intubation procedure through 2 minutes after intubation is complete.
