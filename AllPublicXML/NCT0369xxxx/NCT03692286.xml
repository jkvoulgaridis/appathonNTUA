      To assess the Postoperative Pain after using Silver Nanoparticles with and without Calcium
      Hydroxide as an Intracanal Medication in Patients with necrotic pulp (RCT)

      When the treatment itself appears to initiate the onset of pain and/or swelling, the result
      can be very distressing to both the patient and the operator. Patients might even consider
      postoperative pain and flare-up as a benchmark against which the clinician's skills are
      measured. Prevalence of postoperative pain or flare-up is, therefore, one of the influencing
      factors when making a clinical decision. Better management of postoperative pain increases
      the patients' confidence in dentist's skills and gives positive attitude toward dental
      profession. In cases with necrotic pulp, the incidence of pain becomes higher, hence testing
      which intracanal medication is more effective in decreasing the bacteria present within the
      root canal and subsequently pain is crucial.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are free from any physical or mental handicapping condition with no
             underlying systemic disease.

          -  Non-pregnant females

          -  Asymptomatic necrotic mandibular single rooted teeth.

          -  Normal occlusal contact with the opposing teeth.

          -  Patients accepting to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medically compromised patients: Pain levels and healing following treatment would be
             compromised as these patients have shown higher incidence of pain and lower healing
             rate.

          -  Pregnant women: Avoid radiation exposure, anesthesia, and medication.

          -  If analgesics or antibiotics have been administrated by the patient during the past 12
             hours preoperatively might alter their pain perception

          -  Patients reporting bruxism or clenching: Avoid further pressure on an already inflamed
             tooth inducing subsequent irritation and inflammation Teeth that shows:

          -  Association with acute periapical abscess and swelling: Need special treatment steps
             which could involve additional visits with incision and drainage. Also, it could
             influence initiation and progression of postoperative pain.

          -  Greater than grade I mobility or pocket depth greater than 5mm. Need special surgical
             and/or periodontal therapy.

          -  No restorability: Hopeless tooth.

          -  Vital teeth

          -  Immature teeth

          -  Radiographic evidence of external or internal root resorption.

          -  Any criterion, not mentioned in the inclusion criteria
