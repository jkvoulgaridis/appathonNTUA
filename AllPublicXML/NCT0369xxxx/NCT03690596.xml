  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) will pilot test a personalized JITAI designed
      to guide delivery of fast acting nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; lozenge) in real-time, to
      prevent smoking relapse. Specifically, a smartphone application (app), will integrate
      pre-quit smoking data with objective location data captured via global positioning system
      (GPS) to establish relapse risk (hotspot) algorithms. During a quit attempt, the GPS-enabled
      app (QuitBuddy) will detect proximity to hotspots and deliver NRT prompts, all of which will
      occur automatically and prior to exposure. Thus, QuitBuddy will optimize NRT use to prevent
      cue-provoked cravings known to undermine sustained abstinence, thereby repurposing this
      evidence-based cessation medication to promote relapse prevention. QuitBuddy will be tested
      against standard care (NRT with brief instructions). Two versions of QuitBuddy will be
      tested, which will differ only in how hotspot algorithms are derived: retrospectively from
      locations recalled at the onset of a quit attempt (QuitBuddy-Recall) or based on real-time
      EMA completed pre-quit (QuitBuddy).

    <description>This smartphone app will identify high-risk situations through real-time EMA data collected before and during a quit attempt. One week of pre-quit smoking behaviors will be integrated with passively sensed GPS data to create hotspot maps. Hotspot maps will provide interactive visualizations of relapse risk. GPS triggered NRT/behavioral prompts will occur when participants come within 50m from the centroid of a hotspot.</description>
