    <measure>Change of the Subject's Target OA Knee Compared to the Baseline as Assessed by WOMAC</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) has been used to assess subjects with OA of the hip or knee and consists of 24 questions in subscales measuring 3 concepts: pain, stiffness, and physical function. These questions measure the amount of pain, degree of difficulty in completing various day-to-day activities, and stiffness experienced in the hip or knee. Usually subject self-administered. A single question has 100 grades, where 0 = very good and 100 = very much worse. VAS (visual analog scale) scale is used for score record.
Data for the exploratory efficacy endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
Safety analyses will be conducted on the SAS. Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics.</description>

    <description>A sensitivity analysis will also be conducted on the Primary Efficacy Endpoint using an ANCOVA with treatment as a fixed class effect and WOMAC baseline pain subscale score as covariates, but the comparisons of interest will be the difference between the active and placebo subjects within each treatment group.
The Secondary Efficacy Endpoints, change from Baseline in the WOMAC subscale scores for pain, stiffness, and functional ability, and overall WOMAC score, will be by analyzed using the same methods as the for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint.
Safety analyses will be conducted on the SAS. Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics, as appropriate. No formal statistical analyses are planned.</description>

    <description>The WOMAC pain subscale has 5 questions. Usually subject self-administered. A single question has 100 grades, where 0 = no pain and 100 = pain as bad as can be.
The Primary Efficacy Endpoint is change from Baseline in the WOMAC (VAS) pain subscale score for the target knee at week 2, 4, 8, and will be analyzed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Treatment will be included as a fixed class effect and WOMAC Baseline pain subscale score as covariates.</description>
