    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a continuous telephone follow-up study on subjects
      who had completed the one-year follow-up of the LAmbre™ left atrial appendage (LAA) system
      registration trial. The follow-up time was 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years after left
      atrial appendage closure operation, to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of
      LAmbre™ LAA Closure System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects who completed 1-year follow-up of the LAmbreTM LAA system registration trial
      will be conducted 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years follow-up by the telephone call.

      During the follow-up, the investigator or his/her designee will use a standardized form to
      record the occurrence of the subject's safety events and validity endpoint by telephone，and
      complete the safety and efficacy summary report. The endpoints of the study included compound
      events, MACCE events, stroke, haemorrhage and other events.
