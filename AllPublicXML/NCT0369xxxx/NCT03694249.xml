    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies the side effects of ifetroban in treating patients with malignant
      solid tumors that are at high risk of coming back after treatment and spreading throughout
      the body. Platelets are a type of blood cells that help with clotting. Cancer cells stick to
      platelets and ride on them to get to different parts of the body. Drugs, such as ifetroban,
      may help these platelets become less &quot;sticky,&quot; and reduce the chance of cancer cells
      spreading to other places in the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of ifetroban sodium (ifetroban) administration in
      patients with malignant solid tumors at high risk of metastatic recurrence, after completion
      of all planned (neo)adjuvant locoregional and systemic therapies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess rate of metastatic recurrence after completion of ifetroban in patients with
      malignant solid tumors.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantify pharmacodynamic markers of ifetroban effects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP 1 (IFETROBAN): Patients receive ifetroban sodium orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses
      repeat every 28 days for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP 2 (PLACEBO): Patients receive a placebo PO QD. Courses repeat every 28 days for 12
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then up to 12
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent.

          -  Subjects ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2

          -  Current diagnosis of any stage I to III malignant solid tumor at high risk of
             metastatic recurrence (deemed by treating physician as patients with ≥ 50% chance of
             cancer metastatic recurrence within 5 years of diagnosis)

          -  Patients must have completed all standard locoregional and systemic therapy for their
             cancer within 120 days of study enrollment.

          -  Administration of an investigational agent prior to enrollment needs to be completed
             at least 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Patients must have recovered (≤ grade 1 toxicities or grade 2 toxicities well managed
             with optimal medical care) from effects of local (surgery, radiation) or systemic
             treatments.

             throughout the trial.

          -  Re-enrollment of a subject that has discontinued the study as a pre-treatment screen
             failure (i.e. a consented patient who did not receive study drugs) is permitted. If
             reenrolled, the subject must be re-consented. Only the screening procedures performed
             outside of protocol-specified timing must be repeated.
