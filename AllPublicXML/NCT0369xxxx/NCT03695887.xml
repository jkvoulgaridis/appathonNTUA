  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improvements in burn care have resulted in increased survival. Despite these improved
      outcomes one of the leading challenges of burn care remains providing adequate analgesia
      during routine wound care and dressing changes. The traditional use of narcotics is
      challenging as the therapeutic window between analgesia and suppression of breathing becomes
      narrow with the intense pain and high doses of narcotics needed for dressing changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The normal challenges of using narcotics are increased in burn patients, who have
      significantly altered metabolism. Unfortunately, the use of regular general anesthesia or
      conscious sedation is not a viable option due to the resources required, and as the
      hypermetabolism of burn injury would result in compromised wound healing with repeated
      periods of without eating related halting of nutritional intake. This has led to the use of a
      number of adjuncts ranging from nonmedical (virtual reality, mindfulness, hypnosis etc.) to
      medication (ketamine, anxiolytics etc.). Historically Nitrous oxide has been used in similar
      settings where severe procedural pain is of relatively shorter duration, such as tooth
      extraction, labor or minor surgical procedures. Nitrous oxide is a rapidly acting analgesic
      that takes effect seconds after inhalation, and lasts minutes. While a randomized trial of
      Nitrous oxide in burn care has been proposed, the only published information currently
      available is in a Chinese medical journal.

      To address this a gap in knowledge, a pilot Randomized Controlled trial is proposed to
      evaluate if Nitrous Oxide in the form of limited dose inhaler canisters can be used to
      improve pain control during burn dressing changes compared to placebo canisters.

    <description>The experience of the dressing change for the patient will also be assessed using the Burn specific pain and anxiety scale which consists of:
Worry about wound-healing
Fear of procedural pain
Fear of losing control because of pain
Fear of pain during dressing change
Pain severity
Keyed up because of enduring pain
Concern about wound healing
Preoccupied with pain
Tension during dressing change
Responses for each item are on a visual analogue scale ranging from &quot;least&quot; to &quot;most&quot;. The response is normalized to a value between 0 and 1, representing the location selected on the line, divided by the total length of the line. The responses will be used to examine a possible relationship procedural and non procedural pain between the nurse and the patient.</description>
