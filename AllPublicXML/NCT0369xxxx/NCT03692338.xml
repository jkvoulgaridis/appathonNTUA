  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to report the effects of immediate or delayed exercise training on patients
      with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma who are receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise interventions also have been shown to improve both cancer- and treatment-related
      fatigue and quality of life across multiple tumor types. Thus, an exercise intervention could
      improve the tolerability of combination immunotherapy. Furthermore, functional capacity
      and/or amount of physical activity are associated with survival in several cancers. Finally,
      there is emerging evidence that exercise training may augment beneficial cancer-specific
      immune function. This study will examine parallel groups of supervised or semi-supervised
      exercise training or usual care in patients with mRCC treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab
      combination therapy. Fitness level will be evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise testing
      (CPET), wearable exercise tracking devices and questionnaires after 12 weeks of
      semi-supervised, home-based exercise.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will be asked to complete 3 30-minute supervised exercise sessions/week under the guidance of the study exercise physiologist. The preferred mode will be treadmill walking, however, alternatives such as cycling or stair climbing machines will be used. For these sessions, patients will be asked to wear a heart rate monitor. Following a 5 minute warm-up, the exercise physiologist will increase speed to correspond with an intensity of approximately 80% VO2peak for 1-minute before returning to a lower speed for 1-minute (50% VO2peak). Patients will complete up to 20 of each 1-minute interval, then cool-down for 5 minutes. At the end of each higher intensity interval patients will be asked to rate their perceived exertion (RPE).
Additionally, patients will receive standard of care nivolumab (3 mg/kg i.v.) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg i.v.) q3 weeks x 4 doses followed by nivolumab at 3 mg/kg q2 weeks.</description>

    <arm_group_label>12 week semi-supervised exercise program</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This cohort will complete 12 weeks of a semi-supervised exercise program independently. Patients will be scheduled for an exercise session with a study exercise physiologist during clinical appointments to complete a sample intensity and time specific exercise session. The preferred mode will be walking, however cycling is also permitted. For each session the patient will wear a heart rate monitor. Following a 5 minute warm-up, patients will increase the intensity of exercise to reach a heart rate corresponding to approximately 60% VO2peak, and will continuously maintain this intensity for their individualized duration to elicit the desired energy expenditure. Each week, the exercise physiologist will call the patient and discuss how to approach the next set of exercise sessions.
Additionally, patients will receive standard of care nivolumab (3 mg/kg i.v.) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg i.v.) q3 weeks x 4 doses followed by nivolumab at 3 mg/kg q2 weeks.</description>
