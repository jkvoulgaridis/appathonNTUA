  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the safety and effectiveness of giving rivogenlecleucel (BPX-501 T cells)
      to patients with AML or MDS post haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant compared
      to post-transplant cyclophosphamide.

    <textblock>
      In the Phase 2 portion, participants will undergo αβ T cell and CD19+ B cell depleted
      haploidentical HSCT followed by an infusion of a fixed dose of rivogenlecleucel (BPX-501 T
      cells) per kg. These participants will be evaluated for prespecified dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) for a 100-day dose limiting toxicity window.

      Following completion of the Phase 2 portion, participants will be enrolled and randomized to
      one of two treatment arms in the Phase 3 portion.

        -  Arm A:αβ T-cell and CD19+ B-cell-depleted haplo-HSCT plus treatment with
           rivogenlecleucel

        -  Arm B: haplo-HSCT plus post transplant cyclophosphamide

      Pediatric patients ages 12-17 will also be included in US only.
