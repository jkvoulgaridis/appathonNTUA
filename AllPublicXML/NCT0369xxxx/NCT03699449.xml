  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study of biomarker-driven targeted therapy in patients with
      platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. More specifically, this is a randomized,
      multi-center, open label, phase II study for Homologous Recombination Deficiency(HRD)+
      patients and a biomarker-driven multiple-arm phase II study for Homologous Recombination
      Deficiency(HRD)- patients.

      This study will consist of a number of study modules (substudies), each evaluating the
      antitumor activity of targeted agents in patients whose tumors express specific phenotype
      relevant to the molecules under investigation.
