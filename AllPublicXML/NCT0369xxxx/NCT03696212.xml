  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult participants diagnosed with NSCLC who have been
      previously treated for a minimum of 12 weeks with any PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor.
      This is a phase 1b/2, multi-center, open label study designed to assess safety and
      tolerability of grapiprant in combination with pembrolizumab, to determine the recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) with pembrolizumab, and to evaluate disease response with grapiprant
      based on investigator assessments. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and response biomarkers
      will also be assessed.
