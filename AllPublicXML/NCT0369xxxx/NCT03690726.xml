  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will investigate whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can
      be used to potentiate/prime spinal cord injured patients' nervous systems for more intense
      rehabilitation exercise of longer duration - thus leading to greater recovery of motion
      function. The technique, in which a magnetic coil is positioned above the scalp and forms a
      magnetic field that activates the desired center of the brain (eg motor cortex), is used in
      clinical practice for the treatment of a number of disorders. However, although a combination
      of rTMS and gait training in SCI patients previously has proven beneficial, it is unknown
      whether additional functional gains can be achieved by combining rTMS and supervised,
      high-intensity resistance training.

      In this project, 30 newly-admitted patients will be recruited and randomized to receive
      either active rTMS and strength training (n = 15) or sham (imitated) rTMS + strength
      training, in parallel with standard care. The investigators hypothesize that the active rTMS
      group will have superior gains in locomotor function and muscle mass, compared to the sham
      group.
