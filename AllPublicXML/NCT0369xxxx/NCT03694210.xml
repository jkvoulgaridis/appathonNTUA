      A prospective, single arm, open label, multi-center, trial to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the Interscope EndoRotor® Resection System in subjects requiring direct
      endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN) with walled off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN).

      A prospective, single arm, open label, multi-center, trial to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the Interscope EndoRotor® Resection System in subjects requiring direct
      endoscopic necrosectomy with walled off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN). Total enrollment 30
      subjects with at least 15 enrolled in the US.

      Subjects will be debrided with the EndoRotor either at the time of stent placement or post
      placement at Investigator's discretion with a maximum of 4 EndoRotor procedures. A minimum of
      2 days is required between each EndoRotor procedure and all procedures need to be completed
      within a 14 (+7/-0) day period. Follow up is completed 21 (+/- 7) days after last EndoRotor
      debridement procedure.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the freedom from major complications. The safety endpoint will include an assessment of the safety of the EndoRotor when performing endoscopic necrosectomy. For the purpose of this study, the safety evaluation shall include complications associated with endoscopic necrosectomy through the 21 (+/-7) day follow-up period. Potential endoscopic complications include perforation and bleeding.</description>

          2. Patients with symptomatic pancreatic necrosis due to acute pancreatitis that have an
             indication to undergo endoscopic necrosectomy after having undergone EUS-guided
             drainage

          3. Imaging suggestive of greater than or equal to 30% necrotic material

          6. Subject capable of giving informed consent.

          7. Subjects with the ability to understand the requirements of the study, who have
             provided written informed consent, and who are willing and able to return for the
             required follow-up assessments through 21 (+/- 7) days, as indicated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject unable to give informed consent.

          2. Subject is unwilling to return for repeated endoscopies.

          3. Documented Pseudoaneurysm &gt; 1cm within the WOPN

             (visible using endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasound).

          5. Dual antiplatelet therapy or therapeutic anticoagulation that cannot be withheld for
             the procedure

          6. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would create an unsafe clinical
             situation that would not allow the patient to safely undergo an endoscopic procedure
             (lack of medical clearance).

          7. Pregnant or lactating women or women of childbearing potential who do not employ a
             reliable method of contraception as judged by the Investigator, and/or are not willing
             to use reliable contraception for the duration of study participation.

          8. Patient is known to be currently enrolled in another investigational trial that could
