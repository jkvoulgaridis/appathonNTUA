      This study has designed implemented and evaluated an intervention to promote parental
      competence and healthy practices in families with children aged 2 to 5 years old, addressing
      parental self-efficacy an skills. This research followed the first three stages of the
      Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions: the theoretical, modeling and
      exploratory trial phases. A randomized control trial with parents of children better 2 to 5
      years old was conducted. The program consisted of two hour long four sessions. Parents were
      grouped in small groups (7-8 participants) and guided by a facilitator whose role was to
      provide a participative and trusting atmosphere to share opinions and experience in healthy
      lifestyles and parenting. Data collection was performed at three time points
      (pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up) to asses the preliminary efficacy,
      acceptability and feasibility of the program.

    <measure>Change from baseline Parental Self-efficacy at post-intervention and three months. Tool to Measure Parental Self-efficacy (TOPSE) is a questionnaire developed to measure parental self-efficacy.</measure>

    <description>Parents from the intervention group will be asked about their parental satisfaction with the program.

    <description>The Evaluation system of positive parenting programs was designed to evaluate the interventions in positive parenting in Spain (Manzano et al., 2012). It is a tool that professional could use in the implementation, methodology and content of the program. The system has 17 indicators that refer to different aspects of intervention programs such as general assessment, objectives, materials, evaluation or ethical aspects. The results will be collected in a table that will show the scores of all the indicators, the total score of each thematic block and the final score obtained in the instrument. In this way it will be observed what parts of the program have more power and which should be improved.</description>
