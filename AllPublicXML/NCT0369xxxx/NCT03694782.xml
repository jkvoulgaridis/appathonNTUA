  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The JArDinS study is a quasi-experimental research that aimed at assessing the impact of
      community garden participation (a natural experiment) in the adoption of more sustainable
      lifestyles.

    <textblock>
      The JArDinS study is part of the SURFOOD-Foodscapes project evaluating the relationships
      between urban foodscape and food styles in Montpellier Metropole (France).

      JArDinS consists of a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental research and includes an
      experimental group of new gardeners starting gardening in a community garden in Montpellier
      and a control group comprising participants from a survey on food behaviors undertaken as
      part of SURFOOD-Foodscapes project. Participants will be surveyed at enrollment and 12 months
      later.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in healthiness of household food supply</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and exactly 12 month later</time_frame>
    <description>The nutritional quality of household food supply was estimated using two indicators of nutritional quality : the mean adequacy ratio (MAR) and the mean excess ratio (MER)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical activity energy</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and exactly 12 month later</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity energy expenditure were estimated directly from raw triaxial accelerometry data using a model which combines an automatic activity-recognition algorithm with an activity-specific count-based model</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mental well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and exactly 12 month later</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. WEMWBS is a 14-item scale rated on a 5-point Likert-type, in which all items are worded positively and address aspects of positive mental health. Total score range from 14-70, with higher scores indicating a higher level of mental well-being.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in social isolation</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and exactly 12 month later</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the UCLA Loneliness Scale. UCLA-3 is a 20-item scale (11 positive and 9 negative) rated on a 4-point Likert-type. Total score range from 20-70, with higher scores greater feelings of loneliness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in environmental impact of household's food supply</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and exactly 12 month later</time_frame>
    <description>Greenhouse gas emissions (in g CO2eq), atmospheric acidification (g SO2eq) and marine eutrophication (in g Neq) related to household's food supply were computed using estimates from the French 'SUStable' table.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in environmental impact of household's food trip (in g CO2eq)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and exactly 12 month later</time_frame>
    <description>For each food trip, the distance traveled specifically for food purchase will be multiplied by energy source consumption of the transportation used, and by the corresponding GHGE factor of source consumption. GHGE related to food trip will be calculated as the sum of all food trips during the period of data collection.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sensibility to food waste</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and exactly 12 month later</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the Sensibility to food waste scale, a 8-item scale rated on a 7-point Likert-type, that measure in which extent participants attach importance to waste and are emotionally affected by it. Total score range from 7-56, a higher total scores denote greater sensibility to food waste.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in connection with nature</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and exactly 12 month later</time_frame>
    <description>Affective, cognitive, and experiential aspects of individuals' connection to nature was assessed by the Nature Relatedness Scale (NRS). NRS is a 21-item scale rated on a 5-point Likert-type. Total score range from 5-105, a higher total scores denote greater nature connectedness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in household food supply expenditure</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and exactly 12 month later</time_frame>
    <description>Monthly household food expenditure and the contribution of each food group and subgroup to total food expenditure were estimated using food expenses data collected in the food supply diary.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Age (in year) of each member of the household</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to report the age of each member each adult of the household.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gardening experience prior to the project</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked about their experiences and perceived competence in gardening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gender of each member of the household</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to report the gender of each adult of the household</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Household income</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants indicated their net income bracket of the household (by month).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Education level of each adult of the household</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to report the higest education level achieved by each adult of the household.</description>

    <intervention_name>Food diary supply</intervention_name>
    <description>Each participant was issued with a food supply diary to record details of their household food supply and related trips over 1-mo period. Household food supply included food purchases, food gift/donation, and potential crops from the garden. Away-from-home food consumption was not recorded. For each food purchase, participants provided details of date, place of purchase, foods purchased (name, quantity and expense incurred), and trip made (origin/where the trip started, destination/where the trip ended, and mode of transportation). When till receipts were available in grocery stores or supermarkets, participants were asked to collect them in an envelope placed at the end of the food supply diary. To facilitate data entry, all family members were encouraged to help filling out the diary.</description>

    <description>Participants were instructed to wear a triaxial accelerometer (wGT3X-BT or wActiSleep-BT, Actigraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) fitted with an elastic strap on right side of the hip for 9 consecutive days, except for bathing and performing activities in the water. The Actigraph was accompanied by an activity logbook in which participants were required to daily record time when awake and sleeping, and, if any, time and duration of workout or device removal</description>
