  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Navigating the risk-benefit profiles of the various biologic options approved for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can be challenging for patients who are considering biologic
      therapies as a treatment option. Thus, there is a need for simple and efficient tools that
      elicit individual preferences and support the patient-provider interaction.

      The principal objective of this study is to assess the impact of an online decision aid
      called IBD&amp;me on patient perceptions of shared-decision making as compared to a standardized
      education arm.

      Context: Navigating the risk-benefit profiles of the various biologic options approved for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can be challenging for patients who are considering biologic
      therapies as a treatment option. Thus, there is a need for simple and efficient tools that
      elicit individual preferences and support the patient-provider interaction.

      Objective: The principal objective of this study is to assess the impact of an online
      decision aid called IBD&amp;me on patient perceptions of shared-decision making as compared to a
      standardized education arm.

      Hypothesis: IBD&amp;me, through optimizing shared-decision making (SDM) and improving the
      patient-provider interaction, will provide incremental benefits beyond those provided by
      high-quality educational material without an SDM tool.

      Design: Pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial in IBD outpatient care

        1. Intervention: IBD&amp;me is an online, freely available tool that allows patients to explore
           decision-making around biologic therapies for IBD at their own pace

        2. Control arm: Standardized, high-quality educational material from the Crohn's &amp; Colitis
           Foundation

    <masking_description>Given the study design and intervention, it is not possible to ensure the blinding of patients and physicians. However, we will attempt to address the limitations resulting from a lack of blinding:
Patients and the physicians will be informed of the study protocol, but will not be provided accurate information about the specific primary outcome (i.e. comparison between IBD&amp;me and the Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) resource). The informed consent document will keep participants blind to the study goals.
Physicians will be kept blinded of the patient's assignment group until the clinic visit.
Data will be collected by an independent researcher. Study investigators and the data analyst will remain blinded until all follow-up data is obtained and the primary analysis is finalized.</masking_description>
