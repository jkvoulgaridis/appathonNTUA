  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa, open-label, propofol-controlled ,dose-escalation, multi-center Study to
      evaluate the tolerance, efficacy and safety of HSK3486 for induction of general anesthesia in
      elective surgery patients.This study is consisted of two cohorts, dose-escalation and
      dose-expansion cohorts. The doses in dose- expansion cohort were selected from
      dose-escalation results.
