  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine changes in retinal and choroidal capillaries with optical coherence tomographic
      angiography (OCTA) after half-dose photodynamic therapy (hd-PDT) in eyes with central serous
      chorioretinopathy (CSC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PDT was hypothesized to have a primary effect on the choroidal capillaries, and a number of
      studies have reported choriocapillary damage and choroidal vascular remodeling after PDT.
      More recently, although OCTA related CSC research has been conducted, no quantitative report
      has thoroughly investigated the microstructural changes in the superficial, deep retinal and
      choroidal capillaries after hd-PDT. The purpose of the present study is to determine the
      changes in the retinal and choroidal capillaries quantitatively with OCTA after hd-PDT in
      eyes with CSC.

      This is a prospective observational study of patients undergoing hd-PDT for CSC with active
      leakage in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and followed for 3 months. Fundus fluorescein
      angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) were performed at baseline; best
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus photography, optical coherence tomography angiography
      (OCTA) with the split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography algorithm (XR Optovue,
      Fremont, CA, USA) and spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) were performed at baseline and each
      follow-up visit after hd-PDT.

    <description>Half-dose photodynamic therapy was performed when a serous retinal detachment involving the macular fovea was present; The treatment field size was set as 3000 microns. This was achieved by administering 3mg/m² of Verteporfin intravenously over a period of 10 minutes. Fifteen minutes after commencing the verteporfin infusion the GLD was exposed to a 689 nm laser light with a florescence of 600 mw/cm² for 83 seconds and a total energy of 50 J/cm². OCTA (XR Optovue, Fremont, CA, USA) and spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) were performed at baseline and each follow-up (one month and three months) visit after hd-PDT.</description>
