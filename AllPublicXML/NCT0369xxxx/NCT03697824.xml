  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adoptive T-cell therapy is a therapeutic approach that aims to generate an anti-tumor T-cell
      immune response by infusing a cancer subjects own T-cells obtained by leukapheresis,
      engineered and expanded in-vitro to express a tumor specific T-cell receptor. NY-ESO-1 and
      LAGE-1a antigens are tumor-associated proteins that have been found in several tumor types,
      including synovial sarcoma. This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of GSK3377794 (genetically engineered NY-ESO-1 Specific [c259] T Cells), in combination with
      anticancer agents including pembrolizumab in subjects with NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a positive
      relapsed and refractory synovial sarcoma. The study will consist of a target expression
      screening to determine if subjects are human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:05
      and/or HLA-A*02:06 positive and if their tumors express NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a, followed by
      a leukapheresis screening phase of up to 42 days prior to leukapheresis. Eligible subjects
      will enter a leukapheresis phase followed by lymphodepletion phase with cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine. During the treatment phase, subjects will be administered GSK3377794 on Day 1
      followed by pembrolizumab infusion once every 3 weeks from Day 22 (or Week 7) for up to 2
      years. There will be a long-term follow-up phase from the end of treatment phase and for up
      to 15 years from the date of GSK3377794 administration.

          -  Male or female subjects will be included. Contraceptive use by men or women should be
             consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those
             participating in clinical studies. a) Male subjects are eligible to participate if
             they agree to the following during the intervention period starting at the first dose
             of chemotherapy for at least 12 months after receiving the T-cell infusion, or 4
             months after there is no evidence of persistence/ gene modified cells in the subject's
             blood, whichever is longer. Must use effective contraception for at least 4 months
             after the last dose of pembrolizumab if this time frame is longer than the duration of
             contraception required in the context of chemotherapy and gene modified cells.

          -  Refrain from donating sperm and either: Be abstinent from heterosexual or homosexual
             intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and

             contraception/barrier: a) Agree to use a male condom and should also be advised of the
             benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception when
             having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who is not
             currently pregnant (as a condom may break or leak). b) Agree to use male condom when
             engaging in any activity that allows for passage of ejaculate to another person.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding,
             and at least one of the following conditions applies: a) Is not a WOCBP. OR, b) Is a
             WOCBP who will agree to use a barrier method (male condom) and use a contraceptive
             method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year), during the
             intervention period and for at least 12 months after receiving the T-cell infusion, or
             4 months after there is no evidence of persistence/ gene modified cells in the
             subjects blood, whichever is longer. WOCBP must use effective contraception for at
             least 4 months after the last dose of pembrolizumab if this time frame is longer than
             the duration of contraception required in the context of chemotherapy and gene
             modified cells. WOCBP should also agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the
             purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator should evaluate the
             effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study
             intervention. c) A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine
             or serum as required by local regulations) within 24 hours before any dose of study
             intervention. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (e.g., an ambiguous
             result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the subject must be
             excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive. The
             investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and
             recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early
             undetected pregnancy.

             to it).

          -  Subject must be presenting with at least two lesions: one measurable per RECIST 1.1
             and the other required for biopsy. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area
             are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.

          -  Central nervous system (CNS) metastases with low CNS disease burden are allowed on a

             systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents,
             corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: a) Ongoing or active
             infection requiring systemic therapy; b) Clinically significant cardiac disease
             defined by congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class &gt;1; c)
             Uncontrolled clinically significant arrhythmia in last 6 months; d) Acute coronary
             syndrome (angina or myocardial infarction) in last 6 months; e) Severe aortic stenosis
             or symptomatic mitral stenosis; f) Inadequate pulmonary function with mechanical
             parameters &lt;40% predicted (Forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1], Forced vital
             capacity [FVC], Total lung capacity [TLC], Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon
             monoxide [DLCO]); g) Interstitial lung disease (subjects with existing pneumonitis as
             a result of radiation are not excluded; however, subjects cannot be oxygen dependent);
             h) Any other illness that in the judgment of the Investigator would compromise the
             subjects ability to tolerate protocol therapy or significantly increase the risk of
             complications

          -  Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or otherwise stable chronic liver disease
             per investigator assessment).

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

          -  Corrected QT interval duration (QTc) &gt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt;480 msec for
             subjects with bundle branch block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate
             according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another
             method, machine-read or manually over-read.

          -  Subject has a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, other agents used
             in the study (Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an
             exception to this rule).

          -  Has severe hypersensitivity (&gt;=Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding females (due to risk to fetus or newborn).

          -  Any prior treatment-related toxicities must be CTCAE (Version 4.03) &lt;=Grade 1 at the
             time of initiating study intervention (except for non-clinically significant
             toxicities e.g., alopecia, vitiligo). Subjects with Grade 2 toxicities that are deemed
             stable or irreversible (e.g., peripheral neuropathy) can be enrolled on a case-by-case
             basis in agreement between the Investigator and Sponsor's Medical Monitor (or
             designee).

          -  Other standard of care lines of therapy are allowed only if guidelines and wash-out
             periods are followed.

          -  Investigational treatment within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior
             to leukapheresis. Investigational vaccines (other than NY-ESO-1 vaccines that are not
             allowed) must follow the wash-out period. Exceptions to this rule must be evaluated by
             the Investigator in agreement with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor (or designee).

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study intervention.
             Subjects with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease are can be
             enrolled, only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA)
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is obtained.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperating with the requirements of the study.

          -  Lymphodepletion and Treatment Phase: In addition to the criteria mentioned above,
             subjects are not eligible for lymphodepletion or treatment if any of the following
             criteria apply: Subject has received cytotoxic therapy within 2 weeks prior to
             lymphodepleting chemotherapy: a. Subjects must have recovered from all AEs due to
             previous therapies to &lt;=Grade 1 or Baseline. Subjects with &lt;=Grade 2 neuropathy are
             eligible. b. Systemic corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressive therapy within 2
             weeks prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

          -  Live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live
             vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella,
             varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG),
             and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed
             virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist)
             are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  Major surgery &lt;=28 days of first dose of study intervention.
