      This interventional study investigates the efficacy of Wet cupping therapy on heavy metal
      levels.The levels of the selected heavy metals will be measured in the blood samples obtained
      from the participants before and after the interventions

    <textblock>
      Wet cupping therapy (WCT) is a traditional therapy which was used for centuries especially
      for detoxifiying purposes.Current literature also points out its blood clarifiying capacity
      in order to illuminate the underlying mechanism of this ancient treatment.

      Steel industry workers, different from the general population are exposed to heavy metals
      more often.Conducting a study in this special group where we will evaluate the levels of
      selected heavy metals in blood before and after the three sessions of WCT might let us know
      its detoxifiying capacity based on measurable parameters.

    <description>CT was applied using plastic disposable vacuum cups on the back in the 5 areas of C7 cervical spine (DU14 acupoint), T2-4 lateral spine bilaterally (BL41-42 acupoint) and T6-8 lateral spine bilaterally (BL44-46). The cupping technique procedure was conducted in five phases:
Primary suction; cups are left attached to the skin for 5 minutes.
Area disinfection; areas are wiped with sterile gauze after disinfection with povidone iodine.
Scarification; Superficial incisions (20-30 gauge), 5 mm length and 1-2 mm depth, are made on the skin with a sterile, number 11 surgical blade.
Bloodletting and secondary suction; the cups which had been previously removed are placed again on the scarified areas Blood leaks from the capillary vessels of the skin and subcutaneous tissue and fills the cups, which are left in place for 15 minutes.
Removing and dressing; the cups full of blood are removed. The areas of application are wiped with sterile gauze and then a dressing is applied</description>
