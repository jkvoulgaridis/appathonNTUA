  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will enroll up to 10,000 adult volunteers in individualized experiments (N-of-1
      trials) designed to assess the individual-level effects of any of five interventions on three
      outcomes. The five interventions are: gratitude journaling, mindfulness meditation, random
      acts of kindness, physical activity, and laughter therapy. The three outcomes are stress,
      cognitive focus, and happiness. Each participant will engage in the selected activity in 3
      day intervals, separated at random by 3 day intervals of usual activity, for a total of six
      3-day periods (18 days).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      N-of-1 trials (single patient crossover experiments) are a uniquely powerful technique for
      estimating treatment effects in the individual. N-of-1 trials have been offered to hundreds
      or perhaps thousands of patients worldwide, but never at scale. HackYourHealth is a tool that
      supports the conduct of simple N-of-1 self-experiments to test if healthy activities that
      work in general (i.e., mindfulness meditation, physical activity, gratitude journaling,
      random acts of kindness, and laughter therapy), improve psychological well-being (stress,
      focus, happiness) in specific individuals. The tool supplies the experimental design,
      facilitates data analysis, and channels feedback to participants. The tool is flexible enough
      to support Massive Individualized N-of-1 Experiments (MINEs) at scale. Working with WNYC
      Radio in New York City, we will recruit and run 18-day N-of-1 trials up to 10,000
      individuals. The purpose of this study is to conduct a formative evaluation of HackYourHealth
      in terms of its perceived usefulness and to explore heterogeneity in intervention response
      across the sample. We anticipate that the results will: 1) identify useful behavioral
      interventions for individual participants; 2) help to estimate generalizable treatment
      effects for the interventions of interest; 3) assess heterogeneity of treatment effects
      across subgroups; and 4) elucidate the user experience with N-of-1 trials. When complete, the
      study will support additional proposals designed to assess the utility of MINEs as applied to
      additional conditions and treatments.

    <description>User Burden Scale (UBS) - The UBS is a 20-item scale, with 6 individual sub-scales, that assesses the burden placed on users by computing systems. The 6 burden-related constructs evaluated through the sub-scales are: (1) difficulty of use (2) physical (3) time and social (4) mental and emotional (5) privacy (6) financial The UBS uses two 5-point scales ranging from 0-4 (Never - All of the time; Not at all - Extremely). Total score is a sum of responses to all questions in the scale. A higher score indicates a higher level of user burden. The maximum score is 80 and minimum is 0.
User burden can be explored by sub-scales to explore which construct is contributing most to user burden. In such a case, scores for each sub-scale are computed by calculating the mean for items within each sub-scale.</description>
