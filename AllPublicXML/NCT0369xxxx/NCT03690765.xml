      A non-interventional, observational program to assess the effects of dydrogesterone

      A non-interventional, observational program to assess the effects of oral dydrogesterone
      therapy in a post-marketing setting whether the effects are related to the regimen of
      dydrogesterone therapy. In this observational program, assuming that dydrogesterone plays a
      role in the treatment of endometriosis without suppression of ovulation, the goal is to
      observe the possible implications of such treatment in terms of treatment regimen and
      response pattern. In the study will be described effects of Duphaston®
      6-months-administration in patients with confirmed endometriosis by assessing pain relief,
      quality of life, need of self-medication with analgesics, etc.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in chronic pelvic pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in chronic pelvic pain intensity assessed by 11-items Numerous Rating Scale (NRS) at the end of observation (Visit 3) versus Baseline (Visit 1) in the prolonged cyclic regime and the continuous regime of Duphaston in patients with endometriosis. The 11-items Numerous Rating Scale (NRS) contains the range from 0 to 10, where 0 represents 'no pain' and 10 represents 'the worst pain'. Patients are asked to point the average pain intensity throughout the last month. The negative change corresponds to better result.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Quality of Life assessed by Short Form-20 (SF-20) at the end of observation (Visit3) versus Baseline (Visit1) in patients with endometriosis. The Short Form-20 (Copyright © the RAND Corporation) consists of 20 questions grouped into two parameters: psychological and physical components of health. The indicators of each scale are compiled in such a way that the higher the value of the indicator (from 0 to 100), the better the score on the chosen parameter.</description>

    <description>Description of the changes in dysmenorrhea assessed by 11-items NRS after 3-months treatment (Visit2) and after 6-months treatment (Visit3) versus Baseline (Visit1) in patients with endometriosis. The 11-items Numerous Rating Scale (NRS) contains the range from 0 to 10, where 0 represents 'No symptoms' and 10 represents 'the Worst trouble'. Patients are asked to point the average intensity of dysmenorrhea symptoms (cyclic pelvic pain, mood disorders, gastro-intestinal symptoms etc.) during the last menses period. The negative change corresponds to better result.</description>

    <description>Description of the change in sexual wellbeing assessed by A Quality Assessment of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for Sexual Wellbeing (5-points Likert scale) at the end of observation (Visit3) versus Baseline (Visit1). A Quality Assessment of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for Sexual Wellbeing by 5-points Likert scale proposes patients to rate themselves on a 5-point scale as being `very satisfied, satisfied, ordinarily, rather not satisfied, not satisfied'. The number (and proportion) of patients in each category will be presented.</description>
