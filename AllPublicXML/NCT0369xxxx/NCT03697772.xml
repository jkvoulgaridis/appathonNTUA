  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic disease management is a public health problem that faces monitoring difficulties
      related to complex care pathways. This study will analyze the use of unscheduled or urgent
      care according to the continuity of care in multimorbid patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic diseases in the population is increasing significantly. It
      represents a new challenge for doctors and health authorities. However, patients often have
      at least two chronic diseases. These are referred to as &quot;multimorbid&quot; patients, whose
      continuity of care has not been well studied to date.

      This observational study evaluates the association between the continuity of care in
      multimorbid patients seen in general practice and their use of urgent healthcare, their
      quality of life and their burden of treatment.
