    <textblock>
      For twenty years research has shown a strong link between olfactory disorders and Alzheimer's
      disease. The focus is on the very early alteration of the olfaction which acts as a harbinger
      of the disease since it is detectable in its asymptomatic phase. In addition, olfactory
      involvement is a precursor to the transformation of mild cognitive impairment into MA. Indeed
      the anatomical structures the first lesions are located in the transentorhinal region of the
      temporal lobe and entorhinal phase, before progressing towards the limbic system, which will
      mark the clinical appearance of the first signs of AD.

      In literature, it has been shown that there was no olfactory test that is recognized as a
      gold standard in the scientific community due to a lack of homogeneity of the tools used,
      their availability and their validity depending on the culture. Moreover, of all the tests
      currently available, none are specific to neurodegenerative diseases.

      Very recent studies show that there is also a strong preference for imaging tools or
      biomarkers in the detection of AD, but it appears that the olfactory disorders are well
      before these markers. It has been shown that an identification test is comparable in
      predictive accuracy to neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid sampling.

      This study will therefore focus on the calibration and validation of a computerized olfactory
      test for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and based the recommendations of professionals
      so as to promote the effective use of this test in clinical practice.

All fragrances tested are kept in an airtight case protected from cold and heat.
The test is done on a tablet and the data will be automatically saved. The first screen is about the administrative data, sex and age of the subject. Olfactory test: six odors among the fourteen are proposed in a randomized way.</description>
