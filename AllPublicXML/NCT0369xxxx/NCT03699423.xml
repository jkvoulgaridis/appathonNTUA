  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the two-week ocular responses, especially on pupillary size and accommodative
      amplitude, of nightly application of 0.01% or 0.02% or 0.03% atropine eye drops in children
      with myopia who were randomized to use of three different low-concentration atropine eye
      drops

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atropine was proven to be effective in controlling myopia progression. However, the most
      common side effects of the use of atropine eye drop are dilation of pupil and decrease of
      accommodation. The investigators wish to evaluate the ocular responses of three low
      concentration atropine eye drops, 0.01% or 0.02% or 0.03%, mainly on the pupillary size and
      accommodative responses in children aged between 6 to 12 years old over two-week usage.

             clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator.

          -  Willing to answer the questionnaire about subjective measurements

          -  Have ocular findings deemed to be normal

          -  No contact lens wearing history

             normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participant's ocular health /
             physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at
             enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.

        NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an &quot;as needed basis&quot;, provided they are not used
        prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product
        is used.

          -  History of eye surgery

          -  History of use of any myopia control interventions such as Orthokeratology, Rigid

          -  Currently treated with other interventions for myopia control

          -  Contraindications to atropine such as pulmonary disease, heart conditions and ADHD

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients to atropine eye-drops and other
             derivatives of anti-muscarinic receptor agents.

          -  Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.
