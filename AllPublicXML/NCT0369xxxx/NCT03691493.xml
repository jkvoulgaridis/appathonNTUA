    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy given with standard care palbociclib
      and hormone therapy work in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread from one
      part of the body to the bone. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells
      and shrink tumors. Palbociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Antihormone therapy, such as fulvestrant, letrozole,
      anastrozole, exemestane, or tamoxifen, may lessen the amount of estrogen made by the body.
      Giving radiation therapy, palbociclib, and hormone therapy may work better in treating breast
      cancer patients with bone metastasis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the response rate three months post-conventionally fractionated radiotherapy,
      relative to baseline, for bone metastases in breast cancer patients receiving concurrent
      palbociclib and hormone therapy treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether conventionally fractionated radiotherapy in combination with
      palbociclib and hormone therapy in breast cancer patients with bone metastases adversely
      increases the frequency and severity of palbociclib toxicities including grade 3 neutropenia.

      II. To determine whether radiotherapy in combination with palbociclib in breast cancer
      patients with bone metastases adversely increases the frequency and severity of radiotherapy
      toxicities including neurological and bone injury.

      III. To assess fatigue, quality of life, and depression before and after radiotherapy for
      bone metastases in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with palbociclib.

      IV. To determine progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer
      patients treated with palbociclib and concurrent radiotherapy to bone metastases.

      V. To evaluate the relationship between volume of irradiated bone and side effects of
      treatment, including leukopenia and neutropenia.

      TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect, store, and analyze circulating tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) in
      metastatic breast cancer patients treated with palbociclib and radiotherapy to bone
      metastases and to determine the relationship between ctDNA and responders versus
      non-responders, PFS, and OS.

      II. To collect, store, and analyze plasma for inflammatory cytokine measurements and
      determine their relationship with fatigue, depression, and quality of life before and after
      radiotherapy for bone metastases in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with
      palbociclib.

      III. To collect, store, and analyze ribonucleic acid (RNA) for gene expression to identify
      functional biology processes over-represented in genes differentially regulated among
      patients who develop toxicities versus those who do not and those who are responders versus
      those who are not and to identify transcriptional regulatory pathways driving observed
      differences in gene expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo conventional radiation therapy over 5-10 days and receive palbociclib orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. At the discretion of treating physician, patients also
      receive letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, or tamoxifen PO QD on days 1-28, or fulvestrant
      intramuscularly (IM) on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months.

    <measure>Response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 months post-radiation</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate will be estimated as the number of responders divided by the number of patients evaluated for response. Among patients who present with pain, responders will be considered those patients who have a 2 point decrease in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and among those who do not present with pain (radiotherapy due to risk of unstable fracture or cord compression), responders will be considered those without development of a pathologic fracture or neurologic compromise (cord compression) due to cancer on imaging.</description>

    <measure>Response rate incorporating BPI and analgesic measures according to International Bone Consensus Guideline Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 months post-radiation</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate will be estimated as the number of responders divided by the number of patients evaluated for response. Among patients who present with pain, responders will be considered those patients who fulfill the International Bone Consensus response criteria using the BPI item rating maximum pain over the last 3 days at the index site and analgesic usage for the treated site within the last 24 hours prior to assessment. Among patients who do not present with pain (radiotherapy due to risk of unstable fracture or cord compression), responders will be considered those without development of a new pathologic fracture or worsening neurologic compromise (cord compression) due to cancer on imaging.</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed before and after radiotherapy. The SF-36 measures eight scales: physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), and mental health (MH) Each scale is the weighted sum of the questions in their section and are directly transformed into a 0-100 scale i.e., the minimum score is 0, maximum is 100 A higher score indicates less disability Total score on the SF-36 is the summation of all the eight scales</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed before and after radiotherapy.
EORTC QLQ-BM22 measures four multi-item scales: painful sites, functional interference, painful characteristics, and psychosocial aspects Each item is scaled from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) and directly transformed into a 0-100 scale A higher score in symptom scales indicates greater distress.

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed before and after radiotherapy. The EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL measures seven scales: physical functioning, global health status, emotional functioning, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, and constipation For questions 1-14, each item is scaled from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) . For question 15 (global QoL), patients respond to a seven-point numerical scale from 1 (very poor overall) to 7 (excellent overall) A higher score in symptom scales indicates greater distress. A higher score in functional scales indicates greater functional ability Each subscore is computed using the Addendum to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual: Scoring of the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL</description>
