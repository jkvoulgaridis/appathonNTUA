    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory</measure>

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory measures pain severity and pain functioning. Pain severity is comprised of 4 questions on a 0-10 scale for pain at it's worst in the past week, the least in the past week, on average, and then currently. Each item is scored separately and higher scores indicate greater pain severity. There are then 12 daily activities in which the participants rates on a scale of 0-10 regarding how much the pain interferes with the activity (10 being the highest interference). These are all scored separately.</description>
