      The purpose of the KDRAFT study is to assess the feasibility and preliminary cognitive
      efficacy of a ketogenic diet therapy in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

    <measure>Proportion of days positive for urinary ketone production</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 90 days (the length of the diet intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will measure and report daily urinary ketone status using Ketostix (Bayer, Germany).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood ketone levels induced by ketogenic diet</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels at month 1, 2, 3 (end of ketogenic diet), and 4 (after 1-month washout).</time_frame>
    <description>Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels will be measured at five monthly study visits; baseline prior to diet initiation, three monthly collections during the ketogenic diet intervention, and after the 1-month washout return to a regular diet.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline global cognitive scores at month 3 (end of ketogenic diet) and change from month 3 global cognitive scores at month 4 (end of 1-month washout).</time_frame>
    <description>Global cognitive performance will be assessed by a psychometrician using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). The ADAS-Cog is an Alzheimer's disease specific, multi-domain cognitive assessment scored from 0-70 points with higher scores indicating poorer cognitive performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline global cognitive scores at month 3 (end of ketogenic diet) and change from month 3 global cognitive scores at month 4 (end of 1-month washout).</time_frame>
    <description>Global cognitive performance will be assessed by a psychometrician using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). The MMSE is a brief cognitive questionnaire with a maximum score of 30 points where higher scores indicate better cognitive performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary intake characterization prior to and after ketogenic diet initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Dietary intake will be collected at Baseline, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in food and nutrient intake will be assessed by monthly 3-day food records completed by participant study partners.</description>

    <description>All participants will be assigned to the 3-month ketogenic diet intervention. Study partners will be instructed to assist participants in adherence to a 1:1 ketogenic diet (approximately 70% fat, &lt;10% carbohydrate, and 20% protein). Participants will be provided medium chain triglyceride oil with a target intake of 1-2 tablespoons per day and micronutrient supplements consisting of multivitamin, vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus. After the 3-month ketogenic diet, participants will complete a 1-month washout period in which they halt adherence to the ketogenic diet and resume their normal diet.</description>
