  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares patient satisfaction after labor and delivery with access to either the
      default educational materials available, or to a table computer set to display an educational
      website, thepainlesspush.com.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled study. The investigators hypothesize that
      parturients with access to the website will exhibit greater satisfaction with labor and
      delivery pain control.

      Potential participants will be recruited from the University of New Mexico Hospital (UNMH)
      Labor &amp; Delivery floor. Patients will be enrolled following an oral consent process. They
      will be randomized into either control group or intervention group. Control group
      participants will have their standard of care visit with an anesthesiologist and routine
      hospital pain-relief information. Intervention group participants will have their standard of
      care visit with an anesthesiologist, plus one hour in which to view the patient education
      website thepainlesspush.com, on an iPad provided by the Anesthesiology department for this
      purpose. After their delivery and transfer to the mother/baby unit, participants will
      complete a satisfaction survey brought to them by a study team member. Participants will
      complete the survey following their delivery and prior to discharge. The primary team will
      notify us with expected discharge in which we will retrieve the survey from them in their
      room and answer any last questions. Their active participation in the study will be complete
      at this time. After a participant completes the satisfaction survey, research team members
      will collect demographic information and relevant obstetric/medical history information from
      the electronic medical record.
