      This study is a phase II, single-arm, open label study under an umbrella trial for NSCLC.
      This clinical study is targeted for the patients who harbor exon 14 skipping mutation of MET
      and all patients will be treated with Capmatinib. The treatment period begins on Day 1 of
      Cycle 1 and 1 cycle consists of 28 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable stage IIIB/IV
             NSCLC that carries MET exon 14 skipping alteration by molecular testing, as per NGS
             and RT PCR.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 to 2

          -  Male or female; â‰¥ 18

          -  Subjects with measurable lesion (using RECIST 1.1 criteria)

          -  Subjects must have archival tissue sample available, collected either at the time of
             diagnosis of NSCLC or any time since

          -  Patients who have progressed during or after 1st line or 2nd line therapy prior to the
             first dose of capmatinib. For patient who have received prior platinum containing
             adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or definitive chemoradiation for locally advanced disease,
             those treatments are regarded as 1st line if the progression has occurred &lt; 12 months
             from last therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any major operation or irradiation within 4 weeks of baseline disease assessment

          -  Any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities which may impair intake or
             absorption of the study drug

          -  Subjects with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who are
             neurologically unstable or have required increasing doses of steroids within the 2
             weeks prior to study entry to manage CNS symptoms

          -  Patients who have received more than 2 lines of prior systemic therapy, which include
             chemo, immune and targeted therapy
