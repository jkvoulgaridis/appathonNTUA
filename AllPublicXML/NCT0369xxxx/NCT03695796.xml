  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients has two main
      limitations. First, there is no approved treatment in NAFLD. Second, liver biopsy remains the
      reference procedure for the evaluation of liver lesions but it is invasive and can't be
      proposed to all NAFLD patients who represent 25% of the general population. Phase III trials
      have recently started in NAFLD with the hope of new treatments available in few years on the
      market. Consequently, we now need to develop and validate the non-invasive tools that will
      allow the identification of the subset of NAFLD patients who will benefit from treatment with
      the new drugs once they will be available in clinical practice.

      We aim to generate of large multicenter cohort of biopsy-proven NAFLD patients including
      non-invasive tests of liver lesions (blood tests, elastography devices) and a biobank to
      promote a research network in the field of non-invasive diagnosis of liver lesions in NAFLD.
      Eight French centers highly experienced in this field of research will participate to the
      cohort.

      Our primary aim will be to evaluate and improve the non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis
      in NAFLD. The primary endpoint will be advanced fibrosis as defined by fibrosis stages F3/4
      by the NASH-CRN histological semi-quantitative scoring
