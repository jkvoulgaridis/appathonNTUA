  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapies delivered via technology have been developed to improve accessibility, however,
      there is limited research regarding messaging therapy in particular, and none that we know of
      utilizing a longitudinal effectiveness design. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      overall effectiveness of messaging therapy, identify any contributors to its effectiveness,
      and to evaluate a dosage effect for this type of treatment.
