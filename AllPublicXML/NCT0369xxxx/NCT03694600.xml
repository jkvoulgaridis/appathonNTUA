      This is a clinical trial designed to evaluate the performance of the IvyGene Dx Liver Cancer
      Test alone, ultrasound alone and the combination of both the IvyGene Dx Liver Cancer Test and
      ultrasound for the detection of HCC within a population that is at high risk for HCC due to
      liver cirrhosis.

      This multi-site, prospective study is designed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of
      the IvyGene Dx Liver Cancer Test alone, ultrasound alone and the combination of the IvyGene
      Dx Liver Cancer Test and ultrasound for the detection of HCC within a population at high risk
      of HCC due to liver cirrhosis. Subjects will be enrolled until the pre-determined number of
      subjects are enrolled.

      Subjects at high risk for developing liver cancer due to liver cirrhosis and who are eligible
      for liver cancer screening as determined by the patient's physician will be invited to
      participate. Subjects will then read, understand and sign the Informed Consent Form and the
      Authorization for Medical Records Form. Participation will consist of providing blood samples
      for testing with the IvyGeneTM Dx Liver Cancer Test and other blood analytes, undergoing
      abdominal ultrasound, and multiphasic MRI once upon entering the study. In addition to
      ultrasound screening (consistent with the current standard of care), all subjects will also
      undergo diagnostic imaging by multiphasic MRI. To this end, upon entering the study, subjects
      will provide a blood sample for determining AFP concentration and a blood sample for the
      IvyGeneTM Dx Liver Cancer Test. AFP concentrations will be determined by the clinical
      laboratory routinely utilized by each site. For each subject upon enrollment, the following
      blood analytes will also be determined: creatinine, prothrombin time, bilirubin, blood
      platelet count, ALT, AST and ALP. The results of all clinical laboratory tests will be
      recorded by use of the subject's Case Report Form. Whole blood samples drawn for the
      IvyGeneTM Dx Liver Cancer Test will be collected (according to the instructions provided with
      each sample collection kit) by using the IvyGeneTM Sample Collection, Stabilization and
      Shipping Kit, and shipped to a central LAM laboratory for testing. Samples will be assayed by
      laboratory technicians blinded to the results of any other testing. Within the same clinical
      visit as the blood draws, subjects will undergo conventional ultrasound to examine the liver.
      Every subject will go on to diagnostic imaging by multiphasic MRI. The results of diagnostic
      imaging will primarily be scored by LI-RADS score and the number and size of any malignant
      lesions identified will be recorded. The images of all MRI, CT, or ultrasound will be saved
      and uploaded for evaluation by a blinded, centralized team of radiologists to confirm
      diagnosis. Any biopsy results or surgical pathology results that are generated for study
      subjects as part of current clinical practice will also be recorded.

      The anticipated study duration for most subjects will be approximately 1 month to complete
      one round of HCC screening by using the IvyGene Dx Liver Cancer Test and ultrasound, and if
      needed, diagnostic imaging. Subjects that receive an indeterminant (LI-RADS score of 3)
      indication by diagnostic imaging will be recommended for a second round of HCC screening and
      diagnostic imaging in 6 months. Therefore, the anticipated study duration for these subjects
      that are recommended for a second round of HCC screening will be approximately 6 months.

        Subjects will be on study for a period of approximately 7 months (subjects receiving an
        indeterminate finding by diagnostic imaging, may be followed up to an additional 6 months)
        Screening: 14 days Enrollment: 7 months Follow-up: 6 months (indeterminate subjects only)
        The total duration of the study is expected to be 13 months (which includes final subject
        follow-up).
