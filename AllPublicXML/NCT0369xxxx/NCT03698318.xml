  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess bioavailability of total gingeroids, free gingerols
      and shogaols, so as their glucuronide and sulfate metabolites, in the plasma, after
      consumption of a single dose of 5 different ginger extracts. These five extracts have the
      same quantity of active substance but with different titration (1.6%, 5%, 39%, 26% and 26%
      NOP80).
