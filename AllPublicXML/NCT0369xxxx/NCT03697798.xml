    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of aP booster vaccination in children, young
      adults and elderly on the (long-term) immune response to B. pertussis in three European
      countries with a different epidemiological background and primary vaccination schedule for
      pertussis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in three European countries (UK, Finland and the Netherlands)
      with a different epidemiological background for pertussis incidence and different age groups
      will have had different primary schedules with whole cell pertussis (wP) or aP vaccines in
      their first year of life. Long-term memory responses will be analysed following aP booster
      vaccination including a detailed assessment of antigen-specific B and T cell responses,
      serology assays for pertussis antigens and the effect of booster vaccination on dynamic
      changes in immune cell subsets and gene transcription.

      There will be four cohorts of healthy volunteers:

      Cohort A - children aged between 7-10 years

      Cohort B - children aged between 11-15 years

      Cohort C - adults aged between 20 to 34 years

      Cohort D - adults aged between 60-70 years

      Participants will receive one injection of reduced diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid and
      reduced acellular pertussis vaccine (dTap)-IPV, (Boostrix® IPV, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK))
      combination vaccine intramuscularly in the upper arm. Children (cohorts A and B) will be
      asked to donate blood four times at different time points, and young and older adults
      (cohorts C and D) will be asked to donate blood at set time points five times in total over
      the 12 months duration of the study. The time points will be:

        -  Timepoint 0 - day of vaccination

        -  Timepoint 1 - 1 day after T0 +/- 4 hours

        -  Timepoint 2 - 7 days after T0 +/- 1 day

        -  Timepoint 3 - 14 days after T0 +/- 4 days

        -  Timepoint 4 - 28 days after T0 +/- 4 days

        -  Timepoint 5 - 1 year after T0 +/- 4 weeks
