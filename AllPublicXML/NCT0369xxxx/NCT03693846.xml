  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II study of twenty-one subjects with mucinous adenocarcinoma of
      the colon, rectum, or appendix with prior systemic therapy with a fluoropyrimidine,
      oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Treatment will consist of nivolumab 480mg every 4 weeks and
      ipilimumab 1mg/kg every 8 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 2 years
      of therapy.
