  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most performed endovascular interventional
      radiology (IR) procedure. TACE procedures are performed in an IR suite, most of which are
      equipped with floor-based flat-panel robotic C-arm allowing two-dimensional imaging.
      Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been developed to allow three-dimensional navigation
      but has several limitations such as reduced signal to noise ratio and small field-of-view,
      and seems to have negative impact on patient radiation exposure. Another option to perform 3D
      imaging is called angio-CT which combines a CT-scan and a floor-based flat-panel robotic
      C-arm in a single IR suite. Even if some publications have shown benefit of angio-CT in TACE
      procedures in Japan, no study about angio-CT in liver IR procedures has been conducted in the
      occidental world so far. The purpose of our study was to assess the impact of angio-CT use on
      patient radiation exposure and treatment quality in TACE procedures compared to CBCT.

      This before-after study consisted of a review of consecutive TACE procedures performed
      between January 2016 and September 2017 in our institution with two different imaging
      modalities, defining two study groups (C-arm with CBCT versus angio-CT).
