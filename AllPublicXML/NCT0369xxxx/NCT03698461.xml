  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver is the most common site of metastases from colorectal cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      with targeted agents is usually recommended for borderline-resectable liver metastases that
      are technically difficult to resect for conversion to resectable disease and control of
      metastatic spread. However, the prognosis of these patients are still poor, and long term
      disease-free survival over 3 years is rare and &lt;20%. More effective measures to prevent
      recurrence are needed before or after resection of colorectal liver metastases.

      -  Atezolizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that targets
           Programmed Death-Ligand 1(PD-L1) and inhibits the interaction between PD-L1 and its
           receptors, Programmed cell Death protein 1(PD-1) and B7.1. Therapeutic blockade of PD-L1
           binding by atezolizumab has been shown to enhance the magnitude and quality of tumor
           specific T cell responses, resulting in improved anti tumor activity.

        -  Bevacizumab is a recombinant, humanized therapeutic antibody directed against vascular
           endothelial growth factor(VEGF). In addition to its well-characterized role in
           angiogenesis, VEGF is also believed to be involved in cancer immune evasion via the
           induction of myeloid- derived suppressor cells(MDSCs). These VEGF-induced MDSCs can
           suppress both T-cell and dendritic-cell function. Bevacizumab can restore and/or
           maintain the antigen presentation capacity of dendritic cells, leading to enhanced
           T-cell infiltration in tumors. When used in combination, VEGF targeting agents such as
           bevacizumab promote the normalization of tumor vasculature and may thereby increase
           access of therapeutic agents.

        -  Atezolizumab with bevacizumab, levoleucovorin, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil(FOLFOX).
           A translational study for renal cell carcinoma showed bevacizumab resulted in modulation
           of tumor immune microenvironment with Th1-related signatures, which was more potentiated
           by subsequent treatment with atezolizumab. This suggests potentiation of anti-tumor
           immunity with the combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab.

             be within the medical standard of enrolling institution.

        Other considerations

          1. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
