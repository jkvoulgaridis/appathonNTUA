  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is currently the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. It has been a
      difficult task for ophthalmologists and researchers to diagnose glaucoma, especially in early
      stage. At present, glaucoma diagnosis mainly relies on OCT and visual field test, which have
      relatively low sensitivity and specificity at the early stage of glaucoma. Previous studies
      mainly focused on ocular manifestation of glaucoma. However, there was evidence that
      abnormalities of visual pathway also existed in patients with glaucoma, indicating cerebral
      cognitive defects may also be involved in glaucoma development. Thus, the current study was
      designed, in which subjects at high-risk of developing glaucoma are separated into two group
      based on test results of topological perception. After five years' follow-up, morbidity of
      primary open-angle glaucoma would be compared between groups to see if there was any
      relationship between impaired cognitive function and incidence of glaucoma.
