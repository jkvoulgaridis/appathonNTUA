  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to understand the efficacy and side effects of lung cancer immunotherapy, at least
      30 patients with lung cancer who were treated with immunotherapy were enrolled. The
      second-generation sequencing technology and liquid phase factor platform were used for
      detection, and clinical imaging and other evaluation methods were used to explore the
      immunotherapy efficacy and side effects affecting lung cancer。
