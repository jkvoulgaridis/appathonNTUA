      This study evaluates an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation for inpatients with
      major depressive disorder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to investigate whether modifying stimulation parameters enables typical
      6-8 week long rTMS protocols to be compressed to only five days. The influence of this
      accelerated protocol on the length of patient stay in the hospital and the direct total cost
      will be investigated.

    <measure>Change in Suicidal Ideation item on Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (day 0), after treatment (days 1-5), at immediate post-treatment follow up visit (day 6), at one month follow up visit (day 35).</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating (MADRS) Scale is a 10-item clinician-administered scale designed to be particularly sensitive to antidepressant treatment effects in patients with major depression.
Outcome 1 of this study will use only question 10 from the MADRS scale, which indexes suicidal ideation. Scores on this question can range from 0 to 6 with higher scores indicating more severe suicidal ideation.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline (day 0), after treatment (days 1-5), at immediate post-treatment follow up visit (day 6), at one month follow up visit (day 35).</time_frame>
    <description>The SSI-C is a 19-item clinician-rated assessment to assess the intensity, pervasiveness, and characteristics of suicidal ideation in adults. Scores range from 0-38 with higher scores indicating greater suicidal ideation.</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression.
Outcome 3 of this study will use only question 9 from the BDI-II scale, which indexes suicidal ideation. Scores on this question can range from 0 to 4 with higher scores indicating more severe suicidal ideation.</description>

    <description>The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating (MADRS) Scale is a 10-item clinician-administered scale designed to be particularly sensitive to antidepressant treatment effects in patients with major depression.
Outcome 5 of this study will use questions 1-9 from the MADRS scale, which index depression. Total scores on these questions can range from 0 to 50 with higher scores indicating more severe suicidal ideation.

    <measure>Change in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (day 0), after treatment (days 1-5), at immediate post-treatment follow up visit (day 6), at one month follow up visit (day 35).</time_frame>
    <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is one of the most frequently utilized rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition.
There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients.
Typical YMRS baseline scores can vary a lot. They depend on the patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2).</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. BDI-II items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on severity of each item. The maximum total score is 63.
Scores: 0-13= minimal depression, 14-19=mild depression, 20-28=moderate depression, 29-63=severe depression</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline (day 0), after treatment (days 1-5), at immediate post-treatment follow up visit (day 6), at one month follow up visit (day 35).</time_frame>
    <description>A trained rater will administer the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-CSSRS). This questionnaire was developed to rate suicidal ideation and behavior.
It rates a person's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent and behaviors.
The scale identifies specific behaviors which may be indicative of a person's intent to complete suicide. An person exhibiting even a single behavior identified by the scale was 8 to 10 times more likely to complete suicide.</description>
