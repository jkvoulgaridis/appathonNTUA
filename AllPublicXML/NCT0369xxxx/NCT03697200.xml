  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitor therapy has become a standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for
      postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Up to 50% of
      postmenopausal breast cancer survivors exhibit significant aromatase inhibitor
      musculoskeletal symptoms, defined as severe joint pain and stiffness. Aromatase inhibitor
      musculoskeletal symptoms in turn has a negative effect on the women's physical function and
      quality of life, leading to discontinued aromatase inhibitor therapy and causing significant
      social and economic burden. Given aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms' profound
      effects, the management of aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms is an essential
      component in cancer care.

      The investigators propose to test auricular point acupressure- —an innovative, non-invasive,
      nonpharmacologic, and low-cost intervention- —to manage aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal
      symptoms in breast cancer survivors. Auricular point acupressure applies an acupuncture-like
      stimulation to ear acupoints without using a needle (i.e., seeds are taped to the acupoints)
      to treat illness/symptoms. Auricular point acupressure is particularly well suited for
      current challenges of unmet aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms management. The
      investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to (1) determine the efficacy of
      auricular point acupressure in relieving aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms, and
      (2) examine the inflammatory signaling of auricular point acupressure effects in breast
      cancer survivors treated with aromatase inhibitor. The investigators will also measure
      psychological, behavioral, personal, and social factors that may moderate or mediate the
      effects of auricular point acupressure. The investigators also believe inflammatory cytokines
      may partially explain the mechanism of action of auricular point acupressure for improved
      aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms and physical function, and plan to measure
      these.

      This study will identify a novel approach to manage aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal
      symptoms in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, with minimal side effects. If successful,
      the paradigm of pain management will shift from a traditional medical model to a larger
      integrative medicine and patient-management paradigm to avoid unnecessary evolution towards
      prolonged disability.

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-sf) questionnaire includes assessment of pain location and multiple aspects of severity of pain, numbness, tingling, and stiffness, including worst, least, average pain, and present, as well as the interference with daily activities. The Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-sf) has a total score ranging from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating more pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, pre- Intervention (4 weeks), post-intervention (8 weeks), one-month (12 weeks), 2-month (16 weeks), and 3-month (20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) consists of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing
Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day
Physical Function (17 items): stair use, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy household duties, light household duties.
The WOMAC score range from 0 to 96. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, pre- Intervention (4 weeks), post-intervention (8 weeks), one-month (12 weeks), 2-month (16 weeks), and 3-month (20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>QuickDASH outcome measure is used. At least 10 of the 11 items must be completed for a score to be calculated. The assigned values for all completed responses are simply summed and averaged, producing a score out of five. The value is then transformed to score out of 100. The score range will be 0 to 100. Higher score indicating greater disability.</description>

    <description>Patients with active points related to Aromatase Inhibitor Musculoskeletal Symptoms (AIMSS). The points for AIMSS include (1) points corresponding to body pain location and (2) three points known for alleviating stress and pain (i.e., shenmen, sympathetic, and nervous subcortex)</description>

    <description>The same procedure of APA will be applied but the tapes/seeds will be placed on different points (points not related to AIMSS). Participants in the Sham APA Control will receive APA on the five ear points comprising mouth, stomach, duodenum, internal ear, and tonsils. These points are chosen for the Sham APA Control for two reasons: First, they are distinct from the zones of the ear (and the points therein) associated with AIMSS and correspond to body regions in which BCS (Breast Cancer Survivors) are usually pain-free; second, they are equivalent in number to those points used in the APA treatment group and no negative impacts have been observed among these points in our pilot study.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Education Control will receive four, 15-minute weekly individual sessions in which the scheduling and duration of interaction with the study staff are identical to the APA and Sham interventions. Educational sessions are intended to reflect usual standard medical care per guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), while also meeting the needs of trial participation, including (1) the knowledge of hormonal therapy and side effects; (2) assessment and management of physical long-term and late effects; (3) assessment and management of psychological long-term and late effects; and (4) dietary (developed by Co-I, van Londen) and physical activity in Breast Cancer Survivors (BCS) (developed by Co-I, Stearns). These materials have been used by the research team, and clinical practice. Materials will be tailored so that they can be delivered within 15 minutes for each session.</description>

          -  Current use of corticosteroids or narcotics

          -  Ear skin disease
