  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to examine the development and appearance of
      embryos before and after freezing following a single controlled ovarian stimulation cycle
      using REKOVELLE® (follitropin delta) as the recombinant follicular stimulating hormone (rFSH)
      for controlled ovarian stimulation. The primary objective of the study is to examine how
      specific factors of embryo development or appearance are related to the chance of becoming
      pregnant.

      The ovarian stimulation protocol with REKOVELLE®, a new rFSH prescribed for ovarian
      stimulation, is individualised with a dosing regimen that is based on two parameters: the
      body weight and the level of a hormone, the anti-Müllerian hormone, (AMH), a parameter used
      to predict how the ovaries will respond to the ovarian stimulation.

    <time_frame>7 weeks after each embryo transfer</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical pregnancy is defined as at least one intrauterine gestational sac with fetal heart beat at week 7, from frozen thawed blastocysts. The correlation between morphological parameters (blastocyst score, timelapse score, blastocoele re-expansion) and clinical pregnancy rate will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative clinical pregnancy rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative clinical pregnancy rate will be calculated based on all participants included in the study and all clinical pregnancies recorded from fresh and frozen-thawed blastocyst transfers as the fraction of participants with at least one positive clinical pregnancy. The cumulative pregnancy rate will be plotted versus transfer number and versus time from start of REKOVELLE® treatment.</description>

    <description>The Intervention (solution for injection) is delivered with an injection pen. For women with AMH &lt;15 pmol/L the daily dose is 12 micrograms, irrespective of body weight. For women with AMH ≥15 pmol/L the daily dose decreases from 0.19 to 0.10 micrograms/kg by increasing AMH concentration. The maximum daily dose for the first treatment cycle is 12 micrograms.
For subsequent treatment cycles, the daily dose of REKOVELLE® should be maintained or modified according to the patient's ovarian response in the previous cycle. Based on the ovarian hypo/hyper-response in the previous cycle, the daily dose in the subsequent cycle should be increased (by 25% or 50%) or decreased (by 20% or 33%). The maximum daily dose is 24 micrograms.</description>

        The study aims to enroll between 1200 and 1500 cycles which is estimated to be sufficient
        for observing 616 single frozen-thawed blastocyst transfers. Patients can contribute data
        from one or more frozen-thawed blastocyst transfers. Further, the patient cohort will be
        recruited among the patient population of 8-10 public and private in vitro fertilization
        (IVF) clinics in Denmark.
