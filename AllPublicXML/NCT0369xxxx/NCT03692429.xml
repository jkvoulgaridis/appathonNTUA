  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label Phase I study aims at assessing the safety, cell kinetics and clinical
      activity of the CYAD-101 treatment administered 3 times with a 2-week interval between each
      administration in metastatic colorectal cancer, concurrently with a standard chemotherapy
      treatment. The standard chemotherapy treatment consists in 6 consecutive cycles of FOLFOX,
      administered with a 2-week interval. The CYAD-101 treatment will be administered at a
      specific time point within the third, fourth and fifth chemotherapy cycles.

      This Phase I study will contain two consecutive segments: a dose-escalation and an expansion
      segment:

      The first segment (dose-escalation segment) will use a 3+3 design to determine the
      recommended dose of CYAD-101 on the basis of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).

      The second segment (expansion segment) of the study will evaluate 3 injections of CYAD-101 at
      the recommended dose defined in the first segment, administered concurrently with FOLFOX, in
      a larger number of patients.

      This open-label Phase I study aims at assessing the safety, cell kinetics and clinical
      activity of the CYAD-101 treatment administered 3 times with a 2-week interval between each
      administration in metastatic CRC, concurrently with a standard chemotherapy treatment. The
      standard chemotherapy treatment consists of 6 consecutive cycles of FOLFOX administered with
      a 2-week interval. The CYAD-101 treatment will start at Day 3 of the third chemotherapy
      cycle.

      This Phase I study will contain two consecutive segments: a dose-escalation and an expansion
      segment:

      The dose-escalation segment will evaluate the safety of three injections of CYAD-101
      administered concurrently with FOLFOX in patients with metastatic CRC. A 3+3 design will be
      used to determine the recommended dose of CYAD-101.

      The expansion segment of the study will then evaluate three injections of CYAD-101 at the
      RecD defined in the first segment, administered concurrently with FOLFOX, in a larger number
      of patients.

      The Phase I dose-escalation segment will enroll a maximum of 18 patients (6 patients maximum
      per cohort in case of DLT) and the phase I expansion segment 18-21 additional patients.
      Patients from the dose escalation segment enrolled in the dose-level selected for expansion
      segment will be considered as part of the expansion segment for the statistical analyses. A
      maximum of 36 patients will be enrolled in the global Phase I study.

      The only chemotherapy regimen accepted in this protocol is the FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin and
      oxaliplatin). This chemotherapy regimen is one of the recommended standard regimens for this
      stage. The FOLFOX regimen will be administered according to a two-week cycle schedule.

    <time_frame>from month 1 up to month 10</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor cell death mediated by CYAD-101 may expose the immune system to new antigens, potentially boosting pre-existing tumor-related immunogenicities or inducing de novo anti-tumor immune responses. Evaluation and characterization of the study treatment mode of action, involving the characterization of the pre-existing and post/during-therapy immune response will be assessed. Moreover, the response of the donor against the allogeneic antigen present on the donor T cells may drive an immunological response clearing the CYAD-101 product. In part, the relative engraftment of CYAD-101 will provide some initial information concerning any potential HvG response (such as reduced persistence of the CYAD-101 cells after second and third infusion). Greater insight into any potential HvG response will be performed within this general immunological assessment of the consequence of CYAD-101 therapy.</description>
