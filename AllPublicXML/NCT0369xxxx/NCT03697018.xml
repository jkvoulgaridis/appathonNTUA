      evaluation of wear behavior and patient satisfaction of monolithic zirconia and zirconia
      reinforced glass crowns after follow-up periods 0,3,6,12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      two groups of patients will be selected according to special inclusion criteria n=13 in each
      group total of 26. each group will receive one of the crowns used in this study either (
      monolithic zirconia or zirconia reinforced lithium silicate glass) after crown delivery wear
      and patient satisfaction will be recorded at 0,3,6,12 moths follow-up periods.
