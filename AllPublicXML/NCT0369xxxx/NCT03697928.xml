  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to measure skeletal muscle metabolism in vivo during exercise using the
      non-invasive MRS technique. Specifically, acetylcarnitine and phosphocreatine (PCr) kinetic
      will be determined at resting, during exercise and during the recovery post exercise. The
      target population is adult healthy men, with a wide range of maximal physical capacity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dynamic changes in acetylcarnitine during the transition from resting metabolism to exercise
      (Acetylcarnitine on-kinetic) may modulate the mitochondrial activation speed and CrAT
      activity may determine the duration of metabolic inertia. Similarly, changes in
      acetylcarnitine during the sudden decrease in energy demand during the transition from
      exercise to resting metabolism (acetylcarntine off-kinetic) may also reflect the action of
      CrAT protein. To date, the only possibility to get information on CrAT activity is by taking
      a muscle biopsy and perform enzyme activity assays ex vivo. By dynamic MRS scanning, it might
      be possible to deduce information that reflects CrAT activity, thereby making the biopsy
      sampling unnecessary.
