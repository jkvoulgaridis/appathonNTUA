  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well MoleMapper, Visiomed, and confocal microscopy work in screening
      participants for melanoma. Analyzing images (photographs) made with three different portable
      imaging systems may be as good as a visit to a dermatologist's office for finding melanomas
      before they can spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical utility of images collected by an iPhone application (app)
      MoleMapper, and a professional grade portable imaging system (Visiomed microDERM DL200evo
      imaging system or 'Visiomed').

      II. To incorporate in vivo confocal images into the triage system in order to determine to
      what degree the information gathered in this modality changes the classification of a lesion
      assigned by a board-certified dermatologist.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo imaging of suspicious moles via iPhone app MoleMapper, Visiomed, and
      confocal microscopy. Participants then receive lidocaine subcutaneously (SC) and undergo
      shave or punch biopsy of suspected melanomas.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity is defined as recommend immediate biopsy (red) lesions correctly identified as red by the dermatologists. The nature of statistical data analyses will be descriptive and exploratory to estimate effect sizes and their variation as well as generate hypotheses for the future study design. Sensitivity will be estimated along with exact 95% confidence intervals.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Specificity of imaging modalities</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Specificity is defined as green (follow-up at annual skin exam) or yellow lesions (recommend examination by dermatologist in 3 months) correctly identified. The nature of statistical data analyses will be descriptive and exploratory to estimate effect sizes and their variation as well as generate hypotheses for the future study design. Specificity will be estimated along with exact 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Sensitivity by changes after consideration of in vivo reflectance mode confocal scanning laser microscopy (RCM) report</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary analysis will be done with the biopsied lesions that were analyzed by RCM. The dermatologists will be provided a report of the RCM findings as well as the VisioMed images and asked to make the same classification as above.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons who participate in the free skin cancer screening at the PDX Skincare Festival
             at Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) on May 19, 2018 and May 18, 2019 and are
             informed by a provider that they have a pigmented lesion for which a biopsy is
             recommended are potentially eligible to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:
