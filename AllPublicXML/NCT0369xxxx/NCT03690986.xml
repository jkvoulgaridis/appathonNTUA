    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well anti-semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) monoclonal antibody VX15/2503
      (VX15/2503) with or without ipilimumab and/or nivolumab work in treating patients with stage
      I-IVA head and neck squamous cell cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as VX15/2503,
      ipilimumab, and nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To evaluate the effect of VX15/2503 alone and VX15/2503 in combination with immune checkpoint
      inhibitors, ipilimumab or nivolumab, on the immune profile in the tumor microenvironment and
      in peripheral blood.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      To extend the previously reported safety profile of single agent VX15/2503 to the combination
      of VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors, ipilimumab or nivolumab, in patients with head
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive VX15/2503 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Beginning
      days 22-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      GROUP B: Patients receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on
      day 1. Beginning days 22-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      GROUP C: Patients receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1. Beginning days 22-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      GROUP D: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Beginning days 22-36,
      patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      GROUP E: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Beginning days 22-36,
      patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      GROUP F: Patients undergo standard of care surgery.

Multi-parameter flow cytometry will be utilized to phenotype immune effector cells. The impact of treatment on the circulating percentage of immune suppressor subsets that may serve as predictors of response to immune checkpoint inhibition.
