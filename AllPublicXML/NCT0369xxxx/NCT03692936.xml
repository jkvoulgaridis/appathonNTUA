  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computed Tomography Derived Fractional Flow Reserve (CT-FFR) is a noninvasive method for
      evaluating the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions by using coronary CT
      Angiography (CCTA) as opposed to invasive FFR examination under invasive coronary
      angiography. The purpose of the CT-FFR-CHINA study is to verify that the diagnostic
      performance of hemodynamically significant lesions by CT-FFR is superior than routine
      anatomic evaluation of diameter stenosis using CCTA alone using invasive FFR as the reference
      standard, exclusively in Chinese population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy of CCTA to detect and exclude
      coronary artery disease (CAD). One main limitation of CCTA, however, is a tendency to
      overestimate the severity of coronary artery stenosis against invasive coronary angiography
      (ICA). On the other hand, FFR, invasively measured under ICA, is recognized as the current
      gold standard in determination of coronary artery lesions due to improved long-term clinical
      outcomes when revascularization is guided by FFR instead of ICA. Moreover, prior studies
      indicated unreliable relationships between detection of obstructive anatomic coronary artery
      stenoses defined by CCTA and hemodynamically significant lesions by invasive fractional flow
      reserve (FFR).

      Recent advances in artificial intelligence and computational modeling techniques now permit
      construction of a 3-dimensional model of coronary arteries visible from CCTA images and
      computation of FFR anywhere in the entire 3D model noninvasively. Several prior prospective,
      multicenter studies have reported promising results for the diagnostic performance of CT-FFR
      using invasive FFR as the reference standard. However, the diagnostic performance of CT-FFR
      in Chinese population is not clear. Therefore, we hereby designed the CT-FFR-CHINA study to
      determine the hemodynamically significant lesions, exclusively in Chinese subjects. It is a
      prospective and multi-center trial with a total of 326 subjects enrolled at 4 Chinese
      centers.
