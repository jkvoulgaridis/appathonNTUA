      Introduction: Evidence indicates that muscle damage caused by exercise can lead to
      functional, biochemical and clinical damage. Therefore, it is pertinent to perform
      investigations related to the muscle damage marker, creatine kinase with clinical and
      functional responses. These outcomes encompass an intrinsic potential for understanding the
      real magnitude of interpretation of classic signals in athletic environments and monitoring
      of athletes, contributing to specific actions. Objective: To verify the correlation between
      clinical signs (pain and perception of recovery), functional (muscular strength) and the
      behavior of CK levels, in the moments following a simulated fight. METHODS: Six male
      parajiu-jitsu practitioners (34-44 years) were included in the study. The participants
      attended the collection site 4 times, with a 24-hour interval between sessions,
      characterizing the following collection moments: baseline, post-exertion, 24, 48 and 72 hours
      after the simulated fight. Data on pain (visual analogue scale - EVA), perception of recovery
      (Likert Scale), muscle strength (Dynamometry) and blood samples for CK analysis were
      collected. All parameters described were measured at all times of collection. For the
      analysis of the association between behavior of CK levels, clinical and functional variables,
      the Odds Ratio test and 95% confidence interval were used. For the gross values, the Pearson
      test was used according to the normality of the data.

      Participants will be intentionally allocated into two groups, G1 consisting of professional
      athletes and G2 consisting of amateur athletes. This division was carried out to guarantee
      homogeneous stratification between participants with level of conditioning and similar
      training. The anonymity of the participants will be guaranteed. There will be masking of the
      participants, investigator and evaluator of the results that were blind to the hypotheses and
      allocation in groups, adopted in the study. All participants regularly attended the same
      training center and no sports injuries that might compromise athletic performance will be
      reported during the survey.
