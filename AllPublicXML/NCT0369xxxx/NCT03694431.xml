  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: To effectively alleviate suffering and improve quality of life for patients with
      serious illness and their caregivers, palliative care (PC) services must be offered across
      multiple settings. Research is needed to determine how best to optimize home-based palliative
      care (HBPC) services to meet the needs of individuals with high symptom burden and functional
      limitations.

      Aim: The investigators will compare a standard HBPC model that includes routine home visits
      by a nurse and provider with a more efficient tech-supported HBPC model that promotes timely
      inter-professional team coordination via synchronous video consultation with the provider
      while the nurse is in the patient's home. The investigators hypothesize that tech-supported
      HBPC will be as effective as standard HBPC.

      Design: Cluster randomized trial. Registered nurses (n~130) will be randomly assigned to the
      tech-supported or standard HBPC model so that half of the patient-caregiver dyads will
      receive one of the two models.

      Setting/Participants: Kaiser Permanente (15 Southern California and Oregon sites). Patients
      (n=10,000) with any serious illness and a prognosis of 1-2 years and their caregivers
      (n=4,800)

      Methods: Patients and caregivers will receive standard PC services: comprehensive needs
      assessment and care planning, pain and symptom management, education/skills training,
      medication management, emotional/spiritual support; care coordination, referral to other
      services, and 24/7 phone assistance.

      Results: Primary patient outcomes: symptom improvement at 1 month and days spent at home in
      the last six months of life; caregiver outcome: perception of preparedness for caregiving.

      Conclusion: Should the more efficient tech-supported HBPC model achieves comparable
      improvements in outcomes that matter most to patients and caregivers, this would have a
      lasting impact on PC practice and policy.
