  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is being revealed that the more severe the damage of the endothelial glycocalyx (EG)
      layer, the more likely it is that the prognosis of the patients is poor. For that reason,
      research is being actively conducted on methods for reducing damage and promoting recovery of
      the EG layer.The natural regeneration process of the EG layer is up to 7 days. Considering
      the fact that it is quiet slow, reducing the damage of EG layer is considered to be very
      important for improving the prognosis of patients undergoing surgery, but there is no
      clinically proven method.

      One of the ways receiving attention to reduce damage of EG layer is to stabilize the layer
      through fluid therapy with albumin. The purpose of this study is to compare the protective
      effect of the EG layer according to the type of fluid (balanced crystalloid solution vs. 5%
      albumin) during surgery in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.
