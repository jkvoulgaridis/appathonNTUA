    <textblock>
      Guided bone regeneration (GBR) using bone graft and barrier membrane is a well-established
      technique for augmentation of atrophic alveolar ridges. There are many techniques for ridge
      augmentation involves the use of bone grafting materials, barrier membranes, possibly some
      tenting/fixation screws the stability of bone graft, space maintenance, angiogenesis, and
      tension free primary suture are essential for success.

      Common techniques introduced for horizontal ridge augmentation are Guided Bone Regeneration
      (GBR), there are many techniques for ridge augmentation involves the use of bone grafting
      materials, barrier membranes, possibly some tenting/fixation screws. For successful GBR,
      stability of bone graft, space maintenance, angiogenesis, and tension free primary suture are
      essential. Space maintenance with particulate bone graft should be provided during healing
      period. However particulate bone graft is easily migrated when grafted on the large
      horizontal bone defect. To reconstruct large bony defect or for the 3-dimensional ridge
      augmentation, bone tack on the collagen membrane or titanium mesh is required to contain
      particulate bone graft during healing but these procedures are surgically time consuming and
      technique sensitive.

      Sticky bone is biologically solidified bone graft which is entrapped in fibrin network.
      Sticky bone graft doesn't scatter because particulate bone powders are strongly
      interconnected each other by fibrin network.

    <description>Autogenous particulate bone will be harvested and a mixture of autogenous particulate and anorganic bovine bone mineral will be prepared at a ratio of 1:1
Venous blood will be drawn from patients' forearm and centrifuged at 2500 RPM/3 minutes and 4000 RPM/15 minutes to produce autologous fibrin glue and concentrated growth factors membrane, respectively
Sticky bone will be prepared by adding autologous fibrin glue to the particulate mixture, placed onto the defect and covered by the prepared concentrated growth factors membrane
For guided bone regeneration the particulate mixture will be placed onto the defect and covered by resorbable collagen membrane
Periosteal releasing incision will be done to provide flap advancement for tension free closure
Closure will be done using horizontal mattress and interrupted 4/0 polypropylene sutures</description>
