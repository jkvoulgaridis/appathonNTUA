  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed by the principal investigator, Dr. Andrea Veljkovic, and the St.
      Paul's Hospital Foot and Ankle Research Group, who will conduct the study. The study is being
      funded by Arthrex, Inc., the manufacturer of the Health Canada approved BioCartilage®
      Micronized Cartilage Matrix.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether adding BioCartilage® to microfracture
      treatment of osteochondral defects of the talus improves osteochondral healing as well as
      improving pain and function.

      Efficacy will be assessed primarily by outcomes scores as measure by the Ankle Osteoarthritis
      Scale (AOS) at the baseline and at multiple post-op followup visits. Additional outcomes
      scores will also be administered to compare general health and foot function between the two
      groups at baseline and at multiple post-op followup visits. X-rays and MRI will be used to
      assess the osteochondral healing rate.

    <masking_description>This study will be single-blinded. Group I and II subjects will be blinded as to whether they have received BioCartilage® in addition to Microfracture or Microfracture alone, as per standard of care. Investigators will be aware of the assigned treatment on the patients. Subjects will be aware of their assigned treatment after their surgery.</masking_description>

    <measure>Changes as Assessed by Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome will be administered 6 times per patient: within 21 days of surgery, 6 weeks post-op, 12 weeks post-op, 6 months post-op, 1 year post-op and 2 years post-op.</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire assesses pain and difficulty in both the left and right ankle. The range for the Pain subscale is from 0 to 100 and the range for the Difficulty subscale is 0 to 100. The range for the Total score (average of Pain and Difficulty) is 0 to 100. Lower values for Pain, Difficulty, and Total is considered better.
The scores will be compared to each other to analyze the change in pain and difficulty from the baseline (within 21 days of surgery) to the end (2 years post-op).</description>

    <measure>Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome will be administered 6 times per patient: within 21 days of surgery, 6 weeks post-op, 12 weeks post-op, 6 months post-op, 1 year post-op and 2 years post-op.</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire assesses activities of daily living and sports subscales. Both subscales range from &quot;Unable to Do&quot;, which indicates a minimum score of 0, to &quot;No Difficulty&quot;, which indicates a maximum score of 4. A better outcome would be a higher score for both subscales.
There is one last questions which asks the patient about their current level of function during their usual activities of daily living (daily living subscale) and sports (sports subscale). For both subscales, the range is from a minimum of 0% to a maximum of 100%. A better outcome score would be a higher score for both subscales.
Both of these subscales are not combined to compute a total score.</description>
