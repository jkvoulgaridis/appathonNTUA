    <textblock>
      This study wants to determine the influence of spontaneous hand gestures and gestural priming
      on stuttering in children with Down syndrome.

      Children with Down syndrome have inherently a low IQ (20-60), language deficiencies that
      cannot be explained completely by the mental disability and pronounced facial features. One
      third of these children also has fluency problems. Fluency problems in children with Down
      syndrome are normally stuttering and/or cluttering. This study focuses primarily on
      stuttering.

      There are many therapies for stuttering, but there are very few for children with Down
      syndrome. Many of these therapies request specific skills like self-reflection and
      self-judgment which are very difficult or impossible for people with intellectual
      disabilities. There is need for a new therapy that considers the strengths of children with
      Down syndrome. Therefore, this study will first observe what the impact of these strengths
      are on the stutter frequency and severity of children with Down syndrome.

      Strengths of these children are: a strong visual short-term memory, a big receptive
      vocabulary, imitation, sense of rhythm, interests in other people and the ability to use
      spontaneous gestures to compensate for their language problems. Consequently, this study will
      see with the effect is of spontaneous gestures on their stuttering.

      These gestures should not be confused with signs from a sign language or sign system. Signs
      are taught, while gestures appear spontaneously. In Belgium they often teach children with
      Down syndrome ' Speaking with Support of Signs'. This is a sign system where the children
      learn to support the key words of their sentence with a sign so that they are better
      intelligible.

      This study is observational and has three research questions. The first question is: Do
      children with Down syndrome who stutter use more spontaneous hand gestures than children with
      Down syndrome who do not stutter? The hypothesis is that the children who stutter will indeed
      make more gestures because they have to compensate for not only language problems but also
      fluency problems. The kind of spontaneous hand gestures will also be considered and if herein
      is a difference between the groups.

      Within this research question, the impact of the use of gestures on the stutter frequency
      will be investigated. The researchers believe that the more gestures they use, the lower
      their stutter frequency will be, because they follow the hypotheses that speech and gestures
      are controlled by the same brain areas. If the children know SMOG, they will also control for
      the effect of SMOG on the stutter frequency.

      The second research question is: 'Does gestural priming have an influence on the fluency of
      children with Down syndrome? Gestural priming is a secondary speech signal that gives
      feedback to the first speech signal by simultaneously mimicking the first speech signal. In
      this research a hand puppet will imitate the mouth movements of the participants in several
      conditions based on earlier research from Snyder, Waddell and Blachet. The hypothesis is that
      due to the function of mirror neurons, the participants will become more fluent. Mirror
      neurons are neurons in the brain that help progress speech by activating the motoric regions
      of speech when an individual sees someone speak and they can produce a neural basis for
      fluency by the perception of the second speech signal.

      The last research question is: Can gestural priming help someone through a stuttering moment?
      The researchers believe that gestures and speech are controlled by the same brain regions.
      Therefore, if someone makes movements while some else is in a stuttering moment, this might
      help the participant to break through the stuttering moment.

      Before the start of the study, language tests are done to see if the participants have a high
      enough language level to participate. They also get a stutter test to get an idea about their
      attitude towards their stuttering.

      The study itself is divided into three research questions. For the first research question,
      the frequency and kind of gestures are investigated. Next to that, the impact of these
      gestures on the stuttering frequency is measured. To collect this information, a spontaneous
      telling task and a retell task will be videotaped to be analysed.

      All the participants get a spontaneous telling task, namely the RTOS. In this test they tell
      what they see on a picture. The investigator first gives an example without explicit hand
      gestures and then the children must tell stories with three pictures. The investigator can
      encourage the children to make real stories and to not just numerate all the items on the
      picture. This can be a challenge because of their intellectual disabilities. If there is not
      enough spontaneous speech collected during the RTOS, the researcher will start a conversation
      with the child about a topic of the child's interests.

      In the retell task, the investigator tells a story and makes 'spontaneous gestures' while
      doing this. After that the participants need to repeat the story as well as they can. The
      length of the sentences will be adjusted to the language level of the participants. The story
      used is 'Pie for Bear' [Taart voor beer], a story that was adapted to people with
      intellectual disabilities by adding manual signs. For this study, the manual signs will be
      exchanged for spontaneous hand gestures. These spontaneous gestures will be decided in
      advance, so that it is the same for all the participants.

      For the second research question, only the group of children who stutter is retained and
      divided into three groups. Each group does the same procedure four times, with each time a
      different condition, based on the procedure of Snyder, Waddell &amp; Blachet. There are three
      experimental conditions and one control condition. In the control condition, the investigator
      gives a sentence and the participant must repeat it immediately after. The sentences will be
      at least three words long, depending on the language level of the contestant, and each
      session has 20 sentences. In the control condition no gestures or priming is used. The
      experimental conditions are the same, but priming is induced. In the first experimental
      condition, the participant gets a hand puppet that must make the same mouth movements as she
      does, but the puppet needs to start moving before the participant starts talking. In the
      second experimental condition, the participant does the same thing with the hand puppet, but
      she has to hold it behind a screen, so she cannot see it herself.

      In the third condition, it is the investigator who simultaneously mimics the participant with
      the hand puppet. The groups do all the conditions, but in a different order, so there is
      control for a saturation effect.

      For the last research question, the third condition will be retaken, but this time the
      investigator only moves the mouth of the puppet when the participant is in a stuttering
      moment.

    <measure>Spontaneous hand gesture frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>This frequency is measured twice for every participant, once in the spontaneous telling task and once in the retell task, over a period of 4 - 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This frequency is calculated by adding up all the gestures used by the participant and dividing it by the total of words the participant said. Tis total is multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. For example, if a participant used 10 spontaneous hand gestures in a speech sample of 50 words, he has a spontaneous hand gesture frequency of 20%. The speech samples are defined by the length of the videos. Every outing of the participant is included in the sample.</description>

    <measure>Stutter frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>This frequency is measured for the first, second and third research question, once per participant who stutters over a period of 4-6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This frequency is calculated for the children with Down syndrome who stutter. The total number of stuttering moments is divided by the total number of words in the speech sample. This number is multiplied by 100 to get the stutter frequency. For example, if a participant had 9 stuttering moments in a speech sample of 90 words, he would have a stutter frequency of 10%. Stuttering moments are defined by repetitions of short words, interjections, syllables or sounds, the prolongation of sounds and blockages. The stutter frequency is calculated in all the studies. The length of the videos defines the speech samples. Every outing of the participant is included in the sample.</description>

    <time_frame>This frequency is measured twice for every participant, once in the spontaneous telling task and once in the retell task, over a period of 4 - 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This might have an influence on their spontaneous hand gesture use. Therefore, the SMOG-frequency is calculated by adding up all the SMOG signs in a speech sample and dividing it by the total count of words in that sample. This number is multiplied by 100 to get a frequency. Experts with a SMOG-certificate are asked to differentiate the SMOG signs from the spontaneous hand gestures.</description>

    <time_frame>Correlation (1) is calculated twice for all participants, once in the spontaneous telling task and once in the retell task, over a period of 4-6 months. Correlation (2) and (3) are also calculated twice in the same tasks but only for the participants who</time_frame>
    <description>The correlations between all the above frequencies are calculated: We look for (1) the relation between the spontaneous hand gesture frequency and SMOG frequency, while controlling for the stutter frequency, we look for the relation between (2) the spontaneous hand gesture frequency and stutter frequency, while controlling for the SMOG frequency and we look for (3) the relation between the stutter frequency and SMOG frequency, while controlling for the spontaneous hand gesture frequency.</description>
