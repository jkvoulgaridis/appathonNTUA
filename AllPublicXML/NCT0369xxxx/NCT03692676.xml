      The UK CPRD data will be used to assess the characteristics of asthma patients who were
      prescribed ICS/LABA FDC before the index date and who initiated Spiriva Respimat, or received
      a higher dose of ICS/LABA FDC, or initiated LTRA, or switched to a new ICS/LABA FDC in the UK
      during the study period (September 2014-December 2017) enabling to assess potential
      channeling of prescribing to different patient populations.

          -  Had a diagnosis of asthma before the index date

          -  Being treated with Inhaled corticosteroids/Long-acting beta agonists (ICS LABA FDC)

          -  Patients who were new users of Spiriva Respimat, or LTRA, or patients who were
             prescribed a higher dose of ICS/LABA FDC, or patients who switched to a new ICS/LABA

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who were prescribed other Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) any time
             before or on the index date
