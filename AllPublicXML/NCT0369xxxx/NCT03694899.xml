  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that providing information to patients about
      excess opioid disposal, calling patients prior to their outpatient post-operative surgical
      appointment and providing a convenient drop box for opioid disposal will increase rates of
      FDA compliant disposal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that:

        1. By providing pre-operative patient education, a drop-box in a convenient location (the
           hospital pharmacy near the surgical outpatient clinic) and a reminder phone call prior
           to the post-operative clinic appointment, an increase in FDA-compliant unused opioid
           disposal rates to at least 40% will be seen.

        2. The investigator's guideline for opioid prescribing after operations that require an
           inpatient admission which the investigator established for general surgical procedures
           will satisfy the opioid requirements of at least 85% of patients undergoing a variety of
           operations from differing specialties.

        3. The utilization of guideline opioid prescribing and FDA-compliant unused opioid disposal
           will decrease the percentage of patients who are taking opioids at 6 months and 1 year
           after their surgery to less than 1%.

      The primary objective is to determine the effect of pre-operative patient education, a
      drop-box in the hospital pharmacy and a reminder phone call on the proportion of patients who
      dispose of unused opioids using a FDA-compliant method.

      Secondary objectives include:

        1. Determine in a prospective study whether our guideline for opioid prescribing after
           surgery which requires inpatient admission fulfills the opioid requirements of at least
           85% of patients undergoing a variety of operations.

        2. Determining the effect of guideline opioid prescribing and FDA-compliant unused opioid
           disposal on the proportion of patients who are on opioids 6 months and 1 year after
           their surgery.
