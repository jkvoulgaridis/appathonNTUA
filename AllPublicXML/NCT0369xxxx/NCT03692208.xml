      The purpose of this novel patient-facing disease management intervention, My Diabetes GOAL,
      is to develop and test a system embedded within the electronic medical record to engage
      patients in personalized goal setting and chronic disease management by: 1) establishing
      personalized goals of care based on comorbidities and preferences, 2) tracking diabetes
      measures against personalized goals, and 3) selecting the route and intensity of care
      management to help patients achieve their goals (e.g., telephonic care management, in-person
      care management, and self-care resources). This application can be used to individualize
      care, increase engagement with patient portals, and improve patient self-efficacy, as they
      take a more active role in their care.

    <description>Patients that are enrolled in the intervention arm will receive an email message via MyChart (University of Chicago patient portal) to complete an initial questionnaire. Completion of the questionnaire will be required prior to initiating risk factor tracking and opening the portal to requests for care management support. A study team member (diabetes nurse educator) will contact the patient, if requested via the survey, to initiate telephonic care management or links to additional support services. Upon completion the study, all patients will receive a post-survey via MyChart.</description>
