  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to uncover mechanisms of action underlying any long-term change in youth
      antisocial behavior by considering the role of child and family characteristics as mediators
      and moderators of change. The study design is qualitative interviews to be conducted
      face-to-face with parents of children previously diagnosed with Conduct Disorder and
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but no longer meet diagnostic criteria.
      Questions will be asked to understand participants' parenting experience over time (before,
      during and after their children's treatment).

    <description>Qualitative interview based on a phenomenological analysis will seek to understand from parents before, during, and after the treatment (previous intervention) about their interactions with their children, especially when problematic behavioural issues occur. All interviews were transcribed verbatim as much as possible, then subjected to a first round of open coding through identification of words, sentences or paragraphs expressing common ideas. Thereafter, a framework of themes was derived and interview content was organized systematically for analysis. The transcripts will also be rotated among researchers for the various stages of coding, such that each transcript was coded by at least two different people. This was to minimize subjectivity in coding and ensure the inter-rater consistency of the codes.</description>

        Study population consists parents of children who participated in a previous longitudinal
        study that investigates the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation and social skills
        training in treating Conduct Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
        The study ended noting that some children no longer meet the criteria of the disorders and
        based on existing literature, parental interactions may have a role in this phenomenon. As
        such, this research proposes to interview parents of these children to understand more.
