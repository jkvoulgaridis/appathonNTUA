  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate if adding expiratory muscle strength training to traditional voice therapy for
      individuals with dysphonia due to glottal insufficiency improves maximal expiratory pressure,
      acoustic and aerodynamic measures (i.e. amplitude, maximum phonation time, peak expiratory
      flow), and voice related quality of life.

    <description>This is quality of life assessment tool quantifying perception of the impact of their vocal disorder on various aspects of lifestyle. It is 30-questions in length and is divided into 3 subscales including emotional, physical, and functional, divided into 10 questions each. Each question scored from 0-4. Total score range from 0-120. Higher score indicates increased handicap.</description>
