      This observational retrospective study will describe characteristics of patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were initiating use or treatment with sodium-glucose
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and other diabetes medications (other glucose lowering
      drugs) in 2015-17 based on National Russian Diabetes Registry data.

        Data of T2DM patients consecutively included in the RNDR from January 2015 to October 2017
        will be included in this retrospective analysis. New users will be defined as individuals
        with T2DM either receiving a prescription of a SGLT-2 inhibitor or other GLD during the
        study period. Individuals with a previous issued/dispensed prescription of that medicine
        class during the preceding 1 year are not defined as new users. The year of the first
        issued prescription of the included medication classes during the study period will be
        denoted the index year. The group of other GLD will include all diabetes medicines,
        allowing combinations and monotherapy use except use of SGLT-2 inhibitors. The class SGLT-2
        inhibitors include mainly dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin.

        Since SGLT-2 inhibitors are relatively recently introduced on the market the population
        size and follow-up time is limited. Approximately 22,000 patients registered in RNDR will
        be included.
