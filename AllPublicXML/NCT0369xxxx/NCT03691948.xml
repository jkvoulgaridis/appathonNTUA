  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled pilot trial to establish methodological feasibility and
      determine whether a web-based, continuing dental education intervention regarding opioid
      prescribing risk mitigation strategies - consistent with ADA guidelines - produces
      pre-to-post changes in knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills pertaining to the use of
      risk mitigation strategies when prescribing opioids in dental practice. The current study
      involves completion of a self-report pre-test (dentists), randomization to complete ROPEs or
      attention control intervention, completion of a self-report post-test (immediately following
      intervention/control completion), and completion of 1-month self-report follow-up assessment.

Knowledge scale contains 5 items. 1 point is awarded for each item correctly answered. 0 points are awarded for incorrect responses. Scale ranges from 0 (least accurate knowledge) to 5 (most accurate knowledge)</description>

    <description>The ROPEs intervention is a self-guided, web-based continuing dental education intervention. Consistent with ADA recommendations, ROPEs consists of seven modules of active content: (1) Overview; (2) Background on the Opioid Epidemic; (3) Dental Pain Management and the Role of Opioids; (4) Universal Precautions Approach; (5) Screening, Monitoring, and PDMP use; (6) Providing Patient Education; and, (7) Case Vignettes. All key intervention content is delivered via video-based platform and includes downloadable practice aides and resources.</description>
