        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have a Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kilogram per square
             meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive), and body weight not less than (&lt;) 50 kg at screening

          -  Participants must have a blood pressure between 90 and 140 millimeter of mercury
             (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic at screening

          -  Participants must have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with normal
             cardiac conduction and function at screening, including: a) Normal sinus rhythm (heart
             rate (HR) between 45 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), inclusive); b) QT interval
             corrected for HR according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) between 350 milliseconds
             (ms) and 430 ms for male participants, and between 350 ms and 450 ms for female
             participants (inclusive); c) QRS interval of ECG &lt;110 ms; d) PR interval of the ECG
             less-than or equal to (&lt;=) 200 ms; e) Morphology consistent with healthy cardiac
             conduction and function

          -  A female participant must be of non-childbearing potential, defined as: a)
             Postmenopausal or b) Permanently sterile

          -  A female participant must have a negative serum beta‑human chorionic gonadotropin
             (b‑hCG) pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test (except if
             postmenopausal) on Day -1 (or Day -2 in the first treatment period in Part 2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants has a history of current clinically significant medical illness or
             certain laboratory abnormalities at screening

          -  Participant has a history of hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody,
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive, or
             other clinically active liver disease, or tests positive for hepatitis A virus IgM
             antibody, HBsAg or HCV antibody at screening

          -  Participants with unusual T wave morphology (such as bifid T wave) likely to interfere
             with QTc measurements

          -  Participants with a past history of heart arrhythmias or with a history of risk
             factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (for example, hypokalemia or family history of
             short/long QT syndrome, or sudden unexplained death at a young age [&lt;=40 years],
             drowning or sudden infant death in a first degree relative [that is, sibling,
             offspring, or biological parent])
