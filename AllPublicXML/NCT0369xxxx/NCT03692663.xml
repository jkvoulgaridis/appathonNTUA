  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre、single arm、open-label，to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      anti-PSMA CAR NK cells in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of anti-PSMA CAR NK cells in a
      3+3 dose escalation design. The Cohort subjects (N=3 or 6) will receive a single dose of
      0.5-3 x 107/kg anti-PSMA CAR NK cells on day 0, following a single dose of 60mg/kg of
      cyclophosphamide administered up to 6-7 days prior to the CAR NK cells. If the number of
      manufactured CAR NK cells does not meet the pre-specified minimum infused dose of 1 x 107/kg
      cells, then dose will not be administered, and the subject will be replaced in the study. If
      1 DLT/3 subjects occurs, the study will enroll an additional 3 subjects at this dose level.
      If 0 DLT/3 subjects or 1 DLT/6 subjects occurs, the study will advance to Cohort 2. If 2
      DLT/3 subjects occurs at dose of 1-3 x 107/kg cells, then enrollment in this Cohort will be
      stopped.The members of Committee on Safety of Drugs will be evaluate safety,and the dose will
      be de-escalated
