      The objective of this case-control intervention study is to explore the effectiveness of
      Concentrated Growth Factor (CGF) and Advanced Platelet Rich Fibrin (A-PRF) on Pain, Edema and
      Trismus After Impacted Lower Third Molar Surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, 75 patient, whose ages ranged between 18-30 and have an impacted lower
      third molar which is in vertical or mesiyoangular position and has class I and II ramus
      relationship and class B and C depth, will included. 75 patient will divided randomly into
      three groups as CGF, A-PRF and Control. After third molar surgery CGF and A-PRF will prepared
      and applied to the extraction sockets in CGF and A-PRF groups. nothing will applied to the
      control group. Post operative pain, edema and trismus will measured at 2nd and 7th days.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Edema-amount change of swelling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2nd and 7th days</time_frame>
    <description>In order to evaluate the amount change of swelling after the operation, horizontal and vertical measurements will be made from 5 reference points including tragus, lip corner, soft tissue pogonion, lateral cantus of the eye and gonion. The first measurement between the tragus-lip corner, the second measurement will be obtained by measuring the horizontal distance between the tragus-soft tissue pogonion. The third measurement will be determined by the measurement of the vertical distance between the outer corner of the eye and the gonion. to determine the change in the swelling measurements performed before surgery and at 2nd-7th days after surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trismus- degree of change (limitation) in maximum mouth opening</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2nd and 7th days</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum mouth opening will be determined as the distance between the right lower and upper right central.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post operative Pain: visual analog (VAS) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6th and 24th hours, 2nd and 7th days</time_frame>
    <description>For the evaluation of the pain, the visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to express the absence of pain in the initial part on a straight line (0) and the end part to express the unbearable pain (10).
0 (no pain)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------10 (unbearable pain) Higher values of the scale represent worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative symptom severity (PoSSe) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Post operative 7th day</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the change in postoperative quality of life will be done with a scale of post-operative symptom severity (PoSSe) consisting of 15-item questionnaire in which the effect of operation on eating, speech, sensation, appearance, pain, disease and daily activities is evaluated. This questionnaire was divided into subscales corresponding to seven main adverse effects, andfor each possible answer there was a score ranging from 0 to a variable number. For total possible answer there was a score ranging from 0 to a 97.9. Higher values of the scale represent worse outcome.</description>
