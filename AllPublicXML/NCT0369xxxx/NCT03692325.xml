  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying an immunotherapy drug, as a possible treatment for oral
      proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (OPVL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or combination of drugs to learn whether it
      works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug/s is being
      studied.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness (how well the drug works) of nivolumab
      in treating OPVL and or prolonging the onset of possible malignancy.

      Nivolumab is a type of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging the body's own
      immune system to attack cancer cells. Nivolumab has been demonstrated to activate the immune
      system to attack cancer cells in participants with different types of cancers. OPVL has a
      high risk for turning into cancer and the investigators are testing if nivolumab may help to
      shrink the white lesions in the participant's mouth and reduce cancer risk.

      In November 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nivolumab for the treatment
      of participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      (SCCHN). Squamous cell carcinoma is the kind of cancer that OPVL can transform into.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have histologically confirmed oral proliferative verrucous leukoplakia
             (OPVL), as defined by: multifocal lesions (≥ 2) or contiguous lesions ≥ 3 cm or a
             single lesion ≥ 4 cm in largest diameter (at least one lesion with any degree of
             dysplasia). (Note: no restriction on the length of time that patients have had one or
             more existing lesions)

          -  Willing to provide blood and tissue from diagnostic biopsies

          -  Any smoking history is permitted. A history of prior or current tobacco use is not an
             exclusion criteria. While discouraged, patients are permitted to continue tobacco use
             while on the study.

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)

               -  total bilirubin ≤2.0 g/dL

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use appropriate method(s) of
             contraception. WOCBP should plan to use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5
             months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after
             the last dose of investigational drug

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 iu/l or equivalent units of hcg) at screening. Pregnancy test
             will be repeated on the day of the first dose of study drug (before administration),
             although results of this test are not required for registration.

          -  &quot;Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)&quot; is defined as any female who has experienced
             menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral
             oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12
             months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or
             physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented
             serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use any contraceptive method with
             a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP will
             be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose
             of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (ie, who are
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require
             contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known carcinoma in situ (CIS) or invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.
             A history of a prior stage III (T1-2N1, T3N0) or IV (T1-3N2, T4N0) invasive head &amp;
             neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with surgery and radiation with or without
             chemotherapy. Patients with prior locoregionally advanced tumors treated with surgery
             alone are eligible.

          -  Existing significant autoimmune conditions. Patients with a history of Hashimoto
             thyroiditis who are stable on replacement hormone therapy are not excluded. Patients
             cannot be on long-term (&gt; 4 weeks) corticosteroids at doses exceeding prednisone 20 mg
             (or its equivalent) prior to enrollment. Short-term corticosteroid dosing is permitted
