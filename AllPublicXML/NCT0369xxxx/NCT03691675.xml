  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intro-stent restenosis, bifurcation lesions and small vascular lesion with diameter &lt;2.75mm
      is the indication of drug coated balloon. In the era of traditional coronary artery balloon
      dilatation, it is believed that muscle fiber of coronary artery great vessels is more
      abundant than that of small vessels, and elastic recoil and dissection are easier to appear
      upon dilatation, which will result in acute vascular occlusion and restenosis, so it is not
      recommended for great vessels to only receive PTCA therapy. But for patients with good
      angiography result without combination of serious dissections after predilation, the acute
      thrombosis seems to be a key factor for acute vascular occlusion. Traditional antiplatelet
      drug doesn't have a good effect, but the application of new-generation antiplatelet drug
      (clopidogrel, ticagrelor and tirofiban) has greatly reduced the occurrence rate of acute
      thrombosis. Therefore, under the guarantee of fully antiplatelet action of new-generation
      antiplatelet drug, for the patients with good angiography result without combination of
      serious dissections after predilation, Drug coated balloon seems to be an alternative of the
      stent. This research is to verify the safety and efficacy of Drug coated balloon in de novo
      coronary artery lesion with vascular diameter ≥2.75mm.

      Stable or unstable angina patients who accept drug coated balloon dilatation therapy with
      diameter stenosis≥50%, reference diameter≥2.75mm will be enrolled. OCT examination should be
      carried out after radiography, predilation, Drug coated balloon dilatation and follow-up.

      For target lesion, balloon should be used for predilation (the ratio of balloon diameter to
      vascular diameter being 0.8-1.0:1), and for good predilation effects, high pressure balloon,
      cutting balloon, dual-wire balloon and spines balloon can be adopted. OCT examination should
      be carry out after balloon satisfactory predilation. Satisfactory predilation radiography
      result is residual stenosis≤30%,TIMI 3 flow without major dissections (type C or higher) in
      NHLBI classification. OCT satisfactory result is residual stenosis≤30% without dissection, or
      with dissection but the dissection angle is ≤90°. Then carry out DCB balloon dilatation
      therapy. The ratio of balloon diameter to vascular diameter is 0.8-1.0:1, and both ends of
      DCB exceed the preprocessing area of lesion for 2-3mm, thus avoiding the occurrence of
      geographical mismatch. Dilation pressure is 8-10atm, lasting for at least 30s. Each DCB
      catheter can be used once only.
