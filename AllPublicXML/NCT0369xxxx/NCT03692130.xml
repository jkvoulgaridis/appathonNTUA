      group-treatment for depressive patients

    <textblock>
      In this study, a randomized trial is conducted in which the participants are allocated to two
      different care services (MAC-CBT® vs. progressive muscle relaxation). Participants are
      patients with depression who have been made aware of the group therapy by their treating
      physicians or psychotherapists or who have read the advertising in waiting areas or on the
      investigators homepage. An extensive psychometric survey will be conducted at the start of
      the study in an interview session with a psychotherapist, who also judges if the participants
      are able to participate in a therapy group. The MAC-CBT® group receives an eight-session
      group therapy, in which the aspects of mindfulness, acceptance and commitment are taught in
      detail. The control group will receive an eight-session treatment with progressive muscle
      relaxation. Input and output results are determined using validated survey instruments. In
      addition, the investigators will check the data for moderating variables (e.g. age, gender,
      previous treatments...).
