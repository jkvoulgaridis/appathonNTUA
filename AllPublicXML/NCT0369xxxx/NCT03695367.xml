        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is scheduled to undergo a unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh under
             general anesthesia.

          -  Has an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status of I, II, or III.

          -  Female subjects are eligible only if not pregnant, not lactating, not planning to

          -  Had any prior inguinal hernia repair except as a child (less than 6 years of age).

          -  Has a planned concurrent surgical procedure (eg, bilateral herniorrhaphy).

          -  Has a pre-existing concurrent acute or chronic painful physical/restrictive condition
             expected to require analgesic treatment in the postoperative period for pain.

          -  Has a contraindication or a known or suspected history of hypersensitivity or
             clinically significant idiosyncratic reaction to required study medications.

          -  Has known or suspected daily use of opioids for 7 or more consecutive days within the
             previous 6 months.

          -  Has taken any NSAIDs within least 10 days prior to the scheduled surgery.

          -  Has a medical condition such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, participating
             in the study would pose a health risk to the subject or confound the postoperative
             assessments.

          -  As per subject history and/or medical records, has active infection or is currently
             undergoing treatment for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus
