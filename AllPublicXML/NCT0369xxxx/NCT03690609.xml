    <textblock>
      The purpose for this protocol is to perform an open-label parallel-arm clinical study in
      healthy subjects to evaluate the efficacy of a nutraceutical product on chronic pain,
      vascular health, inflammation, and overall wellness.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label proof-of-concept human clinical study on the effects of consumption of
      a nutraceutical blend. Data collection will include a core set of data pertaining to chronic
      pain and inflammatory markers. Additional data collection will include blood pressure,
      weight, and overall wellness.

      An open-label study design will be used to evaluate the effects of consumption of the
      nutraceutical product CytoQuel. The product is marketed broadly for many types of
      inflammation-related health issues. The study is of 8 weeks' duration, with evaluation at
      baseline, 2, and 8 weeks of product consumption. Study participants will be randomized to one
      of two groups, taking either 3 caps once daily, or two caps twice daily.

      At each visit, the following measurements and procedures are performed: Blood pressure and
      ankle brachial index, questionnaires pertaining to pain and activities of daily living, and a
      blood draw. The blood is used for testing of cytokines and vascular health related
      biomarkers.
