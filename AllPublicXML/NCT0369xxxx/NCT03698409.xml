  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of literature on the cosmetic use of OnabotulinumtoxinA has suggested that the
      use of preserved saline exerts a local anesthetic effect, and reduces the procedure
      discomfort when used in reconstitution in lieu of preservative-free saline. However, this has
      never been studied in chronic migraine.

      While reducing discomfort is a desirable target in all procedures, it has a special
      importance in the use of OnabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine due to the numerous
      injection locations each session (31 sites) and the ubiquity of scalp tenderness in this
      population. In addition, the pain during procedure is a known migraine trigger for many of
      these patients.

      We hypothesize that preserved saline (known as bacteriostatic saline) produces lower
      procedure-related discomfort when used as a dissolving solution for OnabotulinumtoxinA in
      individuals with chronic migraine as opposed to using preservative-free saline.

      In addition, we hypothesize that reduction of procedure-relate pain during the injections
      will also result in reduced migraine/headache attacks in the week immediately following the
      procedure.
