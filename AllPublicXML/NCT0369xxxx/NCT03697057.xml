  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recovery of patients after general anaesthesia is usually estimated by using clinical
      signs and scores. Since there is a lack of the agreed objective methods for assessing
      cognitive and psychomotor recovery after general anaesthesia in ambulatory settings, the aim
      of this study was to evaluate three psychological tests for this purpose. Patients, who were
      scheduled for ambulatory gynaecological surgery, underwent 3 standard psychological tests
      before (T1), 15 minutes after the surgery (T2) and on discharge from the recovery room (T3).
      The tests used were Wechsler memory scale (test 1, working memory capacity), d2 - test (test
      2, concentration endurance) and computer-based 4-choice-reaction time (4CRT, test 3, reaction
      time) as well as Postanesthesia Discharge Scoring System (PADSS). The same test battery was
      used in healthy female volunteers, all test results were compared at the different time
      points.

    <description>Post Anaesthetic Discharge Scoring System (PADSS) is a clinically-based, objective scoring system used to measure the home readiness of patients following day surgery. PADSS consists of six criteria: ambulation, circulation (blood pressure monitoring), nausea/vomiting, pain and surgical bleeding bleeding. Each criterion is given a score ranging from 0 to 2, maximal score is 10. Only patients who achieve a score of 9 or more are considered ready for discharge.</description>

        Consecutive patients scheduled for ambulatory gynaecologic surgery were asked to
        participate in the study during the routine informed consent process for anaesthesia. The
        inclusion criteria are listed in previous Section. A group of healthy female volunteers,
        meeting the eligibility criteria, completed the same study procedure without a surgery at
        three matched time points; none of them was taking any medication at the time of the study.
        Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals.
