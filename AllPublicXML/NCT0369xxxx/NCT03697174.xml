      This is a randomized controlled human exposure crossover study. Investigators aim to
      investigate the acute health effects of ozone exposure in healthy young adults.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled human exposure crossover study among
      32 healthy young adults in Shanghai, China. Each subject will be exposed twice: once to clean
      air and once to 200 ppb ozone in a chamber for 2 hours. During the 2-hour exposure, each
      subject will be requested to alternate 20 minutes of rest and 10 minutes of exercise on a
      treadmill. The exercise workload will be adjusted to achieve the targeted ventilation of 25 ~
      27 L/min(approximately equal to 15 ~ 18L/min/m2 body surface area). Ozone will be generated
      by a silent electric discharge method (HTU-500, AZCO Industries Ltd., Canada) and introduced
      into the chamber. The temperature and relative humidity in the chamber will be maintained at
      22±1℃ and 55%±5%, respectively. Health examinations will be conducted immediately prior to
      exposure, immediately after exposure, 2 hours after exposure and again the next morning.
