  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-B) is a complementary, non-pharmacologic therapy that
      is being tested to see if it can help cancer survivors reduce their symptoms of pain, stress,
      insomnia, fatigue, or depression. HRV-B is an interactive procedure in which participants
      relax and breathe regularly while watching the a computer screen. The computer screen
      provides feedback that helps people increase their heart rate variability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer survivors often suffer from prolonged and persistent symptom clusters that can
      include: pain, stress, depression, fatigue, and insomnia; symptoms that have each been
      associated with inflammation. The number of cancer survivors in the United States is expected
      to triple by the year 2030. Thus, there is a compelling need to develop and refine effective
      methods to promote high quality cancer survivorship. Dysregulation of autonomic function is a
      key pathophysiological 'common denominator' whereby many cancer-related symptoms likely
      converge. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a valid, noninvasive measure of autonomic function
      with established pathological and psychophysiological attributes. Reduced HRV is a known
      mortality risk factor, and about 80% of advanced cancer patients exhibit autonomic
      dysregulation. Cancer survivors with reduced HRV have increased mortality risk relative to
      those with normal HRV. HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) is an interactive procedure whereby patients
      learn to increase HRV and restore autonomic balance. HRV coherence refers to a state of
      optimum HRV rhythm that produces physiological entrainment of HRV, respiration, and the
      baroreflex. With HRV coherence, consecutive inter-beat intervals cycle from maximum to
      minimum and back to maximum over a period of about 10 seconds, which is associated with
      increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic tone, and a heightened state of
      well-being including improved affect, cognition, and executive function. Previous research
      suggests that HRV-B interventions may be useful for reducing symptoms of: chronic pain,
      anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), heart disease, and insomnia.
      HRV-B thus represents a promising complementary, nonpharmacological therapy that merits
      examination for relief of chronic pain and related symptoms among cancer survivors.

    <intervention_model_description>Cancer patients will be recruited from the Cancer Institute at Greenville Health System. Random assignment to the HRV-B or control group will occur after baseline assessment. During the baseline assessment, participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire, including information about symptoms and feelings. Participant heart rate (pulse) and breathing will be measured for 15 minutes. Baseline heart rate will be measured with a sensor loosely attached to the wrist. Breathing will be monitored by another sensor attached around the abdomen by a belt. Each weekly HRV-B training session will last 30-45 minutes. In each session, heart rate and breathing will be monitored while the participant is viewing pleasant images on a computer screen. An Intervention professional will be present throughout the session. While viewing the images, the participant will be coached on how to control their pulse.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will attend an HRV-B training session once a week for up to 6 weeks. They will complete a SUSCRO Distress Inventory which includes a symptom cluster inventory related to distress. The inventory includes 12 questions which are self-rated from 0 (not at all) to 4 (most of the time). Lower scores indicate less distress and higher scores indicate severe distress.</description>

    <description>Participants will attend an HRV-B training session once a week for up to 6 weeks. They will complete the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ) which includes a symptom cluster inventory related to sleep patterns. The inventory includes 13 self-rated questions. Questions 1, 2 or 5 are used to determine the presence, frequency and duration of sleep symptom criteria. Questions 6 through 13 are used to identify significant daytime consequences of sleep disturbance.</description>
