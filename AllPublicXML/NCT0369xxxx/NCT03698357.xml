  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the effects of Interactive video balance-based exercise (IVBE)
      intervention and conventional rehabilitation on the balance and functional performance in
      stroke survivors. Fifteen participants will receive Interactive video balance-based exercise,
      while the other half will receive conventional rehabilitation.

    <textblock>
      Thirty individuals with stroke are recruited and allocated to 2 groups in this study. Fifteen
      participants in group A will undergo 30 minutes a day and 3 days a week interactive video
      balance-based exercise intervention for four weeks. Another 15 participants allocated to the
      group B will receive 30 minutes a day and 3 days a week conventional rehabilitation for four
      weeks. Time up go test (TUG), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES),
      Motricity Index (MI), Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) were assessed before and after
      intervention in both groups

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 4) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Participants perform a series of 14 functional balance tasks, such as maintaining a quiet stance, sitting-to-stand, shifting weight and reaching, turning in place, standing on one leg, and maintaining a tandem stance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Time Up Go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 4) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test is a quick, reliable, valid, and accurate method commonly used to test dynamic stability and functional mobility. In the test, participants stand up from a 46-cm-high armchair with back support, walk straight for 3 m, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down as quickly and safely as possible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 4) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>The MFES is a 14-item rating scale questionnaire that contains the original 10-activity Falls Efficacy Scale and 4 additional activities. It is used to assess confidence of not falling while performing daily activities.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Motricity Index (MI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 4) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>The MI reflects general muscle strength in persons with stroke.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Functional Ambulation Category (FAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 4) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>The FAC is based on the required level of assistance during walking in individuals with stroke.</description>
