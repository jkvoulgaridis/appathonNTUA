  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Nutrition plays a significant role in ICU treatment, and may influence mortality
      and length of stay in ICU. Enteral route (EN) is preferential to parenteral route (PN) in
      provision of daily nutritional requirements. When enteral route is insufficient, supplemental
      parenteral nutrition (SPN) is recommended. Optimal timing of SPN in acute phase of illness
      remains elusive. ICU patients suffer significant lean body mass loss, in majority, in the
      first 7-10 days of stay. Optimal provision of protein may prevent muscle wasting. Lean body
      mass is essential for optimal physical functioning after treatment. Although ICU mortality
      has been reduced lately, the number of patients going to rehabilitation after ICU stay has
      tripled. Patients after oncological surgery of the gastrointestinal tract may be threatened
      with impairment of physical functioning after ICU treatment.

      AIM: To compare the influence of early and late supplemental parenteral nutrition on
      long-term physical functioning in ICU patients after oncological surgery of the
      gastrointestinal tract.

      STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, multi-centre assessor-blinded study. METHODS &amp;
      ANALYSIS: Patients will be randomised into intervention group that would receive SPN on first
      day, and would be continued until 7th day of stay in ICU. Control group would receive SPN on
      7th day of stay in ICU, when it is not then already met via enteral route. Physical Component
      of SF-36 Scale at 6 month after ICU admission will be assessed.

    <description>We will collect data regarding changes from baseline SOFA score - to determine the extent of a person's organ function failure. SOFA scoring system is useful in predicting the clinical outcomes of critically ill patients. Patient can be scored from 0 to 24. If the patient is scored 0 than the patient is in a good state and predicted mortality is low, while 24 is the worst result with expected very high mortality rate.</description>
