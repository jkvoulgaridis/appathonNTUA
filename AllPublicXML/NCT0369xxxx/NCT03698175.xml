  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore whether a brief mental exercise (developed and widely
      advocated in the field of positive psychology) can change the processing of emotion-related
      information in a similar way as previously observed for antidepressant drugs. Healthy
      volunteers are randomly allocated to a 7-day practice of the &quot;Three Good Things&quot; (TGT)
      exercise or a previously used placebo exercise (unspecified childhood memory recall) with
      study participants as well as investigators being blind as to which practice is conducted.
      After a 7-day practice period, all study participants undergo testing with the Oxford
      Emotional Test Battery, an established battery of cognitive tasks that allow to assess how
      emotional information is processed. The working hypothesis of the study is that the TGT
      exercise, as compared to the placebo exercise, can push the processing of emotional
      information towards a prioritisation of positive (relative to negative) input.

      Background and objective:

      Previous research indicates that various physiological treatments for depression (especially
      antidepressant drugs) can induce positive biases in emotional information processing and it
      has been suggested that this might be a crucial common mechanism through which they exert
      their clinical effects. This study aims to investigate whether similar positive biases can
      also be induced by a brief mental exercise (developed and widely used within the field of
      positive psychology) that has previously been shown to have antidepressant and/or
      happiness-enhancing effects.

      Methods:

      Using a double-blind, parallel-group design, 100 healthy volunteers (male and female) are
      randomly allocated to a 7-day mental exercise practice conducting either the widely reported
      Three Good Things (TGT) exercise or a previously established placebo condition (unspecific
      childhood memory recall). After 7 days of practice, all participants undergo testing with the
      Oxford Emotional Test Battery in order to assess emotional information processing in
      different cognitive domains. This battery consists of a facial expression recognition task,
      an emotional categorization task, an emotional dot probe task, an emotional recall task and
      an emotional recognition task. In addition, prior to and immediately after the 7-day practice
      period salivary cortisol awakening response and subjective state (using various
      questionnaires) is assessed.

      Hypotheses:

      The working hypothesis of the study is that, similar to physiological antidepressant
      interventions, the TGT exercise (as compared to the placebo exercise) might induce biases
      towards positive stimuli in multiple cognitive domains.

      Implications of the study:

      This study will show whether engaging in a simple mental exercise can alter emotional
      information processing in a similar way as previously observed for antidepressant drugs and
      other physiological interventions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance in a facial expression recognition task</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed at day 8 after exercise has been started</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are presented with individual pictures of facial expressions of emotions. Each presented face displays one of six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or surprise). Each emotional expression is presented at different levels of intensity which have been created by combining shape and texture features of the two extremes &quot;neutral&quot; (0%) and &quot;full prototypical emotion&quot; (100%) to varying degrees. Examples of neutral facial expressions are presented as well. Participants are instructed to correctly classify each facial expression as angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, surprised or neutral both as quickly and as accurately as possible. Responses are made by pushing one out of seven labelled keys on a response box. Hit rates, false alarm rates, and reaction times for correct classifications are measured separately for each emotion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance in an emotional categorisation task</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed at day 8 after exercise has been started</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are presented with positive and negative personality descriptors and are asked to classify the valence of each word. These words describe either extremely agreeable/positive characteristics (e.g. &quot;cheerful&quot;, &quot;honest&quot;, &quot;optimistic&quot;) or extremely disagreeable/negative characteristics (e.g. &quot;domineering&quot;, &quot;untidy&quot;, &quot;hostile&quot;) and are presented individually in the centre of the screen. Participants are instructed to imagine themselves overhearing someone describing them with each of the words and to indicate as quickly and accurately as possible whether they would like or dislike to be described with each of the words. Responses are made by pressing a correspondingly labelled key on a button box. Reaction times for correct classifications are measured separately for positive and negative words.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance in an emotional faces dot probe task</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed at day 8 after exercise has been started</time_frame>
    <description>Pictures of positive and negative emotional stimuli (happy and fearful facial expressions) are presented individually together with a matched neutral stimulus (neutral face). On each trial, one stimulus is shown above and the other below a central fixation point. Subsequently, a probe appears behind one of the stimuli and participants have to correctly classify the probe as quickly and as accurately as possible. Stimuli can be masked (i.e. presented very briefly and followed by a jumbled face) or unmasked (i.e. presented for a longer period without a subsequent masking stimulus). Reaction times for correct responses are recorded and vigilance scores are calculated for masked and unmasked positive and negative stimuli by subtracting reaction time data from trials when the probe appeared in the same position as the emotional stimulus (congruent trials) from trials when the probe appeared in the opposite position to the emotional stimulus (incongruent trials).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance in an emotional recall task</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed at day 8 after exercise has been started</time_frame>
    <description>Following a delay period after the emotional categorisation task (about 15 min), emotional recall memory is assessed. Participants are asked to recall and write down as many words as possible from the emotional categorization task. Numbers of correctly and incorrectly recalled positive and negative words are measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance in an emotional recognition task</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed at day 8 after exercise has been started</time_frame>
    <description>Following the emotional recall task, emotional recognition memory is assessed by presenting participants with the original personality descriptors plus an equal number of matched distractor words (50% positive, 50% negative). Participants are asked to indicate for each word as accurately and as quickly as possible whether they recognise it from the emotional categorization task. Numbers of correctly and incorrectly recognised items as well as reaction times for correct recognitions are measured separately for positive and negative words.</description>
