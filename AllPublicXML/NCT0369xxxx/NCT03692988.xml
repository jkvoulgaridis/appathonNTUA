  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developed by Harvey M. Chochinov in 2005, Dignity Therapy (DT) invites individuals with
      life-limiting illnesses to reflect on matters of importance to them and compiles them in a
      narrative document for the patient to share. DT has shown to improve quality of life and a
      sense of dignity, as well as supporting relatives in the process of grievance. Featuring a
      gradual loss of memories of the past, decline of cognitive functions and awareness of self,
      dementia can be regarded as a life-limiting or life-changing illness, which is often
      accompanied by significant psychological stress. DT may help patients and their relatives
      reduce this stress. Yet, no studies have been conducted to determine the benefits of DT in
      patients with early stage dementia (ESD). This study investigates the feasibility and
      acceptance of DT by patients with (very) mild dementia (CDR: 0.5 - 1.5) and their relatives,
      as well as their overall satisfaction. This study further seeks to determine the effects of
      DT on sense of dignity, quality of life, dyadic coping, and levels of anxiety and depression
      in a randomized controlled design.
