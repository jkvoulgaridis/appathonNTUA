  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study of the pharmacokinetics of a novel 200 mg Ibuprofen Medicated
      Plaster. The study will be conducted as a monocentric, open, randomised, single and
      multiple-dose, two-period, crossover trial in healthy volunteers. A total of 16 healthy
      volunteers will be randomised.

      A wash-out period of 3 days is planned between the two periods. Each of the volunteers will
      be randomly assigned to one of 2 possible administration sequences.
