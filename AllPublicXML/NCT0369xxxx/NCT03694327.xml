      Given that tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US, the
      development of effective cessation programs is critical; mobile phone applications represent
      a novel, accessible platform for helping smokers quit. This research project seeks to compare
      the efficacy of two smoking cessation apps. In a blinded, randomized, controlled study,
      current smokers motivated to quit will use a smoking cessation app for 8 weeks.
