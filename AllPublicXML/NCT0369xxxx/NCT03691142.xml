  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare inherited genetic disease of autosomal
      dominant inheritance with a prevalence of about 1/5000. It is manifested by haemorrhage,
      mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (lung, liver and
      nervous system).

      Severe complications during pregnancy in HHT are rare but considered high risk. Intracranial
      or pulmonary haemorrhage, stroke and heart failure have been reported in some women with HHT
      during pregnancy. These complications occur most often in the second and third trimesters
      when maternal physiological changes such as peripheral vasodilatation and increased cardiac
      output are at their peak.

      Previous retrospective studies were conducted with numbers ranging from 40 to 97 patients and
      highlighted the importance of early screening of complications and specific management.

      The aim of this study is to describe, on a larger number of patients, the obstetric and
      neonatal complications in patients with HHT and followed in the French Reference Center for
      HHT.
