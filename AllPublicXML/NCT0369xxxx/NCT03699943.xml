    <textblock>
      This study assessed the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow concentrate and
      injected intra-cavernously into patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). Specifically, this
      study will evaluate ED treatment &gt;18 year old men, a demographic where the etiology of ED is
      attributable primarily to the loss of corporal smooth muscle in the penis. Study endpoints
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intracavernosal bone marrow concentrate
      administration for treating ED patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is characterized by abnormalities of the vascular system; most
      commonly, venous leakage (or veno-occlusive dysfunction) resulting from loss of integrity of
      the surrounding corporal smooth muscle. In the penile vascular system, the corporal smooth
      muscle is responsible for trapping the blood delivered to the corpora cavernosa via the
      arterial system.

      Bone marrow is enriched for cells with regenerative potential, including mesenchymal stem
      cells, which accelerate healing of damaged tissue. The possibility of using bone marrow cells
      in the treatment of ED is enticing since stem/progenitor cell populations are known to
      secrete various growth factors, possess anti-inflammatory activities, and can differentiate
      into cells of the penile architecture.

      This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow concentrate generated
      by a closed system device and injected intra-cavernously in 40 patients aged &gt; 18 years of
      age diagnosed with erectile dysfunction with low dose 30 cc (20 patients) or high dose 60 cc
      (20 patients). Safety and efficacy will be evaluated at baseline (prior to treatment) and at
      1,3,6 and 12-month follow up visits. The study will determine whether injection of bone
      marrow cells intra-cavernously is a clinically feasible, safe and reproducible approach for
      treating erectile dysfunction. A clinical registry will also be enrolling treating the same
      patient population (100 patients (20 cc)).
