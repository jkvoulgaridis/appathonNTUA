      Phase IV, open, multicentre and single-arm study. 50 HIV infection naive patients with severe
      immunosuppression will be recruited to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elvitegravir /
      cobicistat / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide as a first-line treatment.

      The patients included in the study will be treated during 48 weeks and will have to perform
      the selection/basal visit, week 4 visit, week 8 visit, week 12 visit, week 24 visit, week 48
      visit and follow up visit.
