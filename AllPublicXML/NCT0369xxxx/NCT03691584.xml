      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, PK and safety study in a maximum of 25 healthy
      subjects who have provided a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. The dose planned to be
      administered in this study is an iv infusion of 30 mg TP 6076 q24h for 4 consecutive days
      (starting on Day 1 and ending on Day 4).

      Subjects will be randomized to undergo a BAL at a single time point: either 2, 4, 8, or 24
      hours after the start of the final TP-6076 iv infusion on Day 4. The BAL will be conducted in
      5 different subjects at each of the 4 time points, adding up to a total of 20 subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The following inclusion criteria must be met for a subject to be eligible for
             inclusion in the study:

               1. Status : Healthy subject

               2. Gender : Male or female

               3. Age : 18 to 50 years, inclusive, at screening

               4. Body mass index (BMI) : 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at screening

               5. Weight : 50 to 105 kg, inclusive, at screening

               6. At screening, females must be non-pregnant and non-lactating, or of non
                  childbearing potential (either surgically sterilized or physiologically incapable
                  of becoming pregnant, or at least 1 year post menopausal [amenorrhoea duration of
                  12 consecutive months]); non-pregnancy will be confirmed for all females by a
                  serum pregnancy test conducted at screening, admission to the CPU, and follow up.

               7. Post-menopausal females using hormone replacement therapy should be on a stable
                  regimen and be using this since at least 3 months prior to the first study drug
                  administration.

               8. Female subjects of childbearing potential who have a fertile male sexual partner
                  must agree to use adequate contraception from screening until 90 days after the
                  follow up visit. Adequate contraception will be methods with low user dependency
                  (ie, implanted hormonal contraception, an intrauterine device, an intrauterine
                  hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, and/or a sole vasectomised
                  male partner with medical assessment). Also, total abstinence, in accordance with
                  the lifestyle of the subject, is acceptable.

               9. Male subjects, if not surgically sterilized, must agree to use adequate
                  contraception when engaging in sexual activity with a female of childbearing
                  potential and not to donate sperm from admission to the CPU until 90 days after
                  the follow-up visit. Adequate contraception for the male subject (and his female
                  partner) will be methods with low user dependency (ie, implanted hormonal
                  contraception, an intrauterine device, an intrauterine hormone releasing system,
                  bilateral tubal occlusion, and/or a sole vasectomised male subject with medical
                  assessment). Also, total abstinence, in accordance with the lifestyle of the
                  subject, is acceptable.

                  admission to the CPU. An exception is made for hormonal contraceptives and a
                  stable regimen of hormone replacement therapy, which may be used throughout the
                  study.

              11. All over-the-counter medication, vitamin preparations and other food supplements,
                  or herbal medications (eg, St. John's Wort) must have been stopped at least 14
                  days prior to admission to the CPU. An exception is made for paracetamol, which
                  is allowed up to admission to the CPU.

              12. Ability and willingness to abstain from alcohol, methylxanthine-containing
                  beverages or food (coffee, tea, cola, chocolate, energy drinks), and grapefruit

              13. Good physical and mental health on the basis of medical history, physical
                  examination, clinical laboratory, ECG, and vital signs, as judged by the
                  Investigator.

              14. Willing to comply with the study procedures.

              15. Willing and able to sign the ICF.
