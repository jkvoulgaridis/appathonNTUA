    <textblock>
      Twelve (12) SPMS subjects will be enrolled in this study in two dose cohorts. Each subject
      will receive SCM- 010 by intrathecal (IT) administration at baseline and will be followed up
      for 24 weeks for efficacy and 48 weeks for safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects (18-60 years of age) diagnosed with SPMS.

          2. SPMS defined as relapsing-remitting disease followed by progression of disability
             independent of or not explained by multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses for at least 2
             years.

          3. Subjects should be ambulatory with an EDSS score of 3-6.5 (inclusive) at screening and
             baseline visits.

          4. Subjects should be able to go through a lipoaspiration procedure, evaluated by the
             study's plastic surgeon.

          5. Women capable of child bearing must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening
             and baseline visits.

          6. Subjects must use an adequate contraceptive method throughout the study.

          7. Coagulation tests including INR, PTT and prothrombin time (PT) within normal range.

          8. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements for the
             duration of the study.

          9. Ability to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or primary progressive multiple
             sclerosis (PPMS) as defined by the revised McDonald criteria.

          2. Any chronic central nervous system (CNS) disease other than SPMS.

          3. Clinical relapse within 3 months prior to study entry.

          4. Subjects diagnosed with any systemic autoimmune disease.

          5. Contraindications or inability to undergo lumbar puncture (LP) procedure and or
             intrathecal administration.

          6. Severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL).

          7. Abnormal renal function (serum creatinine more than 1.5xULN or creatinine clearance
             &lt;30 ml/min).

             disease in the past, was treated and is currently disease - free for at least 7 years,
             may be considered eligible. In this case the sponsor medical expert approval is
             required.

         11. Previous cell therapy treatment.

         12. Previous total body irradiation or total lymphoid irradiation.

             any other cytotoxic agent.

         15. Previous use of Fingolimod or Dimethyl Fumarate within 2 months prior to screening.
             Subjects who were treated with any of these medications will be excluded if they do
             not have a lymphocyte count within normal range at screening.

         16. Previous use of Teriflunomide within 12 months if no accelerated elimination procedure
             was used.

         17. Previous treatment with immunomodulators (including IFNÎ² 1a and 1b, and IV
             Immunoglobulin (IVIG) or Glatiramer Acetate (GA) within 2 months prior to screening.

         18. A known history of sensitivity to aminoglycosides and or to Vancomycin.

         19. A known history of sensitivity to Gadolinium.

         20. Inability to successfully undergo MRI scanning.

         21. Treatment with any kind of steroids or ACTH during the last 30 days prior to
             screening.

         22. Subjects with clotting disorders or receiving treatment with anticoagulants.

         23. Any relevant medical, surgical, or psychiatric condition, laboratory value, or
             concomitant medication which, in the opinion of the Principle Investigator, makes the
             subject unsuitable for study entry or potentially unable to complete all aspects of
             the study.

         24. Subjects with BMI &lt; 20.

         25. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.
