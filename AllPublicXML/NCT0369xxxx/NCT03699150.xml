    <textblock>
      Background: It is well known that health risks change during lifespan. The weight of a single
      risk factor increases with aging. The clinical significance of a single risk factor is clear
      but there is a lack on the effectof multiple risk factors linked together along different
      hormones condition of women's life in particular regarding to metabolic syndrome,
      osteoporosis, and thromboembolic risk.

      Aim: 1) characterization and follow up of cardiometabolic risk in women of childbearing age;
      2) characterization and follow up of cardiometabolic risk and osteoporosis in
      menopausal-transition women and in post-menopausal women;

      but there is a a lack on the effectof multiple risk factors linked together along different

      osteoporosis, and thromboembolic risk. Moreover some pathological but reversible conditions
      during pregnancy may represent an incursion in metabolic syndrome and a sing of future
      cardiovascular disease.

      Aim: 1) characterization and follow up of cardiometabolic risk in women of childbearing age;
      2) characterization and follow up of cardiometabolic risk and osteoporosis in
      menopausal-transition women and in post-menopausal women; in outpatients referring to FTGM
      Ambulatory of cardiovascular gynecology and osteoporosis in Pisa.
