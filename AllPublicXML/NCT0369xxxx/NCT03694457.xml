  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study consists in comparing two surgical approaches (deltopectoral versus
      lateral deltoid splitting) in the treatment of proximal humerus fractures treated with a
      reversed total shoulder arthroplasty The assessment will focus on clinical (clinical scores,
      efficacy, safetyâ€¦) and radiological results, between these two types of surgical approaches
      by using a prospective, randomized analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2 main surgical approaches in total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) are the anterior approach
      (deltopectoral) and the lateral one (deltoid splitting) (18).

      Their advantages and drawbacks have not been clearly evaluated in proximal humerus fracture
      treated with an arthroplasty.

      The goal of the study is to compare the results between patients (older than 65yo) presenting
      a proximal humerus fracture treated with a reversed shoulder arthroplasty performed through
      an anterior approach or a lateral one.
