  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial will be to link novel mechanistic findings with clinical phenotypes
      and outcomes in the context of an intervention (Dupilumab) that acts directly on our
      mechanistic findings, to directly inform endotype-direct targeted therapy in asthma. The
      potential impact is great, because an important knowledge gap is a practically obtained
      predictive biomarker that could inform which patients would more greatly benefit from such
      therapy. This trial will inform endotype personalized therapy on patients with uncontrolled
      asthma, who will likely benefit from Dupilumab as a first line therapy and prove the concept
      that a therapy that directly acts on mechanistic endotypes can help inform first line therapy
      which has not been well elucidated prior. This trial will allow us to expand our
      understanding of asthma immunopathogenesis utilizing a genotype approach to personalized
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group phase 2 clinical trial.

      Patients will be genotyped and categorized as those with: 1) the wild type allele
      (Q576/Q576), 2) heterozygous allele (Q576/R576), or 3) homozygous mutant allele (R576/R576);
      the genotype associated with more severe disease.

      After a run-in period of 2-4 weeks to determine asthma control, subjects who fulfill all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either subcutaneous Dupilumab or
      placebo (1:1 randomization allocation ratio).

      This study addresses fundamental mechanisms by which the IL-4Rα-R576 variant drives the
      TH2/TH17 disease endotype and the influence of this variant on response to Dupilumab therapy.
      It brings together individuals with deep clinical and scientific expertise in allergic
      diseases, including epidemiology, genetics, inflammation, and tolerance mechanisms to
      investigate, in a coordinated strategy, the hypothesis that the IL-4Rα-R576 variant drives
      TH2/TH17 cell inflammation by subverting allergen-specific iTreg cells into TH17 cells.
      Asthmatics bearing this endotype will be particularly likely to favorably respond to
      Dupilumab therapy by virtue of its prevention of iTreg cell reprogramming into TH17-like
      cells, potentially leading to their long-term stability and potential for sustained immune
      tolerance.
