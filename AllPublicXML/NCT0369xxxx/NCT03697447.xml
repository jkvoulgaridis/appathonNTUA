  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical massage or endermotherapyTM is applied to scar tissue with the intended
      therapeutic value being the promotion of structural or physiological changes. These proposed
      changes are meant to induce more pliability, so that skin possesses the strength and
      elasticity required for normal mobility. The advantage of mechanical massage compared to
      manual massage is that it provides a standard dosage using rollers and suction valves to
      mobilize the tissue. However, research documenting and supporting this effect is lacking. The
      objective of this proposal is to document the effect of 12 weeks of endermotherapy treatment
      on hypertrophic scar characteristics, including erythema, pigmentation, pliability, and
      thickness in adult burn survivors and their subjective evaluation of itch, pain and overall
      scar outcome through a prospective, randomized, controlled, within-patient, single-blinded
      study.
