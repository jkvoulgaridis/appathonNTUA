    <textblock>
      It's a single center study in Canada.

      This will be a single centred prehospital multi-period cluster crossover feasibility trial,
      (see Figure 2a) enrolling patients in Ottawa, Ontario, who are treated by paramedics from the
      Ottawa Paramedic Service, who have been trained in the use of the automated oxygen delivery
      device. We will be using the FreeO2 device. Patients requiring oxygen therapy during
      prehospital transportation will be enrolled. No randomization will occur within this single
      centred feasibility study

      Patients requiring oxygen therapy during the prehospital transportation will be enrolled and
      will be included as soon as they are placed into the ambulance, until the arrival of the
      vehicle to a hospital.

      Each patient will be randomized into one of two groups according to the usual oxygen therapy
      or oxygen therapy protocol with the automated system FreeO2.

      In both groups, SpO2 will be collected continuously every second FreeO2 monitoring, in
      addition to the collection of vital signs carried out by the staff according to the
      standards.
