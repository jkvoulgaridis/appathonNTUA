          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of relapsed/metastatic triple receptor negative
             breast cancer (TNBC).TNBC is defined negatively expression of estrogen(ER),
             progesterone(PR) and human epidermal receptor-2(HER2).If there is a pathology report
             of the metastasis, take the histopathology of the metastases as standard. Negative of
             ER and PR is defined as expression of ER,PR&lt;1% of the tumor cells by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER2-negative is defined as a score of 0 and 1+ by IHC, or
             IHC 2+ &amp; fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)negative. If the ER2 test result is 0
             or 1+ by IHC, FISH detection is optional, but the result must be negative.

             treatment is considered as failure of standard therapy.

          -  According to RECIST 1.1 , patients must have at least one measurable lesion that can
             be accurately assessed at baseline.

        (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than/equal to 3 times ULN, or less than/equal to
        5 times ULN if known liver metastases; Total bilirubin less than/equal to 1.5 within
        institutional limit of normal (ULN); Serum creatinine less than/equal to 1.5 times ULN;
        Electrolyte: magnesium greater than/equal to normal.
