      The aim of the PELICAN trial is to investigate the survival benefit of RFA plus standard
      palliative chemotherapy as compared to palliative chemotherapy alone in patients with LAPC
      after 2 months of induction chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in the Netherlands. Each
      year around 900 patients in the Netherlands are diagnosed with irresectable locally advanced
      pancreatic cancer (LAPC), which has a median survival of 7.9 months. Standard treatment is
      palliative chemotherapy, which offers only a very limited survival benefit. Radiofrequency
      ablation (RFA) is a new ablative technique for LAPC, which is feasible and safe and has been
      suggested to improve survival. A randomized controlled trial has not yet been performed.

      The aim of the PELICAN trial is to investigate the survival benefit of RFA plus standard
      palliative chemotherapy as compared to palliative chemotherapy alone in patients with LAPC
      after 2 months of induction chemotherapy. In a randomized controlled parallel-group
      superiority multicenter phase III clinical trial.

      The intervention will be RFA followed by chemotherapy (gemcitabine monotherapy,
      nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX). The comparison will be standard palliative
      treatment consisting of gemcitabine monotherapy, nab-gemcitabine plus gemcitabine or
      FOLFIRINOX Primary endpoint: Overall survival. Secondary endpoints: Progression free
      survival, complications, pain, radiological tumor response, CA-19.9 and CEA response, quality
      of life, immunomodulation and total direct and indirect costs.

          3. Previous surgical, local ablative or radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer or

               -  Positive regional lymph nodes metastases are not a reason for exclusion. Lymph

                  International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS). Suspicious lymph nodes
                  only on radiologic basis are not considered as metastasis. Only when suspicion is
                  high due to large infiltration, pathological examination by FNA can be
                  considered.
