  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will include a safety run-in phase (Stage 1) and a randomization phase (Stage 2).

      The purpose of Stage 1 is to evaluate the safety of cobimetinib when administered in
      combination with niraparib (Cohort 1) and cobimetinib with niraparib plus atezolizumab
      (Cohort 2).

      Stage 1 will enable patient enrollment in the randomized phase of the study (Stage 2) with
      both regimens at the recommended dose levels from Stage 1.

      Stage 2 is a randomized, dose-expansion phase, evaluating clinical outcomes in patients with
      advanced platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.

      All patients will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression (according to
      &quot;Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&quot; (RECIST), Version 1.1, unacceptable toxicity,
      death, or patient or investigator decision to withdraw, whichever occurs first.
