  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linked color imaging (LCI) is newly developed image-enhancing endoscopy technology that
      differentiates the red color spectrum more effectively than white light imaging thanks to its
      optimal pre-process composition of light spectrum and advanced signal processing. This
      technology, combined in the latest generation Fujifilm's endoscopes (Fujifilm Co, Tokyo,
      Japan) with new high-performance LED illumination system, enhances the visibility of colonic
      mucosal vessels and might increase the detection rate of colorectal polyps. Data available
      regarding colorectal polyp or adenoma detection with LCI are encouraging but are scanty and
      limited to back-to back studies.

      This two parallel arms, randomized, multicenter trial is aimed at evaluating whether LCI is
      superior to WL endoscopy in terms of adenoma detection

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50-75 years-old subjects participating in the regional screening program undergoing their
      first colonoscopy following a positive immunochemical fecal occult blood test (FIT) and
      meeting all eligibility criteria are randomised 1:1 to LCI (LCI group) or WLI (WL) during
      insertion and withdrawal phase of colonoscopy. A randomisation list for each participating
      center was produced by the coordinating center via computer-generated treatment code list.
      Randomisation is stratified by gender, age (50-60, 61-729 years) and screening history (first
      vs subsequent test) through an online centralised study database.All procedures are performed
      with a high-definition ELUXEO 700 series videocolonscopes with or without magnification
      (EC-760R, EC-760ZP, FUJIFILM Co., Tokyo).

      The primary outcome measure is the ADR, defined as the proportion of participants with at
      least one adenoma (per-patient analysis).
