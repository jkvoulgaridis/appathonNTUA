    <textblock>
      Study AG348-C-010 is a multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics,
      and pharmacodynamics of treatment with AG-348 in adult participants with
      non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT). This study will include a 24-week core period
      followed by a 2-year extension period for eligible participants. Approximately 17
      participants with NTDT will be enrolled. The initial dose of AG-348 will be 50 milligrams
      (mg) twice daily (BID) with one potential dose-level increase to 100 mg BID, at the Week 6
      visit based on the participant's safety and hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations.
