  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      International, multicentre, open-label proof of concept study exploring two different dose
      groups of the allogeneic dendritic cell vaccine, DCP-001. Cohort 1 consists of 10 patients
      that will receive 25E6 DCP-001 cells per vaccination and Cohort 2 consists of 10 patients who
      will receive 50E6 DCP-001 cells per vaccination. All patients will be given two additional
      booster vaccinations of 10E6 cells. Each patient will be followed up for 12 months after the
      4th vaccination. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Sera and cell samples (blood
      and bone marrow) will be collected for assessment of efficacy (MRD evaluation) and immune
      response monitoring.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of AML according to WHO2016 criteria, including cytological,
             molecular and cytogenetic criteria (except acute pro-myelocytic leukaemia/APL).

          2. In CR1 (first complete remission) or CRi (incomplete blood count recovery) documented
             by bone marrow examination up to one month before vaccination; CR defined as less than
             5% blasts in normo-cellular bone marrow, ANC &gt;1*E9/L, platelet count &gt;100*E9/L, no
             evidence of extra-medullary disease. Patients in CRi (patients with &lt;5% blasts but
             with incomplete blood count recovery) should have platelets &gt;50 E9/L.

          3. MRD as defined by multicolour flow cytometry (MFC) at a value of &gt; 0.1%, or detection
             of specific molecular abnormalities such as NPM1 mutation.

          4. Patients that are in CR1 or CRi. Patients not having undergone consolidation therapy
             must have been in CR1 for at least 1 month prior to enrolment. Patients treated with
             hypomethylating agents must have been given at least two cycles and up to a maximum of

             controlled limited basal cell skin cancer.

         10. Pregnant or lactating females.

         11. Major surgical procedure (including open biopsy) within 28 days prior to the first
             study treatment, or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of
             the study treatment.

         12. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt; 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic &gt; 100 mm Hg) or
             clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease.

         13. Evidence of any other medical conditions (such as psychiatric illness, physical
             examination or laboratory findings) that may interfere with the planned treatment,
             affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk from treatment-related
             complications.

         14. Known HIV, Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C infections.

         15. History of hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product or to any
