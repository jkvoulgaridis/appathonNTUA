  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately half a million Veterans receiving services at the VA have Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is strongly associated with cognitive functioning deficits in areas of
      concentration, attention, memory, learning, verbal abilities, processing speed, and
      multitasking. Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) is an evidence-based intervention for
      cognitive problems that is effective in other Veteran populations such as those with a
      history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), but CCT has not yet been tested in Veterans with
      PTSD who don't have a history of TBI. The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of CCT in Veterans who have been treated for PTSD but continue to have
      cognitive functioning deficits. The investigators will examine feasibility, acceptability,
      participant characteristics, and effect size estimates in preparation for a fully-powered RCT
      of CCT for PTSD-related cognitive functioning deficits.

  <detailed_description>

      Project Background: PTSD is associated with deficits in cognitive functioning including
      memory, learning, processing speed, concentration, attention, and executive functioning.
      Though many Veterans benefit from evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP) for PTSD, many Veterans
      have cognitive functioning deficits even after completing EBP for PTSD. There are no
      evidence-based treatments for these Veterans. Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) is
      improves cognitive functioning in Veterans with brain injury history, but is not yet tested
      in Veterans with PTSD.

      Project Aims: This study will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and participant
      characteristics, and estimate effect sizes, in a pilot test of CCT for Veterans with
      PTSD-related cognitive problems. Data from this study will form the basis for a future, fully
      powered trial testing the effectiveness of CCT for cognitive problems in Veterans with PTSD.

      Project Methods: The investigators will recruit Veterans from local VA mental health clinics,
      using the VA's Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) to identify potentially eligible Veterans if
      needed. The investigators will compare CCT vs. treatment as usual for 36 Veterans with
      PTSD-related cognitive functioning deficits. The investigators will calculate rates of
      recruitment, retention, and intervention participation. Statistical significance will be
      examined, though the investigators' focus will be on effect size estimates, score ranges, and
      variability to plan for a follow-up, fully powered RCT.

      Anticipated Impact: PTSD-related cognitive functioning deficits are a significant problem for
      many Veterans. CCT is an effective cognitive rehabilitation intervention for Veterans with a
      history of brain injury, but VA clinicians need data on its effectiveness for Veterans with
      PTSD-related cognitive functioning deficits. These studies will provide the data necessary
      for a larger scale RCT proposal if results show that CCT is as promising as expected for
      Veterans with PTSD.

    <description>Compensatory Cognitive Training draws from the theoretical literature on compensatory strategy training for other cognitively impaired populations (e.g., Huckans et al., 2013; Twamley et al., 2010; Storzbach et al., 2016). It is a rehabilitation model that aims to teach individuals strategies that allow them to work around cognitive deficits. Consistent with this model and the expert recommendations for civilians and Service members with TBI (Cicerone, 2011), manualized CCT treatment provides training in compensatory attention and learning/memory skills, formal problem-solving strategies applied to daily problems, and the use of external aids such as calendar systems and assistive devices to promote completion of daily tasks (Storzbach et al., 2016).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible Veterans must meet DSM-5 criteria for PTSD with evidence-based PTSD treatment
             participation within the past 2 years.

          -  Must have an individual mental health provider/case manager assigned for coordination
             of care and management of crises as well as provision of treatment as usual if Veteran
             is randomly assigned to this condition.

          -  Report subjective cognitive complaints, such as problems with memory,
             attention/concentration, and executive function (e.g., planning, organization,
             problem-solving, decision-making).

          -  Referring provider observes mild cognitive problems that interfere with daily life
             (e.g., forgetting appointments or medications, poor performance at work or school,
             difficulty remembering information, trouble focusing in treatment sessions, trouble
             following through on goals).

          -  Fluent English speaker.

          -  Able to read and write and provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No history of traumatic brain injury (of any severity) or another major medical
             condition likely to significantly impact cognitive functioning such as stroke, MS,
             Parkinson's, or a brain tumor.

          -  Do not meet criteria for bipolar disorder or a psychotic disorder. Do not have a
             diagnosis of a substance dependence disorder within the past 30 days.

          -  Do not have active suicidal intent indicating significant clinical risk (which would
             suggest that a treatment targeting suicidal intent is indicated).

          -  Cognitive problems are not severe (i.e., no dementia). Cognitive problems do NOT
             interfere with a Veteran's overall ability to live independently or care for
             him/herself.

          -  Not currently participating in any type of brain stimulation treatment.

          -  No significant auditory/visual impairments.
