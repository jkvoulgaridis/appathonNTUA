    <textblock>
      The conventional treatment for Severe acute exacerbation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease including noninvasive respiratory support, invasive respiratory support, etc, but
      there are many kinds of limitations and complications. Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal
      is a life support technology, which can effectively remove CO2. Recently some clinical
      studies have showed that ECCO2R can effectively improve the AECOPD patient's respiratory
      failure, avoid intubation and removal of endotracheal intubation. We performed a study to
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness of ECCO2R in the treatment of AECOPD patients.

      With the development of technology, ECCO2R is not difficult to implement in intensive care
      unit. Many recently clinical studies have showed that ECCO2R can effectively remove CO2,
      reduce patient breathing work, improve the patient respiratory failure, and avoid
      endotracheal intubation. But there are also treated failure and high incidence of
      complications such as bleeding in the AECOPD patients with ECCO2R treatment, and the
      treatment related to airway management are less mentioned. Therefore, we set a more strict
      inclusion criteria in AECOPD patients and evaluate the clinical effectiveness and associated
      risk of ECCO2R in the treatment of AECOPD.
