    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this investigation is to develop and determine the feasibility of a
      multi-component intervention adapted from a collaborative care framework initiated in the ED
      for patients at risk for opioid use disorder. This study will provide important feasibility
      information for future studies of ED-LINC. The collaborative care intervention (ED-LINC) will
      be supported by a novel Emergency Departement (ED) health information exchange platform.

      The overarching goal of this investigation is to develop and determine the feasibility of a
      multi-component intervention adapted from a collaborative care framework initiated in the ED
      for patients at risk for opioid use disorder. According to the 2015 national survey on drug
      use and health, an estimated 3.8 million individuals over 12 years of age were currently
      misusing opioid pain relievers. An additional 329,000 people use heroin. The Emergency
      Department (ED) is currently at the forefront of this public health emergency and often a
      place where patients come for treatment of overdose and for treatment of medical problems
      related to illicit opioid use.

      Overall, the goal is to establish the feasibility of a multi-component intervention called
      'Emergency Department Longitudinal Integrated Care (ED-LINC)' which is guided by principles
      of collaborative care and is comprised of components that are evidence-based. ED-LINC is
      initiated from the ED and continues longitudinally for patients at-risk for opioid use
      disorder.

    <description>Patients in this arm will receive the ED-LINC intervention. Elements of ED-LINC are based on evidence-based treatments and are central components of collaborative care. ED-LINC will be supported by a novel Emergency Department Information Exchange (EDIE) technology platform that allows for the creation of ED care plans and electronic alerts and will assist in care coordination of this complex population.</description>

    <description>ED-LINC will include 1) A brief negotiated interview at the bedside with an emphasis on motivation to link to services 2) Pharmacotherapy including a discussion of opioid safety, take-home naloxone and initiation of buprenorphine from the ED for participants that are interested and eligible; 3) Longitudinal care management which will proceed for 3-months; and 4) Care plan in the Emergency Department Information Exchange (EDIE) system. This will be coupled with a study cell phone and a weekly supervisory case conference which is consistent with collaborative care principles.</description>
