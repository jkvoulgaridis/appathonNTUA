    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the treatment effect of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation in patients with a history of both persistent post-traumatic headache
      and post-concussion symptoms. In this double-blind, sham-controlled, concealed allocation,
      randomized clinical trial, 20 patients aged 18-65 yrs will be recruited from the Calgary
      Brain Injury Program (CBIP) and the Calgary Headache Assessment and Management Program
      (CHAMP) / Calgary Chronic Pain Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Patients will engage in a
      two-week rTMS treatment protocol (10 treatments) and will be followed for 6 months after
      therapy.

      Demographic information will be collected two weeks prior to starting the study including
      age, sex, education, headache history, concussion history, past medical history, medication
      use, and family medical history. Headache history will be collected including frequency,
      severity, medication-use, type of headache, associated symptoms (i.e. neck pain, photophobia,
      phonophobia, nausea, vomiting) and headache triggers. Baseline questionnaires will be
      completed including headache intensity scale - 6 (HIT-6), Rivermead PPCS questionnaire,
      British Columbia post-concussion symptom inventory (BC-PSI), Montreal cognitive assessment
      (MoCA), quality of life after brain injury questionnaire (QOLIBRI), patient health
      questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder scale-7 (GADS-7) and the post traumatic
      stress disorder checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Patients will keep a two-week baseline headache
      diary before treatment, 2 weeks during treatment, 2 weeks following rTMS, and for 2 weeks at
      the 1, 3, and 6 month follow up assessments (total of 12 weeks). Patients will be reassessed
      at the completion of their rTMS treatment (day 14), and at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment.
      The questionnaires including: HIT-6, Rivermead PPCS questionnaire, PC-PSI, QOLIBRI, PHQ-9 and
      GAD-7 will be completed at all follow up visits.

    <description>The QOLIBRI is a health-related quality of life instrument developed specifically for patients who have experienced a traumatic brain injury. It has 6 subscales and a total of 37 items. The tool is divided into two sections. The first addresses satisfaction with health related quality of life, characterized by cognition, self, autonomy in daily life, and social aspects. These are reported on a 1-5 scale with 1 defined as &quot;not at all satisfied&quot; and 5 as &quot;very satisfied&quot;. The second section is related to &quot;feeing bothered by&quot; emotions and physical problems. They are again scored from 1-5, however 1 is defined as &quot;very bothered&quot; and 5 as &quot;not bothered at all&quot;. The score from all subscales are totaled, and then divided by the number of responses. This gives a mean score, which can range from 1-5. Next, 1 is subtracted from the mean and then multiplied by 25 to produce a score on the 0-100 scale (0=worst possible quality of life, 100= best possible quality of life).</description>

    <description>Rivermead Post-concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ): an instrument developed to assess the frequency and severity of 16 common post-concussion symptoms. On this paper and pencil tool, patients rate the extent to which their symptoms (compared to their pre-injury levels) have become more problematic over the past 24 hours using a rating scale from 0-4 (0=not experienced, 1=no more of a problem, 2=mild problem, 3=moderate problem, 4=severe problem). A total symptom score is calculated out of 64.</description>

    <description>British Columbia Post-concussion symptom inventory (BC-PSI): a 16 item instrument, where 13 questions are used to assess the frequency and intensity of post-concussion symptoms as defined by ICD-10 criteria over the past two weeks (i.e. headaches, dizziness or light-headedness, nausea, fatigue, phonophobia, sadness, nervousness or tension, temper problems, poor concentration, memory problems, reading difficulty, and sleep disturbance). Severity is rated from 0-5 (6 point scale) where 0 is defined as &quot;not at all&quot; and 5 as &quot;constantly&quot;. Intensity is also rated from 0-5, where 0 is defined as &quot;not at all&quot; and 5 as &quot;very severe problem&quot;. The two items are then multiplied (frequency x intensity) for each item. This is subsequently converted to item total scores where: 0-1=0, 2-3=1, 4-6=2, 8-12=3, and ≥15=4. Scores from 1-2 signify mild symptoms and ≥3 moderate to severe symptoms, which can be considered clinically significant.</description>

    <description>Patient MR brain scans will be loaded and processed using the Brainsight TMS neuronavigation software and stereotaxic data for localization of the TMS stimulation site will be determined through a co-registration method between the TMS coil position and the projected site on the MR brain scan. The DLPFC will be located through MNI coordinates (-48, 20, 34). Electromyography (EMG) electrodes will be attached to the right abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle. The resting motor threshold (RMT) is determined as the minimal stimulation intensity required to elicit motor-evoked response of 50 microvolts peak-to-peak amplitude in at least 5 out of 10 consecutive trials of the ADM (contralateral to stimulation).</description>
