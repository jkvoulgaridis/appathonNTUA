      Investigate myelin alterations in patients with neurosurgical diseases

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While a number of advanced imaging techniques, notably magnetization transfer, diffusion
      tensor and quantitative T1 and T2 imaging (MTI, DTI, qT1 and qT2, respectively), have been
      used previously to study white matter in neurosurgical diseases, these methods provide only
      indirect, non-specific information related to myelin content. For example, these modalities
      can tell when there is swelling that is affecting the movement of water, which may be
      indicative of a process that would affect myelin, but they cannot tell us specific
      information about the amount of myelin surrounding a nerve.

      The investigators propose using a MRI sequence, mcDESPOT (multicomponent driven equilibrium
      potential of T1 and T2) that utilizes a computer model that takes T1 and T2 sequences and
      derives a quantitative value for the myelin content in the myelin sheath.

      In the present program, the investigators propose adding the mcDESPOT sequence to the MRI
      scanner in accordance with the MRI manufacturer's technical requirements. When this sequence
      is added, the normal sequences are done first and mcDESPOT is done last. Although the
      sequences obtained for mcDESPOT are sequences used in clinical practice, the flip-angles are
      changed so that they cannot be read like a traditional image. Rather, the data have to be
      post-processed by a computer in order to be able to derive myelin information.

      McDESPOT is a 10 minute sequence that can be added to any MRI scanner. It is a obtained from
      standard T1 and T2 sequences.
