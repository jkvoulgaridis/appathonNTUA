  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare teriparatide treatments and PVPs, focusing on its effects on life
      qualities and effect/coast ratio and evaluate which method is better for patients.

      Osteoporosis and osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF)s are the common diseases that affect
      the qualities of senior people. The general treatments for OVFs including percutaneous
      vertebroplasty (PVP) operation and conservative treatments with pain killers. But with the
      widely used methods, the life quality of patients were still not satisfied. Teriparatide has
      been proven to increase bone qualities in patients with severe osteoporosis and reduced the
      fracture possibilities. The investigators' previous clinical observation found teriparatide
      could be applied to treat fresh OVFs.

      90 participants who diagnosed fresh OVFS were included in the trial. After they received each
      of three kinds of interventions mentioned in this study, The investigators followed up all
      these cases. Once 30 cases goal reaches in a certain group, the data collection in that
      special will stop automatically. The quality of life, pain score and BMDs will be evaluated
      in certain time during the trial.
