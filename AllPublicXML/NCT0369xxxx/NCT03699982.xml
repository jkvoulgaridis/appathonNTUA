  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive
      system, and other organs in the body. Individuals with cystic fibrosis often have poor weight
      gain and growth that can negatively impact health further by worsening lung function.
      Additionally, persons with the disease typically need more than the usual calories on a daily
      basis.

      Most institutions estimate these patients' caloric needs using weight, age, and sex based
      mathematical formulae. However, numerous studies show that use of these formulae often yields
      inaccurate caloric values. Use of indirect calorimetry may give more accurate estimates of
      caloric needs in patients with cystic fibrosis.

      The aim of our study is to assess the accuracy of caloric estimates generated using one such
      widely used mathematical formula, the Harris-Benedict equation, and to compare this calorie
      value with that obtained from indirect calorimetry testing in pediatric and adult patients
      with cystic fibrosis.

      Study investigators will use the newly calculated caloric requirements in dietary counseling.
      Changes in weight and lung function after 3 months will be compared to participants'
      historical changes.

    <description>Resting Energy Expenditure will be determined using the Harris-Benedict formula and indirect calorimetry testing. Additionally, a 48 Hour Dietary Recall will be completed to estimate approximate caloric intake at baseline.
Participants will be instructed to increase their daily calorie intake based on the highest REE/caloric intake, whether by indirect calorimetry, the Harris-Benedict formula, or patient's estimated current caloric intake.</description>
