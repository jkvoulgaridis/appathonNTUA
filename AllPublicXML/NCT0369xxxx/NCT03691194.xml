      Beginning of the first four weeks:

      Upon arrival, subjects will be given a consent form to sign. The student investigators will
      go over the layoutof the research study such as the procedures, and compliance with them.
      Then, subjects will be asked if they agree with drinking orange juice daily for two months.
      If they agree, they will be asked to relax for five minutes, and the student investigators
      will take their blood pressure reading three times using a blood pressure monitor. The
      subjects will complete the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) survey before leaving. The subject
      will drink orange juice for 28 days.

      •

      Visits 2, 3, and 4:

      Subjects will meet with the student investigators at a convenient location. Subjects will be
      asked to rest for five minutes. Student investigators will then take their blood pressure
      reading three times using a blood pressure monitor. The subjects will complete the PSS survey
      before leaving.

      •

      Between visit 2 and 3:

      There is a washout period of approximately eight weeks. • During the first and second set of
      the 4

      -week intervention phase, subjects will visit student investigators to retrieve orange juice
      samples every 3 or 4 days.

    <description>Three readings will be taken each time and average them. If the subject's blood pressure is considered too high or low at any of the visits, they will be dropped from the study and we will suggest to them to see their primary physician.</description>

    <description>The PSS was developed by Sheldon Cohen and his colleagues, and was published in 1983. The PSS is a widely used psychological instrument to measures the level of stress. It has been used in many studies related to stress. The survey takes approximately three minutes to complete. The score ranges from 0-40. A score of 0-13 is considered low stress, 14-26 is moderate stress, and 27-40 is high stress.</description>

    <description>The fresh oranges will be bought from Sysco. They will be squeezed at the kitchen of School of Allied Health Professional with a juicer. They will either be squeezed the night before or on the same day. The juice will not be treated with additional preservatives or sugar. The brand of the juicer is Kitchen Aid. Eight ounces of fresh orange juice needs approximately two and half oranges. They will be put into 32 oz water bottles that were bought from Sysco, and then store them in the refrigerator. They will be given to the subjects every three or four days.</description>

    <description>The concentrated orange juice will be bought from Sysco then reconstituted. One part of concentrated orange juice needs four parts of water to reconstitute. Then, it will be measured and the reconstituted orange juice will be put into 32 oz water bottles that we bought from Sysco. They will be stored in the refrigerator. The subjects will need to get the reconstituted orange juice every three or four days.</description>
