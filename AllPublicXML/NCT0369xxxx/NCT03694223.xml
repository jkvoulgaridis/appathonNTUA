  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence for the use of a diet low in short chain fermentable carbohydrates (low
      FODMAP diet) in the management of functional gut symptoms, such as abdominal pain and
      bloating. However, the provision of advice on the low FODMAP diet can be challenging due to
      limited resources and the need for a dietitian with expertise in the low FODMAP diet. The aim
      of this study is to assess the feasibility in terms of recruitment and retention in planning
      a future trial. The purpose of the future trial will be to investigate the clinical and cost
      effectiveness, as well as the acceptability of different education methods of the low FODMAP
      diet for the treatment of IBS.

      To date, there are no studies on the implementation of the low FOMDAP diet using a mobile app
      or leaflets in the education of the low FODMAP diet. Therefore, a feasibility study design
      was chosen in order to obtain key data on recruitment and retention rates at each study
      group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A low FODMAP diet includes FODMAP restriction, FODMAP re-introduction and FODMAP
      personalisation. This study will focus on FODMAP restriction whereby foods high in FODMAPs
      are avoided for 4 weeks.

      Patients with IBS will be recruited from primary and secondary care centres.

      STUDY GROUPS

      Group 1: 2 x Booklets produced produced by the Department of Nutrition and Dietetic in Guy's
      &amp; St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, and the Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences Division at
      King's College London. These booklets have been produced by dietitians and are commonly used
      in clinical practice across the UK. They contain the following information:

      Group 2: Patients will be asked to download an application on their mobile phones or tablets.
      This application has been produced by dietitians from the Department of Nutrition and
      Dietetic in Guy's &amp; St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, and the Diabetes and Nutritional
      Sciences Division at King's College London.

      Group 3:Patients will attend a clinic visit for a one-to-one consultation with a dietitian.
      As per current clinical practice, the initial visit will last for 1 hour.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE The primary objective is to estimate recruitment and retention rates of
      patients with IBS receiving different education delivery methods of the low FODMAP diet.

      SAMPLE SIZE As this is a feasibility study, a formal sample size calculation is not
      appropriate. For such feasibility studies, sample sizes between 24 and 50 have been
      recommended. Therefore, for this study, a total sample size of 45 was chosen (15 patients per
      group). Previous work indicates an approximately 12% attrition rate and, therefore, the final
      sample size will be 50 patients.

      ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics such as mean values, standard deviations (SD) for continuous
      variables, and counts (percentages) and confidence intervals (CI) for categorical variables
      will be calculated. To assess recruitment and retention rates the following will be recorded:
      number of people directly contacting the researchers for the study, number of participants
      pre-screened and screened, number of participants randomised, number of drop-outs.

      ETHICS AND REGULATORY APPROVALS The trial will be conducted in compliance with the principles
      of the Declaration of Helsinki (1996), the principles of Good Clinical Practice. Ethical
      approval for this study has been granted by an NRES Committee London.

      DATA HANDLING

      The Chief Investigator will act as custodian for the trial data. The following guidelines
      will be strictly adhered to:

        1. Patient data will be anonymised

        2. All trial data will be stored on a password protected computer and limited to authorised
           study personnel

        3. All records and samples will be stored in a secure environment

        4. All trial data will be stored in line with the Data Protection Act

        5. Data and samples will be securely stored for 5 years after the study has ended and may
           be used for further in depth analysis

        6. Data may be accessed by regulatory authorities for audit purposes

    <description>Validated Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) questionnaire. The questionnaire includes four VAS items evaluating abdominal pain frequency and intensity, abdominal distension, satisfaction with bowel habit, and quality of life. Scores are then added up; scoring allows categorisation of patients into mild (75-174), moderate (175-300) and severe (&gt;300) cases, with a maximum achievable severity score of 500 points. A minimal clinically important difference of a 50-point reduction in score allows meaningful interpretation of score change over time.</description>

    <description>Validated Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of Life (IBS-QoL) questionnaire. Each item utilises a 5-point Likert response scale, which is transformed to a 0-100 point scale and subscale scores are then calculated (dysphoria, interference with activity, body image, health worry, food avoidance, social reaction, sexual, relationships). A total score can be calculated by summing the subscale scores. A score of 100 denotes maximum QOL for subscales and the total score.</description>
