  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors.This
      study is a single-arm, prospective, open label clinical study of pyrotinib plus capecitabine
      as the Therapy of brain metastases from HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 30-50% of patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In
      the case of solitary brain metastases, surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery are the preferred
      therapeutic approaches.Chemotherapy is used after further progression of disease but it has
      limited effectiveness. In HER2-positive tumours, trastuzumab therapy has been postulated to
      be associated with an increased risk of development of brain metastases.Thus new therapeutic
      options are urgently needed to improve patients'outcome. Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. We designed the study to explore the
      possibility of pyrotinib plus capecitabine for brain metastases from HER2-positive metastatic
      breast cancer.
