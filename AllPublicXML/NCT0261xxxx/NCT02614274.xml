    <textblock>
      The Nutramax test article is a nutritional supplement that contains several ingredients shown
      to potentially provide benefit to patients suffering from a painful and sometimes
      debilitating condition of the knee called &quot;osteoarthritis.&quot;

      This is a pilot study that is intended to determine whether results from a proprietary
      testing panel conducted on blood and urine samples will correlate with data from physical
      examination and validated surveys that measure participants' quality of life and physical
      capabilities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a significant source of morbidity, especially in patients
      over the age of 40 and is associated with more than $90 billion in US health care costs
      annually. While a myriad of clinical interventions are available, the mainstays of OA therapy
      are the NSAIDs, a class of compounds with well documented side effects including death; the
      risks of which increase with patient age and chronic use. Assessing the effectiveness of OA
      treatment modalities is often complicated by a high placebo effect, making purely clinical
      assessment of outcomes difficult. It is therefore desirable to develop an objective
      assessment tool for both the diagnosis/staging of knee OA and patient response to
      interventional therapies.

      Participants in this study will receive a formulation of the nutraceutical (test article).
      They will be asked to take 3 pills at once per day for 40-44 days. There will be either 4 or
      5 study visits. If participants have been using certain medications or dietary supplements,
      they will be asked to return one week from the initial screening, making a total of 5 visits
      in the study. If they have not been using key medications or dietary supplements, then study
      activities will begin on the day of the initial screening and they will only have 4 study
      visits.

      Participants will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires about their health, and
      have their blood drawn (15 mls or about 3 teaspoons), and provide a urine sample at 4 visits.
      In addition, at the first visit, we will collect information from participants' medical
      record and they will have a physical exam.

    <measure>Patient Reported Quality of Life Via SF-36 (36-Item Short Form Health Survey) Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 is a measure of health status. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. To calculate the scores it is necessary to purchase special software.
Mean+-SD among of improvement is reported.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Quality of Life Via SF-36 (36-Item Short Form Health Survey) Improvement</title>
        <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 is a measure of health status. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. To calculate the scores it is necessary to purchase special software.
Mean+-SD among of improvement is reported.</description>
