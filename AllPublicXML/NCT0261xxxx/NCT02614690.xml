  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the need for univalve or bivalve splitting of casts in pediatric
      patients with forearm fractures following closed reduction and cast application in a
      randomized, prospective fashion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following cast application, little is known regarding the need to split the cast, either in a
      univalve (a split along a single side of the cast) or bivalve (a split along both sides of
      the cast) fashion. Theoretically, the splitting of the cast allows for expansion and soft
      tissue swelling. However, review of the literature yields a paucity of evidence demonstrating
      the efficacy of splitting a cast. In a study by Nietosvaara et. al, a retrospective
      examination of 109 pediatric patients initially treated with closed cylindrical casting for
      closed forearm fractures were evaluated. Of these 109 patients, one-sixth required the
      initial cast to be split, trimmed, or removed secondary to post-traumatic swelling.

      However, the splitting of a cast is not without risks in itself. Once the initial swelling
      dissipates, a univalved or bivalved cast can become excessively loose. This loosening has
      been associated with a loss of reduction. If the loss or reduction is substantial, it may
      require a re-reduction or operation to correct. In addition, with every use of the cast saw a
      patient is placed at risk for iatrogenic cast saw injury. Thermal burns and abrasions from
      cast saws can cause lifelong emotional and physical scars for a patient. They can also be an
      inciting event for litigation against the hospital and or provider, with settlements
      averaging greater than $12,000 per centimeter of cast saw injury.

    <time_frame>&lt;60 days corresponding to total study time and consistent with outcome 6</time_frame>
    <description>This data will be able to help physicians and ER personnel help this patient population with the least number of cast complications and therefore allow for a more efficient use of resources since cast modifications could be minimized. Metrics used to characterize complications are the radiographic union used to determine speed of healing and the number of unplanned ER or clinic visits for cast modifications.</description>

    <measure>Cast Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after cast application (&lt;1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The cast index is a measure of potential for cast failure described by Chess et al. in 1994. The cast index is calculated as the sagittal width measure divided by the coronal cast width measure at the fracture site. A ratio between these measures of 0.7 or greater for pediatric forearms is considered acceptable. For each patient in this study the cast index was calculated as described above. The average cast index for each of the 3 groups was then presented as the final result.</description>

    <description>Pain levels were assessed using the validated Wong-Baker FACES visual pain rating scale. This scale presents a total of 6 options for pain- none, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5- with 5 corresponding to the greatest amount of pain. During the analysis it was decided to group these into 5 categories: No pain which was equal to those selecting none, Mild corresponding to those selecting 1, Moderate pain corresponding to those that selected either 2 or 3, and Severe pain corresponding to those that selected either 4 or 5. Patients with no response were placed into the group &quot;no response&quot;.</description>

        <description>The cast index is a measure of potential for cast failure described by Chess et al. in 1994. The cast index is calculated as the sagittal width measure divided by the coronal cast width measure at the fracture site. A ratio between these measures of 0.7 or greater for pediatric forearms is considered acceptable. For each patient in this study the cast index was calculated as described above. The average cast index for each of the 3 groups was then presented as the final result.</description>

This scale presents a total of 6 options for pain- none, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5- with 5 corresponding to the greatest amount of pain. During the analysis it was decided to group these into 5 categories: No pain which was equal to those selecting none, Mild corresponding to those selecting 1, Moderate pain corresponding to those that selected either 2 or 3, and Severe pain corresponding to those that selected either 4 or 5. Patients with no response were placed into the group &quot;no response&quot;.</description>

          <title>Pain Levels</title>
          <description>Pain levels were assessed using the validated Wong-Baker FACES visual pain rating scale. This scale presents a total of 6 options for pain- none, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5- with 5 corresponding to the greatest amount of pain. During the analysis it was decided to group these into 5 categories: No pain which was equal to those selecting none, Mild corresponding to those selecting 1, Moderate pain corresponding to those that selected either 2 or 3, and Severe pain corresponding to those that selected either 4 or 5. Patients with no response were placed into the group &quot;no response&quot;.</description>

          <description>Patient will have a &quot;No split cast&quot; long arm cast applied after a closed reduction of forearm fractures. The cast will not be split. 20 patients will be randomized to this arm.
No Split Cast of forearm fractures: Enroll 20 patients per arm: patients who present for long arm casts after closed reduction of forearm fractures will be randomized to one of 3 arms. Patients randomized to &quot;No Split Cast&quot; will have a cast that is not split, this is known as closed cast. The cast will be applied according to our Standard of Care casting. Patients will be then undergo follow-up for clinical and radiographic examinations based on the routine fracture management protocol for approximately 3 months.</description>
