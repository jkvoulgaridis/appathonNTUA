  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of vedolizumab subcutaneous (vedolizumab
      SC) as maintenance treatment in participants with moderately to severely active CD who
      achieved clinical response following administration of vedolizumab intravenous (vedolizumab
      IV) induction therapy.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab SC. Vedolizumab SC is being tested
      to treat people who have moderate to severely active CD. This study will look at clinical
      remission, as well as enhanced clinical response and corticosteroid-free remission in
      participants with CD who receive vedolizumab SC maintenance therapy after having achieved a
      clinical response to vedolizumab IV induction therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 824 participants. All participants will enter a 6 week
      Induction Phase where they will be administered open-label vedolizumab IV 300 mg via IV
      infusion at Week 0 (Day 1) and Week 2 (Day 15), and will then be assessed for a clinical
      response at Week 6. Participants who achieve a clinical response at Week 6 will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Vedolizumab SC 108 mg Maintenance Arm

        -  Placebo SC Maintenance Arm

      Participants who do not achieve a clinical response will not be randomized into the
      Maintenance Period, and instead will receive a third infusion of vedolizumab IV 300 mg at
      Week 6.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 71 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final
      visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Participants will
      also participate in a long-term safety follow-up, by phone, at 6 months after the last dose
      of study drug.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Clinical Remission at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score less than or equal to (&lt;=) 150 at Week 52. A CDAI is a multi-item instrument which measures severity of active Crohn's Disease monitored over 7 days includes participant reported symptoms, physician-assessed signs, and laboratory markers. CDAI score is equal to (=) sum of weighted scores for subjective items (number of liquid/soft stools, degree of abdominal pain, general well-being); and objective items (use of anti-diarrhoeal medication, abdominal mass, haematocrit, presence of extraintestinal manifestation, body weight). CDAI scores range approximately from 0 to 600, higher scores indicating greater disease activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Enhanced Clinical Response at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Enhanced clinical response is defined as a decrease from Baseline of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 100 points in the CDAI score at Week 52. A CDAI is a multi-item instrument which measures severity of active CD monitored over 7 days includes participant reported symptoms, physician-assessed signs, and laboratory markers. CDAI score = Sum of weighted scores for subjective items (number of liquid/soft stools, degree of abdominal pain, general well-being); and objective items (use of anti-diarrhoeal medication, abdominal mass, haematocrit, presence of extraintestinal manifestation, body weight). CDAI scores range approximately from 0 to 600, higher scores indicating greater disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Corticosteroid-free Remission at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Corticosteroid-free remission is defined as participants using oral corticosteroids at Baseline (Week 0) who have discontinued oral corticosteroids and are in clinical remission at Week 52. Clinical remission is defined as a CDAI score &lt;=150 at Week 52. CDAI score = Sum of weighted scores for subjective items (number of liquid/soft stools, degree of abdominal pain, general well-being); and objective items (use of anti-diarrhoeal medication, abdominal mass, haematocrit, presence of extraintestinal manifestation, body weight). CDAI scores range approximately from 0 to 600, higher scores indicating greater disease activity.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

        <description>Clinical remission is defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score less than or equal to (&lt;=) 150 at Week 52. A CDAI is a multi-item instrument which measures severity of active Crohn's Disease monitored over 7 days includes participant reported symptoms, physician-assessed signs, and laboratory markers. CDAI score is equal to (=) sum of weighted scores for subjective items (number of liquid/soft stools, degree of abdominal pain, general well-being); and objective items (use of anti-diarrhoeal medication, abdominal mass, haematocrit, presence of extraintestinal manifestation, body weight). CDAI scores range approximately from 0 to 600, higher scores indicating greater disease activity.</description>

        <description>Clinical remission is defined as CDAI score &lt;=150 at Week 52. CDAI score = Sum of weighted scores for subjective items (number of liquid/soft stools, degree of abdominal pain, general well-being); and objective items (use of anti-diarrhoeal medication, abdominal mass, haematocrit, presence of extraintestinal manifestation, body weight). CDAI scores range approximately from 0 to 600, higher scores indicating greater disease activity.</description>

Any event spontaneously reported by the participant/observed by the investigator was recorded, irrespective of the relation to study treatment.
