  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus could be missed during routine random biopsies. We propose a
      study using chromoendoscopy with Acetic Acid to increase the yield of biopsies in detecting
      neoplasia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus is often focal and can be missed by nontargeted biopsies
      alone. In recent years, various advanced endoscopic techniques have been utilized, but with
      varying success rates. Narrow-band imaging, trimodal imaging, spectral imaging and i-scan are
      technologies that are manufacturer dependent with limited varying success rates and have
      financial implications. At our institution, narrow band imaging is routinely utilized as a
      diagnostic tool for detecting Barrett's esophagus. Acetic acid is a commonly available dye
      that has been used in the detection of neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus.

      This study is aimed to prove the effectiveness of acetic acid chromoendoscopy in our
      Barrett's esophagus surveillance population. The goal is to compare the neoplasia yield of
      acetic acid chromoendoscopy with that of standardized random biopsy protocol. The sensitivity
      and specificity for neoplasia detection by these two methods will also be analyzed.

      Investigators plan to conduct this prospective randomized study for a period of one and a
      half years (beginning August 1, 2015, ending February 29, 2016). Based on data from 2014, we
      anticipate to enroll approximately 185 patients. All gastroenterologists (with privileges at
      Doctors Hospital at Renaissance) will participate in this study. Patients will be randomized
      to either acetic acid chromoendoscopy or current standard of care (standardized random biopsy
      protocol utilizing narrow band imaging). Random biopsies from both protocols and targeted
      biopsies (if identified) will be obtained and submitted to pathology department. These will
      be reviewed independently by two pathologists. Any discordant results will be reviewed by an
      outside expert pathologist. Statistical data analysis will be performed utilizing Datadesk XL
      software.

      <recruitment_details>Patients were recruited from our Barrett’s esophageal Surveillance Program. The study took place in a South Texas Gastroenterology office. The first patient was enrolled 4-11-17. Study enrollment was stopped 7/30/18.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients were assigned an arm immediately after enrollment. There were no events within the enrollment and the actual procedure. The only reason patient could have been excluded was a no-show to the procedure appointment.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Number of participants with Long Segment Barrett's</title>
          <description>Measurement of the length of Barrett's esophagus is performed during procedure. Length is reported in centimeters and is subjectively given by endoscopist performing procedure.
Segments less than 3cm in maximal length are classified as short segment. Segments over 3cm in maximal length are classified as long segment.</description>
