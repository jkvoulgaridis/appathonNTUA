      The objective of this study was to compare the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of two
      different dose levels of CyclASol Ophthalmic Solutions to placebo (vehicle) and Restasis for
      the treatment of the signs and symptoms of Dry Eye Disease (DED).

      This phase 2 study explored the safety, efficacy and tolerability of two CyclASol
      concentrations as one drop twice daily versus vehicle (placebo). In addition to the masked
      vehicle control arm, an open-label comparator arm consisting of Restasis was included.

      The study explored a range of signs and symptoms of DED to gain an understanding of the
      possible treatment effects in comparison to vehicle and estimation of effect sizes. In line
      with current treatment guidelines, the proposed phase 2 population consisted of patients
      suffering from moderate to severe DED.

      The primary treatment comparisons in this study were between the two CyclASol concentrations
      versus vehicle for the sign variable total corneal fluorescein staining and the symptom
      variable dryness severity visual analogue scale at day 113. All other comparisons between
      treatments groups were considered secondary analyses.

    <description>The primary analysis and objective of the study was to compare the two CyclASol groups versus vehicle (all blinded treatment arms) for one sign and one symptom endpoint. The open label active comparator arm was not included in the primary analysis to reduce the number of comparisons. The sign endpoint was the change from baseline in total corneal fluorescein staining at day 113. The cornea is divided into five regions: central, superior, inferior, nasal and temporal. Each region is graded from 0-3 based on the National Eye Institute scale, where 0 indicates no staining and 3 maximal staining. The total score is the sum of all these regions. The maximum score for each eye is 15.</description>

    <description>The primary analysis and objective of the study was to compare the the two CyclASol groups versus vehicle (all blinded treatment arms) for one sign and one symptom endpoint. The open label active comparator arm was not included in the primary analysis to reduce the number of comparisons. Furthermore, the open label character could have had an impact on patient reported outcomes. The symptom endpoint was the change from baseline in severity of dryness VAS at Day 113. Dryness severity was rated from 0 to 100%, where 0% corresponds to &quot;no dryness&quot; and 100% corresponds to &quot;maximum dryness&quot;.</description>

        <description>The primary analysis and objective of the study was to compare the two CyclASol groups versus vehicle (all blinded treatment arms) for one sign and one symptom endpoint. The open label active comparator arm was not included in the primary analysis to reduce the number of comparisons. The sign endpoint was the change from baseline in total corneal fluorescein staining at day 113. The cornea is divided into five regions: central, superior, inferior, nasal and temporal. Each region is graded from 0-3 based on the National Eye Institute scale, where 0 indicates no staining and 3 maximal staining. The total score is the sum of all these regions. The maximum score for each eye is 15.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to 113 Days</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set population for worst eye. Worst eye: Eyes were eligible for analysis if they met all inclusion criteria. If both eyes qualified, the worst eye was taken as the eye with higher (worse) staining at Visit 1. If staining was the same, the right eye was selected as the worst eye.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline (Visit 1) in Total Corneal Fluorescein Staining at 113 Days</title>
          <description>The primary analysis and objective of the study was to compare the two CyclASol groups versus vehicle (all blinded treatment arms) for one sign and one symptom endpoint. The open label active comparator arm was not included in the primary analysis to reduce the number of comparisons. The sign endpoint was the change from baseline in total corneal fluorescein staining at day 113. The cornea is divided into five regions: central, superior, inferior, nasal and temporal. Each region is graded from 0-3 based on the National Eye Institute scale, where 0 indicates no staining and 3 maximal staining. The total score is the sum of all these regions. The maximum score for each eye is 15.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set population for worst eye. Worst eye: Eyes were eligible for analysis if they met all inclusion criteria. If both eyes qualified, the worst eye was taken as the eye with higher (worse) staining at Visit 1. If staining was the same, the right eye was selected as the worst eye.</population>

        <description>The primary analysis and objective of the study was to compare the the two CyclASol groups versus vehicle (all blinded treatment arms) for one sign and one symptom endpoint. The open label active comparator arm was not included in the primary analysis to reduce the number of comparisons. Furthermore, the open label character could have had an impact on patient reported outcomes. The symptom endpoint was the change from baseline in severity of dryness VAS at Day 113. Dryness severity was rated from 0 to 100%, where 0% corresponds to &quot;no dryness&quot; and 100% corresponds to &quot;maximum dryness&quot;.</description>
