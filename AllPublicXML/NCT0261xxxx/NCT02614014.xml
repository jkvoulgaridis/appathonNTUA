  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Main aim is to evaluate the role of stress in the evolution of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) and the quality of life of these patients. A second aim is to establish the existence
      of any psicopathological profile in these patients. We designed a prospective experimental
      study were patients are randomized to receive or not a cognitive-behavior program. Patients
      will be evaluated at 3 and 12 months after the program and study variables will be measured:
      stress level, coping strategies, quality of life, activity of disease and biological
      variables related to IBD.
