      The hypothesis is that toddlers with parents who are randomized to a parenting intervention
      and toddlers with parents who are randomized to the maternal intervention focused on maternal
      diet and physical activity will be more likely to have weight status within normal and to
      consume a healthy diet and engage in physical activity than toddlers with parents in a
      placebo (safety) intervention.

      Background:

      Overweight is a serious public health problem which can begin in early childhood. Factors
      which contribute to overweight include: overfeeding, excessive intakes of fat and sugar;
      frequent sedentary activities (i.e. television watching).

      Overweight, defined as a BMI &gt; 95th percentile, in early childhood has reached epidemic
      proportions with 14% of 2-5 year olds overweight and 26.2% &quot;at risk of overweight,&quot; defined
      as a BMI &gt; 85th percentile (Ogden et al., 2006).

      Dietary and physical activity patterns established early in life track over time, making the
      first few years of life an ideal time to help families establish healthy eating and physical
      activity behaviors and avoid overweight. This project works to identify techniques that could
      prevent overweight.

      Purpose of Study:

      The investigators are collaborating with the Anne Arundel County, MD Special Supplemental
      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the University of Maryland's
      Pediatric Ambulatory Center to implement strategies that will prevent overweight among
      toddlers. The project focuses on the dietary, physical activity, and growth patterns of WIC
      toddlers. The investigators are conducting a 3-cell randomized trial consisting of: 1) a
      maternal intervention focusing on healthy diet and physical activity patterns for mothers; 2)
      a toddler parenting intervention focusing on parenting, limit setting, and development
      strategies; and 3) an intervention on child safety. The interventions are implemented over 3
      months, with 8 sessions.

      The investigators hypothesize that altering maternal behavior will have a positive impact on
      the growth and development of the toddler by preventing behaviors that lead to overweight
      among children. The parenting intervention will improve parenting skills by offering
      information on proper approaches to feeding, discipline and educational play. The
      investigators will compare the growth patterns of toddlers whose mothers were randomized to
      the maternal and parenting interventions with those in the safety intervention. This study
      design allows us to examine the mechanisms linking the interventions to improvements in diet,
      physical activity, and growth.

      In addition, the investigators will conduct the safety promotion intervention for the
      attention control group, considering the high risk of unintentional injuries among the
      toddlers from low-income families. The investigators also hypothesize that the safety
      promotion intervention will reduce the safety problems of the toddlers' homes. The underlying
      mechanisms will be examined, if there is a significant intervention effect.

    <description>Measured weight and height for the toddlers, transferred to age and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) Z-score. The range of BMI z-score is usually between -5 and +5. BMI z-score lower than -1.645 is defined as underweight. The BMI z-score from -1.645 to 1.036 is normal weight and BMI z-score greater or equal to 1.645 is obese.</description>

    <description>Change body mass index (BMI, kg/m^2, calculated by measured weight and height) from baseline to 12-month follow-up. The BMI ranges usually ranges from 0-50 with higher score indicating higher weight regarding the height. Scores above 25 are considered overweight and scores above 30 are considered obese.</description>

    <description>The Emotional Availability Scales (EAS) include 4 maternal scales (sensitivity, structuring, non-intrusiveness, and non-hostile) and 2 child scales (responsiveness and involvement), each rated on 7-point Likert scales, with high scores optimal. The maternal and child sub-scale scores were averaged for a total mealtime interaction score. The total score ranges from 1-7. Coders were trained until they demonstrated inter-rater reliability &gt;0.80 based on intraclass correlation coefficients with 10 observations from the scale creator and 10 observations with the faculty coordinator. Inter-rater reliability was reviewed through weekly reliability checks.</description>

          <title>Toddler Body Mass Index (BMI) Z-score</title>
          <description>Body Mass Index, kg/m^2, is calculated by measured weight and height. BMI z-scores are measures of relative weight adjusted for child age and sex. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from a reference population in the same age range and with the same sex. These scores are used to determine weight status (e.g., overweight, obese, etc.)</description>

Maternal Lifestyle (Physical Activity and Nutrition): At each session, mothers will identify a dietary goal for the next session (e.g., reduce soda intake). They will learn to track and evaluate their progress, setting new goals or modifying existing ones as necessary. Mothers will be given pedometers and shown how to keep a pedometer tracking chart. As with dietary choice, our objective is to have the mothers identify personal goals and strategies to achieve those goals, so they are more likely to continue to engage in physical activity after the intervention ends.</description>

Maternal Lifestyle (Physical Activity and Nutrition): At each session, mothers will identify a dietary goal for the next session (e.g., reduce soda intake). They will learn to track and evaluate their progress, setting new goals or modifying existing ones as necessary. Mothers will be given pedometers and shown how to keep a pedometer tracking chart. As with dietary choice, our objective is to have the mothers identify personal goals and strategies to achieve those goals, so they are more likely to continue to engage in physical activity after the intervention ends.</description>

Maternal Lifestyle (Physical Activity and Nutrition): At each session, mothers will identify a dietary goal for the next session (e.g., reduce soda intake). They will learn to track and evaluate their progress, setting new goals or modifying existing ones as necessary. Mothers will be given pedometers and shown how to keep a pedometer tracking chart. As with dietary choice, our objective is to have the mothers identify personal goals and strategies to achieve those goals, so they are more likely to continue to engage in physical activity after the intervention ends.</description>
