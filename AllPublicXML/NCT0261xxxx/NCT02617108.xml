    <textblock>
      Patients who want to go TCRS will randomly divided 3 groups. In Group 1(100 patients), women
      received postoperative estrogen therapy. In Group 2 (100 patients), a Foley catheter with the
      balloon inflated with 4 ml of normal saline solution will be placed into the uterine cavity
      at the end of the operation for five days. In Group 3 (110 patients), women will not receive
      any of the treatment (comparison group). All subjects underwent two further hysteroscopy, one
      and three months after the initial surgery. At the second or third look hysteroscopy, the
      incidence of intra-uterine adhesion will be analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The uterine septum (US) is the most common congenital uterine malformation, accounting for
      about 75% of Mullerian anomalies. Transcervical resection of septum (TCRS) has been shown in
      several cohort studies to improve outcome, although evidence from prospectively conducted
      randomized trial is lacking. TCRS is generally considered to be safe but there is a concern
      that it may be complicated by post-operative formation of intrauterine adhesions. Some
      investigators therefore recommend the use of postoperative adjuvant therapies with a view to
      preventing adhesion formation, as in the case of hysteroscopic surgery for Asherman syndrome.
      The adjuvant measures proposed include postoperative estrogen therapy, the placement of an
      intrauterine device (IUD) or Foley catheter in the uterine cavity. Unlike the case of
      Asherman syndrome in which these various adjuvant therapies are often used and appear to be
      of benefit, it is uncertain if any of these adjuvant measures are of benefit or necessary in
      the case TCRS. In this study, the investigators will compare the postoperative adhesion
      formation rates who will receive Foley catheter therapies „ÄÅpostoperative estrogen therapy and
      those who will not receive any therapies to determine the usefulness of Foley catheter
      therapies in reducing postoperative adhesion formation.

    <description>Subjects received postoperative hormone therapy as per the protocol in use in our center for Asherman Syndrome. Immediately after the operation, the subjects were started on a 3- month course of cyclical hormonal therapy, consisting of orally administrated oestradiol valerate 2-4mg/day for 21 days, orally administrated medroxyprogesterone acetate 8mg /day from day 12 to 21 of the oestradiol valerate therapy. The second treatment cycle started one week after the completion of the first cycle, and the third treatment cycle started one week after the second cycle.</description>
