  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are an important risk factor for fragility fractures. Both are associated with the
      ageing process and as they rise also increase the risk of mortality, disability and
      dependency. Interventions to prevent falls have been based on multifactorial approaches but
      the outcomes have shown little effectiveness. Lately, it is being recommended interventions
      which foster physical exercise incorporating it to daily life activities. The OTAGO exercise
      programme is based on easy physical exercises for older adults and has shown cost-effective
      outcomes for falls prevention and its consequences.

      This is a randomized clinical trial carried out in primary care. The study's scope of
      activity will include four urban primary care centers. All selected patients with inclusion
      criteria will receive a geriatric assessment and other required medical treatment. Next, they
      will be allocated either to an intervention group or control group. The intervention group
      will be trained for three months according to the OTAGO exercise program (training phase).
      Followed by a loyalty phase during which they will be monitored quarterly for a year by their
      assessment team. The control group will be receive normal medical treatment. Falls and
      fractures will be monitored quarterly in both groups during 15 months.

    <description>Evaluate the incidence of OTAGO's physical intervention program on improvement of parameters of physical frailty (strength) in elderly (75-89years).

    <measure>Parameters of physical frailty (balance) measured through Biodex Balance System ('stability index') from April 2016 to June 2017.</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the incidence of OTAGO's physical intervention program on improvement of parameters of physical frailty (balance) in elderly (75-89years). Starting training with phase guided by physiotherapist, followed by loyalty phase guided by regular nurse. It will be measured through Tinneti Scale and Biodex Balance System. Biodex Balance System provides valid, reliable and repeatable objective measures of a patient's ability to balance on stable and unstable surfaces. It provides visual biofeedback of a patient's ability to control their centre of gravity and their limits of stability. This test provides an objective 'stability index' that if higher than the predicted value indicates a strength, proprioception, and vestibular or visual impairment. Both monitoring at baseline and during follow-up.</description>
