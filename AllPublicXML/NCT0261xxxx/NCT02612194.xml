  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm two-stage phase II study with crizotinib (Xalkori®) in the treatment of
      subjects with metastatic urothelial cancer of the bladder, upper (ureter or renal pelvis) or
      lower (urethra) urinary tracts. The purpose of this study is to see if this experimental drug
      has a potential benefit in subjects with stage 4 urothelial cancer.

      This study tests crizotinib used alone in subjects with urothelial cancer, previously treated
      with chemotherapy, and whose tumors have certain proteins. Proteins are complex natural
      substances essential to the structure and function of all living cells. These proteins, c-MET
      or RON, may trigger molecular pathways that are involved in the growth and spread of bladder
      or upper urinary tract cancer. Crizotinib is a drug taken by mouth that blocks these
      pathways. Early laboratory research suggests that crizotinib may benefit patients with
      urothelial and other cancers with these molecular pathways.

      This is a single arm two-stage phase II study designed to evaluate the objective response
      rate in subjects with metastatic urothelial cancer demonstrating c-MET or RON overexpression
      who have received prior therapy with a cisplatin or carboplatin containing regimen.

      Subjects will be recruited at Levine Cancer Institute (LCI) and other participating sites.

      Immunohistochemistry will be utilized to define tumor sample c-MET and RON protein expression
      patterns for assignment into molecular cohorts as described in section 12.1.

      In the first stage of this study, subjects will be enrolled in parallel to three molecularly
      defined cohorts as follows:

        1. c-MET high (&gt;50%), RON null (0-9%) (n = 14 subjects)

        2. c-MET-positive (10-100%), RON-positive (10-100%) (n = 7 subjects)

        3. c-MET null (0-9%), RON-positive (10-100%) (n = 7 subjects)

      All enrolled subjects will continue with study treatment until criteria for treatment
      discontinuation has been met.

      If Stage 1 response criteria are met in a cohort, the cohort may be considered for expansion,
      and additional subjects (16 in Cohort 1 or 25 in Cohorts 2 or 3) may then be enrolled into
      that cohort in Stage 2. An expansion cohort will be defined by the Sponsor- Investigator
      following review of all available trial data which will be conducted after the first Stage 1
      cohort has completed accrual and at least every six months thereafter until all Stage 1
      cohorts have completed accrual.

      If more than one cohort meets Stage 1 response criteria (2 responses out of 14 subjects for
      Cohort 1 or 1 response out of 7 subjects for each of Cohorts 2 and 3), then the cohort
      showing the highest response rate will be given highest consideration for expansion.

          8. Subjects receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly

             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table/aspx; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the subject will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the subject is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

                  limited to carbamazepine, efavirenz, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine,
                  phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's Wort, and

          9. Receiving any medications that are CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range
             (alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus
             and tacrolimus)

         10. Subjects may be screened for study participation though may not begin study treatment:

             time of enrollment), active neurologic symptoms or the use of prohibited medications
             in subjects with a history of brain metastases
