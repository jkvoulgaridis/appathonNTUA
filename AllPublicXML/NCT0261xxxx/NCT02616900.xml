      The &quot;eSight Quality of Life and Efficacy Study&quot; (eQUEST) is a prospective cohort study
      intended to demonstrate the functional vision and Quality of Life (QoL) improvement provided
      by eSight Eyewear to persons with significant visual impairment resulting from various eye
      conditions. The multi-site study will evaluate the efficacy of the eSight device for various
      Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) across a broad range of subject ages and disease types.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive an initial benchmark assessment to determine their visual function.
      This includes standard clinical tests for acuity and contrast performance. Subjects will then
      receive a demonstration of the device. If the demonstration shows favourable results
      (improved functional visual performance for some rudimentary tasks such as reading), and the
      subject consents to the study, the subject will return to the site a week later to receive
      their personalized device (lens prescriptions incorporated into the unit), and more
      comprehensive training on its operation. They will then use the unit in their
      home/work/school environment over a period of three months. At the start of the study, after
      a period of one month, and at the end of the three month period, the subject will visit the
      clinical setting for administration of various specified ADL tasks, and the Veterans Affairs
      (VA) Low Vision (LV) Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ) 48-question VA LV VFQ-48 survey. The
      intent of this repetition is to understand how ADL proficiency and VFQ-48 QoL assessment
      changes over time, as the subject becomes more accustomed to the device.

    <measure>Quality of Life Improvement After Three Months of Device Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after three months of device use.</time_frame>
    <description>The study seeks to quantify, after a period of usage of the device of three months, improvement in subjects' Quality of Life using the validated tool, &quot;Veterans Affairs (VA) Low Vision (LV) Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VFQ) - 48 Questions&quot; (VA LV VFQ-48). Quality of Life is measured in Logits. Individual scores ranged from -5 to +10 (a higher number is a better score). Overall improvement was 0.84 Logits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after three months of device use.</time_frame>
    <description>The study seeks to quantify, after a period of usage of the device of three months, improvement in visual acuity using standard optometric charts (e.g. &quot;20/400 to 20/160&quot;, etc.). We measured LogMAR acuity on a standard ETDRS chart. Results show an average greater than seven-line improvement (-0.76 LogMAR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Visual Contrast Performance in Log Units.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after three months of device use.</time_frame>
    <description>The study seeks to quantify, after a period of usage of the device of three months, improvement in contrast performance using a standard optometric &quot;Mars Contrast Chart&quot;. Outcome is measured in Log Units ranging from 0.04 to 1.92 in decrements of 0.04 log units, a higher score indicating better contrast performance. The scale of the Mars Contrast Chart is interpreted as follows:
0.0 - 0.5 Log Units: Profound Loss 0.5 - 1.0 Log Units: Severe Loss 1.0 - 1.5 Log Units: Moderate Loss 1.5 - 1.75 Log Units: Normal Vision (&gt;60yrs) &gt;1.75 Log Units: Normal Vision (&lt;60yrs)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects between the ages of 13-75.

          2. Subjects have been diagnosed with one of the following low vision conditions: Diabetic
             Retinopathy, Stargardt's Disease, Age Related Macular Degeneration, Leber's Disease,
             Retinopathy of Prematurity, Cone Rod Dystrophy, or Ocular Albinism .

          3. Subject must have distance Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) measured with Early
             Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart of between 20:60 and 20:400 in the
             better eye.

          4. Subject must have a functional field of view of at least 20 degrees (bilateral or
             monocular). Field need not be centrally located.

          5. If the subject is employed, they must be prepared to use eSight Eyewear in their
             workplace environment, have informed their employer of their involvement in the study,
             and received permission from their employer to bring eSight Eyewear into the
             workplace. If the subject is self-employed, they must be prepared to use eSight
             Eyewear in their workplace environment. Similarly if the subject is a student, they
             must be prepared to use eSight Eyewear in their educational environment.

          6. Subject must be, in the opinion of the examiner, highly motivated, alert, articulate,
             mentally competent and able to understand and comply with the requirements of the
             study (defined herein).

          7. Subject must provide informed consent. Subjects under the age of majority must have a
             legal guardian present during the informed consent process, who must sign the Informed
             Consent form on their behalf.

          8. Subject must agree to use eSight Eyewear only under conditions that will not
             jeopardize the safety of either the user or the device.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must not be currently undergoing any medical or surgical procedures resulting
             in unstable vision.

          2. Subjects for whom their vision, for whatever reason, can be considered unstable.

          3. Subjects who have undergone cataract, refractive, or other surgical procedures related
             to vision in the six month period prior to the study.

          4. Subjects who have undergone any eyesight-related injections (e.g. anti-VEGF) in the
             two month period prior to the study because of active bleeds in the retina. Ongoing
             anti-VEGF treatments are permitted if subject is in a &quot;Treat and Extend&quot; or pro re
             nata (&quot;PRN&quot;) disease management, and macula is dry.

             who exhibit clinical evidence of depression, poor motivation, emotional or
             intellectual problems, or any other conditions which would likely limit validity of
             consent or appropriate responses to participate in the study or who are deemed
             unsuitable psychologically or physiologically for study participation by the
             investigator.

          7. Subjects who may have a conflict of interest with eSight Corp, which could reasonably
             influence their participation in the study.

        <description>The study seeks to quantify, after a period of usage of the device of three months, improvement in subjects' Quality of Life using the validated tool, &quot;Veterans Affairs (VA) Low Vision (LV) Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VFQ) - 48 Questions&quot; (VA LV VFQ-48). Quality of Life is measured in Logits. Individual scores ranged from -5 to +10 (a higher number is a better score). Overall improvement was 0.84 Logits.</description>

        <title>Improvement in Visual Contrast Performance in Log Units.</title>
        <description>The study seeks to quantify, after a period of usage of the device of three months, improvement in contrast performance using a standard optometric &quot;Mars Contrast Chart&quot;. Outcome is measured in Log Units ranging from 0.04 to 1.92 in decrements of 0.04 log units, a higher score indicating better contrast performance. The scale of the Mars Contrast Chart is interpreted as follows:
0.0 - 0.5 Log Units: Profound Loss 0.5 - 1.0 Log Units: Severe Loss 1.0 - 1.5 Log Units: Moderate Loss 1.5 - 1.75 Log Units: Normal Vision (&gt;60yrs) &gt;1.75 Log Units: Normal Vision (&lt;60yrs)</description>
