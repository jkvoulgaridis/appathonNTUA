  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) after switching from a stable regimen consisting of emtricitabine/tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) plus a third antiretroviral
      (ARV) agent in participants harboring the archived nucleoside/nucleotide reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance mutation M184V and/or M184I in human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -1 reverse transcriptase.

      This is a two part study. If the rate of virologic failure in Part 1 is deemed acceptable,
      once the internal data monitoring committee officially completes the interim review, the
      study will continue to Part 2.

        <description>The percentage of participants with PVR for HIV-1 RNA cutoff at 50 copies/mL at Week 12 was summarized. PVR was the percentage of participants who did not have a confirmed virologic rebound. Virologic rebound was defined as 2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA values ≥ 50 copies/mL or the last available HIV-1 RNA value ≥ 50 copies/mL during the study followed by premature discontinuation from the study.</description>
