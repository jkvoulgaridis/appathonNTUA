  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, open-label, three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate the
      effects of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise vs. 12 weeks of resistance exercise vs. usual care in
      men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer to determine the safety,
      feasibility, and tolerance of exercise; quality of life indicators, and a prognostic score.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a PI-initiated, randomized clinical trial of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise vs. 12
      weeks of resistance exercise vs. usual care among 39 men with metastatic castration resistant
      prostate cancer. Eligible men will be randomized with equal probability to one of the three
      regimens. All patients will receive a packet of print material on diet, exercise, and
      psycho-social support appropriately geared for men with late stage disease at the end of the
      trial. The aerobic exercise arm (N=13) will receive a 3 day/week remotely-supervised exercise
      regimen that includes high-intensity interval training and continuous vigorous intensity
      aerobic exercise training. The resistance exercise arm (N=13) will receive a 3 day/week
      remotely-supervised resistance exercise regimen incorporating different volumes and loads.
      Men in the control arm (N=13) will be asked to continue their typical exercise practices for
      12 weeks. Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires, physical function and strength
      tests, body measurements, and collection of blood specimen at baseline and 12 weeks.
