  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is currently detected by ultrasound-guided biopsy. Computer-aided diagnostic
      (CAD) systems based on multiparametric MRI are now capable of detecting most aggressive
      cancer foci non-invasively, but additional progress is needed for the technique to be
      accepted in clinical practice. We hypothesize that combining MRI and ultrasound imaging can
      improve the detection of cancerous tumors. As a first step in this direction, we need to
      create a database with MR images, 3D ultrasound images, and corresponding histopathology
      results, in patients treated by radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. This is the
      purpose of the present study.

      In a later stage (outside the scope of this study), we will be learning how to combine these
      images to best recognize cancerous tumors, we will use that knowledge to develop a new CAD
      system, and we will assess the performance of the new CAD. We expect this future system to
      improve the detection of prostate cancer and to reduce the number of patients requiring
      biopsy.
