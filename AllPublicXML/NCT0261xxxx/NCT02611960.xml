  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus standard of care (SOC) treatment
      (capecitabine, gemcitabine, or docetaxel) for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic
      nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      pembrolizumab or Investigator's choice of SOC treatment.

      The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab treatment prolongs Overall Survival (OS)
      when compared to SOC treatment.
