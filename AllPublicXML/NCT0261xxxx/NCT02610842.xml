      Hands are commonly affected in Systemic Sclerosis (SS). The objective of this research is to
      apply a home based hand care guide in patients with SS and to evaluate its response regarding
      hand pain, function, strength and mobility.

      Introduction: Hands are commonly affected in Systemic sclerosis (SS). Skin thickening,
      Raynaud phenomenon, digital ulcers and cutaneous calcinosis may result in pain, disability
      and claw deformity. Strategies to improve hand function are recommended since its diagnosis
      and throughout the treatment. Unfortunately hand care assistance is not often available. The
      objective of this study was to developed a brief guide about hand care and home-based
      exercises to be applied in our outpatient clinic.

      Methods: A brief program , with instructions about the disease and home-based exercises will
      be applied in a group patients with Systemic Sclerosis (SS) during the period of 12 weeks.
      Hand function (Cochin Hand and Functional Scale), disability (HAQ-Scleroderma), quality of
      life (SF-36 hand pain (visual analogue scale), grip and pinch strength, hand mobility (delta
      finger) will be assessed in the first appointment and after twelve weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cochin Hand Functional Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>08 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this self-report scale is to measure functional ability in the hand.
The questions ask how much difficulty the person has performing 18 tasks without the help of any assistive device. Kitchen tasks include holding a bowl and a plate full of food, pouring liquid, cutting meat, and peeling fruit. The dressing items include buttoning and opening/closing a zipper. The hygiene items include squeezing a tube of toothpaste and holding a toothbrush. Office items include 2 writing tasks, while other items include turning a doorknob, cutting with scissors, and turning a key in a lock. Score range is from 0-90. A higher score indicates greater disability or more difficulty, whereas a lower score indicates less disability or difficulty.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hand pain (pain-VAS) was assessed using a 10 cm horizontal pain scale. Pain severity was rated from 0-10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = very severe pain</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Delta Finger-to-palm</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The standard finger-to-palm (FTP) measurement is obtained using a ruler to measure the distance (in centimeters)between the tip of the pulp on the 3rd finger and the distal palmar crease while the patient attempts to make a full fist (maximal finger flexion at all 3 finger joints: MCP, PIP, and DIP). The delta FTP is finger extension, the distance between the 3rd fingertip and the distal palmar crease while the patient attempts full finger extension, minus the FTP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire, is a self-administered 20-questionnaire that assesses functional ability in eight domains. Questions in each domain are scored in a four-point scale, from 0 (&quot;without difficulty&quot;) to 3 (&quot;unable to do&quot;). The maximum score from each domain is added together and divided by the number of categories completed (score ranging from 0 -better to 3 - worse). The Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) consists of the 20 items from the HAQ and has five additional questions that assess symptoms caused by Systemic Sclerosis (Raynaud Phemonomenon, digital tip ulcers, gastrointestinal and lung symptoms, as well as overall disease symptoms) using visual analogue scales (VAS). Scores on the VAS range from 0 (does not interfere with activities) to 3 (very severe limitations with activities). The overall score is the sum of each of the five VAS sub scores and the scores for the eight HAQ domains divided by 13. The SHAQ index ranges from 0 to 3.</description>

        <title>Cochin Hand Functional Scale</title>
        <description>The purpose of this self-report scale is to measure functional ability in the hand.
The questions ask how much difficulty the person has performing 18 tasks without the help of any assistive device. Kitchen tasks include holding a bowl and a plate full of food, pouring liquid, cutting meat, and peeling fruit. The dressing items include buttoning and opening/closing a zipper. The hygiene items include squeezing a tube of toothpaste and holding a toothbrush. Office items include 2 writing tasks, while other items include turning a doorknob, cutting with scissors, and turning a key in a lock. Score range is from 0-90. A higher score indicates greater disability or more difficulty, whereas a lower score indicates less disability or difficulty.</description>

        <title>Delta Finger-to-palm</title>
        <description>The standard finger-to-palm (FTP) measurement is obtained using a ruler to measure the distance (in centimeters)between the tip of the pulp on the 3rd finger and the distal palmar crease while the patient attempts to make a full fist (maximal finger flexion at all 3 finger joints: MCP, PIP, and DIP). The delta FTP is finger extension, the distance between the 3rd fingertip and the distal palmar crease while the patient attempts full finger extension, minus the FTP.</description>

        <title>Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire, is a self-administered 20-questionnaire that assesses functional ability in eight domains. Questions in each domain are scored in a four-point scale, from 0 (&quot;without difficulty&quot;) to 3 (&quot;unable to do&quot;). The maximum score from each domain is added together and divided by the number of categories completed (score ranging from 0 -better to 3 - worse). The Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) consists of the 20 items from the HAQ and has five additional questions that assess symptoms caused by Systemic Sclerosis (Raynaud Phemonomenon, digital tip ulcers, gastrointestinal and lung symptoms, as well as overall disease symptoms) using visual analogue scales (VAS). Scores on the VAS range from 0 (does not interfere with activities) to 3 (very severe limitations with activities). The overall score is the sum of each of the five VAS sub scores and the scores for the eight HAQ domains divided by 13. The SHAQ index ranges from 0 to 3.</description>
