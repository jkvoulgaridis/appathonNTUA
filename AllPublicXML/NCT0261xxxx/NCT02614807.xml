  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure is very common among elderly Canadians. Clinical trials show clear
      benefit from lowering blood pressure in hypertensive elderly patients. These trials also
      demonstrate safety for several classes of blood pressure lowering drugs including water
      pills. However, water pills (thiazide diuretics) used for treatment of hypertension, can
      cause low sodium (hyponatremia), a significant clinical problem mainly among elderly and very
      elderly. Causes are age related decrease in kidneys' ability to get rid of water and low salt
      coupled with high water intake. A standard approach to treatment is lacking since higher salt
      intake may worsen hypertension, and lower water and higher protein intake is difficult to
      understand and actually implement. 'Nepro' is a nutritional drink high in protein, and low in
      potassium and sodium. It is used frequently as a dietary supplement in patients with kidney
      disease specifically for low sodium and high protein content. The high protein content in
      Nepro can help the kidney get rid of excess water, and the low sodium and potassium content
      will make this a safe option to use. Hence investigators propose a proof-of-concept trial on
      an easy to understand and administer, and relatively affordable solution to this issue. It
      could be summarized in one sentence: &quot;Will a bottle of Nepro a day keep thiazide-caused
      hyponatremia and the doctor away?&quot;

    <description>All recruited patients will receive a standard endorsement of lower fluid intake (&lt;1.5 Litres/day) by a hypertension nurse and physician and an additional treatment consisting of a bottle (237 ml) of Nepro (a low sodium, low potassium content protein supplement) a day (supply for 4 weeks will be provided).</description>

    <intervention_type>Dietary Supplement</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Nepro</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention is a dietary protein supplement. In the elderly hypertensive patient (assuming body weight of 70 kg) with mild to moderate hyponatremia free water excess is around 2.5 L. One bottle of Nepro/day will generate about 120 mosm to be excreted via urine. Given limited and mostly fixed urinary dilution and concentration between 300 and 800 mosm/L in the elderly and very elderly, one bottle of Nepro a day will result in an extra 400 ml of urine for a net loss of 163 ml of free water. Thus over the period of 2 to 4 weeks the calculated free water excess should be completely eliminated.</description>
