          7. Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          8. Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm^3

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm^3

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN
                  (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with known liver metastasis)

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min (calculated by the Cockcroft Gault formula).

          9. Female subjects are eligible to enter and participate in the study if they are of:

             a) Non childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),
             including any female who

             i) Has had a hysterectomy,

             ii) Has had a bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy),

             iii) Has had a bilateral tubal ligation, or

             iv) Is post menopausal (total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year).

             days of the first investigational product administration), and uses adequate
             contraception before study entry and throughout the study until 28 days after the last
             investigational product administration. Adequate contraception, when used consistently
             and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician,
             are defined as follows:

          3. Any major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment.

          4. Any radiotherapy within 14 days prior to enrollment, providing the subject has
             recovered from all toxicities to NCI-CTCAE ≤ Grade 1.

             investigational product administration.

          6. Unresolved toxicity &gt; Grade 1 (according to NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.03) from previous
             anti cancer therapy, unless agreed by the sponsor.

          7. History or presence of gastrointestinal disease or other condition known to interfere
             with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.

             BGB-283).

          9. Untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastasis. Subjects with previously treated brain
             metastasis that are asymptomatic, off steroids for longer than 28 days are permitted.

         10. Any unstable, pre-existing major medical condition that in the opinion of the
             Investigator contra indicates the use of an investigational product, including active
             infection, known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive subjects, or known
             Hepatitis B or C.

         11. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol.

         12. As a result of the medical interview, physical examination or screening
             investigations, the investigator considers the subject unfit for study.
