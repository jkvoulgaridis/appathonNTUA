  <official_title>A Phase 3, Randomized, Active-Comparator Controlled Clinical Trial to Study the Contraceptive Efficacy and Safety of the MK-8342B (Etonogestrel + 17β-Estradiol) Vaginal Ring and the Levonorgestrel-Ethinyl Estradiol (LNG-EE) 150/30 μg Combined Oral Contraceptive (COC) in Healthy Women 18 Years of Age and Older, at Risk for Pregnancy.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the contraceptive efficacy of the etonogestrel +
      17β-estradiol (ENG-E2) vaginal ring in women between 18 and 35 years of age based on the
      number of in-treatment pregnancies as expressed by the Pearl Index (PI). The study will also
      assess the safety and tolerability of ENG-E2 vaginal ring. The levonorgestrel-ethinyl
      estradiol (LNG-EE) 150/30 μg combined oral contraceptive (COC) will be used as the active
      comparator.

    <measure>Number of In-Treatment Pregnancies Per 100 Woman-Years of Exposure in Participants 18-35 Years of Age (Pearl Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year (13 28-day cycles)</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure for this study was contraceptive efficacy, or the prevention of in-treatment pregnancy. The total incidence of in-treatment pregnancies was expressed as the Pearl Index, which is defined as the number of in-treatment pregnancies per 100 woman-years of exposure (one woman-year defined as a period of 365.25 days). NOTE: Due to early termination of this study, the ENG-E2 reporting group received only up to 10 cycles of treatment, and the LNG-EE reporting group received only up to 9 cycles of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. NOTE: Due to early termination of this study, the ENG-E2 reporting group received only up to 10 cycles of treatment, and the LNG-EE reporting group received only up to 9 cycles of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Breakthrough Bleeding/Spotting (BTB-S), by Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>BTB-S was considered any bleeding/spotting that occurred during expected non-bleeding interval that was neither early nor continued withdrawal bleeding. BTB-S was classified as follows: Bleeding = any bloody vaginal discharge that required one or more sanitary pads or tampons per day; Spotting = any bloody vaginal discharge that required no sanitary pads or tampons per day. NOTE: Due to early termination of this study, the ENG-E2 reporting group received only up to 10 cycles of treatment, and the LNG-EE reporting group received only up to 9 cycles of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Absence of Withdrawal Bleeding (AWB), by Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to keep a daily diary to record vaginal bleeding events. AWB was defined as no bleeding/spotting during the expected bleeding period. NOTE: Due to early termination of this study, the ENG-E2 reporting group received only up to 10 cycles of treatment, and the LNG-EE reporting group received only up to 9 cycles of treatment.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.

        <description>Participants were asked to keep a daily diary to record vaginal bleeding events. AWB was defined as no bleeding/spotting during the expected bleeding period. NOTE: Due to early termination of this study, the ENG-E2 reporting group received only up to 10 cycles of treatment, and the LNG-EE reporting group received only up to 9 cycles of treatment.</description>
