      Background:

      Retinal diseases cause the loss of rod and cone photoreceptors. Symptoms include vision loss
      and night blindness. Researchers want to learn about rod and cone function in healthy people
      and people with retinal disease. They want to know if how well a person sees in the dark can
      test the severity of retinal disease.

      Objectives:

      To find out if how well a person sees in the dark can test the severity of retinal disease.
      To find out if this can help detect retinal disease and track its changes.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 5 and older with:

      Retinal disease OR

      20/20 vision or better with or without correction in at least one eye

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical and eye history and eye exam. Those with retinal
      disease will also have:

      Eye imaging: Drops dilate the eye and pictures are taken of it.

      Visual field testing: Participants look into a bowl and press a button when they see light.

      Electroretinogram (ERG): An electrode is taped to the forehead. Participants sit in the

      dark with their eyes patched for 30 minutes. Then they get numbing drops and contact

      lenses. Participants watch lights while retina signals are recorded.

      Visit 1 will be 3-8 hours. Participants will have up to 6 more visits over 6-12 months.
      Visits include:

      Eye exam and imaging

      Time course of dark adaptation: Participants view a background light for 5 minutes then

      push a button when they see colored light.

      Dark adapted sensitivity: Participants sit in the dark for 45 minutes. They push a button
      when

      they see colored light.

      For participants with retinal disease, ERG and visual field testing

      Objective: The objective of this protocol is to investigate local changes in rod and cone
      photoreceptor function across the retina in healthy volunteers and participants with retinal
      disease.

      Study Population: Up to 120 healthy volunteers and 250 participants, age five or older, with
      retinal disease.

      Design: This single-center, observational, case-control study will be comprised of three
      related Aims that assess rod and cone function with the recently released commercial Medmont
      Dark Adapted Chromatic (DAC) perimeter and/or a commercial Cambridge Research Systems
      computer monitor (Display++) specialized for displaying stimuli at low light intensities. For
      Aim 1 the normal ranges will be established for dark-adapted retinal sensitivities to blue
      and red stimuli of the DAC perimeter, and for radial frequency (RF) hyperacuity on the
      Display++ monitor. For Aim 2, the normal range will be established for describing the
      kinetics of dark adaptation following bleaching of retinal rhodopsin for the DAC perimeter.
      For Aim 3, local changes in rod and cone photoreceptor function across the retina in
      participants with retinal disease will be examined from measurement of the kinetics of dark
      adaptation, dark-adapted retinal sensitivity to the DAC blue and red stimuli, and/or RF
      hyperacuity on the Display++ monitor.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome for this study is to establish normal ranges for A) the
      kinetics of dark adaptation (time), B) dark adapted retinal sensitivity (dB) for the Medmont
      DAC blue and red stimuli, and C) RF hyperacuity on the Display++ monitor. The secondary
      outcomes will be to examine changes in the kinetics of dark adaptation, dark adapted retinal
      sensitivity, and scotopic and photopic RF hyperacuity in participants with retinal disease.
