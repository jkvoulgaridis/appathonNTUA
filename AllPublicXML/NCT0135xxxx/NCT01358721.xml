    <description>PFS is defined as the time from treatment arm assignment to the date of first documented disease progression. Participants who die without a reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Participants who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments will be censored on the date they were assigned a treatment arm. PFS rate is the percentage of participants who did not have disease progression at particular time points (16 weeks, 24 weeks, 48 weeks)</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival Rate in BMS-936558</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the time from treatment arm assignment to the date of first documented disease progression. Participants who die without a reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Participants who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments will be censored on the date they were assigned a treatment arm. PFS rate is the percentage of participants who did not have disease progression at particular time points (16 weeks, 24 weeks, 48 weeks)</description>
        <time_frame>Progression free survival rate will be assessed in each individual treatment arm by tumor assessments at 16, 24, and 48 weeks. From initial dose to end of study (assessed up to 39 months)</time_frame>

          <title>Progression Free Survival Rate in BMS-936558</title>
          <description>PFS is defined as the time from treatment arm assignment to the date of first documented disease progression. Participants who die without a reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Participants who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments will be censored on the date they were assigned a treatment arm. PFS rate is the percentage of participants who did not have disease progression at particular time points (16 weeks, 24 weeks, 48 weeks)</description>
