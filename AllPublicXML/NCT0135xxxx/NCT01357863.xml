  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a multicenter prospective observational cohort study, trying
      to cover almost all Brazilian States, in a population of ErbB2 positive metastatic breast
      cancer patients, whose disease has progressed after trastuzumab-containing regimen, comparing
      outcomes in two groups: Group 1: patients receiving Lapatinib-capecitabine immediately after
      1st Trastuzumab progression (second line treatment), and Group 2: patients receiving
      Lapatinib-capecitabine after 2 or more lines of treatment after 1st trastuzumab progression
      (third line or greater).

    <textblock>
      All cases of ErbB2 positive metastatic breast cancer, receiving approved standard treatment
      with lapatinib-capecitabine, after trastuzumab-containing regimen progression in community
      setting can participate in this observational study, for a period of 12 months of observation
      since the start of the lapatinib-capecitabine treatment.

        with lapatinib-capecitabine, after trastuzumab-containing regimen progression in community
        setting can participate in this observational study, for a period of 12 months of
        observation since the start of the lapatinib-capecitabine treatment.

        Centers from private and public settings, which have incorporated Lapatinib treatment in
        their routine clinical practice, will be included in this study. Data on the country, type
        of center, and facility name will be collected on the case report form for use in the data
