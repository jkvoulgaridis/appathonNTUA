  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the effects of Vitamin D supplementation on the
      body's response to insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar), on inflammation, and on
      specific cells and processes in fat tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last several years, studies have shown that low vitamin D levels may increase risk
      of developing Type 2 Diabetes. The investigators will administer vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)
      to non-diabetic, insulin resistant subjects with vitamin D deficiency (total vitamin D levels
      &lt;20 ng/ml) to increase the level of vitamin D3. The investigators will study the effects of
      increased Vitamin D on insulin action, adipose tissue inflammation, and on certain cells and
      processes in fat tissue.

      Investigators will study participants with a procedure called a &quot;pancreatic clamp&quot; study.
      During the clamp procedure, glucose (a sugar) and insulin (a hormone produced in the pancreas
      that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood) are infused with an intravenous catheter,
      and blood samples are collected periodically throughout the procedure to measure blood sugar
      levels and the levels of several hormones that are found in the body and are related to
      glucose metabolism. Adipose tissue inflammation will be measured using the following
      inflammatory markers: IL-6, PAI-1, TNF-alpha, and iNOS.

    <measure>Percent Change in Hepatic Insulin Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>2nd clamp visit (after up to 3 months) and 3rd clamp visit (after up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Endogenous glucose production (EGP) was assessed at each study visit to evaluate hepatic insulin sensitivity. Percent change between the EGP at baseline and second visit (after treatment for up to 3 months with Vitamin D to reach a target level of ≥30 ng/ml), and baseline and third visits (after treatment for up to 6 months with Vitamin D in order to reach a target level of ≥50 ng/ml) will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change in Peripheral Glucose Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>2nd clamp visit (up to 3 months) and 3rd clamp visit (up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of glucose uptake to determine peripheral insulin sensitivity was measured using the rate of disappearance (Rd) of glucose at each study visit. Percent change between the Rd at baseline and second visit (after treatment with Vitamin D for up to 3 months to target level of ≥30 ng/ml), and baseline and third visits (after treatment with Vitamin D for up to 6 months to target level of ≥50 ng/ml) will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Evaluated Expression of Pro-inflammatory Gene TNF-α</measure>
    <time_frame>2nd clamp visit (up to 3 months) and 3rd clamp visit (up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Adipose tissue macrophages will be isolated from subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, and will be quantified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. TNF-α gene expression will be examined by real-time (rt-PCR) and will provide a measure of macrophage activation at baseline, at 2nd study visit (after treatment with Vitamin D to a goal level of ≥30 ng/ml), and at 3rd study visit (goal Vitamin D level of ≥50 ng/ml). The mRNA copy number is then compared with a reference gene copy number (5 commonly used house keeping genes [HKGs]) as a ratio, which is a measure of relative gene expression.</description>

        <title>Evaluated Expression of Pro-inflammatory Gene iNOS</title>
        <description>Adipose tissue macrophages will be isolated from subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, and will be quantified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. iNOS gene expression will be examined by real-time (rt-PCR) and will provide a measure of macrophage activation at baseline, at 2nd study visit (after treatment with Vitamin D to a goal level of ≥30 ng/ml), and at 3rd study visit (goal Vitamin D level of ≥50 ng/ml). The mRNA copy number is then compared with a reference gene copy number (5 commonly used house keeping genes [HKGs]) as a ratio, which is a measure of relative gene expression.</description>

        <population>iNOS expression was measured in 7 (out of 11) participants in the Vitamin D group. For the placebo group, 6 of the 8 participants provided fat biopsy samples for the 2nd visit, and 4 participants provided for the 3rd visit due to loss to follow up, withdrawal, or difficulties in obtaining IV access.</population>
