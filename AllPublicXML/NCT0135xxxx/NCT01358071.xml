  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized phase II trial is to compare progression-free
      survival (PFS) in patients randomized to NGR-hTNF plus an anthracycline versus patients
      randomized to an anthracycline alone
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considering the safety/toxicity profile of NGR-hTNF characterized by mild-to-moderate
      constitutional symptoms, the reversibility of these adverse events generally occurring only
      during the infusion time; the absence of overlapping toxicities with chemotherapeutic agents;
      the safety and preliminary antitumor activity observed in previous trial with doxorubicin;
      and the objective response rate (RR) registered in a phase II trial in previously treated
      ovarian cancer patients seems justified to evaluate in a randomized phase II trial the
      efficacy of NGR-hTNF against a doxorubicin-based option in advanced ovarian cancer patients
      progressing or recurrent after a standard platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy.
