  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS). SLOS is an
      inherited condition that is caused by the body not making an enzyme as it should. The body
      needs the enzyme to help make cholesterol. SLOS can cause many health problems including slow
      growth and development, eating disorders, sleep disorders, behavior disorders, and eye
      diseases. Severe SLOS leads to birth defects and mental retardation and in many cases early
      death. The investigators plan to measure cholesterol and other sterol levels, perform
      clinical observations, whole body testing and imaging (brain MRIs), to learn more about the
      disease and its progression, differences in the clinical features among individuals with
      SLOS, and look at the effect of cholesterol supplementation in this condition.

      The study is an interventional study to characterize disease progression and correlations
      between clinical, biochemical and physiological features of the disease. The main hypothesis
      is that dietary cholesterol supplementation does not improve features of SLOS related to the
      brain (e.g. IQ, behavior).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a disorder of cholesterol synthesis, or production. It
      is caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene which encodes for 7-dehydrocholesterol-
      Î”7-reductase, an enzyme necessary for the production of cholesterol in the body. Affected
      individuals exhibit multiple malformations and mental retardation. The features of SLOS are
      thought to be primarily related to cholesterol deficiency and accumulation of cholesterol
      precursors. However, the clinical phenotype is not well characterized, the biochemical
      pathogenesis is incompletely understood, and there is no proven therapy for this devastating
      condition. Thus our primary objective is to better define the clinical and biochemical
      phenotypes of the disease using a natural history study design. The study will contribute to
      creating a comprehensive SLOS patient registry, identify biomarkers that can be used for
      diagnostic testing, screening and outcome measures in future therapeutic trials. All patients
      with SLOS receive dietary cholesterol supplementation with the hope that cholesterol
      supplementation will improve the clinical manifestation of the disease. However, there is no
      evidence supporting a clinical benefit of cholesterol supplementation. Thus a secondary
      objective of the study is to determine if cholesterol intake correlates with changes in whole
      body cholesterol homeostasis and clinical end-points.

    <description>All new subjects will come to their first visit with an least 3 weeks of stable cholesterol intake. Typically and preferably this will include egg yolk as cholesterol supplement, but in some instances e.g. intolerance to egg yolk it may include a new encapsulated cholesterol preparation, Sloesterol.</description>

    <intervention_type>Dietary Supplement</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Cholesterol supplementation</intervention_name>
    <description>Cholesterol supplementation may be achieved with SLOesterol instead of or in combination with egg yolk. SLOesterol is a powder formulation that contains cholesterol and natural emulsifier. It is considered a medical food developed by Solace Nutrition and available by prescription only.</description>
