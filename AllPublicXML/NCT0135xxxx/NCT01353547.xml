      The purpose of the research study is to identify the genetic, environmental and immune
      profiles that may increase a person's risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). While MS is
      not a disease caused by a single variation in genetic material (DNA), a single environmental
      factor, or a single malfunction in immune cells, there are genetic alterations, environmental
      exposures and immunologic factors that make the development of MS more likely. Obtaining
      information about who is at risk for MS will be beneficial in the future if the investigators
      can identify effective ways to prevent or slow down the progression of this disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system (white bloods cells that normally
      fight infection) becomes misdirected and attacks healthy tissue. In patients with MS, the
      misdirected white blood cells attack myelin, a lining that insulates the nerves found in the
      brain and spinal cord. This results in inflammation and damage in the myelin. Loss of this
      protective lining disrupts nerve impulses and causes abnormal function in the nervous system.

      This large research study will ultimately enroll 5000 subjects who are at risk of developing
      MS.

    <description>For each subject, weighted integrated risk score will be calculated, combining genetic burden and environmental exposure. A distribution of the risk score will be generated for the cohort. At this stage, the study will assess whether there is an increase in subjects with a diagnosis of MS (validated by a letter or copy of clinical records from the subject's neurologist) within the higher end vs. the lower end of the risk score distribution.</description>

        This large research study will ultimately enroll over 10000 subjects who are at risk of
        developing MS. The study will last 20 years. We will recruit subjects from all over the
        United States, as everything is done via mail, email, or/and phone.
