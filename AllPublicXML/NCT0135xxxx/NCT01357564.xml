    <textblock>
      The Tailored Activity Program - Veterans Administration is a Phase III efficacy trial
      designed to reduce behavioral symptoms in Veterans with dementia living with their caregivers
      in the community. The study uses a randomized two group parallel design with 160 diverse
      Veterans and caregivers. The experimental group receives a transformative patient-centric
      intervention designed to reduce the burden of behavioral symptoms in Veterans with dementia.
      An occupational therapist conducts an assessment to identify a Veteran's preserved
      capabilities, deficit areas, previous roles, habits, and interests to develop activities
      tailored to the Veteran. Family caregivers are then trained to incorporate activities into
      daily care. The attention-control group receives bi-monthly telephone contact where education
      on topics relevant to dementia is provided to caregivers. Key outcomes include reduced
      frequency and severity of behavioral symptoms using the 12-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory
      (primary endpoint), reduced caregiver burden, enhanced skill acquisition, efficacy using
      activities, and time spent providing care at 4 months; and long-term effects (8 months) on
      the Veteran's quality of life and frequency and severity of behavioral symptoms, and
      caregiver use of activities. The programs' impact of Veterans Administration cost is also
      examined. Study precision will be increased through face-to-face research team trainings with
      procedural manuals and review of audio-taped interviews and intervention sessions.

      This study tests the efficacy of a transformative patient-centric intervention designed to
      reduce the burden of NPS in Veterans with dementia who live at home with family caregivers.
      The innovative intervention, the Tailored Activity Program (TAP-VA), involves 8 sessions over
      4 months in Veterans' homes. An occupational therapist conducts a systematic assessment to
      identify a Veteran's preserved capabilities and deficit areas, and previous roles, habits and
      interests from which to develop and introduce activities tailored to the Veteran's profile.
      Family caregivers are then trained to incorporate tailored activities into daily care
      routines. The intervention was pilot tested in an NIMH funded study with 60 community-living
      individuals with dementia. Findings from this pilot showed statistically significant and
      clinically meaningful reductions in NPS, specifically agitation and less time being on &quot;duty&quot;
      by family caregivers. Results of this pilot phase support moving forward with a full-scale
      Phase III efficacy trial. The investigators tested TAP-VA in a randomized two-group parallel
      design in which 160 racially and ethnically diverse Veterans with dementia and their family
      caregivers (dyads) were randomly assigned to receive TAP-VA or an attention control group.
      All dyads were evaluated at baseline and 4-months (main trial endpoint), and then reassessed
      at 8-months to evaluate long-term treatment effects (baseline to 8 months), including
      continued activity use, caregiver well-being, and costs.

    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) assesses the frequency and severity of 12 common behavioral symptoms in dementia.
The NPI Score is calculated by multiplying the total reported frequency by the severity score, with a theoretical range of 0-1704: high scores indicating greater frequency by severity.
The change between 2 or more time points is being reported. Baseline to T2 (4 months) - short-term measure; and baseline to T3 (8 months) - long term measure</description>

    <description>Occupational therapists assess the person's home environment, preserved capabilities, daily routines, interests and the caregiver's readiness and ability to use activities. Activities are developed that reflect the Veteran's previous or current interests and are modified to match their preserved capabilities without taxing the most impaired areas of cognition (e.g., memory, new learning). TAP-VA provides caregivers with the knowledge and skills to use activities. The overall goal is to provide predictability, familiarity, and structure in the daily life of the Veteran and establish a level of environmental stimulation appropriate to that person's abilities.</description>

        <title>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Measures the Frequency and Severity of Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia.</title>
        <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) assesses the frequency and severity of 12 common behavioral symptoms in dementia.
The NPI Score is calculated by multiplying the total reported frequency by the severity score, with a theoretical range of 0-1704: high scores indicating greater frequency by severity.
The change between 2 or more time points is being reported. Baseline to T2 (4 months) - short-term measure; and baseline to T3 (8 months) - long term measure</description>

            <title>Tailored Activity Program</title>
            <description>The INT is designed to draw on residual abilities of Veterans with dementia and provide an environment supportive of these abilities. Occupational therapists assess the person’s home environment, preserved capabilities, daily routines, interests and the caregiver’s readiness and ability to use activities. Activities are developed that reflect the Veteran’s previous or current interests and are modified to match their preserved capabilities without taxing the most impaired areas of cognition (e.g., memory, new learning). TAP-VA provides caregivers with the requisite knowledge and skills to use activities. Caregivers are instructed in specific skills such as ways to simplify activities, the environment and their communication, and how to help the Veteran initiate and follow a sequence. The overall goal is to provide predictability, familiarity, and structure in the daily life of the Veteran and establish a level of environmental stimulation appropriate to that person’s abilities.</description>

            <title>Attention Control</title>
            <description>The ATN Serves 3 purposes: 1) creates clinical equipoise, ensuring that ethical treatment is provided to all study participants; 2) controls for the one-on-one attention to caregivers in the intervention group to rule out potential effects of professional contact; and 3) serves as a retention tool. Caregivers in this group receive bi-weekly telephone contact by a trained healthcare professional. In each session, caregivers are provided important information about dementia and strategies for disease management. Each telephone contact begins with a brief overview of the specific purpose of the session, followed by a description of the key facts about the session topic, and concludes with a question and answer period. Table 2 outlines the specific domain and session content that is covered. The attention control group intervention is delivered by a member of the research team who is knowledgeable about dementia and has had prior experience working with family caregivers.</description>

          <title>Tailored Activity Program</title>
          <description>The INT is designed to draw on residual abilities of Veterans with dementia and provide an environment supportive of these abilities. Occupational therapists assess the person’s home environment, preserved capabilities, daily routines, interests and the caregiver’s readiness and ability to use activities. Activities are developed that reflect the Veteran’s previous or current interests and are modified to match their preserved capabilities without taxing the most impaired areas of cognition (e.g., memory, new learning). TAP-VA provides caregivers with the requisite knowledge and skills to use activities. Caregivers are instructed in specific skills such as ways to simplify activities, the environment and their communication, and how to help the Veteran initiate and follow a sequence. The overall goal is to provide predictability, familiarity, and structure in the daily life of the Veteran and establish a level of environmental stimulation appropriate to that person’s abilities.</description>

          <title>Attention Control</title>
          <description>The ATN Serves 3 purposes: 1) creates clinical equipoise, ensuring that ethical treatment is provided to all study participants; 2) controls for the one-on-one attention to caregivers in the intervention group to rule out potential effects of professional contact; and 3) serves as a retention tool. Caregivers in this group receive bi-weekly telephone contact by a trained healthcare professional. In each session, caregivers are provided important information about dementia and strategies for disease management. Each telephone contact begins with a brief overview of the specific purpose of the session, followed by a description of the key facts about the session topic, and concludes with a question and answer period. Table 2 outlines the specific domain and session content that is covered. The attention control group intervention is delivered by a member of the research team who is knowledgeable about dementia and has had prior experience working with family caregivers.</description>
