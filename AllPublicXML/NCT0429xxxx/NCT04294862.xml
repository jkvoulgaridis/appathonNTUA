  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate TNP-2092 distribution into joint tissues in participants
      undergoing a total hip arthroplasty (THA) or a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Tissue
      distribution is the primary objective, and plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and
      tolerability are secondary objectives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the tissue distribution, plasma PK, safety,
      and tolerability after a single 300 mg intravenous (IV) dose of TNP-2092 administered before
      induction of anesthesia in adult participants undergoing THA or TKA. Sixteen patients who are
      scheduled to undergo primary THA or TKA will be enrolled.

      The enrolled participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive the study
      intervention (a single 300 mg IV dose of TNP-2092) 2 hours before induction of anesthesia on
      Day 1. Tissue samples from bone and synovial fluid will be collected during surgery and
      analyzed for TNP-2092 and cefazolin concentrations. Plasma samples will be collected on Day 1
      and Day 2 for PK analysis. Safety and tolerability information will be collected on Day 1 and
      Day 2 at the clinical center, on Day 7 by phone, and on Day 14 at a final follow-up visit.
