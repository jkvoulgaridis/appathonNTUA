  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoablation combined
      with anti-pd-1 antibody in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma after progression
      on first line systemic therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have suggested that local destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation induced
      activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation
      of tumor antigens. While pd-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell
      regulatory signaling. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with anti-pd-1 antibody in
      patients in advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
