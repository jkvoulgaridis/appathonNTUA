    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research is to develop strategies and interventions to mitigate
      the impact of conscientious objection on women's access to safe abortion care in Mexico and
      South Africa using a user-centered design approach and test the feasibility and effectiveness
      of these interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conscientious objection (CO) is emerging as a growing barrier to abortion care, and evidence
      suggests that it is being incorrectly used as a justification for public sector medical
      providers and institutions to exempt themselves from their duties to provide essential
      reproductive health services for women. Given this, it is essential to better understand and
      address this misuse of CO and find ways to improve women's access to safe abortion services
      to prevent them from using unsafe methods which risk their health and lives.

      This study will conduct formative research to more fully understand the problem of CO in
      Mexico and South Africa and use these findings to develop interventions and strategies to
      mitigate the impact of CO on women's access to safe abortion care using a user-centered
      design approach. Rapid randomized controlled trials will then be used to assess effectiveness
      of the interventions. The specific aims of this study are:

        1. Improve our understanding of CO and its impact on access and quality of abortion care
           from providers' and facility mangers' perspectives in Mexico, and South Africa.

        2. Develop strategies and interventions to mitigate the impact of CO on women's access to
           safe abortion care. Using the data collected, a multi-disciplinary Innovation Team will
           develop strategies and interventions to respond to the challenges posed by CO using a
           user-centered design approach.

        3. Rapid-test intervention prototypes. We will test selected strategies (prototypes) in
           Mexico, and South Africa with assessments to determine successes, and the feasibility of
           scaling up these approaches.

    <description>Proportion of health facility staff exhibiting at least one behavior to make it more difficult for women to access abortion care (e.g. gave incorrect directions to a woman seeking abortion care, told a woman abortion services were not available at the facility, tried to convince a woman that she should not have an abortion, etc.).</description>

    <measure>Stigmatizing Attitudes Beliefs and Actions Scale (SABAS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and at 30-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Average Stigmatizing Attitudes Beliefs and Actions Scale (SABAS) score. The SABAS is a tool designed to measure abortion stigma at the individual and community level, ranging from a minimum of 18 to a maximum of 90. A higher score represents more stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs about women who have an abortion (worse outcome).</description>
