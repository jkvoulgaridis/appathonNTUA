    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well a web-based lifestyle intervention called Precision
      Nutrition Coaching Program works in improving health in African American cancer survivors.
      Participating in the web-based lifestyle intervention program reinforced with experienced
      lifestyle coaches and consisting of physical activity, nutritional/lifestyle habits, and
      educational lessons may help to improve overall health and well-being, fitness level, and
      quality of life in African American cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To conduct a pilot implementation research study to determine the viability, safety, and
      effectiveness of the use of a 12-month, commercially available, web-based lifestyle
      behavioral medicine intervention program by individuals who are or have been a Witness Role
      Model (WRM) in the National Witness Project (NWP).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To examine the feasibility of this research to subsequently investigate the effects of
      optimal health and/or lifestyle related behavioral medicine interventions used to promote
      optimal health on mitigating cancer-related and overall mortality disparities in African
      Americans (AA), and comorbidity/ chronic disease(s) management over time. (EXPLORATORY)

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete the 12-month Precision Nutrition Coaching Program web-based lifestyle
      intervention consisting of physical activity at home or a local gym, nutritional/lifestyle
      habit with a new focus biweekly, and educational lessons about health, nutrition, fitness, or
      behavior change.

    <description>The effects of the lifestyle intervention program will be ascertained via primarily subjective, self-reported assessments administered at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and a follow-up. Subjective data will be validated through the collection of objective data in a subset of local participants via in-person assessments. Generalized linear mixed model methods, specifically a repeated measures analysis of variance with a random participant effect, as well as fixed effects for time and interaction will be used.</description>
