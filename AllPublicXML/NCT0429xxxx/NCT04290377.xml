  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the efficacy of upper extremity rehabilitation using
      Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) on individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke. BMI is a device
      that can record and analyze human brain signals (in this study Functional near-infrared
      spectroscopy was used) and also provide live feedback (by pneumatic glove movement) to the
      individual wearing it. This device hypothetically enables more accurate training by
      reinforcing the correctly activated brain signal repeatedly then conventional therapy.

      In phase 1 study investigators will evaluate the feasibility of BMI on chronic stroke
      participants. 5 sessions of BMI-assisted occupational therapy (OT) will be performed and the
      Fugl Meyer Assessment-Upper Limb (FMA-UL) score change between the pre-treatment and
      post-treatment will be analyzed by paired t-test.

      In phase 2 study, a randomized controlled study will be performed by randomly allocating
      participants to either control (OT plus OT) or experimental group (BMI-assisted OT plus OT)
      and the difference of FMA-UL score change between the two groups will be analyzed by
      Student's t-test.

    <description>As the goal of the intervention is to promote finger extension in participants who are unable to extend his/her finger due to stroke, the pneumatic glove provides extension assist when appropriate brain activity is present. The brain activity is obtained by Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Hypothetically, this will repeatedly induce brain activation that is related to finger extension.</description>
