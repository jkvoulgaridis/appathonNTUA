      This study evaluates the efficacy of a rehabilitation intervention for people with Autism
      Spectrum Disorder through an individualised serious game developed for improving skills
      related to a specific daily living activity: shopping in a supermarket.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serious games are innovative computer-based interventions to support children and adults with
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, few studies have assessed the efficacy of these
      interventions in real-life contexts. The present study investigates the generalisation of
      daily living skills related to shopping activities after a rehabilitation intervention
      administered via a personalised serious game (ShopAut). The underlying hypothesis of this
      study is that training with an individualised serious game can improve performance in a
      real-life environment. In order to prove this hypothesis, a small sample of subjects with ASD
      will play an individualised serious game, ShopAut, for ten sessions. Subjects will undergo
      real-life experiences in a supermarket pre- and post-virtual training to determine whether
      there had been a generalisation of skills from the virtual environment to the real
      environment. Improvements in skills and performance in the real shopping activity are
      evaluated using specific tools.

      The serious game ShopAut is developed integrating an individualised design that provides both
      the personalisation of the game's scenario, contents, difficulty, and user interface; and the
      customisation of game modes, player perspectives, and input devices. It is a
      three-dimensional game that provides a realistic shopping experience where the player can
      practice and engage with, above all, shopping activities, experiment their problem-solving
      skills, and take on unexpected events.

    <description>In order to describe the participants' functioning in the supermarket, an ad hoc evaluation form was created based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: children and youth version (ICF-CY).

    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II (VABS-II) is a standardized paediatric functional assessment tool. The VABS-II offers a way to measure personal and social self-sufficiency in real-life situations and to observe how these cognitive abilities impact the autonomy management process when put into practice. The VABS-II consists in a semi-structured interview with the parents. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The serious game ShopAut, is a three-dimensional game conceptually based on classic 3D life simulation games. ShopAut aims to teach players the procedure of a shopping activity; to reinforce object categorization and recognition in a supermarket; to improve attention, orientation, and problem-solving skills; and to help the player engage in simple economic transactions.
The intervention provides a virtual training with ShopAut to train, experiment, and practice behaviours and actions that can be then transferred in real-life contexts.</description>
