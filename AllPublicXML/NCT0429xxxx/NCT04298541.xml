  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to propose the first direct comparison of Ga-68-DOTATATE PET and
      Ga-68-DOTATOC PET in patients with meningioma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator is proposing a direct comparison of Ga-68-DOTATATE and -DOTATOC in a pilot
      cohort of patients with meningioma, and hypothesize non-inferiority of DOTATOC. This pilot
      study will form the basis for a subsequent prospective clinical trial and will allow us to
      optimize our existing imaging protocols, while developing a more cost-effective protocol.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Optimize the Ga-68-DOTATATE and -DOTATOC PET protocol.

        -  Compare Ga-68-DOTATATE and -DOTATOC PET in patients with meningioma.

      Secondary Objectives

      â€¢ Correlate Ga-68-DOTATATE and -DOTATOC PET with clinical and pathological characteristics

    <intervention_model_description>The study intervention consists of 2 PET/CT scans that will be performed at least 24h apart using 68-Ga-DOTATATE and 68-Ga-DOTATOC radiotracers, in patients with suspected meningioma that are planned for subsequent surgery.
Visit 1 Patients will undergo 68-Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan.
Visit 2 At least 24h apart from Visit 1, patients will undergo 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scan.
Follow-up Phase Patients enrolled in the study are planned for surgery as part of SOC. After the two scans, patients will undergo surgery and a histopathologic analysis of the resected tumor will be performed. The histopathology results will be used to correlate molecular biomarkers with imaging parameters. Patients are not required to return physically to the clinic for a follow-up visit. However, during the follow up period a review of clinical and imaging records related to the diagnosis will be conducted by the research team as part of the study during the follow- up period.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitatively measure the visual appearance of target lesion to cranial blood pool using the maximum SUV ratio to compare results from Ga-68-DOTATATE and -DOTATOC PET.</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare visual appearance qualitatively using the maximum SUV ratio of target lesion to cranial blood pool (i.e. superior sagittal sinus reference region) of DOTATATE and DOTATOC PET scans in patients with meningioma.
Based on our pilot clinical case series, the following reference regions will be evaluated:
Suspected meningioma;
Pituitary gland;
Superior sagittal sinus;
Brain parenchyma.
Dynamic PET will be acquired and data will be analyzed including comparison of tissue-activity curves and Patlak analysis, as established by the PI in a pilot cohort.
Extent of meningioma based on Ga-68-DOTATATE- and DOTATOC PET/CT will be compared to extent of disease as determined by MRI.</description>

    <description>Compare visual appearance quantitatively using the maximum SUV ratio of target lesion to cranial blood pool (i.e. superior sagittal sinus reference region) of DOTATATE and DOTATOC PET scans in patients with meningioma.
Qualitative analysis will include evaluation by board certified radiologists with expertise in nuclear medicine/ molecular imaging who will be blinded to the radiotracer injected. Quantitative analysis will include extraction of the ratio of lesion's SUVmax values/reference regions.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolled in the study will subsequently undergo surgical resection of the lesion. The surgical specimen will be used for biomarker analysis to assess genetic information.
