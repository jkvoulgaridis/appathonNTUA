  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are among the most common chronic illnesses diagnosed in
      childhood. Moving from the pediatric to the adult health care is a crucial phase, which can
      greatly affect adolescents' quality of life. According to the latest international
      guidelines, based in particular on expert opinions, the implementation of joint visits
      (involving both pediatric and adult gastroenterologists) are highly recommended during the
      transition period. This trial aims to prove the beneficial effect of the joint visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transition care is a targeted, well-planned activity, which aims to facilitate the transfer
      of adolescents with chronic illnesses from pediatric to adult health care. Over the past few
      years, several recommendations have been introduced with respect to the transitional care of
      adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). According to the international
      recommendations, joint visits (involving both pediatric and adult gastroenterologists) are
      highly recommended during the transition period. Although joint visits are considered to be
      the most optimal form of structured transition, so far, no randomized controlled trial
      providing strong scientific evidence to prove the superiority of joint visits over usual care
      has been conducted. TRANS-IBD is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical
      trial designed to demonstrate the benefits of a structured transitional intervention
      involving joint visits. Patients in the intervention arm attend a total of four joint visits
      between the ages of 17 and 18. In the control arm, patients only meet the pediatric
      gastroenterologist but there is balanced consultation between the adult and the pediatric
      gastroenterologist, regarding the patient's medical history and treatment plan. Patients in
      both groups receive the same training and education, the only difference between the two arms
      is the presence of the adult gastroenterologist at the joint visits. The intervention period
      of the study starts at the age of 17 and lasts until the age of 18, when the participants are
      transferred to the adult gastroenterologist. The follow-up period starts from transfer and
      lasts until the end of the first year spent in the adult gastroenterology care.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, controlled, two-arm, multicentre trial. The target patient population consists of adolescents with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), aged between 16.75 and 17 years. The sample size calculation suggests that 160 subjects (80/ each arm) is required. The allocation ratio is 1:1. Eligible participants in the intervention arm attend a total of four joint transition visits with the adult and the pediatric gastroenterologist. In the control arm, adolescents meet only the pediatric gastroenterologist, but there is a balanced consultation between the two gastroenterologists regarding the patient's treatment plan. Patients in both groups receive the same training and education, the only determinative difference between the two arms is the presence of the adult gastroenterologist at the joint transition visits.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after transfer</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL is measured with a validated and IBD-specific questionnaire, called IMPACT III (HR) (unabbreviated scale title is not existing). It consists of 35-items, using a five-point Likert self-completed response scale. The questions are related to the severity and frequency of the following symptoms over the last two weeks: bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional functioning, social functioning, body image and treatments or interventions. The lowest score is 35, that can be achieved, and the maximum is 175 points. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of patients not lost to follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are considered as not lost to follow-up if they attend at least three out of the five planned visits with the adult gastroenterologist (AGE) during the follow-up period. Previously cancelled and then rescheduled AGE visits are acceptable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Medical Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5) which consist of five statements with respect to the patient's medical adherence in the last one week. Patients can describe their behavior on a five-point Likert response scale ranging from 'always' to 'never' (1-5 points). The lowest total score that can be achieved is 5 (lowest adherence), while the highest is 25 (maximal adherence). Higher scores indicate better medical adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy: IBDSES-A</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with IBD Self-Efficacy Scale for adolescents and young adults (IBDSES-A) questionnaire, which investigates the person's confidence in their ability to manage demands and is predictive of health outcomes in chronic disease. The maximum scores range from 21 to 57 (as reverse scoring is used in case of 2 items). Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's satisfaction: CACHE</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with CACHE questionnaire (unabbreviated scale title is not existing), which consists of 31 questions with respect to the attitude of the medical team, the location, accessibility, and facilities of the IBD centre. Questions can be answered with a five-point Likert response scale. The final score can be given on a scale that ranges from 0 (minimum satisfaction) to 100 (maximum satisfaction). The final total score is calculated with standardization, using the following formula to determine the points of each individual item: (real score-minimum score)/ (maximum score-minimum score) ×100. Higher score indicates higher level of satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Transition readiness (1)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Transition readiness is measured with the validated tool of Transition Readiness Questionnaire (STARx). STARx consists of three modules (with a total of 18 items), aiming to investigate the sense of responsibility, the disease-specific knowledge and the independency of the patients. Each item can be answered using a five-point Likert response scale and can be scored between 1 and 5 points. The maximum score is 90, higher score indicates better transition readiness. STARx is filled out by the participating adolescents and by their legal guardian too.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Transition readiness (2)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Transition readiness is measured with the validated tool of Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ). TRAQ consisting of 20 items and assesses the adolescents' willingness to be involved in or to be completely independent in managing disease related tasks (e.g., taking medications, making appointments, getting medications prescribed). A five-point Likert response scale (with scores range from 1 to 5) is used for answering each question. A total of 100 point can be acquired. In case of both tool, higher total scores indicate a higher level of transition readiness.</description>

    <description>The intervention is the implementation of joint transition visits with the participation of both the pediatric and the adult gastroenterologist. One-year intervention period was chosen. In total, there are four joint visits every third months for the adolescents aged 17-18. Each joint visit lasts for at least for 20 minutes, although in case of complex medical history, there is no restriction with respect to the length of the visit. Joint transition visits 1, 2 and 3 (V1-3) are led by the pediatric gastroenterologist, and visit 4 (V4) is led by the adult gastroenterologist.</description>
