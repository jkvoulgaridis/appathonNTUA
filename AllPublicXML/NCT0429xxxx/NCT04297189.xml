      Individual meeting - the first and last meeting are individual meetings with the clinic
      nurse. in the meetings we will take measurements of weight, height and blood pressure.

      data collection, pre-study questionnaires and initial coaching session (the first session may
      be divided into two sessions). at the first meeting, the nurse will check the participant's
      suitability for the study.

      Six group meetings will take place and will include:

      up-to-date knowledge on nutrition (by a dietitian), exercise (by a physiotherapist) and
      coping skills for stress (by a psychologist).

      additionally the meetings will also include coaching tools which the participants will
      practice during the session. The multidisciplinary team has been trained in coaching tools to
      evaluate in group settings.

      In the last individual meeting, participants will be asked to fill out post study
      questionnaires measurements will be taken (weight and blood pressure) and a final coaching
      meeting with the nurse.
