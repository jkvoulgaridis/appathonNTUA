  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      659/5000 Hemodialysis is a therapeutic strategy used in subjects with chronic renal failure.
      Our working hypothesis is based on results published in experimental animal models of stroke
      where the investigators have demonstrated that peritoneal dialysis is an effective technique
      to reduce blood glutamate levels and reduce infarct volume.

      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the viability, safety and efficacy of
      hemodialysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke, proposing that it may have a) a
      potential neuroprotective effect by reducing the excitotoxic levels of glutamate and
      proinflammatory cytokines in blood and b) fewer technical problems than peritoneal dialysis
      to apply in usual clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The reason for the present study is based on previous data from the group that demonstrated
      the following results: a) The decrease in plasma Glu, by peritoneal dialysis (PD), reduces
      the size of the brain infarct in a model of focal cerebral ischemia in rats; b) PD is
      effective in reducing plasma Glu levels in patients with chronic renal failure; c) PD is a
      safe and well tolerated procedure in patients with ischemic stroke in the acute phase,
      however, it was not a viable procedure in our conditions, due to the malfunction of the
      automatic system that made it difficult for the inclusion sessions and dialysate extraction
      and the difficulty for the collaboration of this type of patient with the procedure; d). The
      increase in the median concentration of Glu after cerebral infarction was reduced to 46%
      after PD.

      Based on our previous results, the investigators believe that hemodialysis may have fewer
      technical problems than PD and serve as a neuroprotection technique by lowering the levels of
      Glu and proinflammatory cytokines in blood. To do this, the investigators establish the
      following objectives: a) To evaluate the feasibility and safety of a hemodialysis procedure
      in patients with acute ischemic stroke compared to a control group; b) To analyze the
      clinical benefit of hemodialysis estimated by the volume of the infarction and the
      neurological and functional situation of the patients; and c) To measure the levels of
      glutamate and proinflammatory cytokines in plasma and dialysate samples. For this, a
      single-center, randomized, open-label, controlled study has been designed with a group of
      patients with ischemic stroke who receive conventional treatment (N=10) or conventional
      treatment + 2 hemodialysis sessions (N=10) in the acute phase of the stroke (Phase IIa
      clinical trial with medical device).

The active group will include patients with acute ischemic stroke who, in addition to conventional treatment (best possible medical treatment in patients admitted to a stroke unit), will undergo two hemodialysis sessions in the acute phase of stroke.
The control group will be composed of patients with similar clinical and demographic characteristics to whom only conventional medical treatment will be applied.</intervention_model_description>

The identity of the treatment will remain masked for the analysis of clinical and laboratory data:
The researchers will not know the determination of the concentration of Glu and proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and in the dialysate fluid of the patients until the end of the study, once the database is closed and the randomization codes are opened. Neuroimaging tests Mutimodal CT and simple CT) will be evaluated by a single Neuroradiologist of the Radiology Service of the Hospital de La Princesa, blind to the clinical and biological variables of the patients.</masking_description>

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.

    <description>Blood enters the extracorporeal circuit from the arterial line of the femoral catheter. For this the investigators use a pump integrated in the monitor, equipped with control systems, exerting a negative pressure.
Subsequently, it enters the dialyzer through the internal part of the capillaries (porous), producing a passive exchange of inflammatory and oxidative substances (such as cytokines) with the dialysis fluid, which also circulates through the dialyzer, but through the external part of the capillaries. Blood is returned to the patient, through the venous line of the catheter, with a lower concentration of cytokines after passing through the dialyzer.
This circuit is repeated continuously during the 3 hours of the procedure to ensure maximum clearance of glutamate and interleukins, among other substances.</description>
