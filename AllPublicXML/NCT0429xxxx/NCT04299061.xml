  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the level of physical activity and awareness of physical
      activity among university students studying in a department other than health sciences and
      who have taken courses on &quot;physical activity, exercise, healthy life&quot;.

      According to the results of the study, the perceptions of students from different departments
      on physical activity and exercise will be compared and the effects of the courses they have
      taken on students' attitudes of daily physical activity will be examined.

      Our hypothesizes are:

      1 . A course such as an exercise, physical activity or wellness increases the awareness and
      physical activity level of students studying in different branches.

      2. Stress and sleep problems are less common among students who do regular physical activity.

    <description>This measure assesses the types of intensity of physical activity and sitting time that people do as part of their daily lives are considered to estimate total physical activity in MET-min/week and time spent sitting. Walking = 3.3 METs Moderate Intensity = 4.0 METs Vigorous Intensity = 8.0 METs Total MET-minutes/week = Walk (METs*min*days) + Mod (METs*min*days) + Vig (METs*min*days). 1. Low: • No activity is reported OR • Some activity is reported but not enough to meet Categories 2 or 3. 2. Moderate: • 3 or more days of vigorous activity of at least 20 minutes per day OR • 5 or more days of moderate-intensity activity and/or walking of at least 30 minutes per day OR • 5 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 600 MET-minutes/week. 3. High: • Vigorous-intensity activity on at least 3 days and accumulating at least 1500 MET-minutes/week</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity Awareness Questionnaire - prepared by the researcher</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline of the study</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 13 questions to assess the physical activity level awareness of students. The questionnaire was prepared by the researchers so it does not have a validation. Questions are about determined the difference between meanings of exercise and physical activity. For example:
Mark it as yes, no or not know.
Physical activity and exercise mean the same thing.
Physical activity is a subcategory of exercise.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score. Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a 14-item self-report measure designed to assess &quot;the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (0 = Never, 1 = Almost Never, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Fairly Often, 4 = Very Often) and summed to create a total score. PSS-14 has strong internal consistency (α = .84 to .86) and good test-retest reliability (r = .85 over a 2-day period, r = .55 over a 6-week period.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</intervention_name>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month.The client self rates each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. A global sum of &quot;5&quot;or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper.</description>
