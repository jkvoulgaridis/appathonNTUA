  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KUR-113 Bone Graft
      (TGplPTH1-34 in fibrin) compared to local autograft for the treatment of Degenerative Disk
      Disease (DDD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a common disorder of the lumbar spine. Clinically, DDD
      causes discogenic back pain and may cause related radicular, neuropathic, claudicatory, and
      referred pain.

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind, dose-finding, multi-center study
      which intends to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of KUR-113 Bone Graft (TGplPTH1-34 in
      fibrin) versus local autograft. The study will enroll 50 patients with Degenerative Disk
      Disease (DDD) requiring single-level interbody fusion along with posterolateral fusion (PLF)
      with posterior fixation who meet eligibility criteria and agree to participate in the study.
      Safety and efficacy of KUR-113 Bone Graft will be evaluated by analyzing all clinical as well
      as radiological endpoints and adverse events. This phase 2a study is not powered to detect
      non-inferiority. All patients will undergo clinical and radiological assessments at initial
      hospital discharge (on average 3 days post-surgery), 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

             (Note: trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were investigational, but
             have since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials).
