  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Headstart Test system is an in vitro diagnostic test intended for self-testing for the
      detection of five biomarkers of infection in the urine of patients diagnosed with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      Patient urine testing will be conducted daily to establish a patient baseline biomarker
      profile and provide ongoing monitoring for changes in the biomarker profile. Headstart
      results will be used as an aid in monitoring and early detection of pulmonary exacerbation.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will be asked to collect and test a daily urine sample using a novel testing system
      (HeadStart Test system) in addition to answering questions abut their daily COPD symptoms for
      6 months.

      In summary, this study aims to validate a novel non-invasive point of care (near-patient)
      testing system, to allow people with COPD to detect pulmonary exacerbations by measuring
      urinary biomarkers. If successful, we hope that this will provide patients with an easy to
      use device, which will empower patients and their caregivers to treat exacerbations at an
      earlier stage, with potential health and economic benefits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 40 years or over.

          2. Diagnosis of COPD Stage 2-4 (GOLD I-IV) by spirometry.

          3. Be a frequent exacerbator ie. ≥2 moderate exacerbations in the past 12 months.

          4. Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years.

          5. Be willing and able to comply with study procedures and be available for study visits

          6. Be able to use a 'smart phone'.

          7. Be able to give written consent.

          8. Able to understand written and spoken English. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to give written informed consent

          2. Known respiratory disorders other than COPD which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             is the main contributor to patient's symptoms (e.g. asthma, lung cancer, sarcoidosis
             and other interstitial lung disease (ILDs), tuberculosis, lung fibrosis, cystic
             fibrosis, and non-COPD related bronchiectasis).

          3. Known history of significant systemic and other organ-related disease, other than
             COPD, which in the opinion of investigator, is likely to interfere with the study or
             impact on subject safety (e.g. severe rheumatoid arthritis and Lupus, kidney, liver,
             endocrine, psychological disorders).

          4. Known to be severely alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient (PI SZ or ZZ).

          5. Having undergone lung surgery (e.g. lung volume reduction, lobectomy) within the last
             6 months.

          6. Have cancer, or other terminal condition, which, in the opinion of investigator, has a
             mortality of 12 months or less.

          7. Have, in the opinion of the investigator, evidence of alcohol, drug or solvent abuse.

          8. Taking high dose oral corticosteroid medication (equivalent to daily dose of ≥10mg of
             prednisolone) for more than 3 consecutive months.

          9. Pregnancy

         10. Participation in an interventional clinical study within 3 months of Visit 1 or
             participation in a study using an investigational medicinal product (IMP) either in
             the previous 3 months or in the interval from last using the IMP to 5 times its
             half-life.

         11. Patients with other significant lung disease, unable to consent, unable to use the
             technology (e.g. inability to use the IVD device, or complete the questionnaires), or
             at the Clinician's discretion for other more significant medical/social reasons.
