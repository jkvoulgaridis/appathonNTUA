  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: There is some evidence demonstrating the effect of psychological interventions in
      improvements in health biological parameters. To best of our knowledge, no study had
      addressed the impact of any psychological intervention on extracellular vesicles. In
      addition, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Emotion Focused Therapy for Cancer
      Recovery (EFT-CR) in the group have never been explored regarding extracellular vesicles and
      the effectiveness of these was not compared yet.

      Objectives:

        1. To explore and compare the effect of MBCT and EFT-CR on biological parameters and
           psychological variables in distressed people who have had breast, prostate and
           colorectal cancer;

        2. In addition, we will explore the acceptability through recruitment and retention rates
           of MBCT and EFT-CR in group and evaluate whether these interventions are appropriate for
           a larger clinical trial.

      Methods: The design of this study is a parallel randomized controlled trial. Participants
      will be randomized into MBCT, EFT-CR or usual care. Outcome measures will be assessed before,
      at the end of the intervention (8 weeks) and follow-ups (24 and 52 weeks from the baseline
      moment).

      Hypotheses: The researchers expected that both interventions will have an effect on
      extracellular vesicles and other study biomarkers as well as improvements in psychological
      outcomes, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) group. Regarding the comparative
      effectiveness, we did not have evidence to hypothesize which one of the interventions will be
      superior in both biological (extracellular vesicles) and psychological outcomes.

      Contribution for practice: The results of this preliminary study would permit to know if
      there are benefits of these psychological interventions on changes in extracellular vesicles
      and on psychological outcomes related to health. In addition, this study will permit to
      determine the acceptability of conducting a larger randomized controlled trial.

    <time_frame>T0-before intervention; T1-8 weeks after T0; T2-24 weeks after T0; T3-52 weeks after T0</time_frame>
    <description>The collected extracellular vesicles will be quantified by Nanoparticle tracking analysis (Nanosight Ltd.), and data will be measured in particles per milliliter (mL). NTA measures Brownian movements on a particle-by-particle basis tracking movements by image analysis. Additionally, miR21-5p - a brain related microRNA - will be measured to ascertain for the extracellular vesicle's origin. The latter will be achieved by isothermal DNA amplification method, and data will be measured by luminescence (in RLU - relative light unit).</description>

In addition, the participants identified therapeutic changes as result of the therapy and are asked to rate these changes in three scales: expected change (1: change totally expected; 5: totally unexpected); change without therapy (1: the change would not have happened; 5: change would happen for sure); and the value of the change (1: nothing important; 5: extremely important).</description>

    <description>MBCT is a program developed by Zindel Segal, Mark Williams and John Teasdale. During MBCT patients learn to decenter their negative thoughts and feelings, allowing the mind to move from an automatic thought pattern to conscious emotional processing. Mindfulness practices included in this program are breath awareness, body scan, sitting and walking meditation, and mindful yoga. The intervention will have the following structure: 8 weekly face-to-face meetings of 2 hours in a group format, daily home-based practice of learned skills, 4 hours of retreat/intensive group work after the fifth week, 6 months of home practice, 4 monthly consolidation face-to-face sessions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Emotion Focused Therapy Group for Cancer Recovery (EFT-CR)</intervention_name>
    <description>EFT-CR is an evidence-based approach to psychotherapy, which combines aspects of person-centered, gestalt and existential therapies with contemporary emotion theory and dialectical constructivism (Elliott et al, 2004, Rice &amp; Greenberg, 1984). On EFT-CR, therapist follows the client experience and guides the process, proposing therapeutic tasks when specific client behaviors occur. EFT-CR uses a set of emotion change principles which guide a process of emotional deepening process, from undifferentiated distress to secondary reactive emotions to primary maladaptive emotions to core pain and thence to primary adaptive emotions and emotional transformation (Elliott &amp; Greenberg 2016). The intervention will have the following structure: 8 weekly face-to-face meetings of 2 hours in a group format, daily home-based practice of learned skills, 4 hours of retreat/intensive group work after the fifth week, 6 months of home practice, 4 monthly consolidation face-to-face sessions.</description>
