  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased accessibility to cannabis and its primary psychoactive constituent THC has raised
      public health concerns. One major concern surrounds the potential risks associated with acute
      THC intoxication and who might be most at risk. A second major concern is the need to develop
      sensitive measures that can detect THC intoxication after recent use and enable robust
      comparisons of intoxication to determine sources of risk. One potential source of risk is
      age, specifically during the period of adolescence.

      There is limited knowledge on the effects of THC in adolescents vs adults. One recent report
      compared responses to vaporized cannabis in heavy adolescent vs adult cannabis users and
      found that the adolescents were less sensitive to the drug on most measures. However, their
      findings were complicated by several factors: i) the study used vaporized cannabis, which may
      have other constituents and does not offer full control of the dose, ii) the participants
      were heavy users, making it difficult to determine the influence of prior drug exposure, and
      iii) the participants were not drug-free at the time of testing. Prior exposure to THC can
      lead to tolerance, and adolescents and adults may differ in the rate at which they develop
      tolerance, consistent with changes in CB1R receptor function. Our study will compare
      adolescent (here, aged 18 to 20) and adult (here, aged 30 to 40) responses to THC in
      relatively light cannabis users who are drug-free at the time of testing.

    <description>The POMS measures individuals' mood states. This is a validated scale to measure positive and negative mood states. The POMS contains 30 items and assess six identified mood factors: Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Ejection, Anger - Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-Bewilderment. Scoring of this instrument provides a global score of 0 to 120 or individual domain scores. Lower scores indicate better mood state. The POMS brief form is a simple self-rating instrument</description>

    <description>THC (Marinol® [dronabinol]; Solvay Pharmaceuticals) will be orally administered in doses of 7.5 mg and 15 mg, in opaque capsules with dextrose filler. Placebo capsules contain only dextrose. These doses of THC are known to produce performance impairments as well as subjective intoxication with little to no adverse reactions in experienced occasional, but non-daily cannabis users (Ménétrey et al., 2005; Issa et al. 2016).</description>
