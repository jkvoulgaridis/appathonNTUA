  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral small vessel diseases (SVD) are a very frequent group of disorders all characterized
      by alterations of the structure and/or function of small arteries, veins and capillaries. In
      these disorders, brain tissue lesions accumulate years before the occurrence of clinical
      symptoms which can be devastating such as stroke, cognitive disturbances and gait disorders.
      So far, chronic hypoperfusion was considered to be responsible for the accumulation of such
      lesions. However, recent results have suggested that the lesions underlying white matter
      hyperintensities (WMH), the most common MRI marker of SVD visible on conventional MRI in
      quite every subject with SVD long before the occurrence of clinical events, may depend on the
      considered brain area and may correspond to various mechanisms. Some WMH may even be
      associated with less severe clinical manifestations.The aim of the present study is to
      identify different types of WMH by studying 100 patients with different forms of SVD with the
      most advanced MRI (including ultra-high-resolution imaging at 7 Tesla, new diffusion
      protocol, sodium MRI, contrast-enhanced angiography and relaxometry and post-processing
      techniques), and post-processing techniques (machine learning, deep learning, artificial
      intelligence).

    <description>Depression and anxiety will be assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. The HAD scale is a self-assessment scale for detecting states of depression and anxiety in the setting of an hospital medical outpatient clinic.
HADS is a self-administered scale of 14 items which assessed levels of depression and anxiety, divided into 2 subscales of 7 items (Anxiety or HADS-A, Depression or HADS-D). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 3. A score is generated for each of the two sub-scales (sum of the 7 items, ranging from 0 to 21). Limit scores, for each of the scores, distinguish: non-cases or asymptomatic ones (score ≤ 7); probable or borderline cases (score 8-10); clearly or clinically symptomatic cases (score ≥ 11).</description>
