  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have reported that asthmatic or chronic pulmonary obstructive disease
      patients have an increased response to pain stimulus. However, this aspect has not been
      evaluated in allergic patients. Additionally, the difference in pain sensitivity between
      asymptomatic period crisis have not been evaluated yet.

    <measure>Pressure pain threslhold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The pain pressure thresholds (PPTs) were evaluated by an analogic manual mechanical algometer. This tool consisted of a circular platform with an area of 1 cm2 area, which was perpendicularly applied to generate progressive pressure on the skin at a 1 kg/sec rate. The points selected were chose based on a previous study in asthma patients. Patient was assessed in a seated position and pressure was applied two times at five bilateral points of the body: At two distal points, the distal thumb phalangeal and the gracilis muscle tendon at the inside of the knee. Further at three points at the chest, the costae II, distal of the midst part of the clavicle, the supraspinous muscle and the trapezius muscle's second portion, between the angulus superior at scapulae and the vertebral column.</description>

    <measure>Leicester Cough Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) was used to evaluate cough. This questionnaire brief, easy to administer and well-validated. It consists of 19 items with scores ranging from 1 to 7 and it is divided in three subscales: physical, psychological, and social. The minimum and maximum achievable LCQ total scores are 3 and 21, respectively. A lower LCQ score signifies more cough</description>

    <measure>Borg scale</measure>

    <description>The Borg scale was used to assess the dyspnea, which is a comprehensive instrument designed to measure breathlessness in patients with respiratory pathology. Patients rated their dyspnoea from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no dyspnoea&quot; and 10 represents &quot;maximum dyspnoea.&quot; A difference of 0.9 units was considered as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), according to previous studies in patients with respiratory disease</description>

    <measure>Catastrophizing about Asthma Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In the Catastrophizing about Asthma Scale (CAS) patients rate the extent to which 24 items expressing catastrophic thoughts and feelings about asthma are applicable to themselves (e.g., &quot;There is nothing I can do to reduce the intensity of the asthma attack&quot;, &quot;I worry all the time about whether the asthma attack will end&quot;, &quot;I feel I can't go on&quot;). The scale has two subscales, one referring to the situation of an asthma exacerbation (the exacerbation scale; 13 items), the other scale referring to daily life, whenever no exacerbation is present (general scale; 11 items). The CAS has high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .93), excellent test-retest reliability (r = .94), and good construct validity.</description>

    <description>In each testing session two series of contacts of the mechanical probe with the flexor digitorum muscle (one at ISI 3 s and one at ISI 5 s) were presented to each forearm. The forearms were always alternated between each series of contacts. Ratings of both forearms were used to control for differences in hand dominance and sites of pain.</description>

    <measure>Health status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D was used to evaluate self-perceived health status and is divided into two sections. The first section contains five questions about mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. For each question, problems within the domain are evaluated on a three-level basis. Responders can choose between Bno problems^, Bsome problems^, or Bextreme problems^. The second part is a VAS score, which records the responder's self-evaluated health, where 0 is the worst imaginable health and 100 is the best imaginable health.</description>
