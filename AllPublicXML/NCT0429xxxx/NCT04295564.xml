  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to see if an extra 2 weeks of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in
      stable preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can cause increased lung
      growth and lung function in the infants as measured at 6 months of age by pulmonary function
      testing.

      This is a study to see if an extra 2 weeks of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in
      stable preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can cause increased lung
      growth and lung function in the infants as measured at 6 months of age by pulmonary function
      testing. CPAP is a treatment widely used in the NICU in preterm infants right after they are
      born to help keep their lungs open/inflated. Although the benefit of CPAP after birth has
      been well studied, no one knows how long a stable preterm infant should stay on CPAP. The
      primary outcome of this study is to compare the lung volumes in the infants at 6 months of
      age by pulmonary function testing who were randomized to 2 extra weeks of CPAP in the NICU
      versus CPAP discontinuation, usual care. During the same pulmonary function test the
      investigators will also measure and compare how the infant's lungs diffuse gas.
