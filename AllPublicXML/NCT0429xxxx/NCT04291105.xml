  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study designed to determine the preliminary anti-tumor activity and confirm
      the safety of VV1 in combination with cemiplimab. The study will concurrently enroll patients
      with four distinct advanced malignancies in 5 separate tumor cohorts. The four cancers type
      are NSCLC and melanoma that are progressing on CPI treatment, CPI-naïve HCC, and
      treatment-naïve Endometrial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with melanoma will be enrolled into two parallel cohorts; in one cohort (Intravenous
      melanoma cohort) patients will receive IV VV1 and patients in the other cohort (Intratumoral
      melanoma cohort) will receive both IV VV1 and Intratumoral VV1; both cohorts will receive IV
      cemiplimab in combination therapy with VV1 treatment. Patients with NSCLC, HCC or endometrial
      cancer will receive IV VV1 and IV cemiplimab combination therapy.

          2. Specific by tumor cohorts:

               -  For the HCC cohort, confirmed diagnosis of inoperable HCC by histology or
                  clinical/radiological criteria. i. No prior therapy with a PD-(L)1 immune
                  checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) (prior sorafenib is permitted). ii. No or one prior
                  line of systemic therapy only. iii. Child Pugh Score A or B7.

               -  For the NSCLC cohort, histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced and/or
                  metastatic NSCLC in which radiological progression has been demonstrated during
                  therapy with a PD(L)1 immune CPI and for which no existing options are felt to
                  provide clinical benefit (only one line of PD-(L)1 therapy is permitted).

             Progression during or following 1 or more prior regimen(s) and no more than 3 prior
             therapeutic regimens for metastatic disease.

               -  For the melanoma cohorts, histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced and/or
                  metastatic melanoma in which radiological progression has been demonstrated
                  during therapy with a PD(L)1 immune CPI and for which no existing options are
                  considered to provide clinical benefit (only one line of PD(L)1 therapy is
                  permitted). Progression on ipilimumab is not required. Note: For IT melanoma
                  cohort:

                    -  i. At least one tumor lesion amenable to repeated IT injection via palpation
                       or ultrasound. Injection of deep visceral lesions is not permitted.

                    -  ii. Agrees to provide a newly obtained biopsy of injected and witness
                       lesions prior to start of study treatment, and to repeat biopsies twice
                       during study treatment, and to providing the acquired tissue for biomarker
                       analysis. Tissue obtained for the biopsy must not be previously irradiated,
                       but a new or progressing lesion in the radiation field is acceptable.

               -  For the endometrial cancer cohort, histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced
                  and/or metastatic endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. Eligible patients will
                  not have had any prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting.

          3. For patients treated with prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy:

               -  Last dose of anti-PD-(L)1 must be within 12 weeks of initiating study treatment.

               -  Patient must have received at least 4 doses on q2w, 3 doses on q3w or 2 doses on
                  q4w schedule of the previous anti-PD-(L)1 therapy.

               -  Progression on prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy must be defined by:

               -  Documented radiographic progression on a single radiographic scan, if treatment
                  with anti-PD-(L)1 was ≥ 16 weeks.

               -  Documented radiographic progression on two consecutive radiographic scans at
                  least 4 weeks apart, if treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy was between 8 - 16
                  weeks; if radiographic progression is accompanied with clinical progression, then
                  a single scan assessment may be used.

               -  If progression was only in lymph nodes, biopsy to provide histological
                  confirmation of progression in the lymph node is required.

          4. Measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

        Key Exclusion criteria: Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at
        screening/Day -1 of first dosing will not be enrolled in the study

             inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune hepatitis, lupus, or pneumonitis, with the
             exception of hypothyroidism and type 1 diabetes that are controlled with treatment.
