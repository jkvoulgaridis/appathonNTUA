  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart diseases are among the most common congenital anomalies and occur with an
      incidence of approximately 8ınd12 / 1,000 live births worldwide. This figure does not cover
      minor lesions such as bicuspid aortic valves and small atrial or ventricular septal defects.
      Most of these defects do not need treatment or treatment is needed after infancy. Other
      defects are severe and usually require early treatment in the neonatal period. Critical
      congenital heart disease is defined as structural heart defects that are associated with
      hypoxia in the neonatal period and have significant morbidity and mortality potential in
      early life. Critical congenital heart disease is estimated to be ~3 in 1000 live births. It
      is estimated that 50% of congenital heart diseases are detected by prenatal ultrasound. Even
      if a standard neonatal examination is performed, 13 to 55% of patients with critical
      congenital heart disease can be discharged from the hospital without being diagnosed.

      Screening of infants with non-invasive oxygen saturation measurement has been proposed as an
      adjunct to early detection of critical congenital heart disease.

      The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart
      Association have targeted 7 specific lesions for the pulse oximetry screening protocol:
      truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great arteries, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of
      Fallot, total pulmonary venous return anomaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome and pulmonary
      atresia.

      The reference values of peripheral perfusion (PPI) index has been established for normal
      newborns between 1 and 120 h of age.

      Lower PPI values than 0.70 may indicate illness. Including cut-off values for PPI in
      pulse-oximetry screening for duct dependent congenital heart disease is a promising tool for
      improving the detection of critical congenital heart disease with duct-dependent systemic
      circulation.

      We aimed to investigate screening critical congenital heart disease and also to establish
      normal values of oxygen saturation and perfusion index at high altitude.
