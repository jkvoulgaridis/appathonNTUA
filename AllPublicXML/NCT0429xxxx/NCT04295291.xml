  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survival after intrahospital cardiac arrest has been reported to 15%. In Norway this
      varies between 16 and 23%.). Many factors are associated with survival after cardiac arrest,
      both intra- and prehospital. Recent studies have not included information about individual
      patient factors and the outcome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In the current
      hospital, we are able to record patient specific information related to a cardiac arrest/CPR
      situation, and thereby be able to assess patient-related factors associated with both
      detection, treatment and outcome of CPR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several factors have been associated with survival, e.g. to monitor hands-off time(Odds
      ratio, OR, for 2.48, 95% KI 1.11-5.56, p=.03), monthly assessment of all cardiac arrest cases
      (OR 6.9, 95% KI 1.41-33.92), and includin av local coordinator for CPR (OR 2.93, 95% KI
      1.08-7.94, p=.03), as well as depth of compressions. Nevertheless, information about cardiac
      arrests and CPR have not been assessed in relation to patient specific information. In the
      current hospital, we are able to record the CPR sequence, and see this in relation to other
      patient- and case- specific information such as initial cardiac rythm, time to first
      compression, hands-off time, quality of CPR, and factors affecting the treatment and outcome.

      The hospital has 71 registered defibrillators used in CPR. The current study will both gather
      retrospective data- not seen in relation to patient specific information, and prospective
      data related to specific patients.
