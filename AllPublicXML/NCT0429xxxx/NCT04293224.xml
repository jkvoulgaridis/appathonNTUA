  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, at the Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC), will focus on whether or
      not achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is the most important health promoting
      recommendation of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA).The investigators hypothesize
      that improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors resulting from eating a DGA style diet will
      be greater in people whose energy intake is restricted to result in weight loss compared to
      those who maintain their weight. The investigators further propose that during a state of
      energy restriction, a higher nutrient quality diet such as the DGA style diet pattern, will
      result in greater improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors compared to a typical American
      diet (TAD) pattern that tends to be lower nutrient quality (more energy-dense and less
      nutrient-rich.)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 32-week study including baseline testing (week 0), increased physical activity
      in all groups, pre-diet testing (week 5), an 8-week controlled feeding period, post-diet
      testing (week 14), a follow-up period of dietary education and observation, and end of study
      testing (week 32). During the 8 week feeding, participants will be randomly assigned one of
      the following diets:

        1. DGA Mediterranean diet pattern at sufficient energy level to maintain body weight
           (energy balance)

        2. DGA Mediterranean diet pattern at a moderately reduced energy level (negative energy
           balance)

        3. TAD diet pattern at a moderately reduced energy level (negative energy balance)

      In the follow-up phase, the investigators will evaluate how multiple factors may influence
      body weight management, including previous dietary exposure, as well as the role of cognitive
      function, executive function, genetics, habitual diet, physical activity, eating behavior,
      stress and stress responsivity, metabolic flexibility and gut microbiome.
