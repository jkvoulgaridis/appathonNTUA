  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) and the licenced multicomponent
      MenB vaccine (Bexsero®) have already been included in the Italian childhood immunization
      programme and recommendations for high risk categories have been also implemented.

      As by NIP, vaccination against MenB with either 4CMenB or fHbp-MenB is offered for free for
      several conditions including subjects with severe primary or secondary immunodeficiency.

      In Liguria Region meningococcal vaccination is actively offered to several chronic conditions
      including asplenia, patients with lymphoproliferative disease (also HSCT), subject treated
      with anti-CD20 mAb and HIV-positive.

      In Liguria Region there is a large diverse population with risk condition that, as by
      national and regional recommendation, receive meningococcal vaccination. For some of them,
      i.e. asplenic and complement deficiencies groups, evidence have been generated through an ad
      hoc clinical trial, while for other important groups there is clear need of immunogenicity
      data.

      In the proposed study, the Investigators plan to administer two doses of MenB vaccine
      (Bexsero®), 1-2 months apart, to adult patients living in Genoa area and belonging to
      following categories:

        -  Bone marrow transplant (HSCT patient)

        -  HIV positive

        -  Alfa-CD20 subjects (i.e. Patients candidates for / in treatment with biologic drugs such
           as Rituximab).

      Immunogenicity data will be then obtained from sera collected at the day of the first Bexsero
      dose and one month after the immunization course by Serum Bactericidal Activity (SBA) assay.
