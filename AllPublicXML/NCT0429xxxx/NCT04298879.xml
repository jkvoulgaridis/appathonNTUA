        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18 years or older.

          2. Histologically confirmed, relapsed or refractory, follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin
             lymphoma (NHL) (FL) Grade 1, 2, and 3a or MZL.

          3. Ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

          4. Definition of RRFL or RRMZL: Subjects should have received 2 or more prior therapies
             for FL/MZL included at least one regimen containing Rituximab. Subjects should be
             refractory to Rituximab or experienced disease progression after achieved remission or
             disease progression within 6 months since last therapy.

          5. Radiographically measurable lymphadenopathy or extranodal lymphoid malignancy (defined
             as the presence of ≥ 1 lesion that measures &gt; 1.5 cm in the longest dimension and ≥
             1.0 cm in the longest perpendicular dimension as assessed by computed tomography (CT)
             or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          6. Subjects must be willing to undergo an incisional, excisional, or core needle lymph
             node or tissue biopsy or provide a lymph node or tissue biopsy from the most recent
             available archival tissue.

          7. ECOG performance status 0 to 2.

          8. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

          9. Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.

         10. Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1 . Known histological transformation from indolent NHL to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

        2. History of central nervous system lymphoma (either primary or metastatic).

        3. Prior treatment with idelalisib, other selective PI3Kδ inhibitors, or a pan-PI3K
        inhibitor.

        4. Prior treatment with a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (eg, ibrutinib).

        5. Allogeneic stem cell transplant within the last 6 months, or autologous stem cell
        transplant within the last 3 months before the date of study treatment administration.

        6. Active graft-versus-host disease. 7. Subjects positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
        or hepatitis B core antibody will be eligible if they are negative for HBV-DNA. Subjects
        positive for anti-HCV antibody will be eligible if they are negative for HCV-RNA.
