  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this placebo-controlled, double-blind study is to determine the effects of a
      commercially available (i.e. dietary supplement) Hemp Oil Extract product on various markers
      of physical and mental stress resilience, and perceived recovery from normal daily physical &amp;
      mental stress. Secondary purposes are to collect information on perceived appetite, mood,
      feelings of wellbeing, sleep quality, body composition and safety information via standard
      clinical chemistry panels of sera and plasma.
