  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, in order to visualize the inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart using ultrasound,
      physicians traditionally place the ultrasound probe onto the &quot;Subcostal&quot; area which is
      located below the chest in the upper abdomen area. In this location, the pressure from the
      ultrasound probe is often uncomfortable for adults, and even more so for pediatric patients.
      Previous research and physician experience have demonstrated that it is possible to visualize
      the heart in the &quot;transhepatic&quot; area which is located under the arm on the side of the chest.
      By placing the ultrasound probe in this location, it is more comfortable for the patient when
      applying pressure, and this study aims to prove the effectiveness of visualizing the heart
      through this new location.
