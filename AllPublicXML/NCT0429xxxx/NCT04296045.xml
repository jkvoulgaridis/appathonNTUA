  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maize Cob Extract (MCE) is intended to be used as a bulking agent in food. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the glycaemic and insulinemic response of MCE consumed in
      isolation compared to glucose; the glycaemic and insulinemic response will also be determined
      for MCE alone and in combination with glucose. This is a randomised, double-blind,
      single-centre trial in 10 healthy male participants.
