  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-part study is composed of two stages: a Phase Ib stage consisting of a
      dose-escalation phase and an expansion phase; and a Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, multicenter stage. The Phase Ib stage will assess the safety and tolerability,
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), and
      evaluate the preliminary efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine in combination with venetoclax in
      participants with previously treated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive
      unresectable locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
      Additional patients may be enrolled in an expansion phase to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine in combination with venetoclax at RP2D in
      patients with previously treated HER2-positive LABC or MBC who have previously received
      either trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a). The Phase II randomized
      stage will evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab
      emtansine in combination with venetoclax at RP2D compared with trastuzumab emtansine plus
      placebo in participants with previously treated HER2-positive LABC or MBC who have not
      received prior trastuzumab emtansine therapy, either alone or in combination with other
      anti-cancer therapies.
