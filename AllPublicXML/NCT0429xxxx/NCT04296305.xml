  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV trial studies the effects of slow intravenous (by vein) hydromorphone compared
      to fast intravenous hydromorphone in patients with cancer experiencing breakthrough cancer
      pain. Breakthrough cancer pain is a temporary flare of severe pain. Giving hydromorphone may
      help decrease pain and future patients may benefit from what is learnt about the effects of
      slow intravenous hydromorphone compared to fast intravenous hydromorphone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the abuse liability potential of slow intravenous (IV) hydromorphone bolus
      infusion rate with fast IV hydromorphone bolus infusion rate among inpatients with
      breakthrough cancer pain (from the &quot;DRUG LIKING&quot; scale of the Drug Effects Questionnaire
      [DEQ] questionnaire).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the abuse liability potentials of slow IV hydromorphone bolus with fast IV
      hydromorphone bolus among inpatients with breakthrough cancer pain (from the other scales of
      the DEQ questionnaire).

      II. To compare the analgesic efficacy of slow IV hydromorphone bolus with fast IV
      hydromorphone bolus among inpatients with breakthrough cancer pain.

      III. To compare the adverse effects of slow IV hydromorphone bolus with fast IV hydromorphone
      bolus among inpatients with breakthrough cancer pain.

      IV. To explore the abuse liability potential of slow IV hydromorphone bolus with fast IV
      hydromorphone bolus among the sub group of patients who achieved successful analgesia,
      defined as at least a two point or 30% reduction in pain intensity score on a 0-10 scale.

      V. To obtain exploratory data regarding the relationship between pharmacogenetics and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of hydromorphone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A:

      TREATMENT PHASE I: Patients receive hydromorphone IV over 2 minutes and placebo IV over 5
      minutes.

      TREATMENT PHASE II: Patients receive hydromorphone IV over 5 minutes and placebo IV over 2
      minutes.

      GROUP B:

      TREATMENT PHASE I: Patients receive hydromorphone IV over 5 minutes and placebo IV over 2
      minutes.

      TREATMENT PHASE II: Patients receive hydromorphone IV over 2 minutes and placebo IV over 5
      minutes.

    <measure>Difference of peak abuse liability (AL) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The difference of peak AL scores (maximum score) of the &quot;Drug Liking&quot; scale of the Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) will be assessed between the two treatment groups. Paired t-test will be used to examine the change of peak AL scales. A linear mixed effect model will be fitted for the outcome variable to assess if there is any treatment effect, after taking into account of the &quot;sequence&quot; and &quot;period&quot; effect. A random effect due to patient will also be included. Other baseline covariates, such as patient demographic information will be included in the above model as fixed effects. Will also explore the patterns of the scale change over the two hours after each treatment using graphical tools and repeated measures analysis in which intra-patient correlation is considered at the model.</description>

    <measure>Change in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 120 minutes post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The change in NRS pain intensity scores from baseline to the lowest NRS pain score will be estimated in each treatment group. Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to examine the changes on NRS pain intensity between two treatment groups. Frequency of successful analgesia for each treatment phase will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals. Logistic regression model will be applied to assess the effect of demographics and/or clinical measurements on successful analgesia. The mean time post-intervention will be estimated along with a 95% confidence interval. Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to examine the difference on time post-intervention between two treatment sequences.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in adverse effects assessment scale</measure>

    <description>The mean change scores of the adverse effects assessment scales will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals. Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to examine the changes on adverse effects assessment scales between two treatment groups. Frequency and proportion of objective adverse effects will be reported and tabulated. Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, whichever appropriate, will be applied to test the association of adverse effect and treatment group.</description>

Pharmacokinetic parameters computed will include maximal plasma concentration, time to maximal plasma concentration, area under the concentration-time curve, elimination clearance, inter-compartmental clearances, central volume of distribution, peripheral volume of distributions, elimination half-life and inter-compartmental and distribution half-lives.
