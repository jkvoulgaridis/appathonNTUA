  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center pilot study is to verify the algorithm of mCVI® to accurately capture
      pulse rate and respiratory rate in 10 healthy subjects in comparison to
      commercially-available Masimo pulse oximeter devices. This is a non significant risk device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study the mCVI device is a mobile application used to simply verify the
      algorithm when the mobile video reads a patients pulse rate and respiratory rate while
      spontaneously breathing. There is no facial recognition technology. There is no immediate
      feedback given to the research team to act upon or provide for further clinical care
      decisions. In real time, the mCVI device will be compared to two commercially available pulse
      oximeter devices in a single visit.
