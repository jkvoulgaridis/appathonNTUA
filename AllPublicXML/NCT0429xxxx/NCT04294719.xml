  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will be a mixed-methods feasibility study of modified Cognitive
      Adaptation Training for an inpatient forensic mental health population (finCAT). Cognitive
      Adaptation Training (CAT) is an evidence-based compensatory cognitive intervention that
      focuses on improving functioning through the provision of environmental supports and cues.
      CAT is typically applied in outpatient care but has been successfully modified for inpatient
      service contexts in a Netherlands trial and at CAMH in previous pilots for both forensic and
      non-forensic inpatient populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will expand the investigators knowledge of the role of compensatory
      cognitive interventions for forensic inpatient populations with schizophrenia. Over the
      course of 6 months, the investigators will conduct a feasibility study of the delivery of a
      modified forensic inpatient version of Cognitive Adaptation Training. The objective of this
      single group study with pre-post and follow up assessments is to determine if preliminary
      outcomes and follow up findings support the feasibility of a modified version CAT within a
      forensic inpatient setting. Feasibility data will be used to inform (i) any necessary
      adjustments to the intervention, (ii) any necessary adjustments to the optimal time of study
      for outcomes to be observed, and (iii) to inform future trials with respect to anticipated
      recruitment and drop-out rates and optimal powering.

      This study would be among the few examinations of CAT as an inpatient intervention to date,
      as well as the first to examine a modified cognitive adaptation training approach in both a
      North American and forensic inpatient setting, and would make a substantial contribution to
      the evidence-based intervention literature. This intervention will be referred to as forensic
      inpatient CAT or finCAT.

      The questions for this project are:

        1. Is finCAT feasible for forensic inpatient populations with a schizophrenia spectrum
           diagnosis? Based on preliminary work the investigators hypothesize that finCAT will
           prove acceptable to patients and inpatient staff and will demonstrate positive outcomes
           with respect to functioning and inpatient room organization.

        2. What are the attitudes of inpatient forensic occupational therapists and clinical teams
           towards implementing finCAT on their units?

      This study will expand on the preliminary work of the investigators at CAMH. The study will
      be implemented on four CAMH general security forensic inpatient units. There will be four
      weeks of CAT Clinician--delivered treatment focusing on two goal areas - room organization
      and personal hygiene, followed by two months of maintenance by CAT Unit Champions with pre,
      post, and two-month follow-up, as well as project-end evaluations. In the first four weeks,
      the investigators will conduct a trial of finCAT for two of the four inpatient general
      forensic units, followed by two months of finCAT maintenance with Unit CAT Champions
      supported by the CAT Clinician. This process would then be repeated on the remaining two
      general units at CAMH. Previous implementation of CAT has demonstrated gains within
      one-month; however, follow-up assessments were not conducted to determine if gains were
      maintained over time. While brief, this time period (i) reflects the intent of this study as
      a pilot test of feasibility and, (ii) aligns with this circumscribed version of CAT (as
      compared to the more comprehensive community version with broader outcome domains). Data will
      be collected from both primary participants (inpatients) and the clinical team.

    <description>Room organization will be measured by ratings on the Clutter Image Rating Scale (CIRS; Frost et al., 2008). The CIRS is a 9-picture visual analogue scale used to quantify and standardize the amount of clutter in 3 different living spaces (kitchen, living room, and bedroom). For this project, only the bedroom rating scale will be utilized. The CIRS is used to measure the severity of clutter in compulsive hoarding.Before and after photos will be taken of each participant's room.

The LSP consists of 39 clinician-rated questions on a four-point scale and measures various aspects related to daily life activities: self-care; non-turbulence; social contact; communication; responsibility. For this project, only the self-care ratings from the full LSP-39 will be completed by service providers. Current inpatient research on the use of CAT also uses this scale as a primary measure of the effectiveness of CAT.

    <description>Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) is a standardized implementation of environmental supports for improving adaptive functioning including medication adherence, grooming, and daily activities in patients with schizophrenia. Environmental supports (signs, checklists) are manual-driven and grounded upon an assessment of neurocognitive function and behaviour. Assessment results yield one of six CAT classifications (Apathy/Poor Executive Functioning, Disinhibited/Poor EF, Mixed/Poor EF, Apathy/Fair EF, Disinhibited/Fair EF, Mixed/Fair EF).The goal will be to improve organization and self-care, modifying the intervention to be more relevant for an inpatient setting. Once an individual's CAT classification has been determined, strategies for specific functional problems are chosen from a series of tables. CAT interventions are maintained in the client's living space during weekly visits. CAT clinicians will encourage team members to assist with the reinforcement of CAT tools and strategies.</description>
