    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized, controled, multicenter, phase II clinical study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of fruquintinib as a maintenance therapy following first-line treatment
      for metastatic colorectal cancer. This study will include the patients with confirmed
      unresectable metastatic left-sided colon cancer with RAS mutation or right-sided colon cancer
      who achieved stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) via
      palliative first-line treatment. It's expected to include 110 patients and they will be
      randomly stratified at 2:1 into fruquintinib group and observation group based on whether
      bevacizumab is used and the primary tumor site, using the Interactive Network Response System
      (IWRS). The random No. corresponds to the respective patient. The enrollment time is expected
      to be 18 months, followed up for 24 months.
