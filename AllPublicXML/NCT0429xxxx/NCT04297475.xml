  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New type of imaging method is in demand clinically for early detection and treatment guiding
      of RA. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), a hot spot in medical imaging society, which combines the
      merits of optical imaging and US and has a capacity in morphological, functional and
      molecular imaging, has shown potential in visualizing superficial organs, including small
      joints. The investigators developed a multi-modal photoacoustic/ultrasound (PA/US) imaging
      system, equipped with a handheld 3D PA/US probe, which wass able to provide 3D volume data of
      dual-wavelength PA imaging of small joints, in addition to real-time 2D PA/US imaging. The
      investigators plan to recruit RA patients in different disease conditions and healthy
      volunteers to receive the 2D and 3D PA/US examination on the 2nd and 3rd MCP, PIP joints and
      wrist joints using this imaging system, and to evaluate the potential clinical role of the
      imaging system in RA, and its added value to current imaging methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multi-modal PA/US imaging system was built on a high-end commercial US platform, and
      allowed real-time imaging of grey-scale US imaging, Color-Doppler US (CDUS) imaging and
      dual-wavelength PA imaging. The PA/US images were acquired using a hand-held probe integrated
      optical devices and US transducers. 3D volume data of the selected joint of each participant
      was collected using an automatic scanning device after the dual-modal imaging. The
      investigators plan to recruit RA patients from the outpatient department of Rheumatology of
      our hospital, who have been diagnosed as RA by experienced rheumatologists. The patients and
      healthy volunteers will receive multi-modal imaging examinations using the novel imaging
      system. The MCP 2 and 3, PIP 2 and 3, and wrist of bilateral hand were chosen for the
      multi-modal imaging. Conventional US scanning of the joints, including grey-scale US, CDUS,
      and PDUS, will be carried out by an experienced US operator. Afterwards, 2D and 3D PA/US
      imaging will be implemented for each joint by the same operator. All of the imaging data will
      be analysed by the Matlab software.

    <measure>The PA scores of 50 participants with RA identified by the multi-modal imaging system are in accordance with clinical scoring</measure>
    <time_frame>3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A total of 50 participants received semi-quantitatively measurement of PA signals by the imaging system using a 0-3 scoring system. Score 0 is no PA signals, which represents no detectable active inflammation on PA imaging. Score 1 means less than 3 bars of PA signals within the inflamed regions. Score 2 means multiple PA signals within less than half of the inflammatory lesions. And score 3 means abundant PA signals in over half of the lesions of RA synovium or tenosynovium, which may represent high inflammation activity.</description>
