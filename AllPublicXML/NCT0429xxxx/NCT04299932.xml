  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct this multi-center, three-armed, randomized controlled trial
      to evaluate the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA), compared with sham electroacupuncture
      (SA) and waiting list (WL) on participants with stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence
      (MUI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MUI tends to present with more severe symptoms and put greater burden on the health of
      individual and economy of society. Current European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline on
      incontinence recommends to initiate treatment targeted at predominant component of MUI.
      However, as to whether the interventions for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) can be
      effectively generalized to stress-predominant MUI, there is still no powerful evidence to
      support it. It is necessary to seek for interventions specific to stress-predominant MUI.
      Results of previous studies indicated that acupuncture might help to relieve the incontinence
      symptoms.

    <description>BL33 is located in the third posterior sacral foramen; BL35, 0.5 cun (≈10mm) lateral to the extremity of the coccyx; and SP6 posterior to the medial border of the tibia, 3 cun superior to the prominence of the medial malleolus. BL33 will be inserted by needles of 0.30×75mm size at the angle of 45°, inward and downward, till the depth of 60-70mm. BL35 will be inserted by needles of 0.30×75mm size, slightly outward and upward, till the depth of 60-70mm. SP6 will be inserted by needles of 0.30×40mm till the depth of 25-30mm. All the needles will be lifted, thrust and twisted evenly for three times, right after insertion, to induce the sensation of deqi. Electronic acupuncture apparatus (Yingdi KWD 808 I electro pulse acupuncture therapeutic apparatus, Changzhou Yingdi Electronic Medical Device Co., Ltd) will be connected to the three pairs of needles transversally, with continuous wave of 20 Hertz (Hz), electric current of 2-6.5 milliampere (mA) for BL33 and BL35, and 1mA-3.5mA for SP6.</description>

The three pairs of acupoints will be inserted by needles of 0.30×40mm size to a depth of 2-3mm till the needles can stand still. No manipulations will be conducted, and the sensation of deqi will not be induced. Electronic acupuncture apparatus (Yingdi KWD 808 I electro pulse acupuncture therapeutic apparatus, Changzhou Yingdi Electronic Medical Device Co., Ltd) will be connected to the three pairs of needles transversally, with continuous wave of 20Hz and minimal electric current (ideally at a degree which participant can just percept).
