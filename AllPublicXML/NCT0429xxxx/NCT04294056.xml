    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, two-stage, two-way crossover Phase I study
      in healthy male subjects.The main objective is to evaluate the differences in pharmadynamics
      (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety between ciprofol injectable emulsion and propofol
      injectable emulsion at different doses in healthy subjects.
