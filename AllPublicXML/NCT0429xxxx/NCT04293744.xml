  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PrimECC is a colloid priming solution for cardiopulmonary bypass/ extracorporeal circulation
      (ECC) based on Ringers Lactate, supplmeneted with Dextran 40 and Dextran 1. In a previous RCT
      comparing PrimECC with crystalloid priming fluid, patients in the PrimECC group experienced
      less hemolysis, less tubular cell injury and beneficial effect on the fluid balance. This
      study will investigate if, in a population at high risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), priming
      the ECC circuit with PrimECC instead of crystalloid solution will lead to a reduction of
      postoperative AKI. The hypothesis is that PrimECC, compared to crystalloid prime, will reduce
      postoperative AKI.

      The study is a Swedish multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
      The trial will include 366 patients aged ≥18 years, scheduled for cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass, with an &quot;Acute kidney injury risk score&quot; ≥30% according to Birnie et
      al. (2014). The primary outcome of the study is the incidence of postoperative AKI of any
      stage according to the KDIGO creatinine criteria (serum-creatinine increase ≥ 27 μmol/l
      within 48 h or ≥ 50 % increase from baseline) within 96 hours after arrival to the ICU.
      Secondary outcomes are between-group differences in hemolysis, tubular cell injury
      (NAG-excretion), estimated GFR, and incidence of AKI of different stages according to the
      KDIGO creatinine criteria. In addition, differences in CNS (Tau, NFL, NSE, and S100B) and
      cardiac (TNT/TNI) injury markers will be investigated.
