  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve administration of alcohol in a controlled laboratory setting to
      individuals who are scheduled for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, and then asking them to
      return for another laboratory session 3 months following their surgery. A small number will
      be asked to return again 9 months following their surgery.

      The primary objective for this research is to collect pilot data on the effects of metabolic
      surgery (MS), also known as bariatric surgery, on the metabolism of alcohol. These data will
      be used as preliminary evidence in support of a subsequent application for funding, to be
      submitted to the National Institutes of Health.

      A secondary objective for this research is to determine the extent to which MS changes
      reactivity to alcohol-related cues. Heightened reactivity (e.g., attention bias; craving) to
      alcohol-related cues is known to signify increased risk for heavy drinking and AUD. No
      research to date has examined whether the increased sensitivity to alcohol that occurs as a
      result of MS changes cue-reactivity responses, which in theory reflect an individual's
      history of learning to associate alcohol consumption with its subjective effects.

      An exploratory objective is to compare metabolism of alcohol administered orally versus
      intravenously. IV infusion of alcohol bypasses so-called &quot;first pass metabolism&quot; of alcohol
      after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, compared to oral ingestion, infusion
      can achieve the same blood alcohol concentration (BAC) with substantially less total alcohol
      dosage. Following our hypothesis, this should mean that, compared to oral ingestion, infusion
      will be associated with less production of liver fat, while also mimicking in pre-surgery
      patients what we observe with oral ingestion following surgery. This comparison will permit
      better specification of when (during metabolism) and how alcohol is converted to liver fat,
      and will allow us to separate effects of initial sensitivity to alcohol (a person's
      subjective response to the initial introduction of alcohol into the body) from effects
      associated with tolerance (i.e., the body's attempts to re-establish homeostasis after
      alcohol is introduced).

    <description>Participants' self-reported feelings of stimulation, sedation, and intoxication following exposure to a controlled dose of alcohol in the lab will be assessed using the Subjective Effects of Alcohol Scale (Morean, Corbin, &amp; Treat, 2013). This scale and its psychometric properties were first described in the following publication:
Morean ME, Corbin WR, Treat TA. The Subjective Effects of Alcohol Scale: development and psychometric evaluation of a novel assessment tool for measuring subjective response to alcohol. Psychol Assess. 2013;25(3):780-795. doi:10.1037/a0032542</description>

    <measure>Reactivity to alcohol cues: Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed prior to acute alcohol exposure, approximately 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Cue-induced craving for alcohol will be assessed using an in vivo beverage presentation procedure. In this procedure, participants complete a self-report measure of craving for alcohol, the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (Bohn et al., 1995). They then are presented with a glass of water and instructed to pick it up and sniff it 5 times over a 3-min period. They then complete the AUQ again. Next, the glass of water is removed and participants are presented with an alcoholic beverage. They then complete the signaled sniffing procedure again, this time with the alcoholic beverage, and then complete the AUQ one more time. Cue-induced craving is measured as the change in AUQ score from baseline to the final assessment.

    <time_frame>Pre-surgery and 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Individual differences in self-reported sensitivity to alcohol's effects will be assessed using the Alcohol Sensitivity Questionnaire (Fleming et al., 2016). This measure contains 15 items, each describing an effect people typically experience when drinking alcohol (e.g., feeling more talkative). For each item, participants indicate (1) whether they have ever experienced the effect in question from drinking alcohol, and (2) if so, the number of standard drinks they typically require in order to experience that effect.

    <measure>Reactivity to alcohol cues: motivational approach bias</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed prior to acute alcohol exposure, approximately 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The tendency to approach alcohol-related cues will be assessed using a laboratory task known as the Alcohol Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT; Wiers et al., 2010). In this task, images of alcoholic beverages, nonalcoholic beverages, and non-consumable liquids (e.g., motor oil) are presented on a computer monitor one at a time. Participants are instructed to push or pull on a computer joystick in response to each image, depending on whether it appears to be tilted 3 degrees to the right vs. the left. Each type of image is presented in both orientations multiple times. Approach bias is defined for each image type as the difference in response time for images shown in the 'pull' minus the 'push' condition (faster to pull than to push a given type of image is interpreted as an approach motivational bias).
