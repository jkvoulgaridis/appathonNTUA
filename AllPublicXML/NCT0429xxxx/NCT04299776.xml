  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) therapy, delivered by impedance threshold devices
      (ITDs) or intrathoracic pressure regulators (ITPRs), increases venous return, preload,
      cardiac output, blood pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure by intermittently creating
      negative intrathoracic pressure, which improves circulation in hypotensive animals and
      humans. By increasing systemic pressure and cerebral perfusion as well as promoting venous
      return, IPR therapy potentially improves cerebral oxygenation. The lower intrathoracic
      pressures may also reduce pulmonary artery pressure, although there is currently little
      evidence one way or the other. Use of an ITPR can counteract the multifactorial
      intraoperative hypotension common during surgeries under general anesthesia, and reduce the
      need for other measures to treat such hypotension; however, they might simultaneously promote
      pulmonary complications.

      The investigators will therefore assess whether the use of intrathoracic pressure regulation
      in adults having shoulder surgery under general anesthesia in the sitting position reduces
      vasoactive medication requirements compared with routine clinical practice. Simultaneously,
      the investigators will assess the effect of intrathoracic pressure regulation on pulmonary
      circulation, cerebral oxygenation, and postoperative atelectasis.
