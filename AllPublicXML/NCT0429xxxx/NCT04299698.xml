  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the effect of interaction between genetic and environmental factors on body fat mass
      (BFM) has been proposed, how lifestyle changes affect body weight with regard to the genetic
      composition needs to be verified. The investigators designed an observational study,
      consisting of healthy adults with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and
      longitudinal monitoring of lifestyle including food consumption and physical activities. The
      investigators recruited the participants who desired to control their body fat mass.
      Participants freely choose one of the options among carbohydrate intake reduction, fat intake
      reduction or exercise amount increment to control their body fat mass. Their lifelog on
      exercise and diet were collected, using a wearable device, for three months. Further, the
      investigators assessed anthropometric and serologic markers to measure the effect of
      participant's lifestyle modification. The investigators evaluate the influence of genetic
      compositions on body fat reduction induced by lifestyle change. Four different genome-wide
      polygenic scores (GPS) of volunteers are calculated to test the genetic effects of each
      modification. In this lifestyle observational study, the investigators expect to validate the
      interaction of genetic and environmental factors in determining BFM, and implicate the
      healthcare utility of lifestyle modifications using personalized and genomic perspective.
