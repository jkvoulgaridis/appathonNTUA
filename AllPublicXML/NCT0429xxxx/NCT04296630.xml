  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using social media for health promotion is an innovative and emerging approach but remains
      relatively unexplored in cancer screening. Uptake of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening
      remains low and standard methods of reaching out are expensive with limited impact. The
      objective of this study is to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the
      effectiveness of social media messages for CRC screening on screening intention (primary
      outcome). The results of this trial will be of interest to Cancer Care Ontario and are likely
      to be taken up by other screening programs looking for innovative and novel ways to increase
      screening participation. The study results will be easily translatable identifying the most
      compelling CRC screening messages while the approach can easily be translated to other cancer
      disease sites with screening programs.

      The investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Facebook users
      (aged 50+) in Ontario. Randomization will be done at the level of the forward sortation area
      (FSA) - the first three characters of the postal code. All FSAs in Ontario will be randomized
      to one of four study arms - users assigned to each arm will receive one of the social media
      messages. If users click on the message, a webpage with further information on screening will
      appear and participants will be asked to indicate intention to get screened for CRC. The
      primary outcome will be intention to screen and secondary outcomes will include other
      engagement metrics such as reach, cost-per-click, click-through rates, number of likes,
      number of impressions, and post comments.

      This study will inform the feasibility of using social media for CRC screening and identify
      the most compelling CRC screening messages for the screen-eligible population.
