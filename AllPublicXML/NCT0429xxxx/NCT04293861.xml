  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study MOKHA is aimed to evaluate the beneficial effect of HYMOVIS® on cartilage of
      patients suffering of knee osteoarthritis as revealed by using scientifically sound,
      objective measurements of biological and MRI-based imaging markers.

    <textblock>
      This study is a post-marketing, open-label, prospective and multicentric pilot study in 50
      patients suffering from knee OA. Investigators will be rheumatologists or articular disease
      specialists from public or academic hospitals located in Belgium and France. In each
      investigating center, the same injector will perform all the VS.

    <description>A treatment cycle consists of two injections administered at one week interval. For the purpose of this study, two treatment cycles of two injections of HYMOVIS® at baseline and 6 months will be performed per patient at V1 (Day 0), V2 (Day 7), V5 (Day 180) and V6 (Day 187).</description>
