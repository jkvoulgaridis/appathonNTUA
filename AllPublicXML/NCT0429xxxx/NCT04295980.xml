  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, functional imaging studies have suggested that the Geschwind's territory (the
      inferior parietal lobe) is an important language area. It is the hub for semantics and
      phonetic language processing. However, the type and mechanism of aphasia after injury of
      Geschwind's territory and the subsequent recovery of language are still unclear. In our study
      based on brain injury model of brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVMs) resection,
      investigators found that the incidence of aphasia was higher after the injury of Geschwind's
      territory than after injury of the classical language area, and the type of aphasia was
      complicated, while the recovery rate of language disorder was high during follow-up.
      Investigators hypothesized that the type of aphasia may be associated with the type of brain
      connectivity damaged, and that reorganization of brain connections and brain network promote
      the recovery of language function. In this study, we aim to investigate the types of aphasia
      and their corresponding brain network changes after the resection of BAVMs located in the
      Geschwind's territory. Investigators will evaluate language function and collect
      multimodality images of the patients before resection of the lesions, as well as 7 days, 3
      months and 6 months afterwards. In addition, the anatomical brain connectivity and brain
      network will also be analyzed. Our research will not only be a meaningful exploration for
      mechanisms of human language function damage and reorganization, but will also provide an
      important basis for the protection of brain function in neurosurgery.
