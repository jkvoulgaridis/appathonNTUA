      In this study, the investigators aim at:

        1. Evaluate the presence of vasculogenic mimicry in urothelial carcinomas by CD31-PAS
           double staining.

        2. Correlate the presence of vasculogenic mimicry with the clinicopathologic features as
           age, sex, TNM stage, pathological grade, recurrence, carcinoma in situ, lymphovascular
           emboli, lymph node metastasis, necrosis, surgical margin, multifocality and tumor size
           in urothelial carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer worldwide which seriously affects human
      health. In Egypt, it is the third common malignant tumor.

      Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is considered the most common histologic type of bladder cancer.

      It is well recognized that the biological behavior of several cancers is closely related to
      their blood supply. Tumor progression and metastasis have been long associated with tumor
      angiogenesis. However, several studies demonstrated that vascular targeting drugs which
      induce endothelial cell apoptosis have a little effect. So, it has been suggested that novel
      tumor microcirculation patterns may exist in these neoplasms.

      Vasculogenic mimicry (VM), is a novel tumor microcirculation system. Maniotis et al initially
      discovered VM in melanoma and defined these channels to be composed of tumor basement
      membrane lined externally by tumor cells, lacking blood vessel endothelium and containing
      plasma and red blood cells. So VM can be distinguished using immunohistochemical (IHC)
      staining and histochemical double staining. VM is CD31- or CD34-negative (endothelial
      markers) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive.

      Vasculogenic mimicry was detected in several malignant tumors. Several studies reported that
      VM can promote tumor progression and metastasis and it is positively associated with
      pathological grade, stage, recurrence and drug resistance. Previous studies which evaluate,
      the role of VM in urothelial carcinoma yield controversial results. So, the value of VM in
      urothelial carcinomas and its relation to the clinicopathologic parameters remains to be
      elucidated.
