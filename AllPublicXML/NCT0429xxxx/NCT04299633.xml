  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 3-part study will be conducted to evaluate the interaction of vadadustat with sevelamer
      carbonate, calcium acetate, and Auryxia in healthy male and female participants. A total of
      18 participants will be enrolled in each part of the study. Part 1 of the study will be
      conducted to assess the effect of a single oral dose of sevelamer carbonate (1600 milligrams
      [mg]) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of vadadustat (300 mg). Part 2 of
      the study will be conducted to assess the effect of a single oral dose of calcium acetate
      (1334 mg) on the PK of a single oral dose of vadadustat (300 mg). Part 3 of the study will be
      conducted to assess the effect of a single oral dose of Auryxia® (2 grams) on the PK of a
      single oral dose of vadadustat (300 mg).

                  least of 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug until 30 days after the
                  last dose of study drug. See the clinical trial protocol for acceptable methods
                  of contraception prior to and during the study.

               2. Female participants of non-childbearing potential must be surgically sterile
                  (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, oophorectomy) or post-menopausal
                  (no menses for &gt;1 year with follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt;40 Units per
                  Liter (U/L) at screening).

               3. Female participants of childbearing potential must agree not to donate ova during
                  the study and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

               4. Male participants who have not had a vasectomy for at least 6 months must agree
                  to use an effective method of contraception during the study and until 90 days

             laboratory assessments, and general observations

               1. At screening, abnormalities or deviations outside the normal ranges for any
                  clinical assessments (laboratory tests, ECG, vital signs) may be repeated once at

                  Results that continue to be outside the normal range must be judged by the
                  investigator to be not clinically significant and acceptable for study
