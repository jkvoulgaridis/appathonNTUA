  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, if any, exercise and a plant-based
      diet have on aromatase levels in postmenopausal women who are overweight and being treated
      with an aromatase inhibitor for their HR+, HER2- breast cancer. The study will also look at
      other ways diet and exercise may affect your body (for example, changing the way your breast
      tissue expresses or makes genes) and your quality of life.

    <description>Will explore the data using descriptive statistics and graphical methods, such as summarizing the aromatase levels at baseline and at 24 weeks using means and medians and plotting the data to visualize changes over time. To compare the aromatase levels at 24 weeks post-intervention between the groups, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used.</description>

    <description>Will consist of structured exercise treatment plus a calorie-restricted plant-based diet. Exercise treatment will consist of individualized walking delivered up to 7 times weekly to achieve the patient-specific goal energy expenditure. Training sessions will be performed at MSK or on a treadmill under remote surveillance using a telemedicine approach (i.e.,TeleEx) established in the Exercise-Oncology (ExOnc) Service. Pre-prepared meals, including 6 dinners and 6 lunches per week, will be shipped to the partipant's home during the intervention.</description>
