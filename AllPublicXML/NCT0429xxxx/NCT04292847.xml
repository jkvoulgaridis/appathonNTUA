    <textblock>
      This study recruits woman over the age of 70 who have completed primary treatment for early
      breast cancer in the last 2 months. A survey called the geriatric assessment will be used to
      identify symptoms and issues participants experience.This information will be given to the
      patient's medical oncology team, and used to make referrals to specialists. This study is
      designed to determine if these assessments and timely interventions can be completed during
      clinic visits, and determine if these participants comply with recommendations.

      1. Primary Objective Estimate the percent of patients with at least one deficit who agree to
      at least one referral. &quot;Interest&quot; in the intervention will be determined by this metric. This
      agreement will be determined within the 1-2 weeks of consenting to the study through
      interactions between patients and the Study Team.

      This study will recruit 100 participants in 2 years. These participants will complete the
      geriatric assessment and be given recommendations based on results. The study team will
      follow the medical record to determine if the participants complied with the recommendations
