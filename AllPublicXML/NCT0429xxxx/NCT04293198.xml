  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, two-center, non-randomized, open label, single arm study to assess the
      performance of the KODEX-EPD PV occlusion feature. This study includes patients with atrium
      fibrillation who are scheduled to undergo a cryo balloon ablation procedure for their atrium
      fibrillation.
