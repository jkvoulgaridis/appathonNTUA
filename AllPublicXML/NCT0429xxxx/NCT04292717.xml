  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impairments of walking function after spinal cord lesion due to, for example, inflammation,
      ischemia or trauma are exceptionally diverse. Depending on the size, location and
      completeness of the spinal cord lesion, gait dysfunction is often multifactorial, arising
      from weakness of leg muscles, sensory impairments or spasticity. Locomotor function in humans
      with spinal cord damage can be improved through training. However, there are no
      evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of gait dysfunctions and no excepted standards of
      gait training in this large and heterogeneous group of patients. A lack of evidence-based
      guidance and standardisation prevents the development of optimal training programs for
      patients with spinal cord damage and rather broad and subjective clinical judgement is
      applied to determine patient care. Objective and quantitative techniques like
      three-dimensional (3D) full-body movement analysis capable of identifying the most relevant
      determinants of gait dysfunction at the single-patient-level are not yet implemented as
      diagnostic tool to guide physical therapy in this heterogeneous group of patients. The
      objective of this project is to further advance current clinical locomotor training
      strategies by applying a deficit-oriented gait training approach based on subject-specific,
      objective gait profiles gleaned from 3D gait analysis in chronic, mildly to moderately
      gait-impaired individuals with spinal cord damage due to inflammation (in multiple sclerosis,
      MS) or with traumatic or ischemic spinal cord injury (SCI; motor incomplete). Within a
      parallel-group clinical trial, gait impaired subjects will be characterized by detailed
      kinematic 3D gait analysis and either trained according to their individual deficits or
      treated with non-specific, standard walking therapy for six weeks. It is hypothesized that
      individually adapted, deficit-oriented training is superior in improving walking function
      than purely task-related, ambulatory training in patients with spinal cord damage. This
      project may pave the way to more efficient training approaches in subjects with spinal cord
      damage by transferring and implementing modern gait assessment techniques into clinical
      neurorehabilitation and to move towards individual, patient-tailored locomotor training
      programs.
