  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthropathy characterized by synovitis, cartilage degeneration, subchondral and interosseous
      cysts occur due to hemorrhage in hemophilia. This situation causes to chronic pain,
      decreasing in range of motion, muscle strength, proprioception. Disorders in these parameters
      are the main causes of gait dysfunction. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects
      of therapeutic exercises on target joint functions and gait kinematics, and to determine
      possible complications related to exercise in hemophilic patients.

    <measure>Haemophilia Joint Health Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Change from baseline HJHS at 2 months, Change from baseline HJHS at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) will be applied to evaluate the joint functions of hemophilic individuals. HJHS is a sensitive and valid test used to determine the severity of clinical symptoms that result from hemarthrosis. This comprises an assessment of joints with regards to swelling, muscle atrophy, crepitus, range of motion, joint pain, strength, and global gait. The score for each joint is summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 124, where no joint damage is indicated by a score of 0.</description>

    <measure>Range of Motion Analysis with Kinovea Software</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Change from baseline range of motion during gait at 2 months, Change from baseline range of motion during gait at 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion (ROM) analysis during gait will be done by analyzing video images with computer software &quot;Kinovea&quot;. Kinovea is a free software used by sports and healthcare professionals to analyze video images during physical activity. Furthermore, it is a sensitive method that can be used to evaluate the range of motion of the lower limb joints during gait. ROM analysis of the ankle and knee joints will be done with Kinovea in the heel strike-midstance-toe off and mid-swing phases.</description>

    <measure>Six Minutes Walking Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Change from baseline 6min-WT at 2 months, Change from baseline 6min-WT at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Six-Minutes Walking Test (6min-WT) will be applied to determine the effects of therapeutic exercises on the aerobic capacity of hemophilic individuals. This test is a valid and reliable method for determining aerobic capacity in patients with neuromuscular problems. High walking distance indicates high aerobic capacity.</description>
