  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer and its treatments such as mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal
      therapy cause many side effects such as scar, problems with body perception and sexual
      problems. Sexual concerns lead to significant emotional distress, including
      sadness/depression, issues related to personal appearance, stigma, and negative impacts on
      personal relationships, intimacy and sexuality all of which reduce the quality of life. This
      experimental type of research is conducted within the framework of the BETTER model to
      evaluate the impact of counselling programme on sexuality issues that patients with breast
      cancer experience.

      Methods: The sampling consists of 60 female participants who volunteered to participate in
      the study. Face to face interviews are held with the female participants based on the
      Information Forms and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)&quot;, &quot;EORTC QLQ-BR23 Quality of Life
      Questionnaire&quot;, &quot;Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)&quot;, &quot;Body Cathexis
      Scale (BCS)&quot; and &quot;BETTER Model&quot;. Counselling programme of the women in the intervention group
      is held in four sessions one week apart and these women are provided with a counselling
      booklet accompanied by a CD. The scales are re-applied one month after the last session. In
      the control group, the women are left under routine hospital control after the scales are
      applied. The scales are re-applied to the control group after one month.

    <description>o An appointment was made with the women in the experimental group at a time when they were available and a suitable environment was arranged in the hospital. The counselling programme of the experimental group was conducted in four sessions one week apart. In addition, each woman in the experimental group was given a counselling booklet and compact disc. The interviews lasted between 15- 45 minutes. The topics of interest among women were noted in the interviews and after the information on the subject was received, feedback was given to the relevant woman through a phone call.</description>
