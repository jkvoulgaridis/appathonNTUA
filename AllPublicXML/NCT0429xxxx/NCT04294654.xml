  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Digit-Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) Substitution Test (DSST) score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) is a cognitive test designed to assess psychomotor speed of performance requiring visual perception, spatial decision-making, and motor skills. It consists of 133 digits and requires the patient to substitute each digit with a simple symbol in a 90-second period. Each correct symbol is counted, and the total score ranges from 0 (less than normal functioning) to 133 (greater than normal functioning).&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT) is a cognitive test designed to assess verbal learning and memory, including immediate memory, efficiency of learning, retroactive and proactive interference effects, and encoding versus retrieval. It consists of a number of tasks, including immediate recall and delayed recall. The number of words correctly recalled on each task is recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) measures an individual's ability to carry out tasks that are important for daily living and capture functional changes. Scores for each question range from 0 (no assistance needed) to 2 (full assistance needed), and are assessed by informant interview. The scores for IADL (0-14) is the outcome, with higher scores indicating lesser ability to carry out daily living tasks</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression severity of illness (CGI-S) provides the clinician's impression of the patient's current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient population to rate the severity of the patient's current mental illness on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) score</measure>
    <time_frame>at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - global improvement CGI-I provides the clinician's impression of the patient's improvement (or worsening). The clinician assesses the patient's condition relative to a baseline on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response defined by decrease in MADRS total score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Response is defined as a 50% decrease from baseline in MADRS total score</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Remission defined by MADRS score</measure>
    <time_frame>at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Remission is defined as MADRS ≤10</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Bath Assessment of Subjective Quality of Life in Dementia (BASQID) score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BASQID30 is a clinician rating scale designed to assess subjective quality of life (QoL) in patients with dementia. The BASQID contains 14 core questions, which are scored from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating a better QoL.</description>
