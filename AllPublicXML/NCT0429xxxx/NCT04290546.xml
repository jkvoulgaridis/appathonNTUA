  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of a combination drug and biologic
      therapy in patients with advanced head and neck cancer.

      This research study involves the following drugs and biologics:

        -  CIML NK donor cells

        -  IL-15 superagonist

        -  Ipilimumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, non randomized, open label, single site Phase 1 study. The purpose of
      this research study is to obtain information on the safety and effectiveness of this
      combination of study drugs to treat advanced head and neck. The experimental combination
      therapy in this study involves CIML NK cells from a haploidentical donor (meaning cells from
      another person with similar immune proteins), IL-15, and participants in cohort 2 will also
      receive ipilimumab. CIML NK cells are an allogeneic cell product derived from qualified donor
      natural killer (NK) cells that have been bathed in special proteins to help to identify and
      treat certain advanced cancers.

      - Participants who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial CTLA-4
      Inhibition in Combination with Memory-like Natural Killer (NK) Cell Immune Cell Therapy in
      Advanced Head &amp; Neck Cancer.

      The study consists of 2 parts:

        -  Cohort 1 CIML NK cells without ipilimumab

        -  The investigators are looking the highest dose of the study intervention that can be
           administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that
           have advanced head and neck cancer, not everyone who participates in this research study
           will receive the same dose of the study intervention. The dose given will depend on the
           number of participants who have been enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated

        -  Cohort 2 participants will be treated at the respective dose (at or below the Maximum
           Tolerated Dose), as determined during Cohort plus a lead-in dose of ipilimumab

        -  It is expected that about 12 people will take part in this research study.

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of investigational
      drugs and tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for
      further studies.

      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) has not approved CIML NK cells as treatment for any disease.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved IL-15 as a treatment for any
      disease.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ipilimumab for your specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

          -  The effects of CIML NK cells and N-803 on the developing human fetus are unknown.

        For this reason, WOCBP and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
        barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
        study participation, and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of all investigational
        products (up to 16 weeks after the last N-803 dose), in such a manner that the risk of
        pregnancy is minimized. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she
        or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
        immediately.

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (cardiac function) &gt; 40%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma are not eligible

          -  Participants who have had anti-tumor chemotherapy or other investigational agents
             within 4 weeks prior to cell infusion (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), or
             immunotherapy within 6 weeks prior, or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks prior.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to N-803 or other agents used in study.

          -  Solid organ transplant (allograft) recipients.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Autoimmune disease: patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients
             with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune
             vasculitis [Wegener's granulomatosis]) and motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune
             origin (e.g. Guillain- Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis). Patients with Hashimoto
             thyroiditis are eligible.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the unknown teratogenic risk of
             CIML NK cells and N-803 and with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects by fludarabine/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy regimen. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with CIML NK cells and N-803, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.

          -  HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
             interactions with anti-retroviral agents used in this study. In addition, these
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Individuals with active uncontrolled hepatitis B or C are ineligible as they are at
             high-risk of lethal treatment-related hepatotoxicity in the setting of marrow
             suppression.

          -  Known non-infectious pneumonitis or any history of interstitial lung disease.

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of start of study treatment.

          -  Individuals receiving therapeutic anticoagulation are eligible.
