    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of video assisted instruction on nursing
      students' tracheostomy care skills.

      The universe of the research consists of 81 students who enrolled in the Eastern
      Mediterranean University Faculty of Health Sciences Nursing Undergraduate Program in the fall
      semester of the 2019-2020 academic year and enrolled in the nursing principles course.
      Students who will not participate in the sample selection, agree to participate in the study
      voluntarily and meet the inclusion criteria, constituted the sample of the study. The
      research was designed on two groups, the video-based teaching method-based education
      (initiative) group and the demonstration (control) group. The students were divided into two
      randomized groups as intervention and control groups by using random numbers table.

      Personal Data Form, Tracheostomy Care Skill Assessment Form, Satisfaction from Training
      Methods and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were used to collect the data.

      Nursing education is an education system structured in order to provide the student with a
      professional nursing identity and to prepare the student for professional life, where
      theoretical and practical education is offered as a whole. In this system, nursing students
      are expected to acquire cognitive, affective and psychomotor skills at a very good level.
      Teaching process of psychomotor skill; It enables students to practice, analyze and develop
      skills by analyzing the theoretical information they have learned, to establish a
      relationship between theory and practice, to develop critical thinking and problem solving
      skills, to make regular observations and to gain a sense of trust . Today, with the
      development of technology and changing needs, there are also changes in the methods of
      education and training commonly used. One of the educational methods developed with
      technology is the video model method. Videos are among the important technologies that add
      value to the learning content. The use of video helps students learn new skills and improve
      their learning processes in the same way they have experience during practical training .
      Using videos while teaching nursing skills is as effective as demonstration as it provides
      visuality. Using a properly formatted video to teach a particular nursing skill allows a
      student to learn physical action that complements the theory behind skill and action. The use
      of training based on the video model method is useful for applications of nursing skills
      based on flexibility and capacity for students to review, reflect and repeat recordings .
      When the studies using video method in nursing education are examined; Lee et al. (2016)
      first shot a urinary catheterization skill video to teach nursing second grade students about
      urinary catheterization skills. Later, the experimental group (n = 36) was trained by
      mobile-based video learning and the control group students (n = 35) by the demonstration
      method. All students attended a 90-minute course on urinary catheterization and all students
      watched the urinary catheterization skill video. Students in the control group only watched
      the one-time video, students in the experimental group had the opportunity to watch the video
      for seven days on their mobile devices. A week later, students in the experimental and
      control groups performed urinary catheterization skill in the skill laboratory. At the end of
      the application, students' learning motivation, skill performance score, application
      confidence and skill laboratory satisfaction were evaluated. It was found that students in
      the experimental group had higher motivation to learn, skill laboratory satisfaction,
      knowledge and skill performance score and application confidence compared to the control
      group . Gowri, Minolin and Thenmozhi (2013) conducted a semi-experimental study in order to
      teach obstetric palpation skills to nursing second year students in antenatal period.

    <description>The literature was scanned and tracheostomy care skill assessment guide was prepared by the researchers. This guidebook is a 32-item form of the procedure for preparing the psychomotor skill levels of the students in the video and demonstration group regarding the care of the patient with tracheostomy. While evaluating the forms, the observed steps will be divided into &quot;full&quot; and &quot;incorrect&quot;, 1 point will be given for the fully applied step and 0 points will be given for the wrongly applied and not observed steps. Every correct step applied by students is calculated as &quot;1&quot; point, and every step that is not done or wrong is calculated as &quot;0&quot; point. The minimum score obtained from the Tracheostomy Care Skill Evaluation Form is 32 and the maximum score is 0. The skill assessment form prepared was presented to the opinion of three faculty members who are experts in the field of nursing principles in terms of scope validity.</description>

    <measure>Continuity-Status Anxiety Level</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Inventory is composed of two parts: State Anxiety Inventory and Trait Anxiety Inventory. In the State Anxiety Inventory, the individual needs to be able to express how he feels under certain conditions, and in the Trait Anxiety Inventory, he usually needs to express how the individual feels. The big score from the scales expresses the high anxiety level, the small score indicates the low anxiety level. He states that 0-19 points obtained from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory are not anxiety, 20-39 points mean mild, 40-59 points mean moderate, 60-79 points mean severe anxiety, and individuals who score 60 or more need professional help.</description>

    <measure>Level Of Satisfaction FromEducation Methods</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The survey consists of 16 propositions. One of these propositions is the proposition &quot;I am satisfied with this training method in general&quot;, which questions the satisfaction with education. Other propositions, on the other hand, are composed of propositions aimed at determining the opinions of the education method about the contribution of the student to learning and professional life. Each proposition is scored on the 5-point Likert scale. It is determined that as the scale score increases, the satisfaction of the students from the education method increases, and as the scale point average decreases, their satisfaction from the education method decreases. In the evaluation of the scale, a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 80 points are given to the satisfaction of the students with the education methods.</description>

    <description>Within the scope of Nursing Fundamentals course, a 4-hour theoretical training will be given to the experimental group in the classroom setting. Video presentation including powerpoint presentation and tracheostomy care skill application will be prepared in line with the Respiratory System course content. The powerpoint presentation prepared will be explained by the researchers to the video group students in the classroom by question, answer, discussion and demonstration methods. Immediately after the lecture, students will be watched by the video-assisted teaching method, and the video of tracheostomy care The videos will be sent to students via e-mail. A two-day warning message will be sent to the students from the WhatsApp group to watch the video by the researchers. A week later, students will be invited to the basic skills laboratory for tracheostomy care.</description>

    <description>Within the scope of Nursing Fundamentals course, a 4-hour theoretical training will be given to the control group in the classroom setting. Powerpoint presentation will be prepared in line with the Respiratory System course content. The powerpoint presentation prepared will be explained to the control group students by the researchers in the classroom by question, answer, discussion and demonstration methods. Immediately after the lecture, students will be taken to the basic skills laboratory and tracheostomy care will be performed on the dummy by the researchers using the demonstration method. Then, students will be given the output of the powerpoint presentation and asked to study the lecture notes for a week. A two-day warning message will be sent by the researchers to students from the WhatsApp group to study. A week later, students will be invited to the basic skills laboratory to practice tracheostomy care.</description>
