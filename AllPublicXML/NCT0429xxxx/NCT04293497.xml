  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identifying the malignancy of pancreatic mass using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle
      aspiration (EUS-FNA) is important for treatment decision-making and prognosis prediction. The
      sensitivity of EUS-FNA cytology specimens based on Papanicolaou (Pap) staining is low, which
      hampers accurate diagnosis of pancreatic mass. We assessed the diagnostic value of
      immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining for methionyl-tRNA synthetase
      1 (MARS1).

      BACKGROUND / AIMS: The sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound-guided aspiration cytology used
      to distinguish the pancreatic mass is low and clinical usefulness is not secured. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate clinical efficacy of a new differential staining method for
      cytology which is difficult to differentiate by the conventional staining method using
      pancreatic cancer related protein expressed only in pancreatic cancer.

      Hypothesis: The statistical significance between conventional staining method and MARS1
      staining in the pancreatic cancer cells collected by endoscopic ultrasound-guided aspiration
      will be compared to prove the usefulness of the new staining method.

      Clinical study design: The expression of MARS1 in the pancreatic cancer cell line obtained by
      endoscopic ultrasound in patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer using
      Immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry staining will be performed to differentiate the
      presence of the tumor. The sensitivity and specificity of the new staining method will be
      compared with the conventional staining method and its usefulness be confirmed.
