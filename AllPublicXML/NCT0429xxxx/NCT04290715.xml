  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-quality colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for the detection and prevention of
      colorectal cancer, and its efficacy is predicated on optimal colon cleansing.However, about
      18%-35% of patients were still reported to suffer inadequate bowel preparation. Although
      several predictive models exist, the current guideline indicates that there is insufficient
      evidence to recommend the use of a predictive model for clinical practice.

    <description>The OBPS is a validated scoring system with scores between 0 and 14, where 0 is the best score. The score comprises a sub score 0-4 for each colon segment: right, transverse and rectosigmoid colon. In addition, a score 0-2 is added to indicate the total amount of luminal fluid.
For all participants, OBPS score will be used when the colonscopy is inserting.</description>
