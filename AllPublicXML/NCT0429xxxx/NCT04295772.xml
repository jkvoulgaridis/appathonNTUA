  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, single-group, multi-site, open-label study of an islatravir/doravirine
      (ISL/DOR, MK-8591A) fixed dose combination (FDC) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency
      virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adolescents who are virologically suppressed on
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ≥3 months. The primary purposes of the study are to examine
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of steady-state ISL and DOR in plasma and ISL-triphosphate (ISL-TP)
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and to examine the safety and tolerability of
      ISL/DOR.

          -  Is HIV-1 positive and weighs ≥35 kg at screening.

          -  Has been receiving continuous, stable oral 2-drug or 3-drug combinative antiretroviral
             therapy (cART) ± pharmacokinetic (PK) booster with documented viral suppression for ≥3
             months prior to signing informed consent/assent.

          -  If female, is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and is either 1) not a woman of
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) or 2) is a WOCBP and is using acceptable contraception

             deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] positive).

          -  Has a history of malignancy ≤5 years prior to signing informed consent except for

             infection), therapy, laboratory abnormality or other circumstance (including drug or
             alcohol use or dependence) that might, in the opinion of the investigator, confound
             the results of the study or interfere with the participant's participation for the
             full duration of the study, such that it is not in the best interest of the
             participant to participate.

          -  Is taking or is anticipated to require systemic immunosuppressive therapy, immune
             modulators, or any prohibited therapies from 45 days prior to Day 1 through the study
             treatment period.

          -  Is currently taking long-acting cabotegravir-rilpivirine.

          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in an interventional clinical study
             with an investigational compound or device from 45 days prior to Day 1 through the
             study treatment period.

          -  Has a documented or known virologic resistance to DOR.

          -  Has exclusionary laboratory values.

          -  Is female and expecting to conceive or donate eggs at any time during the study.
