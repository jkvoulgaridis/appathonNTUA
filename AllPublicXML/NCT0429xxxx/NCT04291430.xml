  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, exploratory, observational, registration study on
      patients with symptomatic non-acute carotid artery occlusion to initially evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of endovascular treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion were primarily treated with medication,
      the risk of 2-year stroke recurrence was as high as 22.7%. Ipsilateral stroke and hemodynamic
      decline are independent risk factors for stroke recurrence in patients with carotid artery
      occlusion. In addition, long-term cerebral hypoperfusion and decreased cerebrovascular
      reactivity in patients with carotid artery occlusion may lead to cognitive impairment.

      At present, the recanalization time window of anterior circulation large vessel occlusive
      stroke has been extended to 24 hours under certain evaluation approaches. In order to
      distinguish from the emergency treatment within 24 hours, patients with carotid artery
      occlusion over 24 hours are collectively referred as non-acute occlusion.

      With the maturity of endovascular technique and the advances of interventional devices,
      endovascular treatment has become a hotspot of clinical research in this field. Case reports
      have emerged and prospective studies suggest that recanalization of chronic carotid occlusion
      may improve the cognitive functions. However, the clinical benefit of endovascular treatment
      for symptomatic non-acute carotid artery occlusion remained controversial.

      The purpose of this study is to establish and verify the efficacy of a multi-dimensional
      evaluation system of endovascular treatment and recanalization of symptomatic non-acute
      carotid occlusion.

    <description>NIHSS. The NIH Stroke Scale measures several aspects of brain function, including consciousness, vision, sensation, movement, speech, and language.A certain number of points are given for each of these physical and cognitive functions during a focused neurological examination. A maximal score of 42 represents the most severe and devastating stroke. The level of stroke severity as measured by the NIH stroke scale scoring system:
0 = no stroke 1-4 = minor stroke 5-15 = moderate stroke 15-20 = moderate/severe stroke 21-42 = severe stroke</description>

(Score Description: 0---No symptoms at all. 1---No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities. 2---Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance. 3---Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance. 4--- Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance. 5---Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention. 6---Dead.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D scale within 12 months after procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>12-month after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D essentially consists of two pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions, each describing a different aspect of health: MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, USUAL ACTIVITIES, PAIN / DISCOMFORT and ANXIETY / DEPRESSION. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems (labelled 1-3). The respondent is asked to indicate his / her health state by checking the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical VAS where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine'( score as 100) and 'The worst health you can imagine' (score as 0). This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents.</description>

    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It is commonly used in medicine and allied health to screen for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment. The MMSE's purpose has been not, on its own, to provide a diagnosis for any particular nosological entity.</description>
