  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of usage of a range of oral
      products (toothpaste, mouth rinse, denture cleanser) on the oral health of partial denture
      wearers compared to existing oral hygiene habits.The hypothesis is that there is no treatment
      difference in the oral health when using the range of products for 12 weeks compared to no
      intervention.

      This study is a single-center, single-blind (to the examiner(s) performing the plaque,
      gingivitis, denture cleanliness and oral hygiene assessments), randomized, stratified (by
      denture material type and baseline mean overall modified gingival index [MGI] score),
      two-treatment, parallel group, 12 week clinical study in generally healthy, adult
      participants with at least one conventional removable partial denture (RPD) and generalized,
      mild-moderate, plaque-induced gingivitis (as determined by clinical examiner) and greater
      than or equal to &gt;=4 natural teeth in each arch that meet all study criteria at both the
      Screening and Baseline visits (including &gt;= 30 evaluable surfaces for clinical evaluation of
      gingivitis and plaque). The study will examine the effects of twice daily use of a range of
      dental/denture products (comprising use of a dentifrice, a mouthrinse and a denture cleanser)
      compared to no intervention (participants who continue with their existing oral hygiene
      habits). There will be four visits to the study site: screening, baseline (when participants
      are randomized), and after 6- and 12 weeks use of the range of dental/denture products.

    <measure>Mean Bleeding Index (BI) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>BI assesses the severity and number of bleeding points elicited on probing as a measure of gingival condition. To perform the assessment, a round-end probe (Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs [CPITN] probe is inserted approximately 1 millimeter [mm] into the gingival sulcus (at approximately 60 degrees) and moved around the tooth, from the distal interproximal area to the mesial interproximal area, gently stretching the gingival epithelium. Contact with the tooth surface will be avoided. Gingival bleeding is assessed 30 seconds after probing. Assessments will be performed one quadrant at a time; BI scores will be recorded before moving to the next quadrant. BI will be calculated as the mean score. The scoring system is 0=no bleeding, 1=bleeding within 30 seconds of probing, 2=bleeding immediately on probing). Sites with a score of 1 or 2 will be classified as 'bleeding' sites. Lower score indicates better results.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Number of Bleeding Sites (NBS) at Week 6 and Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Number of gingival bleeding sites will be measured as BI. BI assesses the severity and number of bleeding points elicited on probing as a measure of gingival condition. To perform the assessment, a round-end probe (for example, a CPITN probe is inserted approximately 1 mm into the gingival sulcus (at approximately 60 degrees) and moved around the tooth, from the distal interproximal area to the mesial interproximal area, gently stretching the gingival epithelium. Sites which shows signs of bleeding within 30 seconds of probing will be classified as a bleeding site. Assessments will be performed one quadrant at a time; BI scores will be recorded before moving to the next quadrant. The scoring system is 0=no bleeding, 1=bleeding within 30 seconds of probing, 2=bleeding immediately on probing. Sites with a score of 1 or 2 will be classified as 'bleeding' sites. Lower score indicates better results.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Modified Gingival Index (MGI) at Week 6 and Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MGI will be assessed for the facial and lingual/palatal gingiva of all evaluable teeth, four sites per tooth (facial surface - papilla and margin; lingual/palatal surface - papilla and margin). MGI will be scored as: 0=Absence of inflammation, 1=Mild inflammation: slight change in color, little change in texture of any portion of the marginal or papillary gingival unit, 2=Mild inflammation: criteria as (1) but involving the entire marginal or papillary gingival unit, 3=Moderate inflammation: glazing, redness, edema, and/or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit, 4=Severe inflammation: marked redness, edema and/or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit, spontaneous bleeding, congestion, or ulceration. Lower scores indicate better results.</description>

    <measure>Mean Turesky Plaque Index (TPI) (overall and interproximal) at Week 6 and Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Supra-gingival plaque will be assessed on the facial and lingual surfaces of the teeth using the TPI. Third molars can be included in the assessment if, as a result tooth loss, they are functioning as second molars and gradable for TPI. Each tooth surface is divided into 3 areas; three scores are recorded facially (mesiofacial, facial, distofacial) and three scores lingually (mesiolin-gual, lingual and distolingual) generating a total of six scores per tooth. The plaque will be disclosed and scored as: 0=No plaque, 1=Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin, 2=Thin continuous band of plaque (up to 1 mm) at the cervical margin, 3=Band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than (&lt;) 1/3 of the tooth surface, 4=Plaque covering greater than or equal to )&gt;=) 1/3 but &lt; 2/3 of the tooth surface, 5=Plaque covering &gt;= 2/3 of the tooth surface. Lower scores indicate better results.</description>

    <measure>Mean Partial Denture Cleanliness Index (PDCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The cleanliness of the partial denture will be evaluated based on the modification of the Clinical Categorization of Denture Cleanliness Index. A suitable dental probe will be used to gently scrape the surfaces of the RPD and the PDCI scored using the descriptors detailed below. All surfaces of the RPD should be assessed and the highest score applicable recorded. PDCI scoring system to be used is as follows: 0=No visible plaque; no matter adherent to the dental probe on light scraping, 1=No visible plaque; matter adherent to the dental probe on light scraping, 2=Deposits of plaque just visible on careful examination without need to confirm by scraping, 3=Deposits of plaque clearly visible, 4=Gross plaque deposits (&quot;velvet appearance&quot;).
