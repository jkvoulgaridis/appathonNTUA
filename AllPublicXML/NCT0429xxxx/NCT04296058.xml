    <textblock>
      Two hundred HCC patients with partial hepatectomy were enrolled as a cohort for observational
      study. The inclusion criterion was intended curative hepatectomy for HCC patients by image
      analysis, and the exclusion criteria were unresectable disease, synchronous cancers,
      recurrent cancers, or distant metastasis. The study endpoint was 30 March 2019, and tumor
      staging was based on the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM
      staging system for HCC

      To determine the role of SOX4 in tumor progression in patients with HCC, we examined SOX4
      expression through immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of 200 formalin-fixed and
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HCC specimens . The SOX4 high group of patients was associated with
      positive etiology of hepatitis B virus (P = 0.044), tumor size &gt;5 cm (P = 0.014), thrombus
      formation (P = 0.012), higher microvessel density (MVD) (P = 0.012) in tumor lesions, and
      distant metastasis (P &lt;0.001).

      Cox regression analysis showed that patients with elderly age (P &lt;0.001), higher ‚ç∫-fetal
      protein (AFP) (P = 0.045), presence of cirrhosis (P = 0.008), and SOX4 high in tumor specimen
      (P = 0.042) were independent risk factors . The SOX4 high group performed significantly worse
      regarding overall survival (OS) (P = 0.043) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.019) based
      on the Kaplan-Meier analysis.
