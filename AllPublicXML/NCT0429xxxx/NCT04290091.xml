  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart diseases are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world.
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) alone is estimated to affect 110 million people globally and
      resulted in 8.9 million deaths in 2015.

      A hallmark phenomenon in the development of CAD is the formation of arterial stenoses
      eventually limiting the arterial circulation. Myocardial ischemia caused by the stenoses may
      present symptoms considered typical, i.e, angina pectoris chest pain, but the symptoms may
      vary up to an asymptomatic state. Estimating the pre-test likelihood of angiographically
      significant CAD (â‰¥50% diameter stenotic CAD) is a fundamental component in the initial
      evaluation of symptomatic patients presenting with suspected CAD. This determination directly
      influences subsequent decisions for noninvasive diagnostic testing and treatment. However,
      studies have shown a relatively low prevalence of either ischemia or obstructive CAD on
      noninvasive imaging and invasive angiography (IA) in this population. Therefore, additional
      methods are needed to improve patient selection for such testing.

      Mechanocardiography (MCG) assesses the condition of the heart by measuring the mechanical
      activity (cardiac muscle motion) of the heart from the surface of thorax. MCG can be measured
      with accelerometer and gyroscope which react to recoil and vibration caused my cardiac
      contraction.

      This study aims to validate how the gyroscope and accelerometer derived parameters can
      identify patients with hemodynamically significant CAD in combined contrast computed
      tomography (CT) coronary angiography and positron emission tomography (PET) perfusion imaging
      in combination of high-sensitive troponin testing. The performance of different MCG
      algorithms will be tested offline as a head-to-head comparison with medical history,
      cardiovascular events, high-sensitive troponin values, coronary computed tomography
      angiography (CCTA) and PET scan results.
