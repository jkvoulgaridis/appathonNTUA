      This study will assess cognitive function in patients with a primary brain tumour treated
      with radiation therapy (RT) to generate radio-sensitivity and volume effect parameters for
      the development of cognitive dysfunction. All types of brain tumours apart from glioblastoma
      will be included.

    <textblock>
      RT to brain tumours causes cognitive dysfunction. The extent of RT induced changes in
      cognitive function and radio-sensitivity of the brain is unknown. RT with protons instead of
      photons spares the healthy brain tissue more and is believed to reduce the risk of cognitive
      dysfunction. There is modest knowledge on which parts of the brain we need to spare, to
      prevent cognitive dysfunction.

      The study is a prospective nationwide study including approximately 60 brain tumour patients
      from the four neuro oncology centres in Denmark. The patients will do patient reported
      outcome (PRO) and undergo neuropsychological assessment with standardized tests: They will do
      this prior to RT treatment and ½, 1, 3 and 5 years afterwards. The PRO's included measures on
      quality of life, fatigue, sleep, depression, anxiety, and socio demografica. The standardized
      tests are: Trail making Test (TMT); Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT); Controlled Oral Word
      Association Test (COWAT) - Animals and S; Coding and Digit Span from WAIS-IV; Paced Auditory
      Serial Addition Test (PASAT). The correlation between cognitive scores and RT dose-volume
      parameters to specific areas in the brain will be tested.

      This study will elucidate the dose-response relationship in radiation-induced damage to
      substructures of the brain such as hippocampus, thalamus, temporal and frontal lobes that
      will allow the clinician to prioritize these structures in planning of proton radiotherapy.
