  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity can severely reduce quality and longevity of life and there is an urgent need to help
      people lose weight and maintain weight loss long term. Digital behaviour change interventions
      targeting diet and physical activity have the potential for public health gain; however,
      these interventions are often not adequately tailored to the participants. The aim of this
      study is to develop and test a digital intervention to help people make sustainable changes
      to diet and physical activity, and consequently their weight. This study is a hybrid trial
      that will evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and implementation of the Choosing
      Health program among overweight/obese adults.

      This study is a two-group randomised controlled trial (RCT) with within person assessment.
      Participants (N=285) will be randomly assigned to either the Choosing Health digital
      intervention or a control group. For intervention participants, Ecological Momentary
      Assessment (EMA) will be used to identify behavioural determinants for each individual in
      order to tailor evidence-based behaviour change techniques and intervention content. Control
      group will receive non-tailored factual weight loss advice. Primary outcome is mean
      difference in weight loss between groups at 6 months, in kilograms. Key outcomes will be
      measured at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12 months. Data will be analysed using multilevel modelling
      and time series analysis.

      This is the first weight loss intervention applying individualised digital tailoring based on
      continuous assessment of individual's psychological determinants of behaviour measured over
      time. The Choosing Health will offer insight into factors associated with success in making
      sustained changes to weight, and secondary outcomes, such as diet and physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioural science offers theory-driven and evidence-based behaviour change techniques that
      can support people in losing weight and maintaining it long term. These techniques have not
      yet been assessed in within-person studies that not only examine aggregated between-group
      effects (e.g., intervention versus control comparisons) but also determine personal
      trajectories of weight loss and maintenance and tailor accordingly to the strongest
      predictors of outcomes. The aim of the proposed study is to develop and test a digital
      intervention that uses Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and tailors the evidence-based
      behaviour change techniques that are based on theory to the strongest predictors of outcomes
      (based on EMA responses collected over time).

      This study will determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the proposed
      intervention through the Randomised Controlled Trial (EMA tailored intervention versus
      control), with within person component embedded in the trial. Study hypothesis is that
      participants in the EMA tailored intervention group will lose significantly more weight than
      participants in the control group from baseline to 6 months (post program comparison -
      primary outcome) and at 12 months (maintenance effects assessment - secondary outcome).

      This is a two-group intervention trial adopting a randomised controlled design. It is a
      hybrid trial assessing intervention effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and implementation.
      This study has within person component embedded in the design and intervention group will
      answer EMA questions during the initial 3 months of the study and will receive tailored
      intervention at month 3 combined with additional EMA. There are two phases of the 6-month
      intervention (I) observational EMA phase and (II) active intervention phase.

      The proposed intervention is delivered online through emails and text messages and based on
      the EMA responses in phase I, it is tailored in phase II. The intervention will have a
      non-automatic component, meaning trained facilitators will answer participants' queries and
      provide additional resources if and when needed to improve the engagement with the
      intervention. The study meets CONSORT criteria for RCTs and study ethical approval was
      obtained from SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Wroclaw, Poland (approval
      number 03/P/12/2019).

    <description>Measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short version, the minimum value is 0 (no activity), higher scores mean a better outcome. All activity will be converted to minutes before calculating MET minutes (total score). In each category a maximum of 21 hours of activity are permitted a week (3 hours X 7 days). To calculate MET minutes a week the MET value given (walking = 3.3, moderate activity = 4, vigorous activity = 8) will be multiplied by the minutes the activity was carried out and again by the number of days that that activity was undertaken. To get total MET minutes of physical activity a week the MET minutes achieved in each category (walking, moderate activity and vigorous activity) will be added.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of information materials provided at baseline in a form of eBook or a physical book depending on participants preferences. The book includes the rationale for the intervention, basic information on healthy eating and behaviour change and tables allowing self-monitoring of weight, physical activity and eating (i.e., brief food diary). The book is non-tailored and it has weekly tasks for the participants to complete during 26 weeks (initial 6 months) to support their weight loss. The intervention group will also receive a series of daily text messages and weekly email messages supporting their weight loss and promoting weight loss maintenance. In phase I (month 0-3), the messages and emails will be generic and factual; in the phase II of the intervention, participants will receive text messages and emails tailored to the strongest predictors of outcomes identified in phase I.</description>
