    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, single-dose study,
      which is designed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of CT-P17 SC administration
      via AI and PFS in healthy subjects. Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled and randomly
      assigned to one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. In each treatment arm, all subjects
      will receive a single dose (40 mg) of CT-P17 via either AI or PFS on Day 1 followed by 10
      weeks during which PK, safety, and immunogenicity measurements will be made. The
      randomization to treatment assignment will be stratified by body weight (≥80 kg vs. &lt;80 kg)
      as measured on baseline (Day -1), gender (male vs. female) and study center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be considered eligible to participate
        in the clinical study:

          1. Healthy male or female subjects, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, both inclusive
             (healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and heart rate
             measurement, 12-lead electrocardiogram [ECG], and clinical laboratory tests prior to
             the administration of the study drug).

          2. Subject with C-reactive protein ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          3. Subject has adequate liver function as determined by following results:

               -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤1.5
                  times ULN and

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN.

          4. Subject is informed and able to understand the full nature and purpose of the study,
             including possible risks and side effects, and is given ample time and opportunity to
             read and understand this information. The subject has the ability and agrees to
             cooperate with the investigator and must sign and date the written informed consent
             prior to performing any of the screening procedures.

          5. BMI between 18.0 and 29.9 kg/m2, both inclusive, when rounded to the nearest tenth.

             months after the administration of the study drug. A man or woman is of childbearing
             potential if, in the opinion of the investigator, he or she is biologically capable of
             having children and is sexually active. Male and female subjects and their partners
             who have been surgically sterilized for less than 24 weeks prior to the date of
             informed consent must agree to use any medically acceptable methods of contraception.
             Menopausal females must have experienced their last period more than 1 year prior to
             the date of informed consent to be classified as not of childbearing potential.

                  in-patient hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics within 24 weeks prior to
                  the administration of the study drug (Day 1).

          2. Subject is considered to have a significant abnormal cardiac function in
             investigator's discretion determined by the laboratory results.

             administration of the study drug (Day 1) or plans to have a surgical procedure during
             the study period.

          4. Subject has active tuberculosis (TB), latent TB (defined as a positive result for
             interferon-γ release assay [IGRA] with no active lesion in examination of chest X-ray

             with active TB or traveled to areas within a high incidence of TB within 8 weeks prior
             to the administration of the study drug (Day 1) or has plans to travel to the area in
             which TB is prevalent during the study period. If the result of IGRA is indeterminate
             at Screening, retest will be allowed only once during the Screening period. If the
             repeated IGRA result is again indeterminate or positive, the subject will be excluded
             from the study. If the repeated IGRA result is negative, the subject may be included
             in the study.

          8. Subject used prescription (excluding hormonal birth control), over-the-counter drugs,
             dietary supplements, or herbal remedies that could affect the outcome of the study
             within 2 weeks prior to the administration of the study drug (Day 1).

          9. Subject has undergone treatment with an investigational drug or participated in
             another clinical trial for healthy subject or bioequivalence test within 90 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the administration of the study drug (Day 1)
             or plan to do so during the study.

         10. Subject received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the
             administration of the study drug (Day 1) or plan to do so until the 6 months after Day
             1.

         11. Subject has donated or lost 450 mL or more of whole blood within 8 weeks, or donated

             study drug (Day 1). One unit is equivalent to a half-pint (285 mL) of beer/lager, one
             measure (25 mL) of spirits, or one small glass (125 mL) of wine. Subject is unwilling
             to avoid use of alcohol or alcohol containing foods, medications, or beverages within

             to 24 hours after the administration of the study drug.

         15. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is not eligible for the study
             participation for any reason (including clinical laboratory results) or shows evidence
             of a condition (e.g., psychological or emotional problem, any disorder or resultant

             subject to comply with the protocol requirements. Subject is unable to understand the
             protocol requirements, instructions, study-related restrictions, or the nature, scope,

             involved with the conduct of the study, or immediate family members of such
             individuals, persons kept in prison, or other institutionalized persons by law
             enforcement).
