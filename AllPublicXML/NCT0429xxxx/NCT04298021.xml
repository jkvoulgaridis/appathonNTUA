      This is a open-label, phase II, umbrella study enrolling advanced biliary tract cancer
      patients who have failed to 1st-line chemotherapy. Patients will be enrolled to AZD6738 and
      Durvalumab combination or AZD6738 and Olaparib combination cohorts. Based on the new emerging
      therapies, cohorts can be added into existing protocol.

        1. AZD6738 + Durvalumab cohort:

             -  Durvalumab 1500 mg iv on D1

             -  AZD6738 240 mg bid on D15-D28 Every 4 weeks C1D1 dose of durvalumab will be
                delivered, and AZD6738 of 240 mg bid will be dosed at D15-D28. Every cycle consists
                of 4 weeks.

        2. AZD6738 + Olaparib cohort:

             -  AZD6738 160 mg qd on D1-D7

             -  Olaparib 300 mg bid on D1-D28 Every 4 weeks Every cycle consists of 4 weeks.
                AZD6738 of 160 mg qd will be administered on D1-D7. Olaparib will be delivered as
                300 mg bid dose on D1-D28.

      One cycle consists of 4weeks. Response evaluation will be done every 8 weeks (every 2 cycles)
      of treatment

        1. tumor biopsy is mandatory : screening, after 8weeks (1st-response evaluation), at
           disease progression (PD)

        2. blood sampling for biomarker study is mandatory: every cycles

        3. To evaluate the metabolic changes, 18 F-FDG PET is mandatory at screening and after 8
           weeks (1st-response evaluation).

             human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Subjects with simple HBV
             carrier, a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core
             antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Subjects positive for
             hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative
             for HCV RNA.

         21. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note:
             Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to
             30 days after the last dose of IP.

         22. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         23. Male or female patients of reproductive potential who are not willing to employ
             effective birth control from screening to 6 months after the study drug. (including
             sperm donation for male patients)

         24. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug
             excipients.

         25. Past medical history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis which required
             steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease.

         26. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia or with features
             suggestive of MDS/AML for olaparib cohort

         27. For olaparib cohort, concomitant use of known potent (eg. phenobarbital, enzalutamide,
             phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's
             Wort) CYP3A inducers (eg. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period
             prior to starting study treatment is five half-lives, except for St-Johns' wort, which
             is 3 weeks.

         28. For olaparib cohort, previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical
             cord blood transplantation (dUCBT).

         29. For AZD6738 cohort, diagnosis of ataxia telangiectasia.

         30. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or previous
             significant bowel resection, with clinically significant sequelae that would preclude
             adequate absorption of AZD6738.

         31. For AZD6738 cohort, haematuria: +++ on microscopy or dipstick.

         32. For AZD6738 cohort, Patients with relative hypotension (&lt;100/60 mmHg) or clinically
             relevant orthostatic hypotension, including a fall in blood pressure of &gt;20 mmHg.

         33. Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.

         34. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study

         35. Previous enrolment &lt;&lt;or randomisation&gt;&gt; in the present study
