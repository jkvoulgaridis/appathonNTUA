      Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate potential beneficial effects of Kefir
      drink (Synbio Tech Inc., Kaohsiung City, Taiwan) on fatigue and ergogenic functions following
      physiological challenge. Methods: 16 male subjects, 8 in each group, were divided into two
      groups according to the principle of maximal oxygen uptake, which were (1) first-stage
      placebo and second-stage Kefir group (hereinafter referred to as group A). (2) The first
      phase of Kefeier, the second phase of the placebo group (hereinafter referred to as group B),
      after 4 weeks of supplementation, the performance and fatigue resistance tests were carried
      out in sequence, including: treadmill aerobic endurance exhaustion time, and fixation
      Exercise time and intensity challenge changes in blood lactate, blood urea nitrogen
      concentration and creatine kinase activity, as well as differences in body composition before
      and after supplementation. After the first phase of the test is completed, the four weeks of
      emptying are performed. And after adding the crossover sample, perform four weeks of
      supplementation and testing again.

    <description>We adopted a double-blind test in which the volunteers, based on their basal maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). before and after intervention, the individual basal VO2max during pretest was used as a reference to adjust the individually appropriate exercise intensity to measure exhaustive endurance (85% VO2max) and recording the running time from begin to exhaust.</description>

    <description>For assessment of fatigue-related indices, volunteers fasted for at least 8 h before the 60% VO2max fixed intensity exercise challenge. Blood samples were collected with an arm venous catheter at indicated time points during exercise and recovery periods, including baseline (0), 5 (E5), 10 (E10), 15 (E15), and 30 (E30) min during the exercise phase, and 20 (R20), 40 (R40), 60 (R60), and 90 (R90) min in the recovery phase. Serum lactate (mmol/L), were assessed for monitoring physiological adaptation. All biochemical indices were assessed using an autoanalyzer (Hitachi 7060, Tokyo, Japan).</description>
