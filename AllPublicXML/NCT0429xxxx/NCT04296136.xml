  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients and their families are often unprepared regarding end-of-life care.
      Even patients with high risk of mortality within the index admission or 30 days after
      admission often do not have clearly defined goals of care. This lack of clarity can create
      difficult scenarios for patients, their families, and care providers. Lack of communication
      and documentation of these goals can lead to unnecessary tests, procedures, and readmissions.
      By creating advanced care planning education for the hospital medicine department, a
      standardized note template, and EMR utilization for storage and reference of patient's goals
      of care documentation we aim to facilitate the conveyance of patient's wishes/preferences
      across different care providers and across separate encounters within the healthcare system.

        The study population will include three cohorts in order to evaluate the effectiveness of
        the program. The intervention cohort consists of adult patients admitted to the hospital
        medicine service with a high risk of mortality. We will then have two cohorts used to
        compare outcomes. The first is adult patients admitted to the hospital medicine service who
        are not at high risk of mortality. The second is adult patients admitted to the hospital
        who are not on the hospital medicine service. As described in further detail below, data on
        these three cohorts will be collected during pre-implementation and post-implementation
        time periods. This study design will enable our team to identify the impact of the program
        within the intervention group as well as any externalities that impact care across hospital
        medicine services.
