    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well technology and health communication works in
      improving health outcomes in patients scheduled for mammography screening. The Mobile
      Mammography Screening Program provides a vital health service and it is important that all
      women scheduled for an appointment show-up to be screened. Technology and health
      communication may help decrease no-show rates among patients scheduled for mammography
      screening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To decrease the mobile mammography unit no-show rate by sending text message appointment
      reminders to patients.

      II. To assess the efficacy of the text message reminders at addressing the no-show rate by
      collecting satisfaction survey data from patients that received the texts and that came to
      their scheduled appointment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 1-2 text messages a few weeks before and 1 text message 24 hours before
      their mammography screening appointment. Patients also receive a phone call reminder as per
      standard practice.
