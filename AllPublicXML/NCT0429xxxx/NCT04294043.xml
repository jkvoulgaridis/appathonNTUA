  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of two 5-day infusion
      cycles of IV gallium in adult patients with CF who are infected with NTM.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter open-label study in adults with CF who are colonized with
      M. avium complex and/or M. abscessus complex.

      Subjects will receive two 5-day infusion cycles of IV gallium. The study will evaluate the
      safety and antimycobacterial effect of two 5-day infusions of IV gallium.

          5. Documentation of NTM culture positive defined as follows:

               -  The two most recent consecutive sputum (or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) cultures
