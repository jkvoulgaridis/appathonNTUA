  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of acupuncture
      in the Emergency Department (ED) for treating acute musculoskeletal pain. The overall goal is
      to reduce acute and subacute opioid use by improving acute pain, anxiety and disability with
      non-pharmacologic treatment options at a critical entry point for patients into the
      healthcare system. There are two phases in this study. Phase (1): Enrolled subjects will be
      randomized to Battlefield (auricular) acupuncture, Peripheral acupuncture, or the control
      group receiving no acupuncture. Subjects assigned to an acupuncture arm will receive
      information and access to acupuncture in an outpatient clinic for the 4 weeks following ED
      visit. Phase (2) will analyze the first 60 patients to determine the most efficient method of
      acupuncture. The other type will be dropped and all subjects randomized to acupuncture will
      be in the same arm. All groups will complete questionnaires at 1 hour post-randomization, 2
      and 4 weeks after ED visit. Subjects may also have a blood draw for biomarker analysis while
      during their ED visit. A two-stage adaptive trial design with one planned interim analysis
      will be utilized for this trial. The two-stage adaptive trial design consists of two stages
      of treatment selection stage and efficacy (pain reduction) confirmation stage. The
      feasibility will be assessed based on patient recruitment and retention rates, while the
      acceptability will be assessed using patient reported outcomes and qualitative
      semi-structured interviews. The primary endpoint will be the improvement in pain score
      (evaluated based on of 0-11 pain scale) at the discharge from the ED.
