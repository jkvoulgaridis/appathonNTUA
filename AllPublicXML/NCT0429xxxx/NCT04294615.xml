    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota
      transplantation by automatic methods in the treatment of moderate to severe active ulcerative
      colitis. There are two groups according to FMT pathway ( through a naso-jejunal tube or
      transendoscopic enteral tubing). Patients were followed up until 2 weeks after the final FMT
      in hospital.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Eligible patients required a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis made by a primary
        gastroenterologist based upon history, physical exam, laboratory/radiological studies and
        gastrointestinal histology. All patients were age ≥ 18 year old at the time of enrollment.
        They had moderate to severe symptoms with a mayo score between 6~12 and an endoscopic
        subscore ≥2. Patient medication for UC could not have changed for at least one month prior
        to FMT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Active or history of intraabdominal abscess, acute abdomen or other clinical emergencies
        requiring emergent management, pregnancy, prior history of FMT, prior history of TNF
        inhibitors use, or other serious systemic disease.
