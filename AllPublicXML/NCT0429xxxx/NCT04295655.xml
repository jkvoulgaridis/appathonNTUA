  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxia is considered a key player in many of the comorbidities that characterize COPD, such
      as pulmonary hypertension, skeletal muscle dysfunction, and systemic inflammation. These
      comorbidities are worsened during an exacerbation due to prolonged bed rest and treatment
      with steroids, showing a reduction in the quality of life, exercise tolerance, and a greater
      risk of death in these patients. Therefore, a better understanding of the safety and
      effectiveness of exercise training for AECOPD patients with resting hypoxemia is needed.

    <measure>Lower limb strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Quadriceps strength was assessed with a portable hand-held dynamometer (Lafayette Manual Muscle Testing System, model 01163, Lafayette, IN, USA). The test was performed with the patient seated with his/her knees and hips flexed at 90°. Resistance was applied to the anterior tibia during 5 seconds of maximal muscle contraction. The test was repeated alternatively 3 times on the leg, allowing participants to rest between measurements. The highest value in Newton was selected for the analysis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Balance was evaluated by the one-leg standing balance test (OLS), that measured the time that the patient balances on one leg as long as possible. The patient choose a leg to stand on (whichever he felt more comfortable with), flex the opposite knee allowing the foot to clear the floor, and balance on one leg. Higher values mean better balance.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue was evaluated using the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS) that consists of 22 numerical items which assess multidimensional aspects of fatigue. The scale measures four dimensions of subjective fatigue: &quot;behavioral/severity&quot;, relating to the severity, distress, and degree of disruption in activity of daily living; &quot;affective meaning&quot;, relating to the emotional meaning attributed to fatigue; &quot;sensory&quot;, relating to the physical symptoms of fatigue; and &quot;cognitive/mood&quot;, relating to mental and mood states</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>all patients received the Control Group treatment added to global exercise treatment. The program included 15 minutes of deep breathing exercises and 20-30 minutes of limb exercises. The exercises included global active range of motion (ROM) exercises and muscle strengthening like upper and lower limbs flexion-extension do single-leg stance, and sit to stand exercises. The number of repetitions was adapted to the subject's response taken into account the perceived dyspnea and fatigue during the exercise performance.</description>

    <description>all patients received the Control Group treatment plus neuromuscular stimulation therapy (SEFAR Rehab X2, DJO France S.A.S., France) on quadriceps accompanied by lower limb exercises. The intervention was performed following the protocol described by Valenza et al (2017).
