  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PD1 blockade has been approved as salvage therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC). Although there is not solid evidence that PD1 blockade would induce hepatitis B virus
      (HBV) reactivation, previous clinical trials of PD1 blockade required enrolled patients to
      receive anti-HBV medications and control the viral load to be under 100-2000 IU/mL before
      initiation of PD1 blockade therapy. Such a requirement may not be necessary and could delay
      the treatment. Guidelines for prevention of chemotherapy induced HBV reactivation only
      suggest combining anti-HBV medications during the chemotherapy course without such a
      requirement of very load HBV viral load.

      The investigators hypothesized that under anti-HBV medications, patients with advanced HCC
      and active chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can receive durvalumab treatment without
      increased risks of HBV reactivation and related complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although durvalumab has not been approved as treatment for HCC, similar PD1 blockade agents
      such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab have gain approval as salvage therapy for advanced HCC.
      The investigators will enroll 43 patients with active (defined as serum viral load &gt; 2000
      IU/mL) chronic HBV infection (defined as positive serum HBV surface antigen). All patients
      would receive entecavir within 7 days of initiation of durvalumab treatment. Durvalumab 1500
      mg would be given intravenously every 4 weeks until confirmed disease progression,
      intolerable side effects, or completion of 24 treatment. Tumor assessment will be performed
      every 8-12 weeks. HBV viral load will be monitored at least once per month. Entecavir
      treatment will be continued at least 6 months after discontinuation of durvalumab treatment.
