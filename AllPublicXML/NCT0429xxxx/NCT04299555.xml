      The term &quot;outpatient&quot; refers to all the medical, organizational and administrative care that
      allows the patient to leave the same day the structure where the ambulatory procedure was
      performed. The usual rule for patients undergoing endoscopic surgery or surgery under general
      anesthesia is to transport them to the endoscopy or operating room lying on a stretcher, even
      if they can walk independently.

      In recent years, the procedure of bringing the patient standing in the operating room seems
      to have many advantages. It is readily accepted by patients and may even lessen their
      anxiety.

      Nevertheless, reluctance and fears are sometimes expressed by patients who do not know this
      new procedure. Our team has introduced this procedure for patients admitted to the ambulatory
      hospitalization sector and to join the endoscopy sector.

      The aim of our work is therefore to objectify the fears expressed by patients who have to go
      to the endoscopy room before general anesthesia and to evaluate their progress after
      endoscopy

      Nowadays, the procedure of the patient standing in the operating room or in endoscopy has
      become frequent in the outpatient management of patients. Indeed the advantages are numerous:
      better fluidity of the patient circuits to the block, reduction of the stress of the operated
      one etc. Yet some patients might experience fears.

      Thus, in order to improve our practice, we want to take into account your experience with
      this innovative procedure.

      To determine patients' fears concerning their endoscopic standing before general anesthesia
      and to evaluate their evolution after this first experience

      After your installation in the preoperative area, we submit a questionnaire that corresponds
      to the first part of the document and then accompanied by a hospital agent you will walk
      towards the entrance to the endoscopy room. These questions are about your possible fears and
      your degree of anxiety.

      After an endoscopy under general anesthesia, you will be taken back to your stretcher room
      where you will complete the second part of the questionnaire which deals with the same topics
      as the questions asked before the endoscopy.
