  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was carried out to determine the effect of the use of communication material on
      the anxiety and comfort of the patient in communication with patients receiving mechanical
      ventilators.As a result, the use of communication material reduces anxiety and increases
      patient satisfaction and comfort level. In communicating with intubated patients receiving
      mechanical ventilator therapy, the use of illustrated communication material is recommended.

    <textblock>
      The use ofcommunication material in communication with patients receiving mechanical
      ventilator support increases patient satisfaction and reduces communication difficulties.
      However, there was no randomized controlled clinical study showing the effect of the use of
      these materials on patient care outcomes such as anxiety and comfort level.Patients were
      randomly assigned to the control groups using illustrated communication material and
      intervention and routine communication methods. The research was carried out in three stages:
      preoperative, intensive care and one day after surgery. The primary outcomes of the study
      were pain, anxiety and comfort levels of the patients. Secondary outcomes were the patients'
      satisfaction with hemodynamic parameters and communication method.

    <intervention_model_description>This study was planned as a randomized controlled clinical trial with two arms: Patients who had undergone cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to intervention (illustrated communication material were used) and control (routine methods in the communication were used) groups when they were connected to the mechanical ventilator.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>The anxiety scores were recorded by the intensive care nurse in three consecutive measurements starting with the first communication (0th minute) and at 30th and 60th minutes</time_frame>

    <description>Postoperative comfort levels of the patients were determined by the Early Postoperative Comfort Scale.The highest total score that can be obtained from the scale is 144, and the lowest total score is 24. High scores show that comfort is good, and low scores show that comfort is depraved</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>hemodynamic data</measure>
    <time_frame>Hemodynamic data were recorded through the patient monitor by intensive care nurses in three consecutive measurements starting with the first communication (0th minute) and at 30th and 60th minutes</time_frame>
    <description>hemodynamic data are systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and peripheral oxygen</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>communication satisfaction and adequacy of communication techniqu, change of pain over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain data were recorded as 30th and 60th minutes, starting from the first communication (0th minute) in mechanical ventilation. Satisfaction and adequacy of communication were evaluated an average of 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>It is stated that numerical scales have been adopted more in clinical practice because they are useful in facilitating the definition of pain intensity, facilitating scoring and recording, and evaluating ceiling and floor effects. &quot;The Numerical Evaluation Scale&quot; was used to determine the pain levels of patients and to evaluate their satisfaction with the communication method used and the adequacy of the method</description>

    <description>In the intervention group, communication was established with the illustrated communication material. The pain, anxiety scores, and hemodynamic data of the patients were recorded by the intensive care nurse in three consecutive measurements starting with the first communication (0th minute) and at 30th and 60th minutes. On the first postoperative day, the satisfaction of the communication established with them, as well as their evaluations regarding the adequacy of this communication and their comfort levels were determined during the time they received mechanical ventilation therapy.</description>

    <description>Illustrated communication material was introduced to the patients in the intervention group. In the process (intensive care) that patients received mechanical ventilation support after the operation, agitation and sedation levels were monitored by the intensive care nurse who was to communicate with the patient using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). According to this scale, having minimum -2 and maximum +2 points was accepted as the starting criteria for communication (Sessler et al., 2002). Communication was established with the illustrated communication material.</description>
