    <textblock>
      CC-90009-CP-001 is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, clinical pharmacology study to
      measure how much CC 90009 gets into the bloodstream, how much is eliminated in urine and
      stool, and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. In addition, the safety and
      tolerability of CC 90009 will be evaluated.

      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the biotransformation and excretion of
      [14C]-CC-90009 following a single intravenous (IV) dose of 0.6 mg [14C]-CC-90009 in healthy
      male subjects. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability. The total radioactivity of [14C]-CC-90009 will be 2 μCi.

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subject is ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form
             (ICF).

          2. Subject is male.

          3. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related
             assessments/procedures being conducted.

          4. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          5. Subject is in good health, as determined by the Investigator based on a physical
             examination at screening.

          6. Subject agrees to abide by the requirements and restrictions outlined in the CC-90009
             Pregnancy Prevention Plan for Subjects in Clinical Trials.

          7. All subjects must avoid donating semen or sperm and practice complete abstinence (True
             abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or post
             ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) or
             condom use during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing
             potential (FCBP) while receiving CC-90009 and for at least 90 days after the dose,
             even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. If engaging in sexual contact, inform
             their partners who are FCBP to use two methods of reliable contraception throughout
             the entire duration of CC-90009 and for at least 90 days after their dose of CC-90009.
             Partners of male subjects who are females of childbearing potential must use
             contraception during the same duration as the male subject to avoid pregnancy. If a
             pregnancy occurs with your partner, notify the doctor conducting the study
             immediately. The following are examples of highly effective and additional effective
             methods of contraception:

             • Examples of highly effective methods: Intrauterine device (IUD) Hormonal (birth
             control pills, injections, implants, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system
             [IUS], medroxyprogesterone acetate depot injections, ovulation inhibitory
             progesterone-only pills [e.g. desogestrel]) Tubal ligation Partner's vasectomy

             • Examples of additional effective methods: Male condom Diaphragm Cervical Cap

          8. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 33 kg/m2 at screening.

          9. Subject has clinical laboratory safety test results that are within normal limits or

             neutrophil count (ANC), and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) must be above the lower
             limit of normal at screening.

         10. Subject is afebrile, with supine systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 90 and ≤ 140 mmHg,
             supine diastolic BP ≥ 50 and ≤ 90 mmHg, and resting pulse rate ≥ 40 and ≤ 110 bpm at
             screening.

         11. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), with a
             QTcF value ≤ 430 msec, at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric
             illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he were to participate in the study.

          3. Subject has a past or current history of any condition affecting calcium homeostasis
             including, but not limited to: hypocalcemia, parathyroid disorders, vitamin D
             insufficiency/deficiency, disorders of phosphate or magnesium metabolism. The
             Investigator should contact the Sponsor for questions on any disorders that may be
             related to calcium homeostasis.

          4. Subject has a history of prior infusion reactions, anaphylactic reactions, or
             anaphylactoid reactions to any medication regardless of severity.

          5. Subject participated in a radiolabeled drug study, where exposures either are known or
             unknown to the Investigator, within the previous 12 months prior to Day -1. The total
             12-month exposure from this study and a maximum of 2 other previous studies within 4
             to 12 months of this study will be within the CFR recommended levels considered safe,
             per US Title 21 CFR 361.1: less than 5,000 mrem whole body annual exposure, with
             consideration given to the half-lives of the previous radiolabeled study drugs
             received.

          6. Subject was exposed to significant radiation (eg, serial X-ray or computed tomography
             scans, barium meal, current employment in a job requiring radiation exposure
             monitoring) within 12 months prior to Day -1. All questions regarding this criterion
             should be discussed with the Sponsor.

          7. History of less than 1 to 2 bowel movements per day.

          8. Subject is unable to take calcium citrate, vitamin D3, Dulcolax®, acetaminophen or
             diphenhydramine because of allergy or other intolerance.

          9. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.
             The Investigator should contact the Sponsor for questions about eligibility based on
             this criterion.

         10. Subject was exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days
             prior to dosing, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever is
             longer).

         11. Subject has used any prescribed systemic or topical medication (including but not
             limited to analgesics, anesthetics, etc) within 14 days or 5 half-lives of that
             medication, whichever is longer, prior to dosing.

         12. Subject has used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including
             vitamin/mineral supplements and herbal medicines) within 7 days prior to dosing.

         13. Subject has used cytochrome P (CYP) 450 inducers and/or inhibitors (including St.
             John's Wort) within 30 days prior to dosing. The Indiana University &quot;Cytochrome P450
             Drug Interaction Table&quot; should be utilized to determine inducers and/or inhibitors of
             CYP (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx).

         14. Subject has any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, and excretion, eg, bariatric procedure. Note: prior
             appendectomy is acceptable, but prior cholecystectomy would result in exclusion from
             the study.

         15. Subject donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks prior to dosing to a blood bank or
             blood donation center.

             a. Note: Subjects who received hepatitis B vaccination and who test positive for
             hepatitis B surface antibody and negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen and
             hepatitis B core antibody remain eligible for study participation.

         19. Subject smokes &gt; 10 cigarettes per day, or equivalent in other tobacco products
             including eCigarettes or vapes (self-reported).
