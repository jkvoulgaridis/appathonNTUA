    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of candidate dengue vaccine formulations, it is prudent to
      develop an appropriate challenge model. This study will examine the safety and effectiveness
      of the Dengue 3 Live Virus Human Challenge (DENV-3-LVHC) product and assess the ability of
      this virus strain to elicit an uncomplicated dengue-like illness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects between 18 and 45 years old will be inoculated with Dengue 3 Live Virus
      Human Challenge (DENV-3-LVHC) in a dose ranging study. Subjects will be closely monitored for
      the first 28 days with continued follow up through 6 months. Clinical and laboratory
      parameters, viremia and antibody levels will be assessed. The goal is to determine the dose
      that produces uncomplicated dengue-like illness.

    <intervention_model_description>Nine subjects will be assigned to the low dose group. Twenty-one days post inoculation, data will be reviewed for safety and if performance parameters are met. If safety profile is acceptable but performance parameters have not been met, dose escalation to the medium dose will proceed in nine additional subjects. Twenty-one days post middle dose inoculation, data will be reviewed as above and a determination will be made to proceed to the high dose.</intervention_model_description>
