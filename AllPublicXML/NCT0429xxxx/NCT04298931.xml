  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known, that patients with circulatory impairment sometimes, but not always,
      benefit from intravenous fluids. Predicting if a fluid administration will improve
      circulation is therefore of substantial clinical interest.

      Ventilator treatment induces cyclic variation in blood pressure due to interaction between
      the lungs and the heart. This variation is minor, but its amplitude may be used for guiding
      fluid administration.

      However, this method of using ventilator-induced variation in blood pressure to predict the
      effect of fluid administration was developed when different settings for ventilator treatment
      was recommended, compared with today. With today's recommend ventilator treatment, the method
      is, unfortunately, less reliable.

      The investigators will investigate how different ventilator settings influence variation in
      blood pressure, and the investigators will test if this knowledge allows us to better predict
      the effect of a fluid administration, by taking the ventilator settings into account.

    <measure>&gt;10% Increase in stroke volume from before to after a fluid bolus. (Fluid responsiveness)</measure>
    <time_frame>From two minutes before to two minutes after a fluid administration.</time_frame>
    <description>A patient is considered a fluid responder if they have a &gt;10% increase in stroke volume (pulse contour analysis by the Edwards EV1000 with a FloTrac sensor).
Pre-fluid stroke volume is calculated as the median stroke volume estimate in the two minutes immediately preceding the fluid bolus.
Post-fluid stroke volume is calculated as the median stroke volume estimate in the two minutes immediately following the fluid bolus.
Change in stroke volume is calculated as: 100% * (Post-fluid stroke volume - Pre-fluid stroke volume) / Pre-fluid stroke volume</description>

    <description>Before a planned fluid administration, the investigators will apply a series of 10 ventilator settings for 30 seconds each.
The settings are the following combinations of respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (TV):
RR (min^-1), TV (ml/kg predicted body weight)
31, 6
31, 8
24, 6
24, 8
17, 6

10, 6
10, 8
10, 10
(the order of the respiratory rates: 17 to 31, will be randomized. 10/min will always be last. Tidal volume is always applied from lowest to highest for each respiratory rate).</description>
