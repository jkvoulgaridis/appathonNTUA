  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic erosive gingivitis is a syndrome (CEGS) that combines severe gingival inflammation
      and gingival erosion. The term &quot;desquamative gingivitis&quot; is often used in the literature to
      define chronic erosive gingivitis. However, this definition is inappropriate because the
      pathophysiological process at the origin of this gingival disease does not induce a
      desquamation but rather a loss of gingival substance, namely erosion, concerned wholly or in
      part of the gingival epithelium. In most clinical situations, chronic erosive gingivitis is
      an oral manifestation of a general disease with immune dysfunction. The most frequently
      described diseases are gingival lichen and autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBD). In 2018, as
      part of a monocentric study, we were the first to detail an original papillary gingival
      biopsy protocol, non-iatrogenic, perfectly suited to the anatomopathological examinations
      necessary for the diagnosis of AIBD gingival expression. The CEGS early detection by
      odontologists avoid delayed diagnosis and allows patients to be referred to the closest AIBD
      reference center.

      Hypothesis/Objective A bicentric study was conducted, to evaluate the clinical relevance of
      this protocol, including the differential diagnosis of the CEGS. Research was supplemented by
      carrying out a systematic review of the literature to compare the contributive capacity
      diagnostic of the papillary biopsy technique with other gingival sample methods (attached
      gingival tissue, mucosa).

      Method A retrospective bicentric observational study was conducted from October 2011 to July
      2019, in two departments of oral medicine of two public hospitals in Paris (University
      Hospital - Bretonneau in Paris and Henri Mondor in Créteil; France). These two departments
      are specialized in the diagnosis and management of oral pathology; that of the Henri Mondor
      hospital is an AIBD reference center.

      The literature review was developed in accordance with PRISMA recommendations. It was
      conducted on Pubmed - MEDLINE and Cochrane Oral Health Group and included all existing
      publications from 1935 until August 2019. A manual search of publications from the
      unpublished literature was also conducted.

    <description>Diagnosis of certainty of diseases, whose clinical features are the CEGS, have been made by comparing clinical data with histological criteria commonly accepted by the international community
One week after the biopsy has been performed, we can establish the:
number of contributive results of first-line biopsies performed for conventional histological analysis showing the:
presence or absence of the epithelium,
presence or absence of the intra-epithelial or the subepithelial cleavage,
characteristic of the inflammatory infiltrate, especially the presence and the number of lymphocytes.
number of contributive results of biopsies performed for direct immunofluorescence showing:
immune deposits or not, in a linear staining pattern at the chorio-epithelial junction.
immune deposits or not, in an intercellular staining pattern in the epidermis.</description>

      Gingival biopsies were performed. At least one biopsy per patient was intended for
      anatomopathological examination; a second biopsy was required for direct immunofluorescence
      (DIF), for generalized, particularly severe erosive gingivitis, and/or in the presence of
      pseudomembranes, gingival or oral blisters suggesting the existence of an autoimmune bullous
      disease with gingival expression. This second biopsy was performed either in the wake of the
      first or in second line after reading the first anatomopathological examination.

        Over the study period we were able to study 101 files, but the investigator's final sample
        of patients included 100 adults. In first-line, 2 papillary gum biopsies were performed
        simultaneously for 48 of them (48%), 1 for histological examination and 1 for
        immunohistochemistry. For 47 other patients (47%) only 1 biopsy was performed for
        histological examination and for the remaining 5 patients (5%) only 1 biopsy for
        immunofluorescence (DIF).
