      A Study in Healthy Male Subjects Designed to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic Profile of
      Abiraterone Following Administration of Immediate Release Formulations
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single centre, 2 part, open-label study in healthy male subjects. Parts 1 and 2
      were conducted in separate cohorts of subjects; subjects were not permitted to participate in
      both parts. Part 1 was a part-randomised, 4 period crossover study planned to include 24
      healthy male subjects. Part 2 was a randomised 2-period crossover study in 12 healthy male
      subjects. The aim was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of abiraterone following
      administration of immediate release prototype formulations in healthy male subjects.
