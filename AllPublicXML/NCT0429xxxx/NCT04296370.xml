  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, 3-arm Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Fluzoparib alone or with Apatinib versus Physicians Choice Chemotherapy, as
      treatment, in patients with a Germline BRCA Mutation and HER2-negative Metastatic Breast
      Cancer. The study contains a Safety Lead-in Phase in which the safety and tolerability of
      Fluzoparib+Apatinib will be assessed prior to the Phase 3 portion of the study.
