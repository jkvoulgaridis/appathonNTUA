  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study using cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) manufactured with the Miltenyi
      CliniMACS Prodigy Gamma-capture system will be effective in decreasing specific viral load in
      patients with BK virus viremia and BK virus-associated symptoms post-allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT), renal transplantation, and chemotherapy.

      This open-label, single-arm clinical trial will assess the safety and efficacy of BK
      virus-specific CTLs isolated from whole blood or leukapheresis products. The BK virus
      -specific CTLs will be generated automatically by the CliniMACS® Prodigy using the CliniMACS
      Cytokine Capture System (IFNgamma) after incubation with MACS GMP PepTivator® Peptide Pools
      of BKV VP1 and BKV LT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient Eligibility

          -  Patients with symptoms of cystitis and elevated BK virus DNA by screening PCR as above
             (section 4) post allogeneic HSCT, post chemotherapy

               1. Symptoms of cystitis may include: hematuria (microscopic or gross), pain with
                  urination, frequency, bladder spasms.

               2. Patient may be otherwise treated for cystitis as per local institutional
                  standards. Such treatments may include hydration, antiviral medications, or
                  surgical intervention as deemed appropriate by treating physician.

          -  Consent: Written informed consent given (by patient or legal representative) prior to
             any study-related procedures.

             treatment of refractory BK virus infection.

          -  Any medical condition which could compromise participation in the study according to
             the investigator's assessment

          -  Known HIV infection

          -  Female patient of childbearing age who is pregnant or breast-feeding or not willing to
