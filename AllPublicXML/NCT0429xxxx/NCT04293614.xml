  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgical formation of an AVF offers a unique example of vascular remodelling and
      adaption. Yet, the specific factors which elicit remodelling events which determine
      successful maturation or failure have not been unambiguously determined.

      Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations are increasingly been employed to investigate
      the interaction between local haemodynamics and remodelling and can potentially be used to
      assist in clinical risk assessment of maturation or failure.

      However, these simulations are inextricably linked to their prescribed boundary conditions
      and are reliant on in vivo measurements of flow and pressure to ensure their validity. This
      study will compare in vivo measurements of the pressure distribution across an AVF against a
      representative numerical model.

    <textblock>
      Most patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) will require haemodialysis. Several studies
      have recognized a well-functioning Arterio-Venous Fistula (AVF) as the best modality for
      access in patients with ESRD undergoing haemodialysis.

      A mature AVF has lower incidence of thrombosis and stenosis compared to the other two
      available modalities of the Arterio-Venous Graft (AVG) and Central Venous Catheter (CVC).
      This translates into prolonged patency rates and lower risk of infection. The use of AVF's
      are also associated with lower mortality, and costs.

      However, significant numbers of AVFs [20% to 60 %] are known to fail to mature into
      functioning fistulas. Issues such as impaired vein remodelling, intimal hyperplasia,
      technical problems, unrecognized stenosis within the outflow vein, inflow problems, or steal
      syndromes can all lead to failure of achieving a mature AVF.

      The aim of the study is to examine the relationship between the pressure gradient within the
      surgically formed AVF and its' maturation and functioning status.
