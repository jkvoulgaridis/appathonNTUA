    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/IIa, Open-label, Investigator-initiated Trail of SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1
      Inhibitor) in combination with AIN457 for patients with late stage MSS CRC who failed
      second-line and above treatment.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and RD of SHR-1210
      combination with AIN457 as a treatment of MSS CRC.
