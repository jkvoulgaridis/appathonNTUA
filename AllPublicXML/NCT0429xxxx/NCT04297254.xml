    <description>TEAEs are defined as undesirable events not present prior to medical treatment, or an already present event that worsens either in intensity or frequency following the treatment. The severity of all adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The grades are: Grade 1 (Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated); Grade 2 (Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily life [ADL]); Grade 3 (Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL); Grade 4 (Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated); and Grade 5 (Death related to AE).</description>

    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best overall response from the start of study treatment up to Week 24. CR per response evaluation criteria in solid tumor (RECIST) 1.1 is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm). PR per RECIST 1.1 is defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first occurrence of disease progression (PD) or death, whichever is earlier. PD per RECIST 1.1 is defined as at least a 20% relative increase and 5 mm absolute increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study) recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>
