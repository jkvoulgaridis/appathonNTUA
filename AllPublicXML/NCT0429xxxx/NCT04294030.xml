      This study is designed to compare the performance of the NOWDx HSV-2 Test to a currently
      marketed device. The intent is to show the rapid test device is comparable to the currently
      marketed device. The NOWDx HSV-2 Test is intended for qualitatively detecting the presence or
      absence of human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibodies to HSV-2 in human whole blood to aid
      in the diagnosis of infection caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).

      The objective of this study is to establish the performance characteristics of the NOWDx
      HSV-2 Test based on comparison to the HerpeSelect 1 and 2 Immunoblot IgG and HerpeSelect 2
      ELISA IgG assays.

      The external clinical study along with in-house analytical studies will demonstrate the
      efficacy of the NOWDx HSV-2 Test as an aid in the diagnosis of HSV-2 infection for at home
      testing and point of care testing sites. Participants will self test and be tested by
      Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waived operators with the NOWDx HSV-2 Test
      at independent sites in Florida, Kentucky, and Arizona.

      Two sample types will be tested with the NOWDx HSV-2 Test for each participant: capillary
      whole blood and venous whole blood. Sera from each participant will be tested at an
      independent reference laboratory.

      The NOWDx HSV-2 Test will be evaluated in diverse populations of sexually active persons who
      self-select for genital herpes testing, expectant mothers, and persons claiming to lack
      sexual experience.
