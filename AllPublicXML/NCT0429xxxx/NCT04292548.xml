    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of passive smoking on the levels of
      salivary TAS, TOS, LL-37 and dental status in children.In the study the parents of children
      were asked to fill out a complete survey about smoking habits. After filling out the
      questionnaire, according to the survey results, a total of 180 children were included to the
      study as follows; 90 children exposed to passive smoking, and 90 children in the control
      group (unexposed controls). Also demographic data were recorded (age, gender, parental
      education levels, child's tooth-brushing habit and child's daily dietary sugar exposure,
      family income). Dental examination of children were performed and caries prevalance of the
      patients were recorded. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected from children. Saliva
      'cotinine levels' which are expected to increase in passive smoking group; 'antimicrobial
      peptide LL-37' and oxidative stress markers 'total antioxidant status' (TAS), and' total
      oxidant status' (TOS) were evaluated by using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The
      obtained data parameters of the two groups were evaluated and comparison was performed.
