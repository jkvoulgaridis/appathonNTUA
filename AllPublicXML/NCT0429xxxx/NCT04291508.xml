      Prospective multi-center phase 2b randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded interventional
      platform trial of two different pharmacologic therapies (intravenous Vitamin C or intravenous
      Acetaminophen) for patients with sepsis-induced hypotension or respiratory failure.

  <detailed_description>

      Hypothesis 1A: Acetaminophen (APAP) or Vitamin C infusion will increase the days alive and
      free of organ support to day 28.

      Hypothesis 1B: APAP or Vitamin C will have a favorable effect on other secondary outcomes
      including pulmonary and non-pulmonary organ dysfunction and biomarkers of inflammation and
      endothelial injury

      The investigators plan to carry out two multi-center phase 2b randomized double-blinded
      placebo-controlled trials of two different pharmacologic therapies within a single platform
      trial.

        1. One trial will assess the efficacy of Acetaminophen (1 gram intravenously every 6 hours)
           for 120 hours in patients with sepsis who have evidence of either hemodynamic or
           respiratory organ failure.

        2. A second trial will assess the efficacy of Vitamin C (50 mg/kg every 6 hours) infused
           intravenously for 120 hours in patients with sepsis who have evidence of either
           hemodynamic or respiratory organ failure.

      For efficiency, both the Acetaminophen and the Vitamin C groups will use a shared placebo
      control group. All arms will have the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. All efficacy
      comparisons will use a pooled placebo group. All safety comparisons will use matching placebo
      group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Days alive and free of organ support to day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as alive and free of organ support (dialysis, assisted ventilation, and vasopressors) to day 28. Participants will need to be free of all three components (assisted ventilation, vasopressors, new renal replacement therapy) to qualify for a day alive and free from organ failures. Patients on chronic dialysis will not be scored for the new renal failure free component of this outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ventilator-free days (VFD)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Ventilator-free days is defined to be 28 days minus the duration of mechanical ventilation through day 28. Participants who do not survive to day 28 are assigned zero ventilator-free days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vasopressor-free days</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The number of calendar days between randomization and 28 days later that the patient is alive and without the use of vasopressor therapy. Patients who die prior to day 28 are assigned zero vasopressor free days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Renal replacement-free days</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The number of calendar days between randomization and 28 days later that the patient is alive and without new renal replacement therapy. Patients who died prior to day 28 are assigned zero renal replacement free days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>28-day hospital mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Vital status prior to discharge home before day 28.
&quot;Home&quot; is defined as a patient's place of residence prior to enrollment. Thus, if a patient is discharged to a location that is different from the place of residence prior to enrollment (e.g. rehabilitation facility or hospice) then the patient will be followed until they return to their original location, 90 days, or death, whichever comes first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ICU free days</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days spent alive out of the ICU to day 28.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital free days to discharge home</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as 28 days minus the number of days from randomization to discharge home. If a patient has not been discharged home prior to study day 28 or dies prior to day 28, hospital free days will be zero. Patients transferred to another hospital or other health care facility will be followed to day 28 to assess this endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Days in ICU among survivors and non-survivors</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 28</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with initiation of assisted ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 28</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with initiation of renal replacement therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who receive (new) renal replacement therapy through day 28 will meet this endpoint. Patients with chronic renal replacement therapy initiated prior to the current sepsis illness will not be eligible to meet this endpoint.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in organ-specific Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores between enrollment and study day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0-Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate the SOFA score upon enrollment and at day 7 using clinically available data. If a value is not available at baseline, it will be assumed to be normal. At the day 7 assessment, if a value is missing then we will carry forward the closest previously known value. If a patient is intubated or heavily sedated at either 0 or day 7, the GCS will be omitted when calculating the change in score. If a patient was on renal replacement therapy prior to presentation, then the renal dysfunction component to the SOFA score will be omitted as well</description>
