      This is a performance and reproducibility study to validate new or updated antimicrobials on
      the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC kit. The data from this study will be used to support the
      submission to the FDA for clearance in the US and for global registrations of the device
      intended for in vitro diagnostic use.

      This clinical study entitled &quot;Clinical Performance and Reproducibility of the Accelerate
      PhenoTest™ BC Kit Using the Accelerate Pheno™ System with New Antibiotic Wave I Updates for
      Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Positive Blood Culture Specimens&quot; is designed to
      demonstrate the clinical performance and reproducibility of the new or updated antimicrobials
      on the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC kit, which was previously FDA-cleared in February 2017.

      Clinical performance and reproducibility evaluations will be conducted at a minimum of three
      sites to determine the clinical performance of the new or updated antimicrobials from a
      combination of fresh (de-identified, remnant specimens) and contrived positive blood culture
      samples, to include at least 375 total specimens.

      The study sites selected will have expertise in blood culture diagnostics and will be able to
      conduct the study in accordance with this protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCP).
      Additionally, prior to study initiation, each site will have approval from the local
      Institutional Review Board (IRB).

      It is anticipated that the data from this study will be used to support the submission to the
      FDA for clearance in the US and for global registrations of the device intended for in vitro
      diagnostic use.

          -  Positive blood culture sample containing gram-negative rods according to Gram stain
             results

          -  For fresh specimens, de-identified, remnant positive blood culture specimens from
             patients for which Standard of Care (SOC) testing has been initiated and the remaining

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Blood culture positivity is &gt; 8 hours prior to initiation of testing with the
             Accelerate Pheno™ system

          -  Insufficient (less than 2.0 mL) remnant sample volume

          -  From a patient that has already been enrolled in the study
