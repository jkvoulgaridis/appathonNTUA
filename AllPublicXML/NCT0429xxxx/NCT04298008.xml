      of treatment

        1. Tumor biopsy is mandatory: screening, after 8weeks (1st-response evaluation), at disease
           progression (PD)

        2. blood sampling for biomarker study is mandatory: every cycles

        3. To evaluate the metabolic changes by AZD6738 and Durvalumab combination : 18 F-FDG PET
