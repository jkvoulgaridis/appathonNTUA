  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) in
      combination with active breathing exercises using the flow-based incentive spirometer
      (Inspirix) has a positive effect on the respiratory values in people with multiple sclerosis
      (MS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary research question includes &quot;what is the additional effect of intensive IPV
      treatment in combination with active breathing exercises on respiratory power (Peak
      Expiratory Flow, PEF) in people with MS?&quot;.

      In a single-center randomized clinical trial, 96 people with MS-related respiratory problems
      will be allocated to either the intervention group (IPV + active breathing training) or the
      control group (active breathing training only). Interventions will be provided by trained
      speech- and language therapists, in combination with a multidisciplinary rehabilitation
      programme of 3 weeks. Pre- en posttraining assessment includes measures of respiration,
      speech and fatigue.

    <measure>Change in Pulmonary Dysfunction Index (PDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre- post (3 weeks) (some participants also at 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the PDI, the assessor judges the cough force and the ability of the person to count on 1 exhalation. PDI scores vary between 4 and 11 and a higher score indicates increasing respiratory difficulties.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Maximum Phonation time (MFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre- post (3 weeks) (some participants also at 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum phonation time (MFT) (in seconds) is measured at a comfortable pitch of the voice. The patient is instructed to breathe in as deeply as possible and to hold / a / as long as possible. MFT is measured three times and the longest value is retained.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre- post (3 weeks) (some participants also at 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10) 10-item questionnaire assesses the psychosocial impact on the voice as perceived by the individual. The VHI-10 scores range from 0 to 40, with increasing scores indicating increased psychosocial impact. A score of 11 or higher implies a voice handicap.</description>

    <measure>Change in Vital Capacity (VC)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre- post (3 weeks) (some participants also at 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum amount of air that is exhaled after a deep inhalation. The person is asked to breathe out as deeply as possible in the mouthpiece after a deep inhalation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre- post (3 weeks) (some participants also at 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum inspiratory pressure at which the person inhales against a resistance.</description>

    <measure>Change in Maximum Expiratory Pressure (MEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre- post (3 weeks) (some participants also at 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>MEP is the highest pressure that arises during a powerful exhalation against a resistance.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for fatigue</measure>

    <description>IPV is a well-tolerated method to pump air jets into the lungs via a mouth mask at frequencies of 100-400 pulses per minute.
Each IPV session lasts 15 minutes, whereby the person with MS is firstly administered with a mask for 3 minutes at a high frequency (250 to 400 cycles per minute) and then 12 minutes with a low frequency (75 to 150 cycles per minute). The pressure (1.1 - 1.4 bar) is adjusted so that it is comfortable for every participant, yet there is the maximum possible expansion of the thorax. The sessions are given by speech therapists who are familiar with IPV. The IPV treatment will be provided 5 days a week, during 3 or 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>The active breathing exercises are based on the flow-based incentive spirometer (Inspirix). The Inspirix is a device consisting of a tube with a ball. A plastic tube is connected to the device with a mouthpiece in which the person with MS will has to breathe in and out. The device is equipped with a control button to build up the resistance (number of cc / sec). The aim is to train the inspiratory and expiratory volume as well as the inspiratory and expiratory exhalation force. These exercises are offered 5 times a week in groups under the supervision of an experienced speech therapist, during 3 or 4 weeks.</description>
