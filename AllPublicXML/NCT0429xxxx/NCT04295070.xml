      This Phase I trial will enroll 42 healthy adult volunteers. The study will enroll a sentinel
      group of 6 younger adults aged 18 to 49 years followed by approximately 36 healthy older
      adults aged 50 to 75 years. All participants will receive two doses, 28 days apart. The
      vaccine will be administered as nose drops to both the low and high dose cohorts.

                  protective environment within 7 days after each vaccination

               5. All tissues and materials used to collect respiratory secretions for 7 days after
                  each vaccination are to be sealed in a primary container and placed within a

               -  Established hormonal contraception (oral contraceptive pills [OCPs], long acting
                  implantable hormones, injectable hormones);

               -  A vaginal ring or an intrauterine device (IUD);

                  bilateral oophorectomy for women or vasectomy for men [with appropriate post
                  vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in semen] provided the male
                  partner is a sole partner) Women not of childbearing potential must be
                  postmenopausal for greater or equal to 12 months. Postmenopausal status will be

             Females who are abstinent from heterosexual intercourse will also be eligible.
             Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation methods)
             and withdrawal are not considered highly effective methods of birth control.

             Female participants who are in same sex relationships are not required to use
             contraception.

             WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1 and be willing to
             have additional pregnancy tests as required throughout the study;

             Males must be surgically sterile (&gt;30 days since vasectomy with no viable sperm),
             abstinent, or if engaged in sexual relations with a WOCBP, his partner must be
             surgically sterile (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy) or using an acceptable, highly effective double barrier
             contraceptive method from Screening until until 28 days after the final vaccination.
             Acceptable methods of double barrier contraception include the use of condoms AND the
             use of an effective contraceptive for the female partner that includes: OCPs,
             long-acting implantable hormones, injectable hormones, a vaginal ring or an IUD.
             Participants with same sex partners (abstinence from penile-vaginal intercourse) are
             eligible when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle.

          9. Males must not donate sperm for at least 90 days after the final vaccination;

         10. Participants must have the ability and willingness to attend the necessary visits to
             the clinical research unit (CRU);

         11. Participants must be willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to the
             commencement of any study procedures.
