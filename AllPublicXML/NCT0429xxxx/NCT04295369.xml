  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of a smartphone-based lifestyle medicine (LM) for
      improving psychological well-being in Chinese population. Since a range of lifestyle factors
      are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of common mental disorders (e.g., depression
      and anxiety), modifying different lifestyle factors simultaneously may be effective to
      improve our psychological well-being. Chinese dietary recommendations will be integrated into
      the app to increase the acceptability towards mental health intervention. Through this study,
      we aim to promote evidence-based patient care and to improve help-seeking and access to
      evidence-based interventions for improving psychological well-being.

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial on the effects of a culturally adapted
      self-help smartphone-based lifestyle medicine for improving psychological well-being in
      Chinese population. Prior to all study procedures, eligible participants will be required to
      complete an online informed consent (with telephone support). Around 30 eligible participants
      will be randomly assigned to either smartphone-based lifestyle medicine (LM group) or the
      waitlist control group (WL group) in a ratio of 1:1.

    <measure>Change in the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post-treatment and 1-month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>DASS-21 is a 21-items scale, comprises of three sub-scales which measures the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress, over the past week. The DASS is based on a dimensional rather than a categorical conception of psychological disorder, thus it has no direct implications for the allocation of patients to discrete diagnostic categories. However, recommended cutoff scores for conventional severity labels (normal, moderate, severe) are given in the DASS Manual.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-treatment and 1-month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>ISI is a 7-item scale designed to evaluate perceived insomnia severity. Ratings on the 5 point Likert scale are obtained on the perceived severity of sleep-onset, sleep maintenance, early morning awakening problems, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeably of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and level of distress caused by the sleep problem.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Short Form (Six-Dimension) Health Survey (SF-6D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-treatment and 1-month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>SF-6D is a preference-based single index measure of health. A six-digit number represents each SF-6D health state, each digit denotes the level of one of six SF-6D dimensions: physical functioning, role limitation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-treatment and 1-month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The 52-item HPLPII is composed of a total scale and six subscales to measure behaviors in the theorized dimensions of health-promoting lifestyle: spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, nutrition, physical activity, health responsibility, and stress management.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-treatment and 1-month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>SDS is a brief, 5-item self-report tool that assesses functional impairment in work/school, social life, and family life. The participant rates the extent to which work/school, social life and home life or family responsibilities are impaired by his or her symptoms on a 10 point visual analog scale. The numerical ratings of 0-10 can be translated into a percentage, if desired. The 3 items can also be summed into a single dimensional measure of global functional impairment that rages from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Credibility-Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-treatment and 1-month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-item CEQ yielded ratings of treatment credibility, acceptability/satisfaction, and expectations for success.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-treatment and 1-month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>FFQs is a 18-item scale, including drinks, plant, animal products and cigarette intake, which measures the frequency of food intake over the past three months on a 7-point scale.</description>
