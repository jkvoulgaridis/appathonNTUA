    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the impacts of Toucher-Massage on the
      experience of patients with chronic pain. The study takes place in two rehabilitation
      internal medicine services of the University Hospitals of Geneva at 2 inpatients units with
      78 participants (39 per group).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric study with a design of non-randomized cluster trial with an exploratory
      qualitative part. The treatment is assigned to one of two care units and subjects are
      allocated to the care unit not according to a randomization process but based on
      administrative basis.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the impacts of Toucher-Massage (TM) on the
      experience of patients with chronic pain hospitalized in two rehabilitation internal medicine
      services.

      The main objective is to measure the effects of TM on the global impression of change of the
      perception of pain.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. Measure the effects on

             1. the severity and impact of pain

             2. anxiety/depression

             3. caregiver-patient interaction

        2. Explore the experiences of patients benefiting from TM

        3. Explore perceptions, resistance, barriers and facilitators regarding the proposed
           interventions with the health care teams of the units.

      The population is patients suffering from chronic pain in two units of the internal medicine
      rehabilitation service at Beau-Séjour. The two units are similar in terms of care intake and
      populations cared for.

      The required sample size is 78 participants (39 per group)

    <description>Global impression of change will be measured by The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC).
Minimum value = 1 (no change or condition has got worse) Maximum value = 7 (a great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) assesses the severity of pain and the impact on activities. The scale contains nine items: four of which have a numerical assessment scale for pain severity ranging from 0-10 (0= no pain and 10 representing the strongest possible). The impact of pain is assessed on general activity activities, mood, walking ability, work, relationships, sleep, and taste for life (0= does not interfere, 10= gene completely). The scale provides two main scores: a severity score and a pain repercussions score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is composed of seven items measuring anxiety, and seven items concerning depression.
Minimum value= 0 (never) Maximum value = 3 (really very often). A score greater than or equal to 11 indicates that the person is suffering from anxiety or depression.</description>

    <measure>Interaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Nurse-Patient-Interaction Scale (NPIS) questionnaire will be used to assess the patient's perception of interaction with caregivers across 14 items.
Minimum value = 1 (not at all) Maximum value = 10 (a lot). The higher the score, the better the interaction with caregivers.</description>

    <description>The intervention for the Experimental Group (EG) includes a massage time of about 15 minutes (according to current Geneva Hospital practice) on the foot area. At least four sessions will be delivered and spread over two weeks. The TM will be provided by the care team. The training time for the workers corresponds to 2 times 2 hours. In order to be as close as possible to a standardized session, practitioners will benefit from an intervention guide.</description>

    <description>The Control Group (CG) will benefit from an intervention of identical duration. The treatment consists of a foot massage with a Homedics HM MP RELEX 90 device, a heat-free &quot;shiatsu&quot; program, which lasts about 15 minutes. The use of the Homedics device is no more a common treatment than the practice of Touch-Massage. TM involves a therapeutic relationship between caregiver and patient. It is for this reason that we need a comparator that should allow us to keep the aspect of the massage while decreasing the aspect of the therapeutic relationship and therefore offer us an adequate comparator.</description>
