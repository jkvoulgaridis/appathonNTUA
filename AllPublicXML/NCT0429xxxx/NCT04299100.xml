  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, prospective, randomized controlled trial of a novel sleep health program
      versus no sleep intervention in chronic pain patients. The Sleep Health program will consist
      of weekly home-based videos and digital materials termed &quot;Self-Management for Sleep Care&quot;,
      which will provide participants with information on how to improve their sleep through
      education on sleep hygiene, relaxation training, and cognitive behavioural components.
      Patients will be also be screened through undiagnosed sleep apnea. For those determined to
      have suspected undiagnosed moderate or severe sleep apnea, they will be receive a
      recommendation for referral to a sleep clinic as part of standard of care. The study aims to
      evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the Sleep Health Program which includes the
      videos and digital materials and screening for sleep apnea in patients with chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will complete sleep, pain, and functional questionnaires. Additionally, all
      participants will undergo one overnight oximetry reading using the wristwatch pulse oximetry.
      Following these baseline assessments and questionnaires, participants will be randomized to
      either the control group or the Sleep Health Program.

      A)Sleep Health Program Group Participants in this group will receive usual care from their
      pain physician. Participants will also receive the Self-Management for Sleep Care videos and
      digital materials. Participants with suspected moderate/severe sleep apnea as determined by
      oximetry, but who have not been diagnosed with sleep apnea prior to the study, will be
      recommended for referral to a sleep clinic as part of standard of care.

      B)Control Group Participants in this group will receive usual care from their pain physician.

      First follow up visit:

      At 8 weeks after the initial visit, all participants will attend their first follow-up visit
      and complete the sleep, pain and functional questionnaires and 7-day sleep diary recording,
      and report any changes in medications.

      Second follow up visit:

      At 6 months after the initial visit, all participants will attend their second follow-up
      visit and complete the sleep, pain and functional questionnaires, 7-day sleep diary recording
      and report any changes in medications. Control participants will receive information provided
      by the Self-Management for Sleep Care program. Control participants with suspected
      undiagnosed moderate/severe sleep apnea will be recommended for referral to a sleep clinic as
      part of standard of care.
