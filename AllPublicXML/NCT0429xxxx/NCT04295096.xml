      Title: Collection of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) From Healthy Subjects for the
      Development of Cellular Immunotherapy Product

      Background:

      CAR-T therapies are being developed that utilize modified immune cells to fight tumors.
      'Off-the-shelf' allogeneic CAR-T technology has better efficacy and more promising clinical
      applications. Investigators want to use the cells of healthy subjects to perform the studies.
      To accomplish this, they are collecting PBMCs through apheresis.

      Objectives:

      To collect PBMCs from healthy subjects for product development for cell Immunotherapies.

      Background:

      Autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have changed the therapeutic landscape in
      haematological malignancies. Nevertheless, the use of allogeneic CAR T cells from donors has
      many potential advantages over autologous approaches, such as the immediate availability of
      cryopreserved batches for patient treatment, possible standardization of the CAR-T cell
      product, time for multiple cell modifications, redosing or combination of CAR T cells
      directed against different targets, and decreased cost using an industrialized process. The T
      cells currently used for CAR-T cell manufacturing are mainly derived from peripheral blood
      mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) .The manufacture of allogeneic CAR T cells from PBMCs collected
      from healthy donors is associated with the ability to make multiple vials from a single
      apheresis product. Allogeneic CAR T cells are created from healthy donors, they are generated
      from immune cells that have not been impacted by the immune effects of cancer or by exposure
      to chemotherapeutic agents, in contrast to autologous T cells from patients. The selection of
      donors on the basis of their immune characteristics is likely to be a key factor in
      decreasing the heterogeneity of the final cell product

      Objectives:

        -  To produce allogeneic CAR T cells with different targets and other cell products by
           using PBMCs from healthy subjects.

        -  To develop and optimize the methodology for the response or quality determination of
           cell Immunotherapy products.

      Design:

      All subjects are required to sign a written informed consent form for the study. After the
      signing of informed consent form, participants will be screened with a series of vital signs,
      physical examinations and laboratory tests. Demographic data and medical history of the
      subjects will also be documented. Participants will undergo a routine blood test within 24
      hours before the apheresis to reconfirm their eligibility and 3-5 ml blood samples are to be
      drawn for the development of detection methods of cell-based immunotherapy. Subjects who meet
      all the inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion criteria are qualified to donate
      peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) by means of apheresis. 6×10[9] of cells for each
      healthy person are preferred. 36 healthy subjects are to be enrolled through the whole study.
