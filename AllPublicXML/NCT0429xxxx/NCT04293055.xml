  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether weight loss maintenance can be improved by
      providing individuals with 4 consecutive weeks of phone coaching during the maintenance
      period. Individuals who previously achieved and maintained a &gt;=5% weight loss in a 1-year
      behavioral weight loss program will be provided with a low-intensity maintenance
      intervention. Some individuals will be selected to receive phone coaching. Assessments of
      weight, physical activity, and other weight-related behaviors will occur at baseline, 6
      months, and 1 year.

    <description>All participants are provided with a monthly newsletter which contains useful strategies for maintaining weight loss long-term. Participants are also encouraged to weigh themselves daily using a smart scale, which electronically transmits weight data to the research staff. Some participants randomized to this condition will also receive 4 consecutive weeks of phone coaching at some point over the 1-year intervention period (this is determined by a weight-based algorithm).</description>

    <description>Some individuals will receive 4 consecutive weeks of phone coaching. The first coaching call will be approximately 30 minutes in duration and follow-up calls will be 10-15 minutes in duration. Coaches will help support participants in their weight loss maintenance efforts. Once coaching calls are completed, the participant will not have any other contact with their coach.</description>
