  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single day
      dosing and a separate multiple day dosing of 18-MC HCl administered orally, each part of the
      study having a different set of healthy male and female volunteers (of non childbearing
      potential).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single day and multiple day
      dosing, in healthy, non-smoking, male and female volunteers.

      Part 1: Single day dosing

      Seven (7) healthy male and female volunteers (of non childbearing potential) will be randomly
      assigned to receive in a single day either 18-MC HCl (n=5) or placebo (n=2) in each cohort.
      There will be 4 cohorts: 1) 4 mg bid, 2) 8 mg bid, 3) 12 mg bid, and 4) 16 mg bid.

      All participants will be assessed for PK and safety for 14 days. There will be two sentinel
      participants in each cohort, who will receive their first dose at least 48 hours prior to the
      rest of the cohort. Participants will report to the clinical unit (CU) for a screening visit
      within 28 days prior to Day -1 and all screening procedures and evaluations will be
      completed. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be admitted to the CU on Day
      -1 and will undergo safety and compliance assessments on this day. The results will be
      evaluated prior to study drug dosing on Day 1. After treatment administration on Day 1,
      participants will remain at the CU and undergo serial safety and PK assessments until Day 3.
      On Day 3, participants will be discharged from the CU. Participants will return to the study
      site for a follow-up assessment on study Day 7 and Day 14.

      A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review the safety data and exposure of 18-MC, derived
      from available PK analysis of each cohort. The SRC will confirm the next dose in a subsequent
      cohort (Cohort 2, 3 and 4) as well as progression to the MAD component of the study.

      Part 2: Multiple day dosing

      After completion of Cohort 2 (8mg bid) in Part 1, based on PK and subject to SRC review, Part
      2 will begin as follows:

      Seven (7) healthy male and female volunteers (of non childbearing potential) will be randomly
      assigned to receive either 18-MC HCl (n=5) or placebo (n=2) in each cohort. There will be 4
      cohorts: 5) 2 mg bid x 7 days, 6) 4 mg bid x 7 days, 7) 8 mg bid x 7 days, and 8) 12 mg bid x
      7 days

      All participants will be assessed for PK and safety for 21 days. Participants will report to
      the clinical unit (CU) for a screening visit within 28 days prior to Day -1 and all screening
      procedures and evaluations will be completed. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria
      will be admitted to the CU on Day -1 and will undergo safety and compliance assessments on
      this day. The results will be evaluated prior to study drug dosing on Day 1. After treatment
      administration on Day 1, participants will remain at the CU and undergo serial safety and PK
      assessments. Participants will be confined for the entire dose administration period for
      safety and PK collection and will be discharged on Day 9. On Days 14 and 21, participants
      will return to the CU for further follow-up assessment.
