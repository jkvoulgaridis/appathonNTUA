  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), dose-escalation, and dose
      expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics
      (PD), and efficacy of SRK-181 administered alone and in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy
      in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study is divided into
      3 treatment parts (Part A1, Part A2, and Part B) and a Long-Term Extension Phase (LTEP).

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a histologically documented solid tumor that is metastatic or locally
             advanced, for which SoC therapy does not exist, has failed in the patient, or is not
             tolerated by the patient, or for which the patient has been assessed by the
             Investigator as not being a suitable candidate or otherwise ineligible for the SoC
             therapy.

                  disease or stable disease (e.g., not improving, but also not worsening,
                  clinically or radiographically) after at least 3 cycles of treatment with an

                  with anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy) &lt;28 days prior to administration of SRK-181.

               -  Patient has received targeted small molecule therapy within 5 half-lives of the
                  compound prior to administration of SRK-181.

               -  Patient has a history of intolerance or treatment discontinuation due to severe
                  irAE or other adverse reaction from prior anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy.

          -  Patient has a hypersensitivity to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy.

          -  Patient has the documented presence of neutralizing ADA to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody
             therapy.

          -  Patient is symptomatic or has uncontrolled brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease,

             in situ carcinoma [e.g., cervical], non-MEL skin cancer, bilateral synchronous
             discordant breast cancer, or indolent prostate cancer under observation). A past
             history of other malignancies is allowed as long as patient has been free of
             recurrence for â¥ 2 years, or if the patient has been treated with curative intent
