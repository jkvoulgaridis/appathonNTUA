      This 12-week open-label study will explore how PF-06946860 is tolerated, the effects of the
      study drug, the best dose for treatment and how participants with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
      and cachexia feel after receiving repeated subcutaneous dosing.During the 12-week treatment
      period, study drug will be administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks for a total of 5 doses.
      There is a 12-week follow-up period following the last dose of study drug. Additional
      assessments include:

        -  body mass and body weight measurements

        -  blood pressure and heart rate measurements

        -  Lumbar Skeletal Muscle Index (LSMI) by CT scan

        -  Blood samples:

             -  to evaluate safety,

             -  to measure the amount of the study drug in the blood,

             -  to evaluate if the study drug causes an immune response,

             -  to examine the effects of the study drug on levels of a specific cytokine,

             -  and for exploratory samples for bio banking.

        -  Measure the impact of the study drug on appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, physical
           function, and health-related quality of life with questionnaires.

        -  Measure the impact of study drug on physical activity using wearable digital sensors.

        -  To evaluate the effect of study drug on ability to complete anti-tumor treatment and
           survival in participants with NSCLC and cachexia.

        -  To evaluate tumor size.
