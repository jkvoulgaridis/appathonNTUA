    <textblock>
      The study will include subjects diagnosed with Dystonic Tremor (DT), Essential Tremor (ET),
      and healthy controls in the age range of 21-80 years. Electroencephalography (EEG) will be
      used as the primary outcome measure. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) will be used
      over the motor cortices or cerebellar cortices as an intervention that is expected to have
      short-term (less than an hour) electrophysiological effects.

    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to compare differences in cortical activity of patients
      with tremor before and after applying a session of rTMS. Specifically, the investigators will
      apply rTMS to the primary motor cortex (M1) as our group and others have shown abnormal
      function of the region. Moreover, a study shows that targeting of M1 and the dorsal premotor
      cortex (dPMC) with rTMS results in a trend towards improved clinical outcome in patients with
      focal hand dystonia and cervical dystonia. The central hypothesis of this study is that rTMS
      can modify cortical oscillations in patient populations with tremor and that the
      investigators will be able to detect these changes with the use of Electroencephalography
      (EEG). By applying inhibitory rTMS to the motor cortices, the investigators may expect a
      shift in cortical oscillations towards normal activity.
