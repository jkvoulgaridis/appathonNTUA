      About half of the world's children with epilepsy do not receive treatment - known as the
      epilepsy treatment gap - with significantly higher rates (67%-90%) in low- and middle-income
      countries (LMICs). We will conduct the first cluster-randomized clinical trial (cRCT) to
      determine the efficacy, implementation, and cost-effectiveness of a novel intervention
      shifting childhood epilepsy care to epilepsy-trained community health extension workers in an
      effort to close the epilepsy treatment gap. This research will provide information to help
      extend epilepsy treatment to children in LMICs and worldwide who suffer from untreated
      seizures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is the most common severe neurological disorder among children. Most children with
      epilepsy, if treated, can live normal lives. Yet among the world's children living with
      epilepsy, about 80% of whom reside in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), about half do
      not receive treatment; this is described as &quot;the childhood epilepsy treatment gap.&quot; Among the
      LMICs of Africa, the childhood epilepsy treatment gap is about 67%-90% - unchanged for over
      twenty years. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health agencies
      recommend that the epilepsy treatment gap be bridged by task shifting epilepsy care to
      community health extension workers (CHWs) in primary care settings, this recommendation has
      not been implemented on a large scale. This failure to scale up task shifting in epilepsy
      care is due to (a) inadequate evidence of efficacy of task-shifted epilepsy care, (b) a lack
      of methods and tools for implementing epilepsy task shifting, (c) inadequate understanding of
      task-shifted epilepsy care barriers, and (d) a lack of cost-effectiveness data for health
      policymakers. CHWs providing task-shifted epilepsy care must identify children with epilepsy,
      disadvantaged by stigma and unknown to the healthcare system, who are without access to
      neurologists or electroencephalograms (EEGs). An epilepsy screening tool in the local
      language (e.g., Hausa) is therefore essential for epilepsy diagnosis, seizure type
      classification, and medical management. Hausa, the most commonly spoken language in west
      Africa, with over 120 million Hausa speakers, is used in daily life, commerce, and education;
      our proposed study will be conducted in three major cities in Hausa-speaking Africa.

      Funded by an R21 grant (R21TW010899) in preparation for this cluster-randomized clinical
      trial (cRCT), we developed and piloted in Kano, Nigeria (a) a scalable epilepsy training
      program for CHWs, (b) an epilepsy community education program in Hausa to facilitate
      screening, diagnosis and treatment; and (c) an epilepsy data management system. We also (d)
      validated an epilepsy screening, diagnosis, and seizure classification tool in Hausa, (e)
      demonstrated feasibility of screening and enrolling children in a cRCT of task-shifted
      epilepsy care, and (f) piloted a task-shifted epilepsy diagnosis and management protocol. We
      will now conduct the first cRCT of task-shifted childhood epilepsy care in Africa with the
      following specific aims:

        1. Conduct a non-inferiority cRCT of a task-shifted childhood epilepsy care protocol
           compared to enhanced usual care (EUC) in three Hausa-speaking cities in northern
           Nigeria. We will enroll 1530 children (age 6 mo, &lt;18 yrs) with epilepsy across 60
           randomly selected primary healthcare centers (PHCs) in Kano (30 PHCs), Kaduna (16 PHCs)
           and Zaria (14 PHCs). PHCs will be randomly assigned to intervention (task-shifted to
           CHWS childhood epilepsy care; 30 PHCs) or EUC (referral to a physician for epilepsy
           management; 30 PHCs). Primary outcome: we hypothesize that the proportion of children
           seizure-free for ≥ 6 months at 24 months follow-up (primary outcome) will be similar in
           the intervention and EUC arms. Secondary outcomes at 24 months include (a) percent
           seizure reduction from baseline, (b) time to next seizure after 3 months seizure-free,
           and (c) accuracy of epilepsy diagnosis and seizure type classification by CHWs compared
           to assessments by physician epilepsy specialists, blinded to the randomization arm.

        2. Assess socio-behavioral and implementation outcomes among providers, parents/guardians
           and patients in the cRCT. Outcome measures include: (1) Difference in baseline, 12- and
           24-month intervention acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility measures among
           providers in the task-shifted intervention arm of the cRCT; (2) Difference in baseline,
           12- and 24-month quality of life, epilepsy knowledge and stigma, and trust in the
           healthcare system and providers among participants; (3) Comparison of 12- and 24-month
           quality of life, knowledge and stigma and trust measures among participants in the
           intervention and control arms.

        3. Determine the cost-effectiveness of the task-shifted epilepsy care intervention. Direct
           costs of the intervention and EUC will include personnel costs (including CHW epilepsy
           training) and expenses for diagnostic (EEG, brain imaging) and laboratory tests and
           anti-epileptic drugs. Indirect costs will include travel time and time away from work
           for parents/guardians and change in school attendance for patients. Cost-effectiveness
           will be expressed as US dollars per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted.22-28

      This project will also establish a brain disorders clinical research network for
      Hausa-speaking Africa and provide data for health system leaders and policymakers to scale-up
      task-shifted childhood epilepsy care.

    <intervention_model_description>The basic framework of these studies is a cRCTin which 60 PHCs (clusters) will be randomly selected from about 399 eligible PHCs in three major cities in the Hausa-speaking areas of northern Nigeria -30 of about 167 PHCs in Kano, 15 of about 124 PHCs in Kaduna, and 15 of about 108 PHCs in Zaria. Half of the overall PHCs will be randomly assigned to the task-shifted care arm of the cRCT, in which epilepsy treatment and follow-up care is provided by a CHW. The other half will be assigned to &quot;enhanced usual care&quot; in which the care is provided by a physician and a CHW serves to record events and collect other standardized data.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>The principal investigators and research personnel will share deidentified data from the study in multiple modes:
Data files for internal (study) investigators
Data files for external (non-study) investigators
Timely and comprehensive publication of the results for the primary and secondary outcomes
Public-access data files supplied to NIH</ipd_description>
    <ipd_info_type>Study Protocol</ipd_info_type>
    <ipd_time_frame>A standard analysis file will be created for use in the analysis of the trial, and for manuscripts and reports. At the end of the trial, the analysis file will be circulated to each internal investigator. If an internal trial investigator requests a special file be created for him/her, a complete proposal must be submitted as detailed below. The contents/variables of the standard analysis file will be posted in the members-only section of the trial website. The internal analysis file will include data from screening and baseline forms, follow-up visit forms with CHWs, seizure diaries, medication administration diaries, neurological exams, laboratory (clinical laboratory, EEG, brain imaging) forms, and outcomes. A section for potential external investigators will also be created on the trial website, which will list the variables from the case report forms. In general, external investigators will be limited to variables from this list.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Both internal and external investigators are required to submit a proposal requesting a dataset from the trial, describing the following elements in detail:
Investigator's name and affiliation
Hypothesis to be tested or investigation to be conducted
Background and relevant literature
Subjects eligible for inclusion in the analysis and dataset
List of variables of interest
Substantially detailed analysis plan
List of potential co-authors and collaborators</ipd_access_criteria>
