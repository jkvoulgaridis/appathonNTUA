  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with a history of bariatric surgery may face various difficulties during pregnancy and
      puerperal time. Therefore it is assumed the prevalence of mental health disorders might be
      higher than in average women during and after pregnancy. This could possibly lead to an
      unsatisfying weight progress and therapeutic non-adherence. These factors shall be observed
      in the study in order to characterize this special cohort of participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women following bariatric surgery are included at least 6 months after childbirth to evaluate
      retrospectively pregnancy and puerperal time. For mental health issues questionnaires, a
      structured clinical interview (SCID) and a psychological interview give an insight to past
      and present status. In order to evaluate weight progress and nutrient deficiencies routine
      follow-up care data of bariatric surgery is screened. In order to assess the course of
      pregnancy and child development data is extracted from pregnancy and child's examinations
      reports. Furthermore medication adherence, quality of life and sleep are registered by
      questionnaires.
