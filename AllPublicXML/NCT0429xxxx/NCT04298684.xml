  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 2-years prospective, randomized and multicentric study will be performed to assess the
      efficacy of metformin compared to sitagliptin on benign thyroid nodules size ≥ 2 cm, in newly
      diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies reported that prevalence of thyroid nodules (TN) is increased in patients
      with insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there are no
      guidelines for the management of TN in this target population. In 2013, the French National
      Health Insurance reported that thyroid surgery procedures for benign nodules have increased
      unjustifiably. The impact of such surgery on the patients could be serious, with
      psychological repercussions and risks of surgical complications and the need of a
      substitutive lifetime hormonal treatment. The investigators hypothesize that metformin may
      reduce the need of TN surgery by decreasing benign TN size through a reduction of IR profile.
      A 2-years multicentric prospective study will be conducted to compare efficacy of metformin
      versus sitagliptin on benign thyroid nodules size in patients with initial benign thyroid
      nodules ≥ 2 cm. The percentage of thyroid surgery avoided, IR profile measured by Homeostasis
      Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance-Index (HOMA-IR-index) and adipokines concentrations
      will be also collected at inclusion ad at 2 years. The Primary outcome will be the percentage
      of patients in each group who had at least a 20% decrease in one or more nodules of more than
      2 cm at 2 years. Several secondary outcomes will be registered: percentage of thyroid surgery
      observed in each group at 2 years, number of new TN (≥ 10mm) after 2 years of follow-up ,
      percentage of metabolic syndrome before and after treatment, proportion of subjects with
      improvement of the HOMA-IR index and adipokine concentrations, plasmatic thyroid-stimulating
      hormone (TSH), T4 and T3 levels evolution, percentage of insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
      and adiponectin receptor expression in thyroid tissues after TN surgery.

    <intervention_model_description>Multicenter, prospective open-label study evaluating the efficacy of metformin compared to sitagliptin on benign TN growth in subjects with T2DM. After written approval, subjects with T2DM who meet the eligibility criteria will have a thyroid ultrasound. Subjects with TN of at least 2 cm and 2 benign cytology results after fine-needle aspiration, will be included after a run-in period of 1 month with a daily basal insulin therapy in order to reduce glucotoxicity. If the Hb1Ac levels remain above 8%, the subjects will not be included. After inclusion, a central randomization will allow subjects to benefit from either metformin (group 1) or sitagliptin (group 2). In both cases, the standard nutritional care and physical activity recommendations (150 minutes of physical activity per week) will be recalled. If HbA1c levels &gt; 8% during the follow-up, treatment by gliclazide will be introduce (LP30mg). A follow-up schedule will be given to the included patient for future visits.</intervention_model_description>
