  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Breast cancer is the second most common cause of U.S. cancer deaths in women. Immunotherapy
      drugs use a person s immune system to fight cancer. Researchers want to see if a new
      combination of immunotherapy drugs can help treat breast cancer that has gone to places in
      the body outside of the breast (metastasized).

      Objective:

      To learn if a new combination of immunotherapy drugs can shrink tumors in people with
      metastatic breast cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 and older who have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, such as Triple
      Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) or ER-/PR-/HER2+ Breast Cancer (HER2+BC)

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      medical history

      physical exam

      disease confirmation (or tumor biopsy)

      tumor scans (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or bone scan)

      blood and urine tests

      electrocardiogram (measures the heart s electrical activity)

      echocardiogram (creates images of the heart).

      Participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The drugs they get will be based on the group
      they are in. Drugs are given in cycles. Each cycle = 3 weeks. Participants will be seen in
      clinic every 3 weeks, prior to the start of a new cycle. At each visit, participants will
      have an clinical exam, have blood drawn and will be asked about any side effects. They will
      repeat the screening tests during the study. New scans, like a CT scan, will be done every 6
      weeks to see if the treatment is working.

      All participants will get BN-Brachyury. It is 2 different vaccines - a prime and a boost.
      First the priming vaccines, called MVA-BN-Brachyury help to jump start the immune system.
      Next the boosting vaccines, called FPV-Brachyury help to keep the immune system going. They
      are injected under the skin during different cycles.

      All participants will get M7824 (also known as Bintrafusp alfa ), which is an immunotherapy
      drug. Some participants will get a commonly used drug is HER2+ breast cancer called
      adotrastuzumab emtansine (also known as T-DM1DM1 or kadcyla). For both, a needle is inserted
      into a vein to give the drugs slowly.

      Some participants will take Entinostat weekly by mouth. It is in tablet form. Participants
      will keep a pill diary.

      Participants will continue on their assigned treatment until their cancer grows, they develop
      side effects or want to stop treatment. About 28 days after treatment ends, participants will
      have a follow-up visit or a telephone call. Then they will be contacted every 3 months for 1
      year, then every 6 months for 1 year. They may have more tumor scans or continue treatment.

      Background:

        -  Current greater than or equal to 2nd line treatments for metastatic breast cancer
           provide modest response rates, and modest improvement in progression-free survival but
           no treatments are curative.

        -  Bavarian-Nordic (BN)-Brachyury vaccine is a recombinant poxvirus vaccine against the
           transcription factor brachyury, which plays an important role in the
           epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer. A recently completed phase 1
           study of BN-Brachyury vaccine showed the vaccine was well tolerated and generated an
           immune response.

        -  M7824 is a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of a monoclonal antibody against
           human PD-L1 fused to the soluble extracellular domain of human TGF-Beta receptor II
           (TGF-BetaRII), which functions as a TGF-Beta trap.

        -  Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1 or Kadcyla) is an antibody drug conjugate used in
           second- and third- line treatment of metastatic HER2+ breast cancer (HER2+BC). T-DM1
           activates ADCC, dendritic cell maturation, increases TILs, increased PD-L1 expression,
           and increased immunomodulatory cytokines.

        -  Entinostat is a class 1 histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) which suppresses tumor
           initiating cells, regulatory T-cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as
           well as enhances cytotoxic T-cell mediated lysis, direct natural killer (NK) lysis, NK
           cell activation, increases PD-L1 expression and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
           (ADCC). In addition, entinostat may also be able to overcome HER2 resistance.

        -  We propose a Phase 1b trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the stepwise
           combination of the BN-Brachyury vaccine, M7824, T-DM1 and entinostat in metastatic
           breast cancer.

             -  Arm 1 - Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC); M7824 + BN-Brachyury

             -  Arm 2 - ER-/PR-/HER2+ Breast Cancer; M7824 + BN-Brachyury + T-DM1

             -  Arm 3 - ER-/PR-/HER2+ Breast Cancer; M7824 + BN-Brachyury + T-DM1+ Entinostat

             trial as long as the HBV viral load is undetectable on suppressive therapy, if
             indicated.

          -  Patients with history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and
             cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are
             eligible if they have an undetectable or unquantifiable HCV RNA 12 weeks or longer

          -  Patients who have received radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Patients with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases should be excluded
             from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often
             develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events. However, patients with treated brain metastases
             are eligible if there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression
             for 6 weeks after treatment is complete (no radiotherapy within 6 weeks) and within 28
             days prior to the first dose of trial drug or asymptomatic brain metastasis. Patients
             requiring immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10mg/day prednisone
             equivalent) for palliation are excluded.

             antibodies (Grade greater than or equal to 3 NCI-CTCAEv5).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing active
             infection that requires systemic treatment with ongoing antibiotics (eligible if can
             stop antibiotics on day of enrollment), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,
             or psychiatric illness/social situation that in the opinion of the primary
             investigator would prohibit the patient from complying with study requirements.

          -  Known history of a gastrointestinal illness that in the investigator s opinion would
             prevent the absorption of entinostat, which is an oral agent. (Arm 3 ONLY)

          -  Patients with bone metastases who have initiated denosumab or a bisphosphonate therapy
             within 28 days prior to or after Cycle 1 Day 1. Continuation of prior therapy is

             patient s ability to carry out the treatment program.

          -  Patients should have no evidence of being immunocompromised as listed below:

               -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to enroll
                  if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to
                  an autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not
                  requiring systemic treatment or conditions not expected to recur in the absence
                  of an external trigger in the opinion of the primary investigator.

               -  Altered immune function, that in the judgement of the PI that may affect a
                  patient s ability to adequately engage the immune system and respond to the
                  immunotherapy agents being administered, including but not limited to:
                  inflammatory bowel disease; active infectious enteritis; eosinophilic enteritis;
                  lupus erythematous; ankylosing spondylitis; scleroderma; multiple sclerosis.
                  These criteria do not include all disease with an immune-related component, but
                  are not autoimmune in nature or have a primary alteration in the general immune
                  function that may interfere with the vaccine mechanism of action, for example
                  celiac disease.

               -  Immunosuppressive therapy post-organ transplant.

          -  Concurrent use of chronic use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses of
             systemic steroids for replacement, defined as 10mg of prednisone per day or
             equivalent, or local (topical, nasal, ophthalmic or inhaled) steroid use or prior
             concomitant use with chemotherapy. Systemic steroids must have been discontinued &gt;2
             weeks prior to trial start. Prior use of corticosteroids in short-term schemes
             (duration shorter than 3 days) for indications such as prophylaxis of reactions to
             intravenous contrast for imaging studies or chemotherapy-related AEs are not
             considered part of this exclusion. Prior use of corticosteroids for brain metastasis
             ending at least 14 days prior to enrollment is not considered part of this exclusion
             criteria.

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because of the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects with all of the agents involved in this
             trial.

          -  Clinically significant cardiomyopathy, coronary disease, chronic heart failure (CHF;
             New York Heart Association class III or IV or hospitalization for CHF), or
             cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients with a history of myocarditis are excluded due to the potential of
             myocarditis with anti-PD-L1 antibodies.

          -  Patients with pulse oximetry &lt; 92% on room air will be excluded due to the potential
             of pneumonitis with anti-PD-L1 antibodies.

          -  Any other condition, which would, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or
             Medical Monitor, indicated the subject is a poor candidate for the clinical trial or
             would jeopardize the subject or the integrity of the data obtained.
