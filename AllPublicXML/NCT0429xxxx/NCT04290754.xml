  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-arm comparative effectiveness research trial to that will evaluate the
      ability of the interventions, Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive-behavioral &amp;
      Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT) and Teens Achieving Mastery over Stress (TEAMS), to
      intervene early to prevent depressive illness and potentially other common mental health
      disorders. Using cluster randomization, 564 participants eligible for the study will be
      offered one of two different depression prevention programs in multiple sites in Chicagoland,
      Rockford, IL; Dixon, IL; and Louisville, KY. The study will also assess teens', parents' and
      providers' experiences with each intervention approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of mental, emotional and behavioral (MEB) disorders have an initial onset before
      age 24, with 20% annual incidence, with major depressive disorder (MDD) being the most common
      MEB. Health systems, eager to reduce costs, want to transition from the current &quot;wait until
      sick enough for treatment&quot; model for MDD to a preventive model. However, evidence is needed
      for (1) the comparative effectiveness of a &quot;scalable intervention&quot; and (2) an implementation
      model for such a scalable intervention in the primary care setting. This study is a
      comparative effectiveness trial evaluating the efficacy of two evidence-based
      cognitive-behavioral prevention (CBP) programs: Teens Achieving Mastery over Stress (TEAMS),
      the &quot;gold standard,&quot; face-to-face, group therapy model, and Competent Adulthood Transition
      with Cognitive Behavioral, Humanistic and Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT), a scalable,
      self-directed, technology-based model. Using cluster randomization, 564 eligible adolescents
      age 13-18 will be offered one of two different depression prevention programs in multiple
      sites in urban and suburban Chicago, IL; rural Western Illinois, including Dixon and
      surrounding towns; and Louisville, KY. The investigators will comprehensively evaluate
      patient-centered outcomes and stakeholder-valued moderators of effect at 2, 6, 12, and 18
      month assessment points. Using a hybrid clinical trial design that simultaneously examines
      implementation process, the study will also assess adolescents', parents' and providers'
      experiences (i.e. efficacy, time commitment, cultural acceptability, and implementation cost)
      with each intervention approach.

    <description>Time will be measured to nearest minute for all intervention related activities including initial screening, engagement phone calls, use of CATCH-IT, TEAMS group activities, including travel time to and from TEAMS groups. Time will be measured from adolescent, family, practice, community center, healthcare organization, health system perspective. For time that cannot be directly measured by study staff, the investigators will sample direct observation or questionnaires to capture time required for health system related activities such as screening and engagement.</description>
