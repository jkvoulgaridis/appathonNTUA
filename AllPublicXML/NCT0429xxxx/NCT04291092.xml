        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18;

          2. ECOG is 0-1;

          3. Non-small cell lung cancer confirmed by histology;

          4. The presence of brain metastases as determined by imaging, with unlimited numbers,
             allowing the presence of clinical symptoms of brain metastases;

          5. According to RECIST 1.1, there is at least one measurable extracranial and
             intracranial target lesion each;

          6. Allow first-line chemotherapy programmes;

          7. For patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations or ALK
             rearrangements, the researchers need to judge by imaging (RECIST 1.1 standard), after
             receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors（TKI） anti-tumor regimen before entering the group
             or during the treatment of traumatic brain progression;

          8. Sign informed consent and agree to collect the clinical efficacy and information of
             the patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Immunotherapeutic contraindications (including long-term use of hormones, history of
             radiation pneumonia, etc.)

          2. Active autoimmune diseases (e.g. vitiligo, psoriasis, hypothyroidism requiring hormone
             replacement therapy, etc.)

          3. Patients with active hepatitis B or C, HIV, active tuberculosis, etc.;

          4. Active infections requiring antimicrobial therapy (e.g. antimicrobial, antiviral,
             antifungal);

          5. History of known allogeneic organ transplantation and history of in vivo hematopoietic
             stem cell transplantation;

          6. Patients with interstitial lung disease or previous history of interstitial pneumonia;

          7. Having a history of substance abuse and unable to abstain from it or having mental
             disorders;

          8. who have participated in other clinical trials of antitumor drugs within 4 weeks
             before entering the group;

          9. Having used PD-1/PD-L1 and other immunotherapy drugs before entering the group;

         10. previous or concurrent with other untreated malignancies, except for cured basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma of the cervix in situ and superficial bladder cancer;

         11. (a) Pregnant or lactating women; those with fertility who are unwilling or unable to
             take effective contraception;

         12. The researchers judged other situations that might affect the conduct of clinical
             studies and the determination of their findings.
