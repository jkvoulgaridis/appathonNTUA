  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      52 patients that had previously participated in the RDBPC study of intralymphatic
      immunotherapy (ILIT) with 2 concomitant allergens, birch and grass, with NCT02423707, were
      eligible for an open follow up 5-6 years after treatment.

      Bakground: Intralymphatic immunotherapy has been proposed as a new, more effective, modality
      for allergy immunotherapy. With ultrasound- guided injections into the lymph node the
      allergen is injected directly to the secondary lymphoid organ to stimulate the immune system.
      The protocol that has been used so far is three injections with one month interval. The
      effect have been evaluated in several studies with limited sample sized and the effect have
      been estimated to be in the same range as after conventinal subcutaneous immunotherapy. No
      long term follow up have been performed.

      Objective: To investigate if the clinical improvement and immunological alterations is
      maintained 5-6 years after ILIT with two concomitant allergens, birch and grass.

      Methods: 52 patients that had previously participated in the RDBPC study were asked to
      participate in this open follow up.
