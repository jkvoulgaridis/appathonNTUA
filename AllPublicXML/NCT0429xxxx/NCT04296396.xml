      Non-inferiority randomized trial of 5,500 women with a cesarean delivery randomized prior to
      discharge to either an individualized opioid prescription protocol (IOPP) that includes
      shared decision making or to a fixed opioid prescription of 20 tablets of oxycodone 5mg.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority multi-center unblinded randomized trial of 5,500 women undergoing a
      cesarean delivery who are randomized before discharge to either an individualized opioid
      prescription protocol (IOPP) that includes shared decision making or to a fixed opioid
      prescription of 20 tablets of oxycodone 5mg. The primary endpoint is the presence/absence of
      moderate to severe pain at 1 week after discharge. Moderate to severe pain is defined as a
      value of 4 or higher on the Brief Pain Inventory worst pain scale (0 to 10) in the last 24
      hours. Consenting women will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two arms using a secure
      internet based randomization system maintained centrally by the Data Coordinating Center
      (DCC). Randomization will be stratified by site. Women will be followed through 90 days
      postpartum.
