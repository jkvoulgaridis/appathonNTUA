  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery under extracorporeal circulation (ECC) in newborns with congenital heart
      disease causes significant morbidity and mortality. The perioperative period is a period of
      major vulnerability implicated in the appearance of these sequelae, and it is therefore
      essential to monitor brain function during ECC. The quality of cerebral oxygenation in the
      perioperative period is routinely monitored non-invasively by infra-red spectroscopy, which
      makes it possible to estimate cerebral tissue oximetry from a surface electrode (NIRS). The
      association between time spent outside the limits of cerebral self-regulation and the
      occurrence of perioperative encephalopathy is not known. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether disturbances in brain self-regulation during the operative period are
      associated with the occurrence of postoperative encephalopathy in children operated on for
      congenital heart disease in the neonatal period. The main objective of the research is to
      determine the association between time spent outside individually determined cerebral
      self-regulation limits and the appearance of brain lesions suggestive of low brain output.
      Secondary objectives will investigate the association between time spent outside
      self-regulatory limits and the occurrence of postoperative encephalopathy defined by clinical
      and encephalographic criteria and will study factors predictive of the development of
      postoperative encephalopathy.
