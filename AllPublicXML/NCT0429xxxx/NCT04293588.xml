  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main outcomes of this study are to establish a cohort of well-phenotyped asthma patients
      with a recent history of an exacerbation. We aim to describe exacerbation profiles
      (phenotypes) of the cohort in terms of inflammatory/biomarker profile and bacterial/viral
      infection status and to compare these with exacerbation events in the sister APEX cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, observational, longitudinal cohort study. The study will consist of
      one group of approximately 200 patients with clinician diagnosed asthma, who have had at
      least one exacerbation in the past year before informed consent. They will be identified from
      secondary care, primary care and the Nottingham Respiratory Research Database (NRRD).

      After the Baseline visit, each subject will be followed for the duration of their
      participation in the study. Participants will be asked to contact the research team if they
      perceive that their asthma symptoms are worsening to the extent that they would usually seek
      help from a healthcare professional. They will then be invited to attend the Assessment Visit
      and potential Exacerbation Visit. Participants who complete this visit will then continue in
      the study, as we are interested in comparing subsequent events in the same individuals, to
      establish exacerbation stability and consistency.

      All participants, whether they have attended an Assessment visit or not, will be invited to
      attend for an Annual visit. The research team will also contact participants at 3 monthly
      intervals, with their permission, to discuss the study and provide updates.

          -  One asthma exacerbation requiring additional treatment in the year prior to informed
             consent. This is defined as either: 3 or more consecutive day's treatment with oral
             corticosteroids; for participants not on maintenance steroids, OR at least a doubling
             of treatment with oral corticosteroids for 3 or more consecutive days, from a stable
             dose, for participants on maintenance therapy with oral corticosteroids. These can be
             patient-reported.

          -  Any other clinically significant medical disease or uncontrolled concomitant disease,
             that is likely, in the opinion of the investigator, to impact on the ability to
