  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the mortality of patients with non-varicose upper gastrointestinal
      bleeding after performing early gastroscopy who are admitted on weekends and night hours is
      higher than those admitted on weekdays or during daytime hours.

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the schedule (day or night) and the day of
      admission (working or weekend / night) on the mortality of patients with non-varicose upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding after performing an early gastroscopy.

      A retrospective observational study will be carried out in patients admitted to the bleeding
      unit of the Santa Creu I Sant Pau Hospital, where we observed hospital mortality and 30 days
      after performing an early gastroscopy, the duration of admission, signs of hemorrhagic
      activity in a period of less than 12 h. After early gastroscopy and types of endoscopic
      treatments, data will be collected by reviewing medical records.

      The number of patients expected to be included in this study is 1320 patients. Patients will
      be included the day they enter the bleeding unit for an early gastroscopy.

        Patients diagnosed with non-varicose upper gastrointestinal bleeding and admitted to the
        Bleeding Unit of the Santa Creu and Sant Pau hospital during 2017 and 2018 to perform an
        early gastroscopy. In addition, patients must meet the following inclusion and exclusion
        criteria.

             bleeding.

          -  Patients who have undergone an early endoscopy to determine the source of bleeding.
