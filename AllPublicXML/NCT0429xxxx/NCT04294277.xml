  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the benefit of Pemigatinib, a drug that
      has indicated promising effects for relapse free survival in molecularly-selected, high-risk
      patients with urothelial carcinoma who have received radical surgery. Patients will receive
      Pemigatinib at a once-daily dose on a continuous schedule, continued until 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, Phase II study, evaluating safety and efficacy of
      INCB054828 (Pemigatinib) as adjuvant therapy for molecularly-selected, high-risk patients
      with urothelial carcinoma who have received radical surgery.Patients will receive Pemigatinib
      at a once-daily (QD) dose of 13.5 mg on a continuous schedule. Treatment will be continued
      until 12 months, or until the evidence of disease relapse or onset of unacceptable toxicity.

      Hyperphosphatemia can be managed with diet modification, phosphate binders, or dose
      modification. Since mineralization of the cornea and retinal changes consisting of serous
      retinal detachment have been reported in humans, ophthalmic exams are done at baseline and
      once every 12 weeks during treatment and should include a visual acuity test, slit-lamp
      examination and fundoscopy. Additional assessments (e.g. Orbital CT) should be done if
      clinically relevant retinal findings are observed on ophthalmologic exams and in participants
      with reported visual AEs or change in visual acuity, if the events or changes are suspected
      to be of retinal origin.

    <description>At Day 1, prior to the start of treatment, results from screening visit evaluations are reviewed to determine eligibility requirements. Subsequent visits during reatment phase will take place at Day 8, Day 15 and Day 21 and subsequently at 3 week intervals. Timing of subsequent visits can be prolonged to max. 9 week intervals if no problems exist during the first 12 weeks of therapy. Subjects will self-administer study drug using an oral QD regimen in a continuous dosing schedule. Each dose of Pemigatinib should be taken first thing in the morning upon waking or after a 2-hour fast; subjects should then fast for an additional 1 hour after taking study drug. The starting dose is 13.5 mg Pemigatinib. Study treatment will continue until 12 months, or until the evidence of disease relapse or onset of unacceptable toxicity.</description>
