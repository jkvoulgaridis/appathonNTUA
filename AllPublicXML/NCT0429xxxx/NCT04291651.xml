  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cysts are found incidentally on 15-50% of CT and MRIs for all indications and
      their prevalence is increasing. Many of these cysts may be precursors to pancreatic cancer,
      and thus pose a substantial risk, however, the vast majority are benign. Increased detection
      of pancreatic cysts provides an opportunity to diagnose pancreatic malignancy at an early,
      curable stage yet also increases the potential to over-treat clinically insignificant
      lesions. This presents a clinical challenge to prevent unnecessary resection of indolent
      disease, with associated risks of infections, bleeding, diabetes, and costly disability.
      Unfortunately, there is little information on the epidemiology and natural history of
      pancreatic cysts to help guide management. This study develops a large, prospectively
      managed, electronic, patient-directed pancreatic cyst registry based at UCSF using the
      NIH-funded Eureka Health platform. PANC Cyst will facilitate work to improve clinical care
      and understanding of pancreatic cysts by prospective follow-up of patients with cystic
      lesions, especially the diagnostically challenging small cysts, to identify factors related
      to cyst formation and progression to malignancy. Longitudinal data capture that includes
      clinical outcomes will also enable us to more precisely define anatomic, radiographic and
      biomarker information that can be used to differentiate populations of patients for whom
      surgery is indicated, surveillance is warranted, or no further evaluation is necessary.

      Patients in this study will have the option of donating blood for biobanking, approximately
      10cc of plasma and 10cc of serum. Patients will also have the opportunity to donate a saliva
      sample at the time of study registration, or at a later date.

      Further, samples that are routinely collected for diagnostic purposes may be collected and
      banked at the time of their clinically routine procedure. If a patient consents to the use of
      extra material for research purposes, the biological samples will be banked and the blood,
      and/or pancreatic juice/cystic fluid, tissues, and saliva will be used for identification and
      characterization of potential biomarkers from de-identified samples.

        The majority of patients in this study will be over the age of 60 years old, due to the
        natural age distribution of pancreatic cysts. There will be an approximately even
        distribution of males and females.
