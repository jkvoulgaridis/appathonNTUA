  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal has three aims to characterize the relationship between aspirin therapy,
      platelet function response, and prevention of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP)
      through a prospective, cohort study using pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
      pharmacogenomics and bioinformatics. The results of this proposal will provide necessary data
      for prospective study on individualized aspirin dose adjustment for prevention of HDP.

      This proposal has four aims to characterize the relationship between aspirin therapy,
      platelet function response, and prevention of HDP through a prospective, cohort study using
      pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics and bioinformatics. The results of this proposal will
      provide necessary data for prospective study on individualized aspirin dose adjustment for
      prevention of HDP.

      Aim 1: Establish pharmacodynamic endpoints for aspirin in prevention of HDP Hypothesis:
      PFA-100 closure time and serum thromboxane/urinary dehydrothromboxane-B2 (dTX-B2) are
      pharmacodynamic markers of aspirin response and are predictive of HDP high risk pregnant
      patients.

      Aim 2: Explore aspirin pharmacogenetics by assessing the relationship between platelet
      receptor genotype, aspirin response, and prevention of HDP Hypothesis: Platelet receptor
      genotype is associated with race and may result in reduced platelet response to aspirin
      therapy, and increased incidence of HDP.

      Aim 3: Assess the utility of circulating microRNA as a marker of aspirin response in
      pregnancy and risk of HDP Hypothesis: Quantitative expression of selected miRNAs are
      biomarkers for response to aspirin therapy and risk of HDP.

      Aim 4: Evaluate aspirin pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics Hypothesis: Individual factors
      influence aspirin pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and may impact individual dosing of
      aspirin
