  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caudal blockade (CB) is one of the most frequently performed regional anaesthetic techniques
      in children. It's an efficient way to offer perioperative analgesia for painful sub-umbilical
      interventions but with high incidence of motor block and urinary retention. In one study,
      psoas compartment block was associated with less morphine comsumption and prolonged duration
      of analgesia compared to single-shot caudal Block in small children undergoing open hip
      reduction/osteotomies. Ultasound guided anterior Quadratus lumborum block (AQLB) provides
      unilateral analgesia to the nerves between the psoas muscle (PM) and the quadratus lumborum
      muscle (QLM). The first pediatric study evaluating Quadratus lumborum block is encouraging .

      The first pediatric study evaluating Quadratus lumborum block is encouraging. To the best of
      the investigator's knowledge, there are no previously published data comparing the AQLB with
      other regional techniques in infants undergoing hip surgery.

      The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the analgesic effects between
      AQLB and CB in children undergoing unilateral open hip reduction/osteotomies for hip
      dislocation.

      Patients were randomly assigned, into 1 of 2 groups, namely, group CB (n = 20) and group AQLB
      (n = 20).

      Preoperatively all children were premedicated by using oral midazolam (0 .5mg/kg).

      anesthesia was induced with 3 to 4% sevoflurane and 50% with 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen.Then
      fentanyl 3 μg/kg and Propofol 1 - 2mg/Kg were administered for anesthesia induction. Airway
      was secured with endotracheal tube placed in the mouth facilited by 0.15 mg/kg cistracurium.
      Anesthesia maintenance was performed with sevoflurane 2% in 50% nitrous oxide.

      AQLB and CB were done with 1 ml/kg, 0.25% Ropivacaine (maximum dose limited to 20 ml)

      Postoperative follow-up:

      All patients received 15 mg/kg paracetamol before extubation. Tramadol 2 mg/kg intravenous
      was planned as rescue analgesia when CHEOPS score was more than 3. Supplemental IV tramado, 1
      mg/kg could be added if necessary every 6 hours.

The sacral hiatus is forming with the two posterior superior iliac spines an equilateral triangle. The puncture is performed between the two sacral cornuae. The sacrococcygeal ligament gives a perceptible 'pop' when crossed. After crossing the sacro-coccygeal ligament, the needle is redirected 30° to the skin surface, and then advanced a few millimeters into sacral canal. After verifying absence of spontaneous reflux of blood or cerebrospinal fluid, slowly injection of Ropivacaine 0.25% 1ml/ kg</description>

Patients were placed in the lateral position, a probe was placed transversely to the abdominal flank. The needle was inserted using an in-plane technique and was preceded further into the fascia between the QLM and PM. Following confirmation of the correct space with the administration of 0.5-1 ml local anesthetic, block was induced with 1 ml/kg, 0.25% Ropivacaine,</description>
