    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the most effective dose of light therapy to improve sleep in
      people with Parkinson's Disease. Four groups of participants will receive bright-white or
      dim-red light therapy at different times throughout the day.

             download (CPAP download) will be permitted;

          3. Co-existent symptomatic restless legs syndrome (RLS) (as assessed by the International
             Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICDS) diagnostic criteria for RLS) at screening;

          4. Cognitive impairment as determined by a Mini Mental State Examination score &lt;25 at
             screening;

          5. Presence of moderate depression defined as a Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)
             score ≥20 at screening;

          6. Current untreated hallucinations or psychosis (drug-induced or spontaneous) with a
             score of 2 or above on the Hallucinations and Psychosis question of the MDS-UPDRS Part
             2;

          7. Use of hypno-sedative drugs for sleep or stimulants, unless the participant has been
             on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to the screening;

          8. Ongoing or recent (within 30 days prior to screening) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
             Insomnia;

          9. Use of antidepressants, unless the participant has been on a stable dose for at least
             60 days prior to the screening;

             anticipated during the 16 weeks after screening;

         11. Travel between 3 or more time zones within 45 days prior to study screening or
             anticipated such travel during the 16 weeks after screening;

         12. Unstable or serious medical illness;

         13. History of significant eye trauma or disease, retinopathy, or cataract Grade 4 that
             would significantly affect transmission or processing of light through either eye;

         14. Current use, use at any time during study participation, or use within the 30 days
             prior to screening of photosensitizing or other medications that in the opinion of the
             investigator would interfere with the safety of the participant during the trial,
             including: amiodarone, porfimer, psoralens, chlorpromazine, quinidine, demeclocycline,
             temoporfin, tetracycline, fleroxacin, oral isoretinoin, voriconazole, nalidixic acid,
             thioridazine, St. John's wort, ofloxacin, and piroxicam;

         15. Pregnant women will be excluded from participation; if a participant is
             pre-menopausal, a urine pregnancy test will be conducted at randomization to determine
