    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure will be entered. Participants will be randomized to one of three
      study arms: Arm 1: Classical massage, Arm 2: Relaxation, Arm 3: Control Hypothesis: Classical
      Massage and Benson Muscle Relaxation will decrease frequency, severity, discomfort of
      symptoms and improve quality of life.

      Previous reports have revealed that classical massage and Benson relaxation exercise are
      promising for physiological parameters such as respiratory rate, pulse, blood pressure in
      heart failure patients. On the other hand, research examining effects of these approaches on
      physical symptom status that is including dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, chest pain, peripheral
      edema, sleep problems and dizziness and quality of life is limited. The present study
      investigates the effects of classical massage and Benson relaxation exercise in a
      single-site, 3-arm, randomized, controlled study of 96 patients with heart failure. Arm 1:
      Classical massage; Arm 2: Benson relaxation exercise; Arm 3: Control. The investigators
      hypothesize that Classical Massage and Benson relaxation exercise will decrease frequency,
      severity, discomfort of symptoms and improve quality of life.

    <description>During the first interview, a booklet explaining the introduction, purpose, benefits and application steps of hand-foot massage will be given to the patients in the classical massage group. Hand and foot massage will be applied to the patients for 30 minutes in the form of right hand five minutes, left hand five minutes, right foot ten minutes, left foot ten minutes, using liquid vaseline in each session twice a day in the patient's own bed with individual applied sessions by the researcher. Patients will receive a total of 14 sessions of classical massage, twice a day, for seven days.</description>

    <description>During the first interview, patients will be given a booklet explaining the description, purpose, benefits and application steps of the Benson relaxation exercise. With individual counseling sessions, a total of 14 sessions of Benson relaxation exercises will be performed in a quiet room, twice a day for seven days, each session lasting 20 minutes. At the beginning of the application, patients will focus on their breaths by taking slow and natural breaths with the researchers' commands and will quietly say to yourself the words of the focus, sound, sentence or prayer they choose, which are meaningful to them.</description>
