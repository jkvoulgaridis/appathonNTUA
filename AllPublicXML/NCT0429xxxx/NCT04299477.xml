  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory mediators in periodontitis may lead to elevated systemic cytokine levels,
      resulting in increased bone resorption including the jaws. Osteoporosis may have an influence
      on the periodontal condition of post-menopausal women and the risk for periodontal disease
      may increase due to osteoporosis. The hypothesis of the study was that non-surgical
      periodontal treatment and medical treatment of osteoporosis by bisphosphonates may improve
      the clinical outcomes and decrease salivary levels of IL-1β, IL-17, ALP and 8-OHdG.
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanism of bi-directional relationship
      between osteoporosis and periodontal diseases and to investigate the outcomes of non-surgical
      periodontal treatment with regard to salivary levels of IL-1β, IL-17, 8‐OHdG and ALP in
      patients with periodontitis and osteoporosis.

    <intervention_model_description>25 patients with periodontitis (P) and osteoporosis (group 1), 25 systemically healthy patients with P (group 2) and 25 systemically and periodontally healthy individuals (group 3) were enrolled in this study.
Individuals were periodontally examined at baseline, 1 month and 3 months following the non-surgical periodontal therapy.
Participants in group 1 and 2 received non-surgical periodontal therapy including supra- and subgingival scaling, and root planning.Patients were advised and instructed to perform oral care twice a day, use interdental toothbrushes once a day regularly. No scaling and root planning was performed in the group 3.</intervention_model_description>
