  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a meal is eaten, nutrients activate the release of hormones from the bowel into the
      blood stream. Normally there is a large amount of hormone released, which tells the brain
      that an individual is full and to stop eating. When people gain weight and become overweight
      or obese, these hormone signals are reduced, resulting in these people eating more and
      gaining more weight. This study is investigating mechanisms which may break this cycle by
      using particular nutrients to restore reduced hormone levels.
