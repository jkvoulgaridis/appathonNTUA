      Explore the clinical feasibility of using primary cell culture system to guide
      gastrointestinal cancer chemotherapy, and establish the correlation between ex vivo drug
      sensitivity and patient clinical response.

      Study objectives: Personalized drug sensitivity test for late stage,potentially operable
      gastrointestinal cancer using patient derived primary cell culture.

      Explore the clinical feasibility of using primary cell culture system to guide
      gastrointestinal cancer chemotherapy, and establish the correlation between ex vivo drug
      sensitivity and patient clinical response.

      The study will collect primary tumor tissues from stage III/IV gastrointestinal cancer
      patients who underwent emergency surgeries, and then establish the primary tumor cell library
      for ex vivo chemotherapy drug sensitivity test in order to:

        1. Compare the ex vivo Maximal Inhibition Index(MI) and Drug Sensitivity Index (DSI) with
           patient's Overall Response Rate (ORR)

        2. Provide research support for future clinical treatment.

      This ex vivo method applies to single or combination drug regimen, and does not require prior
      knowledge of the specific mechanism for individual patient's drug sensitivity. Previous
      research as well as literature studies support the close relationship between ex vivo drug
      sensitivity and in vivo drug response.

  <detailed_description>

      The patient underwent surgery to remove tumor and agreed to take out the abdominal tumor
      specimens for research. A section of each sample was removed for the generation of PDX models
      as described early.The rest of the tumor cells were expanded using ex vivo drug sensitivity
      assay.

      The drugs used in the study were 5-fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, and irinotecan at C0 = 10 mM,
      2.5 mM and 0.02 mM, respectively. They were applied either as single agents or in
      combinations of 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan, or all three
      agents, or others. After 7 days of treatment, the tumor cells were stained with EdU, Hoechst
      and EpCAM with the Cell Quantitative Detection Kit. Images were acquired with an automated
      microscopic image-scanning system and analyzed with the built-in software.
