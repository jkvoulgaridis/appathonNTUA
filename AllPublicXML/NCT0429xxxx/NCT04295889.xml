    <textblock>
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a worldwide major public health problem that is associated
      with an increased incidence of kidney failure and cardiovascular events, that lead a high
      burden for affected patients and high costs for society. Symptoms of CKD occur late, when
      kidney function drops to below 30%. At that time preventive measures will have only limited
      efficacy. Protein excretion in urine has increasingly been recognized as early marker of CKD,
      and is often associated with high blood pressure, diabetes, and/or high cholesterol levels.
      These are all important risk factors for progression of kidney and cardiovascular disease.
      Population screening for urinary protein loss could detect a considerable number of subjects
      with yet unknown risk factors for progressive kidney and cardiovascular disease who can
      benefit of early intervention. However, there is no validated method for population screening
      yet. We aim to develop a home based population screening for elevated urinary protein loss.
      We will investigate two screening methods, and evaluate their yield and cost-effectiveness.

      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide major public health problem that is associated
      with an increased incidence of kidney failure and cardiovascular disease (CVD). To tackle
      this burden, screening for CKD among the general population could be beneficial to allow
      early detection and treatment. In the last decades, elevated albuminuria has increasingly
      been recognized as an early marker of generalized vascular endothelial damage, that predicts
      CKD and CVD progression.

      It has been estimated that approximately 6% of the general population has elevated
      albuminuria, and that the majority of these subjects are not known yet with this abnormality.
      Among these subjects, many have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and/or impaired kidney
      function, that often is also not known yet. Early detection of elevated albuminuria may be
      important because it gives the opportunity to invite subjects that test positive for further
      screening for CKD and CVD risk factors. Thus these risk factors for CKD and CVD progression
      could be treated in an early stage.

      Population screening for albuminuria could be justified according to the WHO criteria of
      Wilson and Jungner , because CKD has important consequences for subjects, the course of the
      disease is initially symptomless, and there are treatment methods available. However,
      implementation research to validate screening the general population for albuminuria and
      related health consequences is lacking, as are cost-effectiveness studies.

      In the current study we aim to develop a home-based screening technique for detecting
      elevated albuminuria. We will investigate two screening methods, and evaluate their yield and
      cost-effectiveness.

    <description>The participation rate of the two screening methods is defined as the number of persons completing the albuminuria screening (i.e. returning the first PeeSpot urine device or scanned the first ACR | EU urine test strip with use of the app, and in case of an ACR &gt;30 mg/g in this initial test, also completing the a confirmatory albuminuria screening tests).</description>

    <measure>The yield of albuminuria screening.</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening period of 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>These are twofold. First, the positivity rate of the ACR tests (defined as the number of persons who tested positive for albuminuria (at least 2 out of 3 tests positive) relative to the number of persons participating in the corresponding arm (=per-protocol analysis) and of all invited persons in the corresponding arm (intention-to-screen analysis).
Second, the positivity rate of the elaborate screening, defined as the number of subjects with increased albuminuria (defined as ACR &gt;30 mg/g) with newly diagnosed and/or poorly controlled CVD and CKD risk factors. These risk factors, which will be assessed during the elaborate screening, include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, impaired kidney function.</description>
