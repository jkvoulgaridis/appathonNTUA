  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection leads to destruction of CD4+T cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue
      (GALT) and promotes a decline in mechanical barrier functions of the gut mucosa, and the
      subsequent translocation of microbial products from the gastrointestinal tract to systemic
      circulation. The gut mucosal immune system is not completely restored by cART, and the
      resultant microbial translocation may contribute to chronic inflammation, inadequate CD4
      T-cell recovery, and increased rates of serious non-AIDS events. Many studies have revealed
      strong and characteristic compositional differences in gut microbiota between individuals
      with HIV infection and seronegative controls. So far, several probiotic organisms have shown
      the ability to enhance intestinal epithelial barrier functions, reduce inflammation, and
      support effective Th-1 responses. Probiotics mainly stimulates polymeric IgA secretion, avoid
      bacterial overgrowth and their translocation, and produce a self-limited inflammatory
      response through development of regulatory T (Treg) cells by anti-inflammatory cytokine
      production. Therefore, we design a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study to determine whether the use of a probiotic can expand beneficial microbiota that aid
      in decreasing bacterial translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, thereby
      improving immune functions in HIV-infected subjects. Participants in the intervention group
      will receive oral probiotic containing 3 billion Bifidobacterium and 1 billion Lactobacillus
      once daily, while those in the placebo group will take placebo which contains no probiotic
      but has the same flavor and characteristics as the probiotic product.. Gut bacterial
      community diversity and composition, immune recovery and activation in peripheral plasma,
      plasma levels of gut damage, microbial translocation and inflammation at baseline and after
      12 months of receiving intervention will be analyzed.
