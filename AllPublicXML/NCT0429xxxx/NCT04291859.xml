    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women diagnosed with idiopathic PD (consistent with the UK PD Society Brain
             Bank Criteria for the Diagnosis of PD), Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging ≤4 in 'OFF'
             and ≤3 in 'ON' state and a Mini Mental State Examination Score &gt;26.

          -  Patients must currently have a good response to levodopa, and be receiving a stable
             dose of levodopa (&gt;3 doses per day of standard levodopa or &gt;3 doses per day of
             carbidopa and levodopa, or benserazide and levodopa, Extended-Release Capsules) for at
             least 4 weeks prior to screening. If the patient's response to Levodopa has not been
             previously documented in medical records, the patient will be submitted to a Levodopa
             challenge test while in practically defined OFF state prior to enrolment.

          -  Patients must experience recognizable and predictable motor fluctuations (with at
             least 1.5 hours of OFF-periods in the awake time, including predictable morning OFF
             episodes) causing clinically significant disability during the 4-week screening
             period. This will be documented during a defined period of 3 consecutive days prior to
             enrolment, using a patient diary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has or has had one or more of the following conditions that are considered
             clinically relevant in the context of the study; other neurological disorder,
             psychiatric disorder, seizure disorder or encephalopathy, respiratory disease, hepatic
             impairment or renal insufficiency, metabolic disorder, endocrinological disorder,
             haematological disorder, infectious disorder, any clinically significant immunological
             condition, elevated intra-ocular pressure or is at risk of acute narrow-angle glaucoma

        Other in- and exclusion criteria may apply
