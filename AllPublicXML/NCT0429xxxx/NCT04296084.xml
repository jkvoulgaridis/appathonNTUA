    <description>For kinematic analysis, MVN BIOMECH Awinda MTW2-3A7G6 sensors (Xsens Technologies B.V. Enschede, The Netherlands) were used. A Kalman filter (Xsens Kalman Filter, XKF) was used for 3D reconstruction of body segment position and orientation. IMU sensors were placed in accordance with the anatomical regions found in the directive issued by the International Biomechanics Association. Joint kinematic data of bilateral upper limb, lower limb and trunk were recorded with IMU sensors and wireless station. Xsens MVN Studio 4.6 was used to track IMU orientations according to the world-based coordinate framework. To make an effective analysis, gloves, vests and velcro were used to attach sensors to the extremities and body.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>GAITRite (CIR System INC. Clifton, NJ 07012) walkway system will be used. GAITRite; It is an electronic walkway which consists of portable carpet and sensors embedded on the carpet and transfers every foot contact to the computer when individuals walk on the carpet. With GAITRite, base of support (cm), velocity (cm / s) and cadence (steps / min) parameters will be evaluated.</description>
