    <textblock>
      Pablo is a new virtual reality (VR) game combined with wearable motion sensor system which
      can targeted intervention in an interactive environment, immediate and sensitive feedback
      about the user's performance, a motivating effect due to game-based feature. Unlike
      commercial camera systems such as Kinect or force platforms, the systems require a continuous
      sightline or restrict the base of support which may increase risk of falling. Few of studies
      had investigated the rehabilitation effects on balance with Pablo for patients with stroke.
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of virtual reality training through
      Pablo system in patients with chronic stroke.

      Pablo is a new virtual reality (VR) game combined with wearable motion sensor system which
      can targeted intervention in an interactive environment, immediate and sensitive feedback
      about the user's performance, a motivating effect due to game-based feature. Unlike
      commercial camera systems such as Kinect or force platforms, the systems require a continuous
      sightline or restrict the base of support which may increase risk of falling. Few of studies
      had investigated the rehabilitation effects on balance with Pablo for patients with stroke.

      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of virtual reality training
      through Pablo system in patients with chronic stroke.

      METHODS: Patients with mild to moderate motor deficits (N=38) participated 18 VR plus
      standard rehabilitation sessions or 18 standard therapy sessions. The performance was
      assessed for 2 times before and after therapy. The outcome measures included Berg Balance
      Scale, Functional Reach Test, and Timed Up and Go Test (cognition) for balance evaluations,
      Gait analysis for gait evaluation, Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale for balance
      confidence, and Stroke Impact Scale for quality of life. The pleasure scale and adverse
      events were also recorded after each training session. Collected data will be analyzed with
      sample T test by SPSS version 20.0, and alpha level was set at 0.05.

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 9 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional reach test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 9 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Reach Test (FRT) is a clinical outcome measure and assessment tool for ascertaining dynamic balance in one simple task. The patient is instructed to next to, but not touching, a wall and position the arm that is closer to the wall at 90 degrees of shoulder flexion with a closed fist. The assessor records the starting position at the 3rd metacarpal head on the yardstick.
Instruct the patient to &quot;Reach as far as you can forward without taking a step.&quot; The location of the 3rd metacarpal is recorded. Scores are determined by assessing the difference between the start and end position is the reach distance, usually measured in inches. Three trials are done and the average of the last two is noted.</description>

    <measure>Time up and go-cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 9 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>In the TUG-cog, patients were asked to complete the test while counting backward by 3 from a randomly selected number between 20 and 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 9 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Activities-specific balance confidence (ABC) scale is a subjective measure of confidence in performing various ambulatory activities without falling or experiencing a sense of unsteadiness. Participants estimate on a scale of 0% to 100% how confident they are that they could perform activities such as picking a slipper up off of the floor or walking on a slippery surface without losing their balance. The item scores are then summed and divided by 16 to provide an overall mean balance confidence score.Higher scores indicate higher confidence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale-physical domain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 9 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The stroke impact scale (SIS) is a stroke-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument, which was developed by Duncan et al. (1999) at the University of Kansas Medical Center, to measure the consequences of stroke in multiple domains, including physical (strength, hand function, activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADL, and mobility), emotion, memory/thinking, communication, and social participation. Where the score is the domain score for a particular domain, the mean is the mean of the nonmissing item scores within that domain, with each item scored in the range of 1 to 5. Using this algorithm, each domain score has a range of 0 to 100. Higher score indicate the higher health-related quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Every training session during 18 sessions, total sessions continued to 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to measure the enjoyment of physical activity. The original 18-item PACES scale was used to assess enjoyment. Respondents were asked to rate &quot;how you feel at the moment about the physical activity you have been doing&quot;using a 7-point bipolar rating scale. Higher PACES scores reflect greater levels of enjoyment</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse event times</measure>
    <time_frame>Every training session during 18 sessions, total sessions continued to 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to measure adverse event times, such as dizzy, pain, fall.</description>

    <description>18 virtual reality training through Pablo system (30 minutes a time, 2-3 times a week). Postural transition included sit-to-stand, sit down, reaching to different directions, stepping to different directions with weight transfer, and bending the trunk forward and side to side. The controller was attached to lower extremity or trunk to control the game, such as elevator, hot air balloon, shooting cans, etc.</description>

The rehabilitative protocol focus on strengthening, endurance training, ambulation, and ADL training that included: (1) Hip flexor and knee extensor strengthening with resistance progressing used by weight bag or Thera-band. (2) Cycle ergometer riding with increase speed and resistance. (3) Gait pattern and speed correcting through treadmill and parallel bar. (4) Hand functional training and strategy teaching for feeding, dressing, and toileting.</description>

    <description>18 balance training sessions (30 minutes a time, 2-3 times a week) (1) Facilitated the balance reaction through weight shifting exercise with standing on even surface to uneven surface, such as tilting board.(2) Postural transition included sit-to-stand, sit down, reaching to different directions, stepping to different directions with weight transfer, and bending the trunk forward and side to side. (3) Changed the standing requirement, such as single legged stance or lunge stance. (4) Increased perception complications through cognition or upper extremity task to improve dual task attention.</description>
