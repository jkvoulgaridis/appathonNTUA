  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at evaluating the feasibility and the efficacy of the Teen On-line Problem
      Solving program (TOPS) in improving executive functioning and behavior problems in
      adolescents aged 11-19 years with congenital or acquired brain damage.

      Participants with acquired brain injury constitute the control group, compared to the target
      group of adolescents with congenital brain injury.

      In order to control for placebo effects, participants of both the congenital brain injury
      group and the acquired brain injury group are randomized into two intervention conditions.
      Group 1 performs the regular version of the TOPS, while Group 2 performs a modified version
      containing no activities on executive functions, behavioral strategies and social skills.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with congenital or acquired brain injury often present with executive dysfunction
      and behavioral and social problems. Ad hoc rehabilitation may significantly ameliorate such
      difficulties. With this aim, the Teen On-line Problem-Solving program (TOPS) could represent
      a suitable opportunity of intervention, as it aims at helping children to improve executive
      and behavioral functioning. The program consists of a web-based platform composed of 20
      sessions, 10 core and 10 supplementary, providing information and activities on executive
      functioning, behavioral strategies, social skills and injury-related issues. The program is
      delivered remotely, with patients performing it at home, together with their families.
      Biweekly Skype sessions with a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist are scheduled along the
      entire duration of the intervention to monitor the real-life problem-solving process that
      patients are required to perform.

      Assessment of executive functions and behavioral problems is conducted before and after the
      training (immediate post training assessment at month 6 and follow-up assessment at month
      12), in order to investigate the presence of significant changes after the intervention. Both
      questionnaires and performance-based measures are used.

    <masking_description>Outcomes assessors and care providers are blinded with respect to participants' group assignment. Blinding is not possible for participants and investigators due to the intrinsic characteristics of the TOPS program. In this regard, the introduction of performance-based measures to conduct pre- and post-training assessment has been scheduled, in order to ensure better methodological procedures and enhance validity.</masking_description>

    <description>The SCL-90 is a self-report questionnaire aimed at measuring psychiatric symptom intensity on nine different subscales. The 90 items are scored on a five-point Likert scale (ranging from 0 to 4), indicating the rate of occurrence of the symptoms during the last 7 days. In this study the questionnaire is administered to parents to assess parental psychological distress, by considering the Global Severity Index (GSI). Raw scores of the GSI, which are calculated as the average score of the 90 items of the questionnaire, range from 0 to 360. The final score is reported as T score (M = 50 SD = 10). Higher scores indicate higher distress. Consistent with the recommendations of Derogatis (1994), a T score at or above 63 on the GSI indicates the clinical range.</description>

It is a performance-based assessment. Participants are asked to plan, set up and run a birthday party through the completion of 16 tasks resembling real-world activities. All tasks are scored on a 3-point scale: 0 for failure, 1 for a partial or nonoptimal completion, and 2 for satisfactory completion. The final raw score ranges from 0 to 32.
