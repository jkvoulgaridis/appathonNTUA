      Prospective clinical assessment of 40 Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) treatments in 10 completed
      stroke patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      10 patients having suffered a stroke and having being rehabilitated will be treated with 40
      consecutive Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT) after a minimal delay of 3 months after
      stroke. They will be neurologically assessed before and 3 months after HBOT. Rivermead
      mobility index will be also assessed.

    <measure>Change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline NIHSS Score at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological assessment before and after HBOT. Composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0 (0 is better).</description>

    <measure>Change in Rivermead mobility index (RMI) at 2 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline RMI at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mobility scale used in neurological rehabilitation. All items are rated in a yes/no format with positive responses scoring a 1 for a maximal RMI score of 15 (15 is better). Changes are evaluated every two weeks for a total of 8 weeks (every 10 sessions of HBOT), than after 1 and 3 months.</description>
