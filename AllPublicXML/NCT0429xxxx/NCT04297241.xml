  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of ISDN therapy to
      reduce venous congestion and improve exercise tolerance in children and adults after the
      Fontan operation. This will be accomplished by recruiting 15 Fontan physiology patients from
      the Cincinnati Children's Fontan clinic and University of Kentucky Pediatric Cardiology
      clinic for the investigation. The investigators will non-invasively measure both central
      venous pressures at rest and during graded cardiopulmonary exercise testing. In addition the
      study team will obtain a measurement of liver stiffness before and after a 4-week regimen of
      ISDN therapy. Patients will be seen twice in clinic, once before and after ISDN therapy, and
      phone calls will be made to ensure safety, compliance, and make appropriate alterations to
      medications throughout the study period. Pre- and post-intervention central venous pressure
      and exercise tolerance will be compared.

    <description>Potential adverse side effects of study medication (isosorbide dinitrate) will be monitored throughout study period. Study medication will be titrated to a maximal dose of 30mg dependent on the patient tolerance. Patient tolerance is defined by frequency of known risk factors to the study medication (headaches, hypotension, and syncope).</description>
