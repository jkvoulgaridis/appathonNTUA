  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) is a respiratory support for neonates with
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and represents the gold standard for RDS treatment in
      many Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). Respiratory supports providing Synchronized Nasal
      Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation may further enhance the success of non-invasive
      respiratory support.

      The most significant risk factor associated to NCPAP management is nasal trauma. Nasal
      injuries represent a source of pain and discomfort for infants. In some cases, they could
      become a site of infection and cause functional, cosmetic, long term outcomes as erythema or
      necrosis of the columella nasi.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of nursing interventions to reduce the
      incidence of pressure injuries during NCPAP support in infants admitted to NICU.

      It is hypothesized that implementation of some preventive interventions could improve nursing
      care quality and reduce nasal pressure injuries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies highlighted that nasal trauma, due to NCPAP support, is caused by the
      following risk factors:

        -  Very Low birth weight (&lt; 1500 g)

        -  Gestational age &lt; 32 weeks

        -  NCPAP duration &gt; 5 days

        -  NICU stay of &gt; 14 days

      However, previous studies results are mixed regarding factors affecting nasal injuries in
      neonates supported with NCPAP.

      Interventions indicated as protective are:

        -  Appropriate size of mask or nasal prongs and headbands

        -  Use of hydrocolloid as nasal barrier dressing

        -  A frequent alternation of the NCPAP device (nasal prongs or mask)

        -  A frequent assessment of skin integrity In this study a cohort of neonates (experimental
           group) will be prospectively enrolled and compared to a cohort of neonates born in 2018
           (retrospective group) with similar characteristics. The NICU clinical procedures for
           skin integrity are similar for both cohorts but the experimental group will receive them
           with different frequency and modality based on previously defined risk factors that each
           newborn present.

      Hence, aim of this study is:

      - To asses the effectiveness of specific nursing care interventions on the incidence of
      pressure injuries due to NCPAP support in neonates admitted to NICU.
