    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will evaluate the efficacy and related mechanism of probiotics
      and prebiotics as an add-on treatment in improving the antipsychotic induced psychotic
      syndrome, the cognitive impairment, gastrointestinal function, and metabolic disorders in
      schizophrenia patients, through genotype identification, psychopathology, neuropsychology,
      biochemical evaluation and other methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit 210 schizophrenia patients who meet the criteria of DSM-4, and then
      randomized to 3 groups: control group, probiotics group and prebiotics group for a 14-weeks
      clinical trail and 12-weeks follow-up period. In addition to probiotics, prebiotic or
      maltodextrin interventions, in the meantime, all participants will also use one of the
      prescribed antipsychotics medications. Clinical efficacy and safety assessment will be done
      at baseline, clinical trail and follow-up period. The specific aims are to evaluate these
      tips: 1) psychotic syndrome; 2) cognition; 3) Gastrointestinal function; 4) inflammatory and
      metabolic related markers. Psychotic syndrome will be measured by the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale. Cognitive function will be assessed by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive
      Battery. Gastrointestinal function will be assessed by gastrointestinal symptom assessment
      scale (GSRS). Biological samples also will be collected, and stored to research Intestinal
      inflammation, intestinal permeability, intestinal flora and other indicators.

    <description>The complete PANSS contains ratings for 30 symptoms, including 7 positive symptoms, 7 negative symptoms, and 16 general psychiatric symptoms. The clinical efficacy was evaluated by its score reduction rate, with the total score reduction rate ≥75% as recovery, 50% ~ 74% as significant improvement, 25% ~ 49% as improvement, and &lt;25% as invalid. improvement, significant improvement and recovery add up to apparent effect.</description>
