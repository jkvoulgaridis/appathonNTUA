  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. In atrial fibrillation, there is a
      risk that clots can form in the heart, especially in the left atrium. If these clots come
      loose, there is a risk of stroke. To prevent strokes, patients with atrial fibrillation and
      status post ICB can be treated with anticoagulants. This medication therapy prevents blood
      clots from forming in the heart, but can also cause bleeding. Another therapy option is the
      occlusion of the left atrium. After closure of the left atrium, only a short anticoagulation
      therapy is necessary until the occluder has healed. The aim of the study is to compare these
      two treatment approaches. In this study only already approved drugs and occlusion systems
      will be used.

    <textblock>
      Within the current trial, two novel strategies are tested in a randomized fashion in patients
      with atrial fibrillation and status post intracranial bleeding. Patients with ICH were
      usually excluded from the large NOAC trials and were also not representatively included in
      the large Watchman device trials. On the other hand, registries show that there is a
      significant proportion of patients with status post ICH that were implanted with a LAA
      closure device in clinical routine, and also there are those patients treated with NOAC due
      to their high stroke risk, despite the risk of recurrent ICH.

      Both therapies, NOAC and LAA closure are effective in preventing stroke in patients with AF
      at high risk for stroke. Also, for both therapies there is evidence for prevention of
      bleedings, especially intracranial bleeding events.

      Patients within the LAA closure group will have the chance after successful closure of the
      LAA to quit oral anticoagulation medication and therefore reduce their lifetime risk for
      bleeding and recurrent bleeding. Patients in the NOAC group are provided with an excellent
      protection against stroke and a significant reduced bleeding risk compared to Vitamin K
      antagonist therapy.

      The trial will help to develop data and hopefully guidelines for management of patients with
      AF and status post intracranial bleedings. It may help to give physicians data to therapy
      patients post ICH adequately and help to reduce mortality rates in those patients.

Death due to proximate cardiac cause e.g. myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, worsening heart failure, or endocarditis
Death caused by non-coronary, non-CNS vascular conditions such as: pulmonary embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm, dissecting aneurysm or other vascular disease

All procedure-related deaths including those related to a complication of the procedure or treatment for a complication of the procedure
Sudden or unwitnessed death defined as non-traumatic, unexpected fatal event occurring within one hour of the onset of symptoms in an apparently healthy subject. If death is not witness, the definition applies when the victim was in good health 24 hours before the event

    <description>Stroke (including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) - A stroke is an acute episode (lasting &gt;24 hours) of focal neurological dysfunction caused by brain, spinal cord, or retinal vascular injury as a result of hemorrhage or infarction. Strokes are characterized as follows:
Ischemic stroke: an acute episode of focal cerebral, spinal, or retinal dysfunction caused by infarction of the central nervous system tissue. Hemorrhage may be a consequence of ischemic stroke. In this situation, the stroke is an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation and not a hemorrhagic stroke.
Hemorrhagic stroke: an acute episode of focal or global cerebral or spinal dysfunction caused by intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or subarachnoid hemorrhage</description>

In the presence of atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease, diagnosis of embolism to the lower extremities should be made with caution and requires angiographic demonstration of abrupt arterial occlusion.</description>

    <description>LAA closure procedure will be done by experienced operators according to the local SOP. LAA closure will be performed under fluoroscopic and TEE guidance within conscious sedation or general anesthesia. Antibiotic single-shot prophylaxis should be administered peri-procedurally (i.e., cefazolin 2 g). The specific anatomy of the LAA is evaluated and an appropriately sized CE-marked device (WatchmanTM or Watchman FLXTM) is deployed. LAA angiography and TEE imaging is performed to identify optimal positioning of the device and to exclude a relevant leak. Following device deployment, patients will receive a therapy according to the manufacturers IFU, currently Aspirin and clopidogrel for 3 months followed by single Aspirin up to 12 months. Alternatively, 3 months of NOAC followed by Aspirin monotherapy up to 12 months are possible.</description>
