  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As technology advances, smartphones are now widely available and can provide a convenient and
      effective means to improve drug compliance by sending an electronic reminder on a regular
      basis. In a meta-analysis of 16 RCTs in assessing of drug compliance in chronic diseases,
      text message significantly improves medication compliance (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.52-2.93; P &lt;
      0.001). The drug compliance improves from 50% to 67.8%, or an absolute increase of 17.8%.
      Further evaluation is required as most of these RCTs relies on self-reported compliance. This
      data may be not applicable to pregnant women and trial of using this approach to improve drug
      compliance during pregnancy is lacking.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of smartphone message will improve the drug
      compliance in pregnant women requiring long term medications. The investigators propose a
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of smartphone message.
