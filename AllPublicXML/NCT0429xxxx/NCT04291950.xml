  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A key tenet of this project is that of reaching translational human diagnosis and biomarker
      end points. To lay a foundation and make progress towards these translational goals,
      investigators will address the following specific aim:

      To determine if BMI/ obesity differentially influence expression and epigenetic signatures in
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from Hispanic compared to NHW women.

      The intended goal of this Project is to develop epigenetic biomarkers to monitor the role of
      obesity and ethnicity on he development of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The proposed
      approach will seek to clarify for the first time if BMI is a biological factor that regulates
      aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression and epigenetic activity at breast cancer
      susceptibility and hormone receptor genes based on Hispanic or non-Hispanic white (NHW)
      ethnicity. If successful, the proposed experiments have the potential to highlight the role
      of overweight and obesity for dietary prevention of TNBC and to underscore the consideration
      of breast cancer screening among overweight/obese Hispanic women. Additionally, this study
      will provide the opportunity to begin testing the utility of AhR as a biomarker of TNBC
      development related to BMI and ethnicity.

    <description>DXA studies will be completed prior to surgery or port placement. Blood draws will be done in OR by research staff. Tissue will be obtained at the time of their definitive surgery or at the time of port placement. For women going to surgery first, four (4) 16-gauge core needle biopsies will be obtained by research staff after the tumor has been removed from the patient and the specimen is on the collection table in the OR.
For women who are getting neo-adjuvant therapy prior to surgery, the core needle biopsies will be collected at the time of port placement in the OR.</description>

For women who are getting neo-adjuvant therapy prior to surgery, the core needle biopsies will be collected at the time of port placement in the OR. The patient will be under light anesthesia for the port placement. Per standard care, we will also use local anesthetic for the needle core biopsy. Port placement requires ultrasound (US). We will take advantage of the US already available in the OR to guide the core needle biopsy. Within 30 minutes of procurement, the tissue from the biopsies will be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen by staff and taken to the lab.</description>

        he overall strategy for this pilot project is to collect breast tissue from 30 non-tumor
        (control) subjects and 30 TNBC patients. The women will be stratified by BMI (lean,
        overweight, obese) and ethnicity (Hispanic vs NHW). Race and ethnicity will be
        self-reported. Hispanic women can be of any race. Due to the Southwestern location of the
        University of Arizona (UA) and the regional demographics, we expect that approximately 90%
        of the Hispanic women recruited for this study will be White of Mexican/Mexican-American
        ancestry. However, eligible non-White, Hispanic or non-Hispanic, subjects will not be
        excluded.
