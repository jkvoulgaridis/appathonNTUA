    <textblock>
      Multidisciplinary experts from two Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs), used an iterative
      modified Delphi process to develop and refine criteria determining PICU patients for whom a
      family care conference would be beneficial. In this study the investigators will assess the
      reliability of the family care conference criteria by prospectively reviewing the medical
      records of two months of PICU patient admissions at both participating sites. The information
      obtained will also be used to further refine the PICU family care conference criteria as
      needed.

      Multidisciplinary experts from two Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs), used an iterative
      modified Delphi process to develop and refine criteria determining PICU patients for whom a
      family care conference would be beneficial. The investigators goal was to define a set of
      criteria that are highly sensitive (maximally inclusive) and reliable. The investigators have
      done a preliminary assessment of the criteria by retrospectively reviewing two months of PICU
      patient's medical records at the two participating sites. In this study the investigators
      assessed the reliability of the family care conference criteria by prospectively reviewing
      the medical records of two months of PICU patient admissions at both participating sites. The
      investigators will also use the information obtained to further refine the PICU family
      conference criteria as needed.

      Primary Aim: Determine reliability of criteria for determining which PICU families to offer a
      family care conference.

      Secondary Aim: Refine the PICU family care conference criteria

      Methods: Two people per patient will extract electronic health record (EHR) data for two
      months at the PICUs of the two participating sites to identify patients who met one of the
      family care conference criteria and patients for whom a family care conference occurredâ€”the
      latter determined by searching the entire EHR for the terms &quot;patient care conference&quot;, &quot;care
      conference&quot;, &quot;FC&quot;, &quot;family meeting&quot;, and &quot;meeting&quot;. The investigators will also extract the
      following patient data: age; sex; and indication for PICU admission. For patients meeting at
      least one of the family care conference criteria, but for whom a family care conference was
      not documented, a study team member will ask the patient's PICU team (either resident,
      fellow, APRN, PA, or attending) at the time of discharge if family care conference occurred
      while the patient was admitted. The goal of this effort is to identify family care
      conferences that occurred, but that were not documented in the EHR. The investigators will
      also identify patients who had a family care conferences but did not meet the criteria.

      Data analysis: The investigators will calculate a kappa statistic describing agreement
      between the two raters' determination of which patients met at least one of our family care
      conference criteria. The investigators will also look at kappa statistics by site and for
      individual criteria to determine what influenced the overall kappa score.

      Refining criteria. The study team will review and discuss criteria with a Kappa &lt; 0.7. The
      investigators will modify the criteria, definition, or process for accessing those criteria
      as needed. The teams will also discuss patients who had a family care conference but did not
      meet our preliminary criteria to identify common themes and consider modifications that would
      improve the inclusivity of our family care conference criteria.
