  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter prospective single arm phase II study. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficiency of Sintilimab combined with Chidamide in the treatment of
      relapsed/refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

      This is a single-arm phase 2 study with fixed does of combined Sintilimab and Chidamide
      regimen. This regimen is repeated every 21 days. Sintilimab (200mg) is administered
      intravenously on day 1 of every cycle. Chidamide is used 20mg twice per week continuously.
      From the beginning of the trial, sindilimab will be used for 96 weeks, until disease
      progress, intolerable toxicity or patient/investigator discretion. Patients will continue to
      receive Chidamide treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      patient/investigator discretion.

      The response will be evaluated every 2 cycles in the first 36 weeks and every 4 cycles from
      week 36 till the end of treatment. The patients who achieve complete remission (CR), partial
      remission (PR), and stable disease (SD) will receive further treatment. The patients with
      progressed disease (PD) will be continue on the treatment and reassess after 4-8 weeks to
      rule out false progression. On confirmation of PD , patients will be withdrawn from the trial
      and receive salvage regimens.
