        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,
        the protocol investigator, or a member of the research teams. If the investigator is a
        member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their patients' medical records for suitable
        research study participants and discuss the study and their potential for enrolling in the
        research study. Potential subjects contacted by their treating physician will be referred
        to the investigator/research staff of the study. The principal investigators may also
        screen the medical records of patients with whom they do not have a treatment relationship
        for the limited purpose of identifying patients who would be eligible to enroll in the
        study, and to record appropriate contact information in order to approach these patients
        regarding the possibility of enrolling in the study. Patients identified in this manner
        would subsequently be approached for study enrollment after consultation with their
        treating physician.
