      One mechanism to reduce potentially inappropriate medications is through deprescribing, a
      deimplementation-based approach to thoughtfully discontinue a medication a patient is
      currently prescribed. Many interventions to overcome deprescribing barriers target the
      provider, who is already overburdened. Although some believe providers have primary
      responsibility for deprescribing, patient-initiated discontinuation discussions can
      effectively facilitate deprescribing. In a single-site pilot study, the investigators
      successfully engaged VA Primary Care patients to facilitate deprescribing of select
      potentially inappropriate medications. The investigators now propose a multisite randomized
      controlled trial of engaging Veterans who may be deprescribing candidates. By study end, the
      investigators will have established the effectiveness of an innovative, low-tech,
      patient-focused intervention to promote deprescribing, thereby directly improving quality,
      safety, and value of VA care while also setting the stage for generalization of this approach
      to other potentially inappropriate medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background - Despite multiple provider- and system-level interventions to reduce potentially
      inappropriate medications (PIMs), many Veterans are still prescribed drugs that provide
      little benefit, placing them at unnecessary risk of adverse drug events (ADEs). One mechanism
      to reduce PIMs is through deprescribing, a de-implementation-based approach to thoughtfully
      discontinue a medication a patient is currently prescribed.

      Many Choosing Wisely recommendations address PIMs. Specifically, proton pump inhibitors
      (PPIs), a medicine used to reduce gastric acid, should be de-escalated to the lowest dose
      necessary to provide relief. Many older patients with diabetes are over-controlled, with
      blood sugar levels lower than recommended, yet remain on multiple diabetes medicines and may
      be able to use fewer medicines. These patients are also at higher risk of low blood sugar
      from insulin and sulfonylureas, and should have limited use of these agents.

      Finally, gabapentin is often used off-label to treat pain, with greatly increased use over
      the past several years. There are many barriers to deprescribing PIMs. Many interventions
      solely target the prescribing provider. Although some believe providers have primary
      responsibility for deprescribing, patient initiation of discontinuation conversations can
      effectively facilitate deprescribing. In a single-site pilot study, the investigators
      successfully reduced PIMs by engaging VA Primary Care patients by providing them with
      Veteran-centric EMPOWER (&quot;Eliminating Medications through Patient Ownership of End Results&quot;)
      brochures. However, it is not known if this approach will be as successful for Veterans with
      other chronic conditions or at non-pilot sites.

      Aims - The investigators propose three aims. 1) Examine the impact of a patient-centered
      intervention to change provider prescribing (the primary outcome), as determined by the
      frequency with which medications are either deprescribed or de-escalated. 2) Examine the
      effect of a patient-centered intervention on engaging patients, via post-visit surveys of
      Veterans' interaction with the brochures and their influence on deprescribing discussions and
      deprescribing. 3) Using qualitative methods, identify key organizational contextual factors
      related to intervention fidelity, feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness to support
      future implementation.

      Methods and Innovation - The investigators propose a multisite quasi-experimental trial using
      a Hybrid Type I Effectiveness-Implementation design of providing EMPOWER brochures directly
      to Veterans who may be deprescribing candidates for three cohorts of PIMs (PPIs, diabetes
      medications, and gabapentin). The investigators will mail brochures in advance of scheduled
      primary care visits, unlike distribution methods used in other studies. The primary outcome
      will be the composite of deprescribing and de-escalation of target medications, identified in
      pharmacy dispensing records of the Corporate Data Warehouse (Aim 1). Mail-based surveys sent
      after the scheduled primary care visit will assess patient engagement with the brochure and
      its impact on patient-provider communication (Aim 2). Finally, qualitative data from
      clinicians and staff addressing Proctor's Implementation Outcomes will provide the foundation
      for future implementation strategies (Aim 3).

      Significance and Next Steps - The study directly addresses multiple Veteran Care Priorities,
      including health care value, primary care practice, quality/safety, and Whole Health, and is
      aligned with current VA initiatives to prioritize patient preferences via
      individually-tailored, proactive care plans. The proposed work is strongly supported by
      Pharmacy Benefits Management and Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation,
      which will facilitate the dissemination of findings to improve the quality and safety of
      medication use within VA. By study end, the investigators will have established the
      effectiveness of an innovative, low-tech, patient-focused intervention to promote
      deprescribing of commonly used medications for three populations, thereby directly improving
      quality, safety, and value of VA care while also setting the stage for wider implementation
      and generalization of this approach to other potentially inappropriate medications.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will target Veterans at three primary care sites who meet eligibility criteria for one of the PIM cohorts and are prescribed the target medication at the time of their scheduled primary care visit. At each intervention site, individual PCPs will be randomized to the sequence of patient cohorts. The study will begin with a 13-month retrospective baseline period, with one month for baseline subject identification and 12 months for observation of baseline subjects' deprescribing outcomes. Then, each PCP will be randomized to the order of three 4-month periods during which their eligible patients receive medication-specific brochures, one medication cohort at a time. The primary comparisons are between &quot;brochure-intervention&quot; patients and &quot;baseline&quot; patients (matched in terms of eligibility) from the same provider.</intervention_model_description>

An exception to the de-escalation rule will be for insulin, where only complete cessation will qualify since dose changes are less likely to be reflected in the order compared to oral medications.</description>

    <description>An EMPOWER medication brochure, adapted to the VA, designed to educate and activate patients. These brochures provide detailed medication information, allow self-testing of indications for use, prompt reflection of experiences with potential side effects, discuss alternative therapies (medication and non-pharmacologic options), and provide a vignette of a patient who successfully stopped the medicine. They were designed for a 6th grade reading level and were based upon theories of patient activation, adult learning, and cognitive dissonance. The visually appealing brochure repeatedly emphasizes that patients should not make any medication changes without first consulting their health care providers.</description>
