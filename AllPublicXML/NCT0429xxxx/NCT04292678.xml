  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of patients with advanced cancer will be entered. Participants will be randomized
      to one of two study arms: Arm 1: Progressive muscle relaxation; Arm 2: Attention matched
      control. Hypothesis: Progressive muscle relaxation will decrease caregiving burden and
      severity of fatigue and improve quality of life.

      Previous reports have revealed that progressive muscle relaxation to use to decrease symptom
      burden associated with cancer. However, there have been limited studies that directly focus
      on supporting caregivers of advanced cancer patients who face serious problems in diagnosis
      and treatment process, at least as much as cancer patients. Besides, till date, no study has
      been conducted to determine the effects of progressive relaxation exercise on caregiver
      burden, fatigue and quality of life in those providing care for patients with advanced
      cancer. The present study investigates the effects of progressive muscle relaxation in a
      single-site, 2-arm, randomized, controlled study of 64 caregivers of patients with advanced
      cancer. Arm 1: relaxation; Arm 2: Attention matched control. The investigators hypothesize
      that progressive muscle relaxation will decrease severity of caregiver burden and fatigue and
      improve quality of life.

    <description>The progressive muscle relaxation intervention will last for 20 minutes and comprise sessions involving tensing and relaxing the body with deep breathing. The participants will perform progressive muscle relaxation for each body part in order, starting with the facial muscles and head, followed by neck, shoulders, chest, abdomen, legs, and feet; all muscle tension and relaxation procedures were performed accompanied with deep breathing. The participants will be instructed to tense a specified group of muscles for 5 s and relax it for 10 s while breathing out. Throughout this exercise, the participants will visualize a wave of relaxation flowing over their body using the deep-breathing technique.</description>
