  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study of 30 patients who are 8-21 years of age with venous
      thromboembolism (VTE)- either lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary
      embolism (PE).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be in three groups- those with lower extremity DVT, those with PE, or those
      with both lower extremity DVT and PE. Patients will have blood drawn for thrombin generation
      assay, thromboelastography assay, and thromboinflammatory panel in addition to standard of
      care labs for diagnosis of VTE and management of anticoagulation. The patients will then fill
      out questionnaires on quality of life and level of exercise at their first outpatient visit 4
      weeks after diagnosis. At approximately 3-6 months after diagnosis, patients will undergo two
      days of testing for the research study. All patients will have exercise testing using bicycle
      ergometry to measure global aerobic fitness. They will once again fill out questionnaires
      about their quality of life and level of physical activity. After a 24 hour rest period, DVT
      patients will undergo 31P-MR Spectroscopy and non-invasive spin labeling MRI to provide data
      on skeletal muscle bioenergetics (phosphocreatine metabolism), and lymphatic and venous flow
      respectively in the affected leg compared to the unaffected leg. This will allow each patient
      to be his or her own control. If initial imaging is obtained at 3 months, patients may be
      asked to undergo repeat imaging (MR spectroscopy and non-invasive spin labeling MRI) at 6
      months pending funding availability. After these research procedures, patients will continue
      to receive standard of care treatment for their VTE in the Bleeding and Thrombosis clinic.
