      Clinical performance of indirect adhesive restorations - onlays, overlays- luted with
      light-cured composite resin will be evaluated over three years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indirect adhesive restorations are indicated in large Class II defects, replacement of large
      compromised existing restorations or endodontically treated teeth where cuspal protection is
      required. The need to perform adhesive restorations of posterior teeth is not only linked to
      esthetic purposes, but also have possibility of strengthening the remaining tooth structure.
      Indirect technique decreases polymerization shrinkage, reduces microleakage and also improves
      the marginal seal when comparing direct resin composites. Furthermore, it provides improved
      physical and mechanical properties, ideal occlusal morphology, more precise control of
      proximal contours and contacts. Indirect adhesive restorations are classically delivered with
      an adhesive procedure including dual-cure cement. Updated approaches now include the use of
      composite resins as luting agent.

      This study will be carried out as a prospective study, with assessment of the restorations
      after three years. PASS 11 Software was used to calculate the sample size. At least 77
      indirect adhesive restorations will be included for this study. Patients referred to Istanbul
      Okan University Faculty of Dentistry between 2016-2017 who had returned for the baseline
      recall and at least one year recall after the treatment will be invited for eligibility to
      participate in the study. 83 indirect adhesive restorations in at least 60 patients will be
      included. The patients who will not meet all the inclusion criteria will be excluded from the
      study. A signed informed consent form will be obtained from all patients before beginning the
      study.

      Restorations will be evaluated clinically and radiographically according to FDI World Dental
      Federation criteria over 3-year period. Three main groups- esthetic, functional, biological
      properties- and their sub-categorizes of FDI World Dental Federation criteria will be scored
      on a scale of 1 to 5. Statistical analysis will be performed using R (v.3.5.3) Software and
      the SIGN.test function in the BSDA package (p &lt;0.05).

    <description>Restorations will be evaluated clinically using dental explorer, mirror, dental loupe and radiographically according to FDI World Dental Federation criteria over 3-year period. Two calibrated observers who are not involved in the placement of the restorations are responsible for the evaluations.
Esthetic properties: Surface lustre, surface staining, marginal staining, color match and translucency, esthetical anatomical form
Functional properties: Fracture of material and retention, marginal adaptation, occlusal contour and wear, approximal anatomical form, radiographic examination, patient's view.
Biological properties: Recurrence of caries, erosion, abfraction, tooth integrity, periodontal response, adjacent mucosa, oral and general health.</description>

    <description>Subjects for the study will be identified from patients who had treated with indirect adhesive restorations onlay or overlay during the period 2016 to 2017 was performed at Istanbul Okan University Faculty of Dentistry by an experienced clinician.
Local anesthesia was applied if necessary. After caries and/or failed restorations were removed, the preparations were performed according to defined principles for adhesive onlays/overlays. At least one cuspal coverage was required for each restoration. All undercuts were eliminated using composite resin. Following the cavity preparation, immediate dentin sealing was applied and polymerized prior to impression taking. Indirect restorations were designed and fabricated with CEREC system. Surface treatments and clinical protocols were performed under manufacturer's instructions. Adhesive cementation with composite resin procedure was carried out with the rubber-dam isolation.</description>
