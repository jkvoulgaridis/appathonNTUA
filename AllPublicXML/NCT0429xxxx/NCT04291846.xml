    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of high-fat diet on
      pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese adult subjects after oral administration of SHR1459
      tablets.

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of single dose of SHR1459
      orally in healthy subjects.

             range of 19 ~ 28kg /m2 (including 19 and 28) (BMI= weight (kg)/height 2 (m2));

          3. During screening period physical examination, vital signs, blood routine, urine
             routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation, abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray and other
             examination results must be within the normal range consistent with age and gender, or
             in accordance with the protocol, or judged to be &quot;no clinical significance (NCS)&quot; if
             beyond the normal range;

          4. The 12-lead ECG should be normal, with male QTcF &lt; 430ms and female QTcF &lt; 450ms; QTc
             interval is corrected by Fridericia formula (QTcF = QT/(RR^0.33), RR is the
             standardized heart rate value, calculated by dividing heart rate by 60);

             entry);

          7. The subject can communicate well with the researcher, understand and comply with the

             and the corresponding regulations;

         13. Subjects refused to stop using any beverage or food containing methyl xanthine, such
             as coffee, tea, cola, chocolate, etc. from 48 hours before the first administration
             until the end of the study;

         14. Subjects refused to stop using any drink or food containing grapefruit 7 days before
             the first dose until the end of the study;

         15. Difficulty in venous blood collection or inability to tolerate venipuncture;

         16. Other factors (including but not limited to inability to understand the requirements
             of the study, poor compliance, physical weakness, etc.) that are not suitable for
             participating in the study, as judged by the researcher.
