      Postoperative ileus (POI) is a transient loss of coordinated peristalsis precipitated by
      surgery and exacerbated by opioid pain medication.So,how to provide patients with ideal
      analgesia without affecting the recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal function?This was
      a prospective randomized controlled study. A total of 105 patients who were scheduled for
      laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomly selected from The First Affiliated Hospital with
      Nanjing Medical University by random number table. These patients were randomly divided into
      three groups: fentanyl(F) group, oxycodone(O) group and butorphanol(B) group.

      Background: Patients often experience pain after gynecological laparoscopy. However, the use
      of opioid analgesia after surgery may increase the incidence of postoperative ileus (POI).
      Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common surgical emergency after a surgical procedure, leading
      to infection and intestinal adhesions, which can extend hospitalization and increase
      readmission rates, and consequently increasing healthcare costs. How to provide patients with
      ideal analgesia without affecting the recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal function?
      There is no guideline which has been troubling clinical anesthesiologists.

      Aims: To observe the effects of fentanyl, oxycodone, Butorphanol on the recovery of
      gastrointestinal function after laparoscopic hysterectomy.

      Methods: A total of 105 patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomly divided
      to three groups: fentanyl group(group F), butorphanol group(group B), or oxycodone
      group(group O). The primary outcome measures were postoperative time to first anal exhaust
      the total analgesic doses in PCIA,effective bolus times. Patients were also assessed for pain
      with a visual analogue scale (VAS), the cumulative PCIA dose, adverse effects
      (Nausea,vomiting, bradycardia, respiratory depression and pruritus), sedation level at 4, 12,
      24, and 48 hours postoperatively, and satisfaction during the postoperative 48 hours and
      postoperative hospitalization days.
