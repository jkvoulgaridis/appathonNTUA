  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia is a popular anesthetic method in patients who will undergo an inguinal
      hernia operation. Researchers known that pain in the operating area is a complaint that
      impairs the quality of life for patients in the long term after the operation. In addition to
      regional anesthesia, has planned to investigate the effects of applying another drug near the
      surgery area on pain that may develop in the long term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative chronic pain can be defined as the neuropathic-characterized pain persisting
      at least 3 months after the surgery despite healing of the operation area.

      However, it is still uncertain if the underlying physio-pathologic mechanism is due to
      intraoperative direct nerve injury or it is resulting from indirect nerve injury caused by
      inflammatory mesh. Post-operative chronic pain restricts the daily activities, causes anxiety
      and depression, increases use of analgesics and imposes a serious economic burden by
      increased use of health services and medical treatment. For this reason, today post-operative
      chronic pain is considered as an important complication of surgery. Researchers can list the
      risk factors of pain development as; age, weight, preoperative and postoperative pain,
      surgical method, recurrence, anesthesia method. Various oral non-steroid and/or opioid agents
      have been used in chronic pain treatment but nowadays interest in regional anesthesia
      approaches is increasing due to increased systemic side effects. Aim in this study is to
      evaluate the effects of postoperative ilioinguinal block implementation on chronic pain in
      patients who will undergo inguinal hernia operation with spinal anesthesia.

    <intervention_model_description>60 ASA I-III patients between ages 18-65 who underwent single-sided inguinal hernia operation were randomly classified into two groups in the operating room as; Group I (n:30); spinal block (SA), Group 2 (n:30); SA and ilioinguinal block (IHNB). All patients were given SA in sitting position and 3ml 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine was injected in sterile conditions with 25 G injection in L3-4, L4-5 subarachnoid space. Times when the block reached T10 level were recorded. Ultrasoundguided ilioinguinal block was implemented and 10 ml 5% bupivacaine was injected to patients in group I with peripheric nerve block injection in the reanimation unit after the surgery.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The presence of pain that may occur in the 3rd and 6th months can be learned by contacting patients by phone. The Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) is a neuropathic pain scale. In LANSS follow-ups, 12 points or more were associated with neuropathic pain.</description>
