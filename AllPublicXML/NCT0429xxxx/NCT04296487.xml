      -  Prospective and interventional study

        -  All procedures are carried out after obtaining informed written consent from patients.

        -  Study procedures involve a biopsy, cell production, cell implantation and follow-up
           including a strict post-surgery rehabilitation protocol (12 month timepoint)

        -  All subjects will be assessed at intervals post-implantation (6 weeks, 3 months, 6
           months and 12 months).

        -  Measures to assess effectiveness and safety will be conducted at follow-ups: Magnetic
           Resonance Imaging (MOCART score), collection of adverse events, orthopaedic scores
           (KOOS, IKDC, SF12v2)

    <measure>Absence of infection after implantation.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Absence of infection is assessed in blood sample by the quantification of three parameters: C-reactive Protein (CRP), neutrophil and lymphocyte rate. The non-infection is characterised by a CRP rate &lt; 10 mg/L, neutrophil rate ranges from 40-75% and lymphocyte rate ranges from 25-40%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported function and knee-related quality of life are assessed by using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 months post-implantation.</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS includes five subscales: symptoms, pain, activities of daily living, function in sport/recreation, and knee-related quality of life. A score in points for each subscale will be calculated, and it ranges from 0 (worst score) to 100 (best score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported physical pain and function are assessed by International Knee Documentation Committee score (IKDC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 months post-implantation</time_frame>
    <description>A score will be calculated, and it ranges from 0 (worst score) to 100 (best score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported functional health and weel-being as assessed by SF12 Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 months post-implantation</time_frame>
    <description>SF12 survey includes 2 subscales: mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summery (PCS). A score in points for each subscale will be calculated, and it ranges from 0 (worst score) to 100 (best score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The cartilage repair is assesed by Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scoring system.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to12 months post-implantation</time_frame>
    <description>MOCART scoring system is based on MRI analysis. A score in points will be calculated, and it ranges from 0 points (no repair) to 100 points (excellent cartilage defect repair)</description>
