  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adductor canal block (ACB) is a peripheral nerve blockade technique that provides good pain
      control in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) which however does not relieve
      posterior knee pain. The recent technique of an ultrasound-guided local anesthetic
      infiltration of the interspace between popliteal artery and the capsule of posterior knee
      (IPACK) has shown promising results in providing significant posterior knee analgesia without
      affecting the motor nerves. The hypothesis was that the combination of ACB + IPACK will
      provide better pain relief and improve knee function in the immediate postoperative period
      compared to ACB alone.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized and double blinded study

      All patients received :

        -  Pregabalin 150 mg preoperatively 12 h before the surgery.

        -  Single-shot spinal anesthesia with 10 to 12 mg of bupivacaine 0.5% and 2.5ug sufentanil
           patients were randomly allocated to receive:

        -  Group 1: IPACK + ACB single shoot

        -  Group 2: contineous ACB For group 1: IPACK was realized after spinal anesthesia with 40
           ml ropivacaine 0.2% All patients received ACB in the immediate postoperative period with
           20 ml ropivacaine 0.2%

      Post operative analgesia included:

        -  Paracetamol 1g IV every 6 hours

        -  Diclofenac sodium (50mg) 1 tablet x 2 per day

        -  Pregabalin 150 mg given orally once daily for a period of 4 weeks.

        -  PCA morphine (Patient Controlled Analgesia), as a rescue analgesia,

        -  Continuous ACB catheter for 48H with :

           4 ml per hour 0.2% ropivacaine in group 2 4 ml per hour saline in group 1

    <description>ACB was done in the immediate postoperative period under a high-frequency ultrasound guidance in which the adductor canal was identified beneath the sartorius muscle and 20 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine was injected in the canal using a 22-gauge 100-mm short-beveled regional block needle and a catheter was kept for 48H with 4 ml/h ropivacaine 0.2%.</description>

    <description>IPACK was realized after spinal anesthesia. Patient was placed in a supine position and knee placed in position of 90° flexion. A low-frequency ultrasound probe was positioned in the popliteal crease, and the needle was inserted from medial aspect of the knee from anteromedial to posterolateral direction in a plane between the popliteal artery and the femur. The tip of the needle was placed 1-2 cm beyond the lateral edge of the artery, and 20 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine was injected for each side.
A ACB was done postoperatively with 20 ml ropivacaine 0.2% and a catheter was kept for 48H with 4 ml/h saline</description>
