  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our prior studies demonstrated that dehydration was a predictor for poor outcome in stroke
      and Blood urea nitrogen/Cr ratio-based saline hydration therapy in patients with acute
      ischemic stroke may increase the rate of favorable clinical outcome with functional
      independence at 3 months after stroke. However, dehydration is likely to be only a part of
      representation in poor nutrition status and physical fragility for a stroke patient.

      Our prior study found that acute stroke patients admitted to neurological intensive care unit
      with low urinary creatinine excretion rate (CER), a marker of muscle mass, was associated
      with poor outcome at 6 months after stroke. An animal study suggested inadequate food and
      water intake determine mortality following stroke in mice and nutritional support reduced the
      14-day mortality rate from 59% to 15%. A study also showed that high protein intake was
      associated with a better outcome in previous cardiovascular events.

      We will calculate CER based on published equation. Based on our prior study, acute stroke
      patients with their CER＜1500 mg/day will be enrolled. A randomized controlled trial will be
      conducted and patients will be randomly assigned to high protein diet or normal protein diet
      for at least 2 weeks. We plan to enroll 300 patients, with 150 patients in ach group, during
      3-year study period. We will consult dietitians for arrangement of their diet. We assume that
      patients receiving high protein diet will have higher opportunity to walk independently
      (modified Rankin Scale 0-1) at 3 month after stroke.
