  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective analgesia is very important in terms of preventing respiratory, thromboembolic
      complications and providing early mobilization after open thoracotomy.

      Although thoracic epidural analgesia is gold standart method for this aim, it causes common
      side effects such as hypotension, dural puncture,motor block In recent years, with the
      effective use of ultrasonography, different regional anesthesia methods have been developed
      to prevent such complications

      complications and providing early mobilization after open thoracotomy.

      Although thoracic epidural analgesia is gold standart method for this aim, it causes common

      effective use of ultrasonography, different regional anesthesia methods have been developed
      to prevent such complications.

      The Erector spinae plan block is a recently developed regional block method .Adminestering of
      lokal anesthetic between the transver proces and erector spinae muscless provides the dorsal
      and ventral branch blokades of regional spinal nerve and make up the analgesia.İt have a wide
      range usage such as surgery of thoracal and abdominal area (Thoracothomy,hysterectomy,Lomber
      surgery) Rhombid block, on the other hand, is a method which make up analgesia by providing
      lokal anestethetic enjection between intercostal muscles and rhomboid muscles and blocks
      between t3- t9 levels
