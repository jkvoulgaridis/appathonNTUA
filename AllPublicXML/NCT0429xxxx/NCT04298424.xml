  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients have the deficiency of motivation and confidence in self-management that are
      mainly influenced by physiological function, social psychology, emotion and low health
      literacy, resulting in poor self-management and glycemic control. According to the study,
      elderly patients can learn the skill of self-management more effectively through the peer
      leaders who have the same culture background, the life experience in disease care and the
      successful self-management experiences. The Self-Management Program of diabetes for the
      elderly will be in progress with the peer leadership concept.( the Peer-Led Self-Management
      Program). The aim of the pilot study was to explore the feasibility and effects of the
      Peer-Led Self-Management Program (PLSM).

      This pilot study uses two groups of block randomized controlled trials with pretest and
      posttest study. The test group will conduct a four-week Peer-Led Self-Management Program and
      the general outpatient care while the control group will implement the general outpatient
      care. In this study, the physiological parameters of Diabetes were used to evaluate the
      difference between the pre-and post-intervention measures.

      Most current self-management programs are developed for implementation by healthcare
      professionals. These professionals cannot fully perceive disease management needs and
      obstacles of older adults due to a lack of similar illness experience. To develop a
      self-management training program for older adult peer leaders with diabetes and to assess its
      feasibility.

      This study was conducted in three stages. In stage 1, the peer leader training program was
      developed using experiential learning theory as the framework and self-regulation theory as
      the strategy for activity design. The 4-week training program was implemented for 4
      hours/week. In stage 2, the feasibility of the training program was assessed. A peer leader
      training assessment tool was developed and used to evaluate peer leaders' leadership skills
      for self-management programs. Peer leaders' attendance rate and their viewpoints toward the
      training program through qualitative interview, willingness to lead self-management programs
      for older adults with diabetes in the community in the future were also assessed. In stage 3,
      This pilot study will take elderly diabetic patients in a community health station in Taiwan.
      The program will be conducted by peer leaders who have completed training to lead elderly
      diabetic patients and promote interaction, sharing, and support among peers. Improve
      self-confidence by guiding elderly diabetic patients to reflect on past self-management
      challenges and share successful self-management experiences. At the same time, learn how to
      find self-management problems, set goals and develop action plans, and other strategies to
      help elderly patients with diabetes set goals for their own health problems, develop and
      implement self-suitable, feasible and sustainable self-management behaviors to strengthen
      Self-management skills for elderly diabetic patients. The 4-week program was implemented for
      2 hours/week.

    <description>The program was designed for implementation over 4 consecutive weeks, with groups of 6-8 people each attending one 60-90-minute class per week. Peer leaders lead the groups to promote interaction, sharing, and support, and assist in goal setting to address behavior-related health problems, and thereby the development and implementation of strategies to achieve suitable, sustainable, and feasible self-management behavior.</description>
