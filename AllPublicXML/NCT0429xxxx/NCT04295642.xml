  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be a 2-part, adaptive, open label, single and/or multiple oral dose, safety,
      tolerability, food effect trial of CVL-751 in subjects with Parkinson's disease. Part 1 is a
      placebo-controlled, single dose cohort intended for assessment of safety and tolerability. In
      case of intolerable AEs, Part 2 would proceed as a multiple dose titration trial to achieve a
      15 mg once daily dose while maintaining L-Dopa treatment (Part 2A). In case of a favorable
      tolerability profile in Part 1, Part 2B would proceed as a single dose trial (similar to Part
      1), with discontinuation of L-Dopa for 24 hours (12 hours pre-Day 1 dose and 12 hours
      post-Day 1 dose).

             medications, or products that, in the investigator's documented opinion, do not signal
             a clinical condition that would impact the safety of the subject or interpretation of
             the trial results may continue evaluation for the trial following consultation and
             approval by the medical monitor.

             findings unless, based on the investigator's judgment, the findings are not medically
             significant and would not impact the safety of the subjects or the interpretation of
             the trial results. The medical monitor should be contacted to discuss individual
             cases, as needed.

             Tests with exclusionary results should be repeated to ensure reproducibility of the
             abnormality before excluding a subject based on criteria provided in the protocol. For
             ECGs, three consecutive recordings are required and if two of the three remain
             exclusionary, then the subject is not eligible for the trial.

         25. Any subject who, in the opinion of the sponsor, investigator, or medical monitor,
             should not participate in the trial.

         26. Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct
             of the trial and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
