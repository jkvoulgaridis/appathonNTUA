  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative emergence delirium (ED) is a severe postoperative complication in paediatric
      anaesthesia. ED is defined as a state with psychomotor disturbance, perception disorder and
      state of excitation and anxiety. The incidence of ED in paediatric patients can be up to 80%.
      ED is associated with the increased morbidity of paediatric patients in the postoperative
      period. One of the potential triggers of ED is sevoflurane. Currently, there are only limited
      data about comparing the influence of anesthesiologic management on the ED incidence. The
      possible ED reduction could lead to reduced stay in a post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU),
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) incidence and the overall reduction of the
      postoperative adverse events incidence together with the higher satisfaction and the patients
      and the legal guardians.

      This prospective randomized interventional single-blind study aims to compare the influence
      of the anaesthesiology management no the incidence of ED in the postoperative period in
      paediatric patients. Elective paediatric patients (2-10 years) scheduled for the planned
      adenoidectomy or adenoidectomy + micro-otoscopy/adenoidectomy + frenulum linguae discission
      will be included in the trial after signed informed consent form the legal guardian. In all
      patients, the 2 Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) patch will be applied on the
      predefined skin area ( visible vein for venepuncture) between 45 minutes to 60 minutes before
      anaesthesia. The patients will be randomized at the operating theatre (allocation 1:1) into
      the experimental group (intravenous induction with propofol + opioid and anaesthesia
      maintenance according to this set bispectral index value with desflurane) and the control
      group (inhalation induction with sevoflurane mixed with air and oxygen and anaesthesia
      maintenance with sevoflurane). The primary aim of the study will be the incidence of ED
      defined by The Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale, which will be measured
      at the , at the admission to PACU and in the 5th, 10th, 15th, 30th minute and at the moment
      of dismission from PACU. The secondary aim will be the time to oral intake (from the end of
      the surgery), the incidence of adverse events (PONV, bradycardia, hypotension), the need for
      concomitant medication (analgesic medication, sedative medication, antiemetic medication).
