    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of ticagrelor vs placebo for the reduction
      of Vaso-Occlusive crises in paediatric patients with Sickle Cell Disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  HESTIA5 will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ticagrelor versus placebo
           in children with SICKLE CELL DISEASE during treatment for at least 12 months and up to a
           maximum of 24 months.

        -  The target population are children (males and females) aged 6 months to &lt;18 years and
           body weight ≥6 kg diagnosed with homozygous sickle cell or sickle beta-zero-thalassaemia
           confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography or hemoglobin electrophoresis. The
           aim is to randomise 20 patients in the age group 6 to &lt;24 months. At least 50 patients
           should be randomised in each of the age groups: ≥2 to &lt;12 years and ≥12 to &lt;18 years.

        -  Prior to randomisation in this study, patients aged 6 to &lt;24 months will undergo a
           14-day Run in period in which they will receive open-label ticagrelor twice a day for 14
           days according to weight. Run-in period includes 4 visits, called R1, R2, R3 and R4. The
           run-In period is to ensure that the treatment is well-tolerated, and that the exposure
           is in line with model-based predictions following repeated twice a day dosing with
           ticagrelor in this age group. At the end of the Run-in period (Visit R4), the patient
           will take his/her final dose of open-label IP and await the independent Data Monitoring
           Committee chairman's evaluation of tolerability, safety and exposure before being
           eligible to enter the Screening period for randomisation. Patients who complete the
           Run-in period according to the protocol must also meet all the inclusion/exclusion
           criteria detailed in Protocol, to proceed to randomisation.

        -  To be eligible for the study, patients must have experienced at least 2 VASO-OCCLUSIVE
           CRISES (defined as painful crisis and/or ACUTE CHEST SYNDROME) events in the past 12
           months prior to Visit 1, (patients aged 2 to &lt;18 years) and prior to visit R1 (patients
           aged 6 to &lt;24 months) indicating that the severity of the patient's disease justifies
           preventive chronic long-term treatment. Even if painful VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES are
           uncommon in infants and become more frequent in older children, data show that symptoms
           like dactylitis precede more severe events and confirm that children who have early
           dactylitis are more likely to have severe events later in life.

        -  Study participants should receive standard of care for SICKLE CELL DISEASE, adjusted to
           the individual patient at the discretion of the investigator, including routine health
           care screening examinations and immunizations to local guidelines and health care
           programmes. Study drug will be given on the background of standard treatments for SICKLE
           CELL DISEASE. Study participants are not withheld from any other treatments that may be
           used in SICKLE CELL DISEASE (eg., hydroxyurea) during the trial, which is important
           considering the use of a placebo control group. However, restrictions apply to some
           medications and interventions that may be necessary for the patient's health and
           well-being during the study.

        -  Patients are to be followed until a common study end date (CSED) is reached defined as
           12 months after the last patient is randomized. Treatment duration is at least 12 months
           for study participants, and patients will continue on treatment until 12 months after
           last randomized patient or up to a maximum of 24 months. The expected average follow-up
           is 18 months, assuming a uniformly distributed enrolment period of 12 months.
           Considering inclusion of patients with at least 2 VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES in the past
           year, this treatment duration is considered long enough to evaluate effects on
           VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES events as well as to capture safety and tolerability data
           supporting a potential future long term use of ticagrelor.

        -  Due to ticagrelor mechanism of action and the potential to reduce symptoms caused by
           ischemia during a vaso-occlusion, a composite endpoint with painful crises and/or ACUTE
           CHEST SYNDROME has been selected for the primary endpoint. Painful crisis is the most
           common reason for emergency department visits for patients with SICKLE CELL DISEASE with
           a significant impact on young patients' lives, affecting them physically and
           emotionally. Secondary endpoints are included to broaden the understanding of effects in
           patients with SICKLE CELL DISEASE and to also assess potential benefits on symptomatic
           disease burden and health-related quality of life (HRQL).

        -  Patients will be treated with 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 mg twice a day or matching placebo,
           depending on body weight.

    <description>Vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) defined as the composite of a painful crisis and/or an Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) . Each component is defined as:
A painful crisis is an onset or worsening of pain that lasts at least 2 hours, for which there is no explanation other than vaso-occlusion and which requires therapy with oral or parenteral opioids, parenteral NSAIDs, or other analgesics prescribed by a health care provider in a medical setting (such as a hospital, clinic or emergency room visit) or at home.
An ACS is an acute illness characterized by fever and/or respiratory symptoms, accompanied by a new pulmonary infiltrate on a chest X-ray.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent prior to any study specific procedures
             not part of standard medical care (local regulations and international guidelines are
             to be followed in determining the assent/consent requirements for children).

          2. Children aged 6 months to &lt;18 years of age and body weight ≥6 kg diagnosed with HbSS
             or HbS/β0 as confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or haemoglobin
             electrophoresis.

          3. Have experienced at least 2 VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES (painful crisis and/or ACUTE CHEST
             SYNDROME) as judged by the Investigator in the past 12 months prior to Visit R1
             (patients aged 6 to &lt;24 months) or Visit 1 (patients aged 2 to &lt;18 years). These
             VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES need to be documented in the patient's medical records or in
             other documents that can be reconciled.

          4. If aged 2 to ≤16 years, must have had a TCD within the past year prior to Visit 2. If
             this is not the case, a TCD examination must be done before randomisation.

          5. If aged ≥10 years, must have had an ophthalmological examination within the past year
             prior to Visit 1. If this is not the case, the patient must be examined by an
             ophthalmologist before proceeding in the study. If local guidelines dictate
             ophthalmological examination at younger ages, those local guidelines should be
             followed.

          6. If treated with hydroxyurea or L-glutamine, the weight-adjusted dose must be stable
             for 3 months before screening.

          7. Suitable venous access for the study-related blood sampling.

          8. Prior to dosing on day of randomisation (Visit 2), a negative urine (dipstick)
             pregnancy test performed at Enrolment (Visit 1) and at Visit 2 must be available for
             female patients of childbearing potential.

          9. Females of childbearing potential (after menarche) must not become pregnant during the
             study. Sexually active females must use a highly effective method of contraception
             which results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year). If use of effective
             contraception cannot be secured in sexually active females, the patient cannot be
             included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of unsuitability which in the
             Investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the
             study.

          2. History of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (ischaemic or
             haemorrhagic), severe head trauma, intracranial haemorrhage, intracranial neoplasm,
             arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, or proliferative retinopathy.

          3. Findings on TCD: Current or previous values for time averaged mean of the maximum
             velocity (TAMMV) that are Conditional or Abnormal. Patients with Conditional TAMMV
             values or higher (≥153 cm/sec using TCD imaging technique [TCDi] which is
             corresponding to ≥170 cm/sec by the non-imaging technique). Both the middle cerebral
             artery and the internal carotid artery should be considered. Any other criteria that
             would locally be considered as TCD indications for chronic transfusion would also
             exclude the patient.

          4. Pathological finding on any other imaging assay indicating increased risk for
             intracerebral bleeding or thromboembolism.

          5. International normalised ratio (INR) &gt;1.4 or active pathological bleeding or increased
             risk of bleeding complications according to Investigator.

          6. Haemoglobin &lt;6 g/dL from test performed at Visit R1 and Visit 1 (patients aged 6 to
             &lt;24 months) or at Enrolment (Visit 1) (patients aged 2 to &lt;18 years).

          7. Platelets &lt;100 × 109/L from test performed at Visit R1 and Visit 1 (patients aged 6 to
             &lt;24 months) or at Enrolment (Visit 1) (patients aged 2 to &lt;18 years).

          8. Undergoing treatment with chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy.

          9. Chronic use of NSAIDs defined as continuous intake &gt;3 days per week that cannot be
             discontinued.

         10. Receiving chronic treatment with anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs that cannot be
             discontinued.

         11. Moderate or severe hepatic impairment defined as laboratory values of alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2×upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin &gt;2×ULN (unless
             judged by the Investigator to be caused by haemolysis), albumin &lt;35 g/L (3.5 g/dL) and
             INR &gt;1.4, or symptoms of liver disease (eg, ascites) from test performed at Visit R1
             and Visit 1 (patients aged 6 to &lt;24 months) or at Enrolment (Visit 1) (patients aged 2
             to &lt;18 years).

         12. Renal failure requiring dialysis.

         13. Patient considered to be at risk of bradycardic events (eg, known sick sinus syndrome
             or second- or third-degree atrioventricular block) unless already treated with a
             permanent pacemaker.

         14. Concomitant oral or intravenous therapy with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)
             inhibitors, CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, or strong CYP3A
             inducers, which cannot be stopped at least 5 half-lives before randomisation.

         15. Active untreated malaria. Patients with suspected malaria at Visit R1 (patients aged 6
             to &lt;24 months) or at Enrolment (Visit 1) (patients aged 2 to &lt;18 years) will be
             tested.

         16. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to ticagrelor.

         17. Patients who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant
             during the study or have given birth less than 3 months prior to Enrolment (Visit 1).

         18. Concern for the inability of the patient or caregiver (defined as legally authorised
             representative) to comply with study procedures and/or follow-up.

         19. Previous randomisation in the present study or participation in any previous HESTIA
             study.

         20. Participation in another clinical study with an IP or device during the last 30 days
             preceding screening.

         21. Involvement of member of patient's family, or patient self, in the planning and/or
             conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study
