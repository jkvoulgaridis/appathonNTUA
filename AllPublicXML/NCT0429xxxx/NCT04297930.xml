    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of lowering intraocular pressure and
      safety profile of the Paul Glaucoma Implant (Advanced Ophthalmic Innovations, Singapore).
      This is a non-comparative and single-arm observational study and all the participants were
      recruited between 1 Dec 2017 and 1 Dec 2018. Patients between age 21 - 80 years with glaucoma
      and an IOP deemed poorly controlled by the study team despite on maximal tolerated medical
      therapy were included in this study. The participants were recruited from 6 tertiary
      ophthalmology centers including National University Hospital, Singapore, Moorfields Eye
      Hospital, United Kingdom, St Thomas' Hospital, United Kingdom, Chulalongkorn University and
      Hospital, Thailand, International Specialist Eye Centre, Malaysia and Chinese University of
      Hong Kong, Hong Kong. All the eyes were followed-up for a period of 12 months after surgery.
      The examination and investigations included best corrected Snellen visual acuity, slit lamp
      examination, goldman applanation tonometry (GAT), dilated fundus examination and optic nerve
      head imaging. The participants are reviewed before surgery, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, three
      months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery. All the data were captured in a standardized
      data-collection form for analysis. The primary outcome measure was failure, if was
      prospectively defined as IOP more than 21mmHg or less than a 20% reduction compared to
      pre-operative baseline on 2 consecutive visits after 3 months, IOP less than 6 mmHg on 2
      consecutive visits after 3 months, reoperation for IOP-related indication, loss of light
      perception vision, or removal of the implant for any reason. Intraocular pressure outcomes,
      number of IOP-lowering medications and the rate of surgical complications were secondary
      outcome measures in this study.

    <description>Complete success was defined as IOP less than or equal to 21 mmHg and more than 5 mmHg, IOP reduced by more than or equal to 20% from baseline and medications were not used at either the 6 or 12 month visits
Qualified success is similarly defined but with the use of IOP-lowering medications. In addition, we also provided success rates based on alternative upper limit of IOP at 18 and 15 mmHg</description>
