  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be the first clinical study of oral administration SMP-100 in healthy subjects. The
      proposed randomized Phase 1 trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple
      ascending dose study in approximately 72 healthy male and female subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SMP-100 is a novel serotonin receptor 3 (5-HT3) partial agonist which has been designed to be
      a safe and effective therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients .

      This will be a single center, Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized,
      sequential single ascending dose (SAD)/ multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and PK of SMP-100 in healthy adult male and female subjects. The study
      will be divided into two parts:

      Part A: SAD cohorts Part A will consist of 6 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level) of 8 subjects
      (6 subjects receiving the study drug and 2 receiving matching placebo), for a total of 48
      subjects. Each subject will participate in only one cohort. Efforts will be made to randomize
      at least 3 subjects of each gender in each cohort.

      Part B: MAD cohorts Part B will consist of 3 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level) of 8 subjects.
      Six subjects will receive study drug and 2 subjects will receive matching placebo, daily for
      14 consecutive days, for a total of 24 subjects (18 study drug; 6 placebo). Each study
      subject will participate in only one cohort. Efforts will be made to randomize at least 3
      subjects of each gender in each cohort.

      For both Part A and Part B, subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study after
      dosing, for reasons other than safety and tolerability, may be replaced after consultation
      between the Safety Review Committee (SRC) members. The total number of subjects dosed
      (including potential replacement subjects) will remain within a maximum of 10 subjects per
      cohort.
