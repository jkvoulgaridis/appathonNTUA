  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive condition of the central nervous system caused by
      immature brain damage before, during or after birth. Persons affected by CP experience
      disability of various types. In individuals with CP, one of the most frequent symptoms is
      limited hand function. Other issues that often occur are muscle weakness, spasticity and
      problems with balance.

      Injection with Botulinum Toxin A (BoNT-A) is common treatment for spasticity in patients with
      injury in central nervous system, e.g. traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injuries
      and CP.The main goal of the project is to explore if motion controlled video game treatment
      alone or in combination with injection treatment with BoNT-A lead to improvement of hand
      function, activity and participation in adults with CP.

      In the project, the investigators will evaluate if these two interventions improve balance in
      adults with CP.

      Participants will be psychologically tested in the beginning and the end of the project to
      evaluate if interventions can have positive effect on psychological symptoms such as
      depression and anxiety, The project is multidisciplinary. It involves a doctor, a nurse, an
      occupational therapist, a physiotherapist and a psychologist. The team will in ordinary
      clinical practice examine participants. Individual goals will be set up in agreement with
      each participant. The goals will be measurable, achievable and time bound. By reviewing scope
      of agreed goals, the investigators will be able to summarize most frequent problems that CP
      patients experience in their daily life.

      There will be 25 participants in the study and they will be followed for 9 months. During
      every visit the team will examine participants, perform relevant tests and obtain objective
      and subjective outcomes. It will be assessed to what degree the goals have been achieved.

      The investigators also want to evaluate long term effects of the two intervention applied in
      the study. Therefore, the participants will be finally assessed 3 months after last
      intervention period.

      Based on study results, implications for future treatment volume and organization of the
      rehabilitation for persons with spasticity will be discussed with the participating units,
      hospitals, municipalities and policy makers. Professionals included in this project are also
      clinicians and will have an important role in ensuring that the findings are included in
      clinical guidelines and educational activities.

    <intervention_model_description>The single subject design was chosen due to its sensitivity to individual differences which is a relevant feature when studying heterogenous population as adults with spastic CP. The study is a multiple-treatment design with two intervention phases, an ABACAA design. The study include a baseline assessment phase (A1), a three-month intervention phase with motion controlled video game training (B), post-intervention assessment (A2), a second three-month intervention phase with Motion Controlled Video Game (MCVG) treatment and BoNT-A treatment (C) including an assessment in the middle when BoNT-A usually have its peak (6 weeks after application) (A3), post-intervention assessment three months after application of BoNT-A (A4) and a follow-up assessment 9 months after beginning of first intervention (A5). All participants will be medically examined and assessed with functional measures in all assessment phases. The timeframe from baseline to follow-up is approximately 9 months.</intervention_model_description>

The participants are recommended to train 30 minutes each day, 4 days a week, during the training periods. It is expected that the amount of training will vary among the participants. Thus, each participant will be instructed to keep a training-diary and weekly report number of hours played/trained through an online reporting system created with &quot;online form&quot;, an electronic data collection system available through the University of Oslo</description>
