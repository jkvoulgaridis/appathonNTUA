  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is the most common single-gene disease in the world. Its prevalence is
      increasing in France, with patients' life expectancy increasing into developed countries. It
      mainly affects populations originating from sub-Saharan Africa. Among the chronic bone
      complications associated with sickle cell disease, osteoporosis has previously been
      highlighted but remains a poorly known complication in this very particular context. A
      dedicated evaluation of osteoporosis and associated risk factors in sickle cell disease
      patients living in France may enable better bone management of these patients in the future,
      as this problem, specific to their disease, is likely to become more frequent as their life
      expectancy increases.

      This is a prospective interventional and monocentric study whose objective is to describe the
      prevalence of osteoporosis in black patients with sickle cell disease in France
