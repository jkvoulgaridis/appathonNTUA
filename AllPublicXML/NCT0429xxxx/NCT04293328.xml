  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The one-year prospective study aims at investigating frequently replacement effect on myopia
      control in young children, and the use of weekly protein removal system in monthly
      replacement modality orthokeratology lenses on surface deposit.

    <textblock>
      In this one-year prospective study, low myopic children, aged 6-8 years, who have no prior
      experience in contact lens wear and myopia control treatment will be recruited. They will be
      prescribed with monthly replacement orthokeratology lenses for a period of one year. Axial
      elongation and ocular conditions during the study will be determined. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to normal cleaning and intensive cleaning groups. Subjects in normal
      cleaning group will be provided with complimentary contact lenses solutions for daily
      cleaning and disinfection. In addition to the daily procedures for lens case, subjects in the
      intensive cleaning group will be required to perform weekly protein removal.

    <description>Menicon Progent A+B is a commercially available protein remover for rigid lenses. It has received FDA clearance and been launched in Hong Kong for over a decade. The product contains two separate sterile solutions, one with sodium hypochlorite and the other with potassium bromide. By mixing the two solutions in a special vial, it can clean and remove protein deposits on the lenses. Parents of subjects assigned to use weekly protein remover will be required to soak the cleansed lenses in the solution mixture for not more than 30 mins every week. All lenses must be rinsed thoroughly with saline and cleansed with daily cleaner again before daily disinfection.</description>
