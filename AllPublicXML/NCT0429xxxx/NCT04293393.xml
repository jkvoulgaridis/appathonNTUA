      Phase II, randomized, open-label, international, multicenter study to compare efficacy of
      standard chemotherapy vs. letrozole plus abemaciclib as neoadjuvant therapy in
      HR-positive/HER2-negative high/intermediate risk breast cancer patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II study in the
      neoadjuvant setting.

      Approximately 200 premenopausal and postmenopausal women with Hormone Receptor
      (HR)-positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative Breast Cancer (BC) of
      intermediate/high risk determined by Ki67 index ≥ 20% on untreated breast tissue and
      centrally assessed, with indication of neoadjuvant treatment, will be included. Patients with
      Early Breast Cancer (EBC) on stages II-III (tumor size (T) &gt; 2cm - T3, T4b, and lymph node
      involvement (N) N0-2) according to the 8th edition of the Union for International Cancer
      Control (UICC) TNM Classification. The subgroup with tumors T2 N0 will include high risk
      patients based on Ki67 index &gt; 30% or Ki67 index between 20% and 30% and Progesterone
      Receptor (PgR) negative and/or histological grade 3.

      Patients will be stratified according to the disease stage (II vs. III), menopausal status
      (premenopausal vs. postmenopausal) and Ki67 index (Ki67 &lt; 30% vs. Ki67 ≥ 30%).

      Once the screening process (locally at site and at the central laboratory) is completed,
      fully eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the control arm with standard
      Chemotherapy (CT) based on anthracyclines and taxanes or to the experimental arm with
      letrozole + abemaciclib.

      All patients will be treated according to the stipulations below, unless any of the following
      occur: unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease, or withdrawal of informed consent,
      whatever occurs first.

      After the last dose of any of the drugs in the neoadjuvant combinations, in both treatment
      arms definitive surgery will be performed. For Arm A not earlier than 21 days and not later
      than 42 days after the last dose of chemotherapy, and for Arm B within 7 days from the last
      dose of abemaciclib and/or letrozole, unless toxicities are not recovered completely in any
      treatment arm.

    <description>Evaluation of the number of patients with a Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) 0-I index as a measure of efficacy. RCB is a continuous variable derived from the primary tumor dimensions, cellularity of the tumor bed, and axillary nodal burden. It is estimated from routine pathological sections of the primary breast tumor site and the regional lymph nodes after the completion of Neoadjuvant therapy. The pathological variables include bidimensional diameters of the primary tumor bed, the proportion of primary tumor area containing invasive carcinoma, the number of positive lymph nodes, and the diameter of the largest nodal metastasis</description>

               -  Age &lt; 60 years and amenorrhea for 12 or more months (in the absence of
                  chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene or ovarian suppression) and
                  Folliculostimulating hormone (FSH) and plasma estradiol are in the postmenopausal
                  ranges per local normal ranges.

             All women who do not meet the criteria for postmenopausal status are considered
             premenopausal for the purpose of this trial.

         13. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1.

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 (100x109/L);

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 8g/dL (80g/L) (erythrocyte transfusions are permitted; initial
                  treatment must not begin earlier than the day after the erythrocyte transfusion);

               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) (≤ 2x ULN and direct
                  bilirubin within normal limits if Gilbert´s disease);

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3x ULN.

         16. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% measured by multiple-gated acquisition
             scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO).

         17. For premenopausal women: agreement to remain abstinent or use single or combined
             non-hormonal contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year
             during the treatment period and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of study
             treatment. Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception. Examples of non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt;
             1% per year include tubal ligation, male sterilization, and certain intrauterine
             devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a
             cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year. Barrier
             methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.

         18. Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of the first dose of abemaciclib for
             premenopausal women, and for women who have experienced menopause onset &lt; 12 months
             prior to first dose of therapy.

         19. Patients consent to biological sample provision for biomarker exploratory analyses.

         20. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory
             tests and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

             not allowed.

          2. Inflammatory breast cancer, multifocal/multicentric breast cancer with ≥ 3 tumor
             lesions or synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancers are not eligible.

          3. Serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example,
             interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe
             renal impairment [e.g. estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30ml/min], history of major
             surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's
             disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline
             Grade 2 or higher diarrhea).

          4. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase
             deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption.

          6. Active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous [IV] antibiotics at time of
             initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection (such as
             known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known active hepatitis B or C
             [for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive]. Screening is not required for
             enrollment.

          7. Personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of cardiovascular
             etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited
             to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest.

          8. Diagnosis of any other malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization, except for
             adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix or colorectal.

          9. Prior hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.

         10. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
