  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of patient knowledge about ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) is a leading cause of
      treatment fear with 60% of ECT patients reporting high levels of anxiety.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if using Virtual Reality (VR) to allow patients' to
      experience a virtual ECT education session before treatment is useful in lowering treatment
      anxiety and increasing knowledge about ECT if compared to standard treatment. In addition,
      measuring heart rate and blood pressure levels before ECT treatment will allow us to assess
      changes in anxiety levels.

      Individuals who choose to participate will be placed (participant will have a 50% chance to
      be placed in either group) to view either a virtual reality video to experience a virtual ECT
      session, or to receive standard preparation, i.e. a discussion with a psychiatrist. Before
      and after this session participants will be asked to complete a measurement of their anxiety
      level and knowledge about ECT (ECT Attitude &amp; Knowledge Questionnaire). Just before ECT
      treatment, blood pressure, heart rate and anxiety level will be measured. Participants will
      also complete cognitive and depression assessments.

      This study will help to develop a relationship between healthcare providers and patients and
      their families to help with education before ECT treatment.
