  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, observational, multicentre study evaluates the existence of Post-traumatic
      stress disorder following a stroke at 3 and 6 months after the management of the patient.

      Questionnaires will be used to assess the presence of stroke post traumatic disorder.

      The evaluation of stroke post traumatic disorder would allow to underline the importance of
      the awareness of the care teams in the the screening of these disorders and to evaluate if
      the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (PCL5) is an effective screening tool.

    <description>Evaluate the number of patients managed for stroke and presenting Stroke Post Traumatic Disorder at 3 months after stroke. This evaluation will be made by completion of PCL-5 questionnaire (Post-traumatic stress disorder checklist version DSM-5 (DSM:Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel of Mental Disorders)). A PCL-5 positive score will be an indicator of post-traumatic stress disorder correlated with stroke.</description>

    <description>Evaluate the number of patients presenting a depressive state at 3 months after stroke. This evaluation was done by completion of HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) questionnaire.
