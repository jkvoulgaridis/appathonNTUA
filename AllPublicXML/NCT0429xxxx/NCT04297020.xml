  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endocrine therapy (ET) is widely used to treat hormone receptor positive breast cancer and
      prevent recurrence by downregulating estrogen function. However, ETs readily cross the blood
      brain barrier and interfere with the action of estrogen in the brain. Estrogen supports
      cognition and menopausal status is closely linked to cognitive health in women. This has
      raised concern that anti-estrogen ETs may affect cognition and brain health in breast cancer
      survivors. However, evidence across existing studies is inconsistent and these effects remain
      poorly understood. The incomplete understanding of the effects of ET are likely due to
      limitations of earlier studies - namely, the under-appreciation of the role of menopausal
      status and insensitivity of standard cognitive measures. This research project will address
      these earlier limitations by specifically comparing ET effects by menopausal status, and
      using highly sensitive, task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures to
      assess the effects of ET on brain function.

      using highly sensitive, task-related fMRI measures to assess the effects of ET on brain
      function.

      This study is a cross-sectional study in a 2x2 factorial design comparing menopausal status
      (pre and post) and patient group (breast cancer survivors on ET and healthy controls matched
      on age, race, education, and time since final menstrual period (post only)). The
      investigators will use sensitive fMRI measures of brain activity during a working memory task
      - measures successfully used to reveal the effects of menopause and estrogen changes in
      healthy women, but yet to be extensively used to study the effects of ET.
