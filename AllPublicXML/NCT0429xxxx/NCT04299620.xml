  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the ability of micro-ultrasound to detect and characterize prostate cancer
      tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (removal of the entire prostate and some
      of the tissue around it). Usually multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is used for the
      detection and targeted therapy of prostate cancer, but its accuracy remains imperfect.
      Micro-ultrasound may be superior as it provides real-time tumor visualization which may
      simplify and improve prostate cancer targeted therapy. This may also reduce the need for and
      substantial costs of radical prostatectomy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine if micro-ultrasound (US) can be used to identify prostate cancer foci with
      equivalent (non-inferior) performance relative to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging
      (mpMRI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine if micro-US can be used to contour prostate cancer foci with equivalent
      (non-inferior) accuracy to mpMRI.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine if ex vivo micro-US images have quality comparable to in vivo micro-US images.

      QUATERNARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine if micro-US can be used to evaluate suspicion of extracapsular extension (ECE)
      with equivalent (non-inferior) accuracy to mpMRI.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients may undergo transrectal micro-ultrasound scan (TRUS) prior to standard-of-care
      radical prostatectomy. Following radical prostatectomy, removed glands are scanned and
      micro-US, standard of care mpMRI, and whole mount images are analyzed and compared.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of prostate cancer foci</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be evaluated by comparing sensitivity and positive predictive value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and micro-ultrasound (US) for identification of prostate cancer (CaP) foci.
Measurement tool = chi squared test</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Contours of prostate cancer foci</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>evaluated by measuring the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distances (Hd) between micro-ultrasound (US) and whole mount (WM) tumor contours, and between mpMRI and WM tumor contours. The difference between tumor diameter and volume will be computed between WM and mpMRI, and between WM and US. All measures will then be used to compare accuracy of US versus mpMRI.
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests:
Signed rank tests are nonparametric matched pair tests, here mostly used to compare correlation of mpMRI and WM v. correlation of US and WM. Minimum and maximum input values will depend on the metric being tested; min and max output values will vary between zero and one. A higher output indicates less difference in performance between mpMRI and US. A lower score indicates that more a difference between mpMRI and US. Whether a lower score is a better outcome or worse outcome depends on which modality (mpMRI vs US) is more strongly correlated with WM.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Ex vivo and in vivo micro-US images</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in in vivo versus ex vivo image quality will be evaluated by testing for systematic differences in tumor contouring accuracy. The measures will be identical to those listed under &quot;secondary outcome measures&quot; above, but for comparison between ex vivo micro ultrasound and in vivo micro ultrasound (instead of MRI).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Suspicion of extracapsular extension (ECE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Micro ultrasound and mpMRI ECE suspicion scores will be compared for ECE-positive tumors. Micro ultrasound and mpMRI ECE suspicion scores will also be compared for ECE-negative tumors.
Measurement tool(s) = Wilcoxon signed-rank test and one-sided non-inferiority t-test.
Notes on the use of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests: (see outcome 2 description above)</description>
