  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the impact of augmenting exercise intensity and
      augmenting exercise frequency on peak work rate. Participants will complete exercise tests
      and provide 8 skeletal muscle samples following a within-subjects randomized crossover design
      utilizing single-leg cycling. Both training periods will be 4 weeks long and skeletal muscle
      biopsies will be collected from both legs before and after each training period. All exercise
      sessions will be supervised, take place in the investigator's laboratory, and occur on
      stationary bikes.
