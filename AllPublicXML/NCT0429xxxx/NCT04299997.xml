  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interpretation of prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is difficult and requires
      expertise. As a result, it suffers from substantial inter-reader variability. The so-called
      Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scoring system has been launched in 2012
      to try and standardise prostate mpMRI interpretation. It is a 5-level score that assesses the
      likelihood that suspicious focal prostatic lesions seen on mpMRI are clinically significant
      prostate cancers. Despite the use of semi-objective criteria for each category of the score,
      the inter-reader reproducibility of the first two versions (PI-RADS v1 launched in 2012 and
      PI-RADS v2 launched in 2015) was moderate at best, even for experienced readers. The last
      version (PI-RADS v2.1) has been launched in March 2019 in an effort to improve the
      inter-reader reproducibility. This version has not been evaluated yet.

      The purpose of our study is to evaluate the accuracy and inter-reader reproducibility of the
      PI-RADS v2.1 score on a large set of 163 prostate MRIs using 20 readers of varying
      experience.

      Twenty readers (14 seniors and 6 juniors) from 7 different institutions and with varying
      experience in prostate mpMRI accepted to participate to the study.

      Reader will assess the dataset independently and will be blinded to the other readers'
      results. They also be blinded to clinical and biochemical data.

    <measure>AUC of the PI-RADS v2.1 score for predicting ISUP ≥2 cancer at subsequent biopsy at the lobe level.</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2020.</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis at the lobe level will be favored for two reasons
Per-lesion analysis is debatable because targeted biopsy may miss their target; in addition, only lesions seen at prospective reading of the mpMRIs were targeted. The &quot;additional targets&quot; will not be taken into account at per-lesion analysis
Per-patient lesion is also debatable since it regards as true positives patients with large spatial discordances between the location of a given lesion and the presence of cancer at biopsy.</description>

    <measure>Analysis of the diagnostic value of the PI-RADS v2.1 components</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2020</time_frame>
    <description>The PI-RADS v2.1 score is made by several components who have different diagnostic weights. The added value of the following components will be assessed:
Lesions DCE+: do they correspond more often to ISUP ≥2 cancers than DCE- lesions?
Lesions with DWI score of 4: is a size of 10-14 mm more predictive of ISUP ≥2 cancers than a size &lt; 10 mm?
Lesions with a T2w score of 2 and a DWI score of 4 in the PI-RADS v2.1 score: what is the proportion of ISUP ≥2 cancers?</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Added value of the Likert score</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2020</time_frame>
    <description>- This part will be only exploratory and narrative. It is aimed at evaluating, at least for the most experienced readers, if there are circumstances in which the Likert score (i.e. &quot;gut feeling&quot;) is more predictive of ISUP ≥2 cancers than the PI-RADS v2.1 score.</description>

    <measure>AUC of the PI-RADS v2 and v2.1 for predicting the diagnosis of ISUP≥2 cancer after 3 years of follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2020</time_frame>
    <description>Because targeted and systematic biopsy may miss cancer foci, follow-up data will be retrieved from the patients files. Patients with no follow-up data within the last year will be reached by phone to update their follow-up.</description>

    <description>Ass of targeted suspect lesions
On each mpMRI,radiologist will contour lesions that were targeted at subsequent biopsy based on reports. Contours will be disclosed to readers who will assess,for each lesion:
Likert score(&quot;gut feeling&quot;ie subjective ass of the likelihood that lesion is clinically significant prostate cancer(5-level scale))
PI-RADSv2, PI-RADSv2.1 score(by strictly applying the published PI-RADS criteria)
EPE score(ie the likelihood of extraprostatic extension;5-level subjective scale without predefined criteria)
Max diameter
Def of add suspect lesions Readers could define suspect&quot;additional targets&quot;(AT);for each AT,they will provide the same criteria. It is expected that, for these suspect AT,at least one score is≥3
Ass of lobes Scores of prostate lobes will be automatically calculated based on 2 previous steps of reading. However,in lobes with no suspect lesion,readers could define whether same criteria are1or2,in peripheral zone and transition zone</description>
