      Abstract:

      Objectives: (i) To investigate the test-retest and inter-rater reliability, construct and
      known-group validity of four independent step tests in older adults with mild to moderate
      dementia (Phase 1); and (ii) the feasibility and effects of a 12-week step training on the
      step performance, physical and functional outcomes in this population (Phase 2).

      Design and subjects: Older adults who have mild to moderate dementia, and able to walk
      independently without walking aids, with stick or quadripod will be recruited to participate
      in this study. Participants will perform four step tests, including Four Square Step Test
      (FSST), Choice Stepping Reaction Time Test (CSRTT), Maximum Step Length Test (MSLT) and
      Alternate Step Test (AST) on three separate testing occasions conducted by two independent
      raters at the baseline (Phase 1).

      The participants will then join either an intervention or control group. Those in the
      intervention group will receive a 12-week step training, while the control group will receive
      usual care. The stepping performance using the step tests validated in Phase 1, cognitive and
      functional outcomes and prospective falls will be compared between the intervention and
      control groups at 12 and 24 weeks (Phase 2).

      Interventions: The step training consists of two 30-minute training sessions per week. The
      participants will receive an individualized, progressive training that is tailored to their
      stepping ability and cognitive function.

      Main outcome measures: Stepping performance using the four step tests, 2-minute walk test,
      10-meter walk test, 30-second sit to stand test, Berg Balance Scale, Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment and prospective falls at 12 and 24 weeks.

      Expected results: (i) The four step tests are reliable in older adults with mild to moderate
      dementia, and the findings of the step tests are moderately associated with the functional
      outcomes, and (ii) the participants in the intervention group will have better stepping
      performance, better functional outcomes and fewer falls compared with the control group at 12
      weeks, and the effects will sustain at 24 weeks.
