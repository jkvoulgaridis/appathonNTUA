  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to characterize the acute exercise response as it relates to brain
      glucose metabolism in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The study team will also examine
      lactate metabolism, relationships with cognition, and the effect of exercise intensity.

  <detailed_description>

      Aim 1: Compare the effects of acute, moderate intensity and acute, higher intensity exercise
      on cerebral glucose metabolism in nondemented (ND) elderly and AD subjects. ND (n=30) and AD
      (n=30) subjects will undergo a single bout of moderate intensity (45-55% HRR) or higher
      intensity (65-75% HRR) exercise to assess the effect of exercise intensity on acute change in
      brain glucose metabolism (rest to exercise). Investigators hypothesize that both moderate and
      high intensity exercise will elicit a drop in global brain glucose metabolism compared to
      quiet rest, but that the effect will be greater with higher intensity vs. moderate intensity
      exercise, and greater in ND subjects than in AD subjects.

      Aim 2: Characterize the effect of both exercise intensities on acute biomarker response and
      cognition (memory and executive function) in ND and AD subjects. The acute biomarker response
      to exercise and the effect on cognition has not been examined in aged or AD cohorts.
      Investigators hypothesize that acute higher intensity exercise will elicit a greater blood
      lactate response (area under the curve, AUC) compared to acute moderate intensity exercise,
      and that this response will be greater in ND than in AD subjects. Investigators further
      hypothesize that lactate AUC will track negatively with change in cerebral glucose metabolism
      and cognitive performance. Although investigators will focus on lactate, they will also
      quantify additional exercise-related biomarkers.
