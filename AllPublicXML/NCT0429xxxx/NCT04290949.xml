      To assess the platelet indices in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary

  <detailed_description>

      Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is a type of acute coronary artery disease (CAD), It is a
      highly prevalent group of emergency diseases, associated with high morbidity and mortality
      (1)

      ACS include ST- elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), non ST-Elevation Myocardial
      Infarction (NSTEMI) and Unstable Angina (UA) (2).

      ACS characterized by plaque rupture and acute thrombosis formation in the coronary arteries
      (3)

      platelet morphology and function have vital roles in the pathogenesis of many diseases
      related to coagulation, thrombosis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction (4)

      Platelets play a crucial role in thrombotic episodes, its activation is acritical factor in
      the creation and evolution of atherothrombosis. (5)

      Not only platelets are essential for the thrombotic vascular occlusion at the ruptured
      atherosclerotic plaque but also they contribute to the obstruction and impairment of coronary
      micro circulation (6).

      Risk stratification plays a crucial role in the management of patients with ACS (7).

      Patients estimated to be at higher risk may be managed with earlier and more aggressive
      treatment, whereas those with lower risk may be managed with less intensive treatment (8).

      Many biomarkers have been evaluated, and various scores have been created for risk
      stratification of ACS patients (9)

      Mean platelet volume (MPV) has been proposed as a primary marker for platelet activation, as
      larger sized platelets have been associated with higher pro-thrombotic risk, and its
      measurement is easy and time effective (10-14)

        -  So It may elevate in patients with ACS and its role, It could be a useful bio marker of
           risk of stratification (15)

        -  Platelet Distribution Width (PDW) measured on admission is a cheap and generally
           available biomarker which allows for predicting the development of heart failure in
           patients with ACS after PCI (16)

      showed that an increased level of PDW was related to the severity of CAD in patients with ACS
      (17).

      Numerous studies support the association of Mean platelet volume (MPV) with adverse cardiac
      outcomes as restenosis stent thrombosis in patients with ACS (19-24) al.2011
