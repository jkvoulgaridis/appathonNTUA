    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well oxaloacetate works in reducing cognitive complaints in
      stage 0-IIIA breast cancer survivors. Oxaloacetate is a natural substance found in the body
      and is available as a nutritional supplement. Giving oxaloacetate may reduce inflammation in
      the brain that could be contributing to cognitive complaints seen after cancer treatments.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To examine the effectiveness of anhydrous enol-oxaloacetate (oxaloacetate) in reducing
      cognitive complaints in breast cancer patients over the course of 8 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tolerability of oxaloacetate. II. To examine whether oxaloacetate has an
      effect on the neurocognitive domain of executive function.

      III. To examine whether oxaloacetate has an effect on patient reported fatigue, insomnia, and
      depressive symptoms.

      IV. To collect blood for assessment of inflammatory markers and glutamate levels.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive anhydrous enol-oxaloacetate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 8 weeks in the
      absence of worsening symptoms or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with a diagnosis of early stage breast cancer (stage 0, I, II, IIIa) who are at
             least 12 months after surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, but may be on endocrine
             therapy or HER-2 targeted therapy, and not more than 5 years after their breast cancer
             diagnosis

          -  No evidence of active/recurrent breast cancer or other serious chronic illness

          -  Has significant cognitive complaints, defined as a score of &lt; 12 on the
             Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Adult version (v)
             2.0 - Cognitive Function 4a

          -  Is geographically accessible, and able to participate in a study of 8-10 weeks
             duration

          -  Ability to complete evaluation surveys in English

          -  The effects of oxaloacetate on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential must
             agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; intrauterine
             device [IUD]; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Women of any age who have had their ovaries and/or uterus removed will
             not be at risk for pregnancy and will not require contraception. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her study physician immediately. Menopausal status will be established as
             follows: Women who are 55 years or older and who are not menstruating will be
             considered postmenopausal and not at risk for pregnancy. Women who are less than 55
             years old who are menstruating will be considered premenopausal and will require
             contraception. Women who are less than 55 years with an intact uterus and ovaries who
             are not menstruating and have not had a menstrual period within the past 2 years will
             have an follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol measured. If the values are
             in postmenopausal range the woman will be considered postmenopausal and she will not
             be considered at risk for pregnancy

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has another serious or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that contributes to
             substantial physical or emotional disability that would detract from participating in
             the planned study

          -  Taking chronic medications that would interfere with cognitive functioning such as
             medications for sleep, anxiety, narcotics for pain, use of illicit drugs or cannabis

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to oxaloacetate

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded from this study because the safety of
             oxaloacetate in this setting is unknown. A pregnancy test will be performed on all
             women with an intact uterus and ovaries who are not determined to be postmenopausal
