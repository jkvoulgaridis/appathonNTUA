  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1, ascending dose escalation study of QL1706 in
      subjects with advanced malignant tumor. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 of the
      study will be a dose escalation evaluation to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of QL1706. This study purpose is to describe
      the safety and tolerability, to assess Pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity, and to
      preliminarily assess the anti-tumor activity of QL1706 in subjects with advanced malignant
      tumor. Part 2 of the study will further characterize the PK parameters for QL1706 in subjects
      with advanced malignant tumor.

    <description>Part 1 (Dose escalation): QL1706 will be administered in sequential cohorts each receiving 1 of 4 doses of QL1706 on day 1 of every 21-day cycle (3 weeks) via IV infusion. Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is reached.
Part 2 (Dose Expansion): The PK parameters of QL1706 will be tested at 2-3 doses determined during the dose-escalation phase in subjects with advanced malignant tumor cohorts.</description>
