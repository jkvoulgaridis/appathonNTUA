      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial
      chemoembolization combined with anti-pd-1 antibody in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma as first line therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is commonly used for the treatment of advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Early randomized trials suggested that TACE can be accepted as the
      standard treatment for advanced stage disease. However, outcome of patients treated with TACE
      in real-life cohorts is still very poor.

      Recent studies have also supported a safe combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with
      TACE. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE
      combined with anti-pd-1 antibody in patients in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
