  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was aimed to study the effect of video assisted education about endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) on anxiety levels of patients who planned to undergo ERCP
      for any reason.Video revealing the ERCP procedure was shown to the patients in one group and
      not shown to the other. Then anxiety levels and pain scores have been obtained before and
      after the procedure in both groups

      The study was conducted to determine the effect of video education on anxiety level before
      the ERCP procedure and satisfaction degree after the ERCP procedure between September 1st
      2017 and December 31st 2018 at Bagcilar Medipol Mega University Hospital. Patients were
      grouped into two in a randomized manner. In control arm, patients underwent ERCP procedure
      with the information provided by the gastroenterologist who recommended the procedure.
      Patients in experimental arm, besides the information provided by the gastroenterologist,
      watched video of ERCP procedure and answered all the questions about the procedure by an
      experienced nurse. A total of 70 patients (35 in each arms) was planned to enroll to the
      study. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) form was applied to measure anxiety level and
      visual analog score (VAS) was applied to measure the satisfaction about the procedure.

    <measure>Change in anxiety status of the patients after ERCP</measure>
    <time_frame>an hour before ERCP and an hour after ERCP</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured with Stait Trait Anxiety Inventory. There are 2 subscales within this measure. The State Anxiety Scale (S-Anxiety) evaluates the current state of anxiety, asking how respondents feel &quot;right now,&quot; using items that measure subjective feelings of apprehension, tension, nervousness, worry, and activation/arousal of the autonomic nervous system. The Trait Anxiety Scale (T-Anxiety) evaluates relatively stable aspects of &quot;anxiety proneness,&quot; including general states of calmness, confidence, and security.
The STAI has 40 items, 20 items allocated to each of the subscales. Responses for the S-Anxiety scale assess intensity of current feelings &quot;at this moment&quot;: 1) not at all, 2) somewhat, 3) moderately so, and 4) very much so. Responses for the T-Anxiety scale assess frequency of feelings &quot;in general&quot;: 1) almost never, 2) sometimes, 3) often, and 4) almost always.
Range of scores for each subtest is 20-80, the higher score indicating greater anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction assessed by visual analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>an hour after ERCP</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS for satisfaction is a horizontal line of 100-mm long. At the beginning and at the end, there are two descriptors representing extremes of satisfaction (i.e. no satisfaction and extreme satisfaction). The patient rated his satisfaction by making a vertical mark on the 100-mm line. The measurement in millimetres was converted to the same number of points ranging from 0 to 100 points.</description>
