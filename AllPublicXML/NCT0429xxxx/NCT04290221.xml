      The main objective of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of the lumbar nerve root
      stimulation with ultrasound-guided percutaneous electrolysis versus the stimulation of
      trigger points in patients with chronic low back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that recently the effectiveness of intratissue percutaneous electrolysis (EPI) has
      become of interest in the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain, when conventional
      physiotherapy management is not successful, the EPI can promote the healing biological
      processes. Several studies have demonstrated that inflammation can play an important role in
      the progression of muscle degeneration, in addition to potentially contributing to painful
      symptoms in individuals with chronic low back pain.

      This technique involves nonthermal, electrochemical ablation of the lesion via the use of a
      cathodic fluid. The inflammation provoked is very localized and healing is rapid. Although
      EPI has been widely employed lately, the literature contains few studies validating its use.

      The good results reported in studies of tendinopathies have to the undertaking of the present
      work, which compares the long-term effectiveness of EPI and dry needling—both
      ultrasound-guided—for the treatment of chronic low back pain.

      A double blind clinical trial will be developed in a sample of 80 subjects with chronic low
      back pain. Patients will receive 1 weekly sessions of intratissue percutaneous electrolysis
      for 3 weeks, for a total of 3 sessions. The aim is to compare the effectiveness of applying
      percutaneous electrolysis in the lumbar nerve root versus applying it to the trigger points
      of the gluteus medius, quadratus lumborum, and erector spinae muscles on disability, pain,
      fear of movement, quality of life, resistance of the trunk flexors, lumbar mobility and
      muscular electrical activity.

    <description>An instrument for measuring the degree of sensitivity to pain. We will carry out a location of the myofascial trigger points following the illustrations of location of the myofascial trigger points that indicate Travell and Simons of both the left and right hemibody.
Once located they will be classified as active or latent. Measured in kg / cm 2 with an analog pressure algometer model Wagner FDK20. To carry out this diagnosis using the analog pressure algometer, a force of 1Kg / sec will be applied until the subject indicates with a &quot;YA&quot; presence of pain, at that time we will stop the pressure made with the analog pressure algometer and record the result. The measurement will be executed 3 times with a 30 sec rest between each measurement and an average of the 3 results obtained will be obtained.
Myofascial trigger points that do not meet the above criteria will be considered latent and which will not be subject to any treatment.</description>
