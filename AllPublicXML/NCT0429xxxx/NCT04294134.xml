  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel mother-child therapeutic
      model called MIO-CPP compared to CPP-only. The goal of MIO-CPP is to improve child
      well-being, permanency and safety, and reduce the risk for involvement in the child welfare
      system for children pre-birth to five who are affected by parental substance use disorders
      (SUD) and/or other mental health problems.

      The goal of the project is to improve child well-being, permanency and safety, and reduce the
      risk for involvement in the child welfare system for families with children pre-birth to five
      who are affected by parental substance use disorders (SUD) and/or other mental health
      problems. The project will integrate with SUD treatment programs for pregnant/parenting women
      and their children by providing two evidence based therapeutic models, Mothering from the
      Inside Out (MIO) and Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP). MIO and CPP will promote the
      development of parental reflective functioning and strengthen parent/child attachment. The
      study will use a randomized control trial to test the effectiveness of MIO and CPP together
      (intervention) compared to CPP alone (controlled) on parent/caregiver well-being, child
      well-being, and family well-being. The study will assess and compare parental satisfaction as
      well as explore whether demographics, history of DHS involvement, and substance use treatment
      history affect the outcomes.

      MIO is an individual, 12-session, manualized, psychotherapeutic intervention. CPP is
      typically offered through weekly sessions with the mother-child dyad that last 1 to 1.5
      hours. The MIO-CPP (intervention) model lasts 9 months and will begin with the standard 12
      weeks of MIO for each mother, with the CPP assessment and engagement phase embedded during
      this time. This will be followed by the dyadic mother-child phase, the core intervention
      stage of CPP. The CPP (control) model will last for 9 months.

      The recruitment for study participants will stop when 170 mother-child dyads have enrolled in
      the study. Participants will be recruited from three substance use treatment facilities in
      Philadelphia and Bucks Counties: Caring Together at Drexel University, Interim House West,
      and Libertae, Inc.

      Data collection from participants will occur at four time points during the study: 1) when
      participants are enrolled; 2) 3 months following enrollment; 3) 6 months following
      enrollment; and 4) 9 months following enrollment or when the participant ends their
      participation in weekly therapy sessions if sooner than 9 months following enrollment. Study
      measures will include: 1) Parent/Caregiver Well-being: a) maternal reflective functioning, b)
      depression, anxiety, and trauma-related symptoms, c) parental substance use and move toward
      recovery; d) parenting stress; e) parent-child relationship; 2) Child Well-being: a) behavior
      problems, b) executive functions; c) socialization skills; 3) Family Well-being: a) child
      welfare involvement, b) reunifications.

      As part of this study, investigator will acquire administrative data about the safety and
      permanency of children and adult recovery for all study participants. The Primary
      Investigator will request substance use treatment data from the City of Philadelphia
      Department of Human Services, and Department of Behavioral Health and Department of
      Behavioral Health and Intellectual disAbilities. The requested data elements will include
      whether the study child has a child welfare record, the types of allegations of abuse or
      neglect, and when the allegations occurred (from birth to present day). Additionally,
      investigators will request all available substance use treatment records will be requested
      for adults who are a part of a study case for the year prior to enrollment in the study to
      one year following their enrollment in the study.

    <intervention_model_description>We will perform a randomized control trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of MIO-CPP therapeutic model on improving parent/caregiver, child, and family wellbeing. Participants will include mother-child dyads from families involved with SUD treatment programs serving women and children in Philadelphia and Bucks counties, including Libertae Inc. in Bensalem, PA; and The Caring Together Program, and Interim House West in Philadelphia, PA. Participants will be randomized to receive a combined therapeutic model of MIO and CPP (intervention) or CPP alone (control). The intervention will last for 9 months (but may take up to 12 months if client is unable to complete within 9 months), and parent and child characteristics will be measured at baseline, 9 months, and once per month at therapeutic visits during the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ITSP provides a standard method for professionals to measure a child's sensory processing abilities and to profile the effect of sensory processing on functional performance in the daily life of a child. This instrument is required as part of the cross-site evaluation.
The ITSP is a judgment-based caregiver questionnaire. Each item describes children's responses to various sensory experiences. The ITSP consists of 36 items for children - birth to 6 months - and 48 items for children - 7 to 36 months. The questionnaire is available in English and Spanish. The caregiver questionnaire contains items divided into sensory systems. For children birth to 6 months, there are four quadrant scores and one combined quadrant score; for children 7 to 36 months, there are five sensory processing section scores, four quadrant scores, and one combined quadrant score available.</description>

    <description>The Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) is a 5-item screen that was designed for use in primary care settings. The measure begins with an item designed to assess whether the respondent has had any exposure to traumatic events. If a respondent denies exposure, the PC-PTSD-5 is complete with a score of 0. However, if a respondent indicates that they have experienced a traumatic event over the course of their life, the respondent is instructed to respond to five additional yes/no questions about how that trauma exposure has affected them over the past month. The PC-PTSD-5 was designed to identify respondents with probable PTSD.</description>

    <description>The Parenting Relationship Questionnaire (PRQ) is designed to capture a parent's perspective on the parent-child relationship. The PRQ has two forms, one for parents of preschool children (aged 2-5) and one for parents of children and adolescents (age 6-18). We will use the preschool version of the assessment, which can be completed in 10-15 minutes. The PRQ (Parenting Relationship Questionnaire) instrument is designed to capture a parent's perspective of the parent-child relationship (or the perspective of a person serving a similar role). It assesses traditional parent-child dimensions such as attachment and involvement and also provides information on parenting style, parenting confidence, stress, and satisfaction with the child's school. The questionnaire is designed to be used in clinical, pediatric, counseling, school, and other settings where there is a need to understand the nature of the parent-child relationship.</description>

    <description>The PDI is a 45 item video-taped, semi-structured clinical interview intended to examine parents' representations of their children, themselves as parents, and their relationships with their children. The PDI is intended to assess internal working models of relationships. The PDI elicits representations regarding a current, ongoing, &quot;live&quot; relationship that is still evolving, that of the parent with her or his child. The parent is asked to describe her or his child's behavior, thoughts, and feelings in various situations, as well as her responses to her or his child in these situations. The parent is also asked to describe him/herself as a parent and to discuss emotions stimulated by the experience of parenting. The interview strives in a number of ways to tap into parents' understanding of their child's behavior, thoughts, and feelings, and asks the parents to provide real life examples of charged interpersonal moments: &quot;Describe a time in the last week when you and your child really</description>

Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) is a two-generation approach that supports and strengthens parent-child attachment by integrating modalities derived from psychodynamic, attachment, trauma, cognitive-behavioral, and social learning theories. (Lieberman AF and Van Horn P, 2005 and 2008) Studies have revealed that CPP caregivers' outcomes include decreased depression, PTSD and other symptoms, increased empathy towards children and an increase in the quality of parent-child interactions. CPP focuses on working with families offering weekly sessions for nine-12 months.</description>

    <description>Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) is a two-generation approach that supports and strengthens parent-child attachment by integrating modalities derived from psychodynamic, attachment, trauma, cognitive-behavioral, and social learning theories. (Lieberman AF and Van Horn P, 2005 and 2008) There have been five randomized trials that provide evidence for the efficacy of CPP, as well as an additional study within a foster care program in Illinois. These studies have revealed that CPP caregivers' outcomes include decreased depression, PTSD and other symptoms, increased empathy towards children and an increase in the quality of parent-child interactions. CPP focuses on working with families offering weekly sessions for nine-12 months. CPP is also very adaptable to suit the needs and composition of each family; it has proven effective with other primary caregivers (e.g., relative caregiver or a foster parent) while the parent is in treatment and once the parent is out of treatment.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women actively receiving treatment for Substance Use Disorder at one of three
             participating clinics in Philadelphia and Bucks Counties: Libertae, Inc., The Caring
             Together Program, or Interim House West

          2. Must be at least six months pregnant or must have a child 5 years old or younger.

          3. Must have access to child - children must either reside with mother, or, if the child
             is in foster/kinship care, the goal must be reunification.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. At Libertae Inc. and Interim House West (both residential treatment facilities), women
             will not be referred for enrollment before they have been affiliated with the
             treatment facility for at least 14 days and will not be referred if they are less than
             45 days from discharge.

          2. At Caring Together (an outpatient clinic), women will not be referred to the study
             before they have completed 2 weeks of outpatient visits. This minimum will ensure that
             women are not enrolled before their substance use treatment has begun.

          3. The study will not enroll mothers who would be unable to receive the intervention
             services in English without the assistance of an interpreter. Due to the duration of
             the study intervention as well as the frequency of visits between the Child-Parent
             Specialist and the client, it would not be feasible to ensure that an interpreter
             would also be available for all visits.

          4. In substance use treatment by judge's or parole officer's orders, and is in no way
             considered to be a prisoner.
