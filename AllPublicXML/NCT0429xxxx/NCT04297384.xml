      This trial studies the impact of the breast cancer pathways program on the patient
      experience, including decision making and quality of life. Measuring how the breast cancer
      pathways program affects decision making and quality of life in patients may help doctors
      improve cancer education.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the impact of breast cancer pathways on patient experience, burden of decision
      making and quality of life in tertiary cancer center and community oncology practice.

      II. Identify modifiable factors that affect provider adoption of breast cancer pathways in
      tertiary cancer center and community oncology practice.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive standard chemotherapy educational materials. Participants also
      complete surveys over approximately 22 minutes at the time of first chemotherapy infusion,
      and approximately 8 weeks after first chemotherapy infusion.

      GROUP II: Participants receive personalized information about their cancer, treatment, and
      side effects. Participants also complete surveys over approximately 22 minutes at the time of
      first chemotherapy infusion, and approximately 8 weeks after first chemotherapy infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment includes intravenous chemotherapy for breast cancer for primary disease as
             neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, or for recurrent and/or metastatic cancer

          -  Can provide consent

          -  Are able to comprehend written materials in English or Spanish

          -  Will receive their chemotherapy at Roswell Park sites in Buffalo or Amherst, New York
             (NY), or Roswell Park Oncology primary care (PC) sites in Niagara Falls, Amherst, West
             Seneca, or Jamestown NY

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Breast cancer patients receiving oral therapy alone

          -  Patients who are not able to comprehend written materials in English or Spanish

          -  Patients who will not receive chemotherapy at a Roswell Park site

          -  Patients who are not able to comprehend written materials will not be included in this
             study, as the consent document will be administered in multiple infusion centers that
             cannot be all staffed daily with a research associate. The study instruments used are
             standardized tools that have been developed as best as possible with appropriate
             literacy levels

          -  Patients enrolled in clinical trials for their breast chemotherapy will be excluded
             from this study because they will require alternative educational materials that are
             specific to the trial drugs being administered
