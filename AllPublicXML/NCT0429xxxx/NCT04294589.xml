  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous Thromboembolic Events (ETVs) are the second leading cause of death (9.2% of causes of
      death) in cancer patients after tumor progression (1). Indeed, cancer is associated with a 4
      to 7-fold risk of ETV during chemotherapy (2). This complication is observed in 20% of cancer
      patients (3), and is sometimes an inaugural manifestation of cancer. This risk is
      particularly increased during the first 3 months after cancer diagnosis (4).

      A biomarker correlated with the occurrence of ETVs would make it possible to target patients
      at high risk of thrombosis who could benefit from primary thromboprophylaxis, thus avoiding
      the complications, particularly haemorrhagic, and the additional costs associated with the
      long-term diagnostic and therapeutic management of ETVs. We have implemented in the
      laboratory an innovative approach to the detection and quantification of circulating NETs by
      flow cytometry (FCM) allowing the routine determination of NETs. Therefore, we propose to
      assess NETs by CMF in a cohort of cancer patients with a very high risk of ETVs (pancreatic
      cancer, gastric cancer and colon cancer).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NETs will be detected and quantified by CMF on the remaining EDTA tube collected to
      perform the blood count (NFS), using the method in place in the laboratory, adapted from the
      method initially described by Gavillet et al. The analyses will be carried out on a Fortessa
      LSR cytometer (Becton Dickinson), the antibodies used are specific to NET components:
      citrullinated H3 anti-histone in indirect labelling coupled APC, PE myeloperoxidase and
      Hoescht 34580 as DNA marker. The level will be measured in NETs/µL of whole blood as a
      function of the white blood cell count (Sysmex XN-3000). In parallel, other parameters
      associated with ETV risk will be evaluated: NFS on Sysmex-XN PLC, D-dimers, FVIII and MP. The
      assays of PM, D-dimers and FVIII will be performed specifically as part of the project, the
      other parameters will be measured as part of routine patient management and will not result
      in any additional constraints or costs. Biomarker assays will be performed at the time of
      cancer diagnosis on the EDTA and citrate tubes collected for NFS and TP/TCA respectively as
      part of routine care.

    <description>At the end of the study, after a minimum clinical follow-up of 4 months, the frequency of ETVs will be correlated to the NET rate measured in univariate and multivariate analysis (including also the following thrombotic risk factors: neutrophil levels, platelet levels, D-dimers, factor VIII, procoagulant activity of PM and body mass index).</description>
