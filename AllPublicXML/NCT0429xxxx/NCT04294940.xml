  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease is a partial inability of the coronary arteries to supply the heart
      muscle due to their narrowing. There is angina and myocardial infarction. Coronary heart
      disease is the first cause of non-communicated deaths and years of life lost.

      After hospital discharge, a few days following the acute care of a coronary heart disease, a
      formal Cardiac Rehabilitation programme (CR) is usually provided. CR is a comprehensive
      programme involving exercise training, risk factor modification, education and psychological
      support. It is generally sequenced in 4 phases. Phase 1 begins at the hospital and consists
      of early mobilisation and education. Most phase 2 CR models are based upon supervised
      ambulatory outpatient programmes. Maintenance (phase 3 and 4) follows the ambulatory
      programme in which physical fitness and risk factor control are supported in a minimally
      supervised setting.

      Despite high-grade recommendations and abundant clinical evidence, a CR program is not always
      implemented and the patients are not systematically referred after discharge from a phase 1
      CR. Furthermore, compliance to pharmacological treatments and changes in lifestyle and diet
      are hugely neglected following a phase 2 CR and an important number of patients resume a
      sedentary lifestyle.

      A growing body of evidence supports the use of digital tools such as smartphones and tablets
      in helping the patients achieve their goals in terms of physical exercise, risk-factor
      reduction and diet improvement.

      Ad Scientiam has developed CardiCare™, a mobile application intended to provide a
      personalised physical training plan contributing to stabilise or improve cardiorespiratory
      fitness through improvement of VO2max.

      The mobile application CardiCare™ is to be used by patients after an acute coronary syndrome,
      graduated from a phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation program in a cardiac rehabilitation centre
      and entering in phase 3 CR.

      The mobile application CardiCare™ consists of several modules:

        -  A physical activity recommendation engine, providing personalised weekly activity
           schedule, self-adapting to the patient's clinical characteristics, physical capacity and
           sport preferences through a proprietary algorithm

        -  Self-administered questionnaires to assess perceived exertion, chest pain, weight
           variations, patient's quality of life

        -  Passive monitoring of the patient's physical activity through Apple's HealthKit and
           Google's Fit

        -  Informational content about cardiovascular diseases, risk factor reduction and chest
           pain action plan The investigator's work hypothesis is that, compared to standard care,
           CardiCare™ will stabilise or improve the cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) acquired
           post-CR.
