  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, non-randomised, dose-escalation study to determine the safety and
      tolerability of different doses of a single dose vaccination of ChAdOx1 HBV in healthy
      participants and in participants with chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection and virally
      suppressed with oral antiviral medication.

      During this study 10 healthy volunteers and 12 participants with Chronic Hepatitis B virus
      infection (on anti-viral drugs to suppress the HBV virus), aged 18-65 years, will receive one
      intramuscular injection of study drug. All participants will be followed up for up to 6
      months (9 visits in total) and will be asked to give a blood sample at each clinic visit.

      The aims of the study are to assess the safety of the study drug and to see if the vaccine
      can induce a strong immune response against the hepatitis B Virus

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in man human study of a therapeutic vaccine for chronic hepatitis B
      infection(ChAdOx1-1HBV). The vaccine will be given to participants in a dose escalation
      strategy (two doses). The study aims to recruit first healthy volunteers (n=10) and then
      adult patients (n=12) who are chronically infected with HBV and are treated with anti-viral
      medication, either tenofovir or entecavir with persistent virological control.

      Each participant will receive 1 dose of the vaccine (intramuscular injection). Participants
      (Volunteers &amp; patients) will attend up to 9 study visits in total. The last visit will be 24
      weeks after vaccination. The primary endpoint of the study is safety. The secondary endpoint
      is the assessment of the immune response to hepatitis B that is generated by the vaccine. The
      study will also determine the effect of ChAdOx1‑HBV on virological and immunological systemic
      and intrahepatic changes in participants with CHB.
