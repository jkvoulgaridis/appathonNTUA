  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess various aspects of reliability and validity of two
      sit-to-stand tests, the Five Times Sit to Stand Test (5TSTS) and the 30-Second Sit to Stand
      Test (30SSTS). The tests will be performed by patients after lower-limb amputation who have
      been newly fitted with a prosthesis. Each test will be performed with and without the
      prosthesis on two occasions: on the first day when the patients will be able to walk
      independently with their prosthesis and two weeks later. On the same two occasions, the
      patients will also perform three walking tests (in randomised order): the L-test, the
      10-Metre Walk Test and the 6-Minute Walk Test. In addition, the patients will repeat the
      5TSTS and the 30SSTS one day after the first assessment. The results will be used to detect
      the presence of a floor effect, assess repeatability and concurrent validity, as well as
      estimate minimal detectable change and effects size for the effect of rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the tests will be performed using standardised protocols and technical aids. The
      assessments will be performed in the afternoon (after the daily rehabilitation program). The
      patients who will be able to perform the 5TSTS will perform that test first. If those
      patients will bill able to stand up within 30 seconds on each of the five trials, the 30SSTS
      will be performed next; otherwise, the number of times that the patient was able to complete
      the transition to the standing position will be recorded and taken as the 30SSTS result.
      Repetition of the outcome measurements will not serve to simply use the differences as the
      actual outcomes, but will serve to assess floor effect (the percentage of patients attaining
      the minimum possible score) on each occasion, to assess repeatability (intra-class
      correlation between the measurements on two consecutive days), minimal detectable change
      (calculated from the standard error of measurement, which will be estimated from the
      correlation between the measurements at the start and after two weeks) and effect size
      (difference between the mean measurements at the start and after two weeks, divided by the
      standard deviation at the start). In addition, the repeated measurements will be used to
      assess concurrent validity in terms of the correlation between the sit-to-stand tests and the
      walking tests on two occasions (at the start and after two weeks).

    <description>The L-test is a performance-based measure of functional mobility. It is a modification of the Timed Up and Go test that overcomes the ceiling effect in higher-functioning patients. The participant must stand up from the chair, walk 7 m, turn 90 degrees, walk 3 m, then turn 180 degrees, and return along the same path to sit in the chair.</description>
