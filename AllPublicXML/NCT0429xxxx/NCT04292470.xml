  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the physiologic and behavioral mechanisms associated with
      enhanced medication effects in adult patients with functional GERD-related symptoms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will complete questionnaires regarding their GERD-related symptoms and have a visit
      with a study clinician regarding their symptoms. Heart rate variability and galvanic skin
      response will be measured in the patient-provider dyads and the visits video recorded.
      Subjects will receive a two-month supply of amitriptyline (10 mg/day), along with
      instructions for taking it. Subjects will complete a daily GERD symptom diary during the
      first and eighth weeks of the study. At the end of the 8-week observation period, subjects
      will complete follow-up measures of GERD symptom severity and quality of life.

    <description>Average daily GERD symptom severity during the last 7 days of the study compared to average daily GERD symptom severity at baseline using daily study diary entries. GERD symptom severity for each day is based on the sum of scores assessing the severity of daytime heartburn, nighttime heartburn, and acid reflux each on a 0-4 point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe). Higher scores signify worse symptoms.</description>
