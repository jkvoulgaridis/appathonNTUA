      This project is a multi-center, randomized, parallel-controlled, non-inferior clinical trial
      of soft contact lenses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The test product is the Soft Contact Lens (model: Spherical Lens), and the control product is
      a commercially available soft contact lens (model: SiHy Daily). The number of enrolled
      subjects is 148, and clinical observation is performed for 3 months.

    <measure>The ratio of corrected visual acuity of left and right eyes is ≥5.0</measure>

    <description>The standard logarithmic visual acuity chart consistent with the guiding principle is adopted in this scheme.
- Success criteria: If the lower limit of 95% CI of the evaluated rate of corrected for visual acuity for both eyes ≥ 5.0 at 1 week visit is ≥-10%, the primary endpoint of the two groups is non-inferior.</description>
