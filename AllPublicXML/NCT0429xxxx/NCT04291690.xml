  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial to determine whether a multicomponent intervention will lead to
      improvements in mobility, self-care, mood, pain, and physical activity among frail and
      pre-frail older adults (as measured with the Essential Frailty Toolset; EFT) hospitalized for
      an acute cardiovascular illness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a single-center randomized clinical trial at the Jewish
      General Hospital; an academic tertiary care center in Montreal, Quebec. Researchers will
      pre-screen stable patients ≥65 years of age admitted to the cardiovascular unit. The
      investigators will target those that consent and have evidence of frailty or pre-frailty
      according to the EFT (score ≥1/5). The EFT consists of a chair rise test to screen for
      physical frailty, a mini-cog test to screen for cognitive impairment, a hemoglobin level and
      a serum albumin level. Patients will be randomly allocated to the usual-care control group,
      or the intervention group that will receive targeted treatments depending on the EFT deficits
      identified. All patients will be outfitted with a hip-worn accelerometer to monitor position,
      step count, and sleep data during the study period. Patients will undergo a structured
      questionnaire and physical performance assessment at baseline (upon index admission) and at
      discharge, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days post-discharge to assess their
      recovery. The primary endpoint will be represented by the EQ-5D scale (mobility, self-care,
      mood, pain, and physical activity) measured by blinded observers.

    <description>We will encourage and assist patients to walk around the ward as tolerated and approved by their treating clinicians, to maximize the time spent out of bed, minimize the time spent in bed, and to encourage and assist them to perform chair rises to build lower extremity strength. For selected intervention patients with greater physical weakness, defined as SPPB ≤9, a Certified Exercise Physiologist will administer a supervised multicomponent exercise program combining strength, flexibility, balance and gait for the prevention of weakness and falls. The exercise program is adapted from the Vivifrail program which is an EU-funded initiative that provides a guide to prevent frailty, physical deconditioning, and incident disability in older persons. The program includes two daily sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, for a duration of 20 minutes each. The morning session includes strength and flexibility exercises. The afternoon session targets balance and walking.</description>

    <description>We will encourage and assist them to wear their hearing and visual aids (if they have these), orient them to time and place verbally and in writing on a clearly visible white-board in their hospital room - and also encourage their family members and caregivers to do so on a regular basis, and inquire about their sleep quality and communicate with the clinical team to reduce sleep disturbances. For selected intervention patients with greater cognitive impairments, defined as MMSE ≤26, we will provide cognitive simulation twice daily during the scheduled visits. Cognitive stimulation comprises of activities with the patient, including but not limited to current news, trivia, crossword puzzles, and memory games. These cognitive interventions are adapted from the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) that targets risk factors for delirium.</description>

    <description>We will reinforce proper eating habits, encourage and assist patients to wear their dentures (if they have these), and inquire about their food preferences and eating barriers and communicate with the clinical dieticians to address these issues. For selected intervention patients with greater nutritional deficits, defined as a positive PONS, we will recommend to the treating clinicians to prescribe MedPass supplementation. PONS, developed as a preoperative screening tool but also used in nonoperative medical settings, reflects low body mass index, weight loss, low dietary intake, and albumin level. MedPass is a 60 mL calorically dense (2 kcal/mL) oral nutritional supplement consumed between meals 4 times per daily. If MedPass supplementation is contraindicated, the treating team will have the full discretion not to prescribe it and/or to consider alternative supplementation strategies.</description>

    <intervention_name>Iron-Deficiency Anemia (IDA) Component of the Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>We will verify their clinical blood test results for hemoglobin level and iron studies and apply the diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency as recommended by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for Heart Failure. These criteria are: (i) Hemoglobin &lt;130g/L in men or &lt;120g/L in women with (ii) a Ferritin &lt;100μg/L or a Ferritin &lt;300μg/L with a Saturation &lt;20%. For selected intervention patients with diagnosed iron deficiency anemia, according to these established criteria, we will recommend to the treating clinicians to prescribe Venofer intravenous iron replacement therapy. The use of intravenous iron replacement therapy is a Strong Recommendation in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines. Venofer is prescribed at a dosage of 300 mg IV daily for a total of 3 doses. If Venofer supplementation is contraindicated, the treating team will have the full discretion not to prescribe it and/or to consider alternative strategies.</description>
