  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, whether and when intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering medication should be used in
      glaucoma suspects with high myopia (HM) is still a dilemma. Randomized trials are required to
      evaluate whether IOP lowering influences the incidence of glaucoma suspect progression in HM
      eyes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HM is associated with increased prevalence of glaucoma. However, accurate diagnosis of
      glaucoma in HM is a challenge. More and more viewpoints had been raised that HM eyes with
      optic disc head damage or/and visual field (VF) defects should been classified as glaucoma
      suspects.

      IOP is the only modifiable parameter in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. However, the
      decision to begin treatment to lower IOP in the glaucoma suspect patient is complex,
      especially for glaucoma suspects with HM. There are lack of guideline and consensus of
      treatment choices. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of medically IOP
      lowering on the progression of glaucoma suspects with HM.

    <description>Latanoprost 0.005% eye drops will be the first choice. If an IOP reduction of 20% is not achieved within three months, timolol 0.5% will be added as second medication. If an IOP reduction of 20% is then not achieved, alphagan 0.2% or alphagan-P 0.15% will be added. If an IOP reduction of 20% is then not achieved, the individual will be excluded from the study.
If necessary, latanoprost will be switched to other prostaglandin eye drops, alphagan (or alphagan-P) will be switched to brinzolamide 1% eye drops.
If necessary, latanoprost and timolol will be switched to Xalacom eye drops, timolol and alphagan will be switched to Combigan eye drops, timolol and brinzolamide will be switched to Azarga eye drops.
Once daily in the evening for prostaglandin eye drops, and twice daily for other eye drops.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged between 35 and 65 years.

          2. Diagnosed with high myopia (spherical equivalent ≤ -8.00 diopters or axial length ≥
             26.5 mm).

          3. Diagnosed with glaucoma suspect, which cannot be explained by myopic macular changes,
             or other retinal and neurologic condition.

          4. IOP ≥ 12 mmHg and ≤ 24mmHg on at least 2 visits, as measured by Goldmann applanation
             tonometry.

          5. An open anterior chamber angle as based upon gonioscopy.

          6. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≥ 6/12.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Allergy to prostaglandins.

          2. Advanced VF loss (MD worse than 16 dB) or a threat to fixation (sensitivity 10 dB or
             worse affecting either or both test points closest to the point of fixation in the
             upper hemifield and at either or both of the corresponding test points in the lower
             hemifield) in either eye.

          3. Previous IOP-lowering surgery in the study eye (i.e. trabeculectomy, Ahmed glaucoma
             valve implantation, any laser trabeculoplasty).

             pigmentosa in the study eye.

          7. Chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease in the study eye (from
             screening), such as chronic or recurrent uveitis.

             examinations, or monophtalmia.

          9. Need for ocular surgery/laser or anticipated need for cataract surgery that would

             rheumatic immune system diseases).
