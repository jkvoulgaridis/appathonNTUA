  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is of great importance because it uses a method that has not been tested in the
      past. To date, various interventions have been examined that use music for patients with
      dementia. At the same time, no intervention was conducted that integrates an additional
      person who shares personalized music with the patient.

      If the combination of another person who shares the positive effect of the music with the
      patient is found to enhance the positive effect of the music, it can change the routine of
      work with dementia patients and may even reduce the use of tranquilizers among them.

      In many cases, it has been found that one of the biggest challenges for family members who
      treat patients with dementia is the lack of content in the sessions and as a result, the
      growing sense of alienation between the patient and his family.

      Listening to music can be a significant tool in the hands of the family, the main caregiver,
      the medical staff, and any person who comes in contact with the patient, a tool that can
      strengthen the sense of connection and connection between them.

    <description>the measured scale estimates 10 out of 12 common behavioural disorders in Dementia: delusions, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, agitation, aggression, euphoria, inhibitions, irritability or instability, , Abnormal motor activity. A higher score indicates a larger severity of these behaviours. min-0 max-140. The follow-up will be performed by a nurse in both departments on a weekly basis during 8 months of the study.</description>
