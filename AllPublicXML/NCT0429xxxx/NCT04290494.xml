  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is to be conducted based on the AIS patient data collected from CNSR I, II,
      and III.

      The primary objectives are:

        -  To investigate the temporal changes in the proportion of intravenous recombinant
           plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) treatment from 2007 to 2017 among Intravenous
           Thrombolytics (IVT) eligible patients (patient groups B and B') and overall AIS patients
           (patient group A) in China;

        -  To investigate the temporal changes in IV rtPA treatment time intervals from 2007 to
           2017 among IV rtPA treated patients (patient groups C and C') in China.

      The secondary objectives are:

      - To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the IV rtPA treated patients
      (patient groups C and C'), IVT eligible patients (patient groups B and B') and the overall
      AIS patients (patient group A) from 2007 to 2017 from the CNSR I to III.
