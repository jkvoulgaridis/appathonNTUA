  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain and depression frequently co-exist in late and mid-life and contribute to
      increased disability, high health care costs, psychiatric comorbidity, and suicide. Older and
      middle-aged depressed-pain patients: a) are mainly treated in primary care practices; and b)
      are often prescribed medication, which increases the risk for addiction to opioids and
      benzodiazepines. Despite the need and desire by the patients and providers for primary care
      behavioral intervention, behavioral interventions are scarce in primary care.

      To address this need, Relief-Hybrid was created. Subjects are randomized to either the
      Relief-Hybrid intervention or to Referral to Mental Health/Usual Care. Subjects in both arms
      will complete research assessments at 6, 9, and 12 weeks. Subjects in the Relief-Hybrid arm
      will receive 5 weekly sessions with the study therapist (licensed social workers, LCSWs) and
      4 self-administered, mobile technology-assisted sessions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depression symptoms, as measured by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 9, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10 item questionnaire assessing severity of depression by scoring participants on mood, anxiety, sleep, concentration, appetite, and suicidal thoughts. The lowest score is 0, no depression symptoms, and the highest possible score is 60, severe depression symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain-Related Disability, as measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 9, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RMDQ includes a scale assessing how much pain the participant has experienced in the past week, with 0 meaning no pain and 10 meaning pain as bad as he/she can imagine.
The RMDQ also includes a series of questions related to pain disability, with 0 indicating no pain-related disability, and 24 indicating severe pain-related disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mood, as measured by the Daily Photographic Affect Meter (PAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PAM is used for assessing mood and emotional state. Participants can either score a &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; affect value.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interoceptive Awareness, as measured by the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 9, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment contains 32 questions measuring 8 areas of manifestations of emotions, including noticing, not-distracting, not-worrying, attention regulation, emotional awareness, self-regulation, body listening, and trusting. The scores for the questions associated with each of the 8 domains are averaged, with a score of 0 indicating &quot;Never&quot; and a score of 5 indicating &quot;Always&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Affect, as measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 9, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of a series of 60 words and phrases and participants rate to what extent they have felt that way in the past week. The words are separated into 13 areas: general negative affect, fear, sadness, guilt, hostility, shyness, fatigue, general positive affect, joviality, self-assurance, attentiveness, serenity, and surprise. The scores range from 1 (very slightly/not at all), to 5 (extremely) for each word and each area is summed for the final score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood, as measured by the Mood Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale rates current sadness, ranging from 0 (not sad) to 10 (most sad). It also rates interest or pleasure in doing things, ranging from 0 (no interest or pleasure) to 10 (greatest interest or pleasure).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain, as measured by the Pain Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale rates current pain, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress, as measured by the Stress Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale rates current stress, ranging from 0 (no stress at all) to 10 (great stress).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities Monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activities monitoring through a phone application; measuring distance covered daily by the participant during the week.</description>
