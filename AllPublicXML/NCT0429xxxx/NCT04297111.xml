  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of probiotic supplementation (Bacillus coagulans) on
      muscle protein synthesis in older adults in response to a plant-based diet.

      The investigators hypothesize that probiotic supplementation will enhance the digestibility
      of plant protein, therefore increasing the proportion of ingested amino acids that appear in
      systemic circulation and enhancing rates of muscle protein synthesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing interest in the use of plant-based proteins, both from the perspectives
      of global sustainability and growing consumer markets; however, plant-based proteins are
      known to have lower digestibility and lower ability to stimulate muscle protein synthesis (an
      important determinant of muscle mass) compared with animal-based proteins. Emerging evidence
      indicates that the probiotic Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 (GanedenBC30) can enhance plant
      protein digestibility. As such, Bacillus coagulans treatment may augment rates of muscle
      protein synthesis in response to plant-based protein intake in humans, by increasing the
      proportion of ingested amino acids that appear in systemic circulation after a plant meal, as
      circulating amino acids act as both a trigger to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in humans
      as well as providing the building block for new muscle tissue. An increase in muscle protein
      synthesis rates would be particularly critical in older adults as it is well established that
      one of the key mechanisms driving the loss of muscle mass with age is a reduction in muscle
      protein synthesis rates in response to dietary protein intake. Therefore, if probiotic
      supplementation can improve muscle protein synthesis rates following plant protein
      consumption, this indicates it may represent an effective and environmentally sensitive
      strategy to attenuate adverse age-related loss of muscle mass and muscle function. This is
      critical as the maintenance of skeletal muscle health is an important factor in the
      preservation of independence and quality of life as we age.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Each participant will undergo 8 weeks of Bacillus coagulans (probiotic) supplementation and 8 weeks of placebo supplementation in a counterbalanced order. There will be a 5-day trial period at the end of each supplementation phase. There will be a wash-out period of 8 weeks between probiotic and placebo supplementation.</intervention_model_description>
