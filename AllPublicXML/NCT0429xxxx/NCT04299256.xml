    <textblock>
      This study carried out in the HD unit of a large-scale training and research hospital, and at
      a dialysis center associated with this hospital located in Ankara, Turkey. Participants will
      be randomized to one of two study arms.

      Arm 1: Intervention group Arm 2: Control group Hypothesis 1. The HD patients in the 8-week
      intervention of BRT combined with music therapy will report lower fatigue scores than those
      in the control group.

      Hypothesis 2. The HD patients in the 8-week intervention of BRT combined with music therapy
      will perceive lower anxiety and depression than those in the control group.

      Patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment are susceptible to many complications. The
      inadequate stress-coping strategies render them vulnerable to high symptom burden and
      impaired quality of life. Patients are given conventional treatments to stop or slow down the
      progress of nephron destruction and prevent complications associated with uremia. However,
      previous studies observed that these therapies may be limited in alleviating fatigue,
      anxiety, and symptoms of depression, and may pose severe side effects. Therefore, in recent
      years patients have shown enhanced tendency to use complementary and integrative approaches
      including aromatherapy, acupuncture, massage, music, and relaxation to provide better control
      on their health and treatment process, feeling better physically, and emotionally, and as
      well as improve quality of life. The present study investigates the effects of Benson
      relaxation technique combined with music therapy in two-centered, 2-arm, assessor blinded
      randomized, controlled study of 61 hemodialysis patients.

      Arm 1: Benson relaxation technique combined with music therapy ; Arm 2: control. The
      investigators hypothesize that Benson relaxation technique combined with music therapy will
      decrease severity of fatigue, anxiety, and depression.

    <description>In the first interview, the patient information delivered a training booklet explaining the definition, purpose, benefits and application techniques of BRT and music therapy to the patients in the intervention group. After patients reviewed the details in the training booklet, a weekly schedule was planned for each patient based on their hemodialysis days. For the initiation of the intervention, patients were invited to the hemodialysis unit at the hospital 45 min prior to their hemodialysis sessions. All the participants wore black eye patches to provide a dim environment and to focus better on their breath and the music piece. Then, the patients information opened the music piece and gave Benson Relaxation Technique comments in a slightly lower voice. Each session lasted for 20 min, and the music piece was switched off as Benson Relaxation Technique ended. The music piece used in the study was Daniel Kobelco's non-verbal classical song.</description>

    <description>Like the intervention group, the control group session (attention-matched education) which composed of 10-12 participants were performed with a booklet containing hemodialysis and its use in a silent room located in the hemodialysis units. The patient information provided in-person training on hemodialysis and its use for 20 min in a group session at the hemodialysis unit, on the first day of the study. During the study period, the participants in the control group were not subjected to any additional intervention.</description>
