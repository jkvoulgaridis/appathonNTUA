  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate if the implementation of a multimedia based
      educational tool and regular reminders with shared decision-making will increase the rate of
      LARC uptake and retention in high risk pregnancy patients within 12 weeks of delivery and to
      study the rates of retention of LARC at 12 and 24 months and short-interval pregnancy rates.

    <textblock>
      This study will include 380 women aged 18-50 enrolled between 28 weeks gestation and
      postpartum day #1 who have a pregnancy that is considered high-risk. After consent,
      participants will be randomized to either routine care or multimedia based intervention. The
      intervention will include an investigator created decision aid presented at the time of
      randomization and reminder texts until 12 weeks postpartum.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the rate of LARC uptake and retention within 12 weeks of
      delivery. Secondary objectives include i) the retention of LARC at 12 and 24 months and ii)
      short-interval pregnancy rates.

    <description>Following randomization, participants will independently view the multimedia based decision aid on a provided tablet. They will also receive provider counseling. For the remainder of the pregnancy, they will receive a text message with a link to the multimedia based presentation. This will occur every 4 weeks until 12 weeks postpartum.</description>
