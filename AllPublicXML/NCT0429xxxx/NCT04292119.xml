      This research study is evaluating Lorlatinib in combination with Crizotinib or Binimetinib as
      a possible treatment for either anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive lung cancer or
      ROS1-positive lung cancer.

        -  This research study involves three study drugs.

        -  Lorlatinib

        -  Binimetinib

        -  Crizotinib

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial of two investigational combinations for treatment of
      either anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive or ROS1-positive lung cancer. The two drug
      combinations being tested are (1) Lorlatinib combined with Crizotinib and (2) Lorlatinib
      combined with Binimetinib.

        -  Lorlatinib is an oral ALK and ROS1 inhibitor. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
           has approved Lorlatinib for treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer. The FDA has not
           approved Lorlatinib for treatment of ROS1-positive lung cancer.

        -  Crizotinib is an oral ALK and MET inhibitor. The FDA has approved Crizotinib for
           treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer. Crizotinib is not approved by the FDA for the
           treatment of MET-positive lung cancer. This study will test crizotinib's ability to
           block MET signaling. Crizotinib is not approved by the FDA for treatment of
           ROS1-positive lung cancer.

        -  Binimetinib is an oral MEK inhibitor. The FDA has not approved binimetinib for treatment
           of ALK-positive or ROS1-positive lung cancer but it has been approved for other uses.

        -  The FDA has not approved the combination of Lorlatinib with Binimetinib or Crizotinib as
           a treatment for any disease.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment which
      will include evaluations and follow up visits.

        -  Patients will undergo screening and those who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be
           assigned to receive either the combination Lorlatinib and Crizotinib or the combination
           of Lorlatinib and Binimetinib. Patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive lung cancer
           who have extra copies of the MET growth signal (MET amplification) will be assigned to
           receive the Lorlatinib and Crizotinib combination. All other patients will be randomly
           assigned to receive one of the combinations.

        -  This study consists of 2 parts:

             -  Phase I:

                  -  The investigators are looking to determine whether combining Lorlatinib with
                     either Binimetinib or Crizotinib is well tolerated and to understand how
                     treatment with the two drugs affects cancer cells and impacts growth signals.

                  -  Not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same
                     dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of
                     participants who have been enrolled in the study prior and how well the dose
                     was tolerated.

             -  Phase II:

                  -  The Phase II study will test the safest doses of the combinations (as
                     established in the Phase I study) in a larger group of patients.

                  -  It is expected that about 96 people will take part in this research study

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic non-small cell lung
             cancer (Stage IV, AJCC v7.0) that carries an ALK or ROS1 rearrangement (ROS1-positive
             patients will only be allowed in dose escalation) as determined using a local
             diagnostic test or a commercial test or by the Food and Drug Administration
             (FDA)-approved FISH test, using Vysis® ALK Break apart FISH Probe, or the Ventana®
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) test.

          -  Disease progression or intolerance to at least one tyrosine kinase inhibitor

          -  At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Previously irradiated
             lesions are not measurable unless the lesion has demonstrated clear progression after
             radiation.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks

          -  Patients must be willing to undergo serial biopsies and have disease accessible to
             pretreatment biopsy. A cell block from a pleural effusion or ascites may be
             substituted for a core biopsy. In select cases, patients may be allowed to enroll
             without a pre-treatment biopsy and/or continue treatment without an on-treatment
             biopsy after speaking with the Overall Principal Investigator if performing the biopsy
             is technically challenging, poses significant risk to the patient, or may result in
             significant discomfort. If a pre-treatment biopsy is not performed, archival tissue
             will be used for correlative studies, specifically plasma-tissue comparisons.

          -  Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication. Does not have any
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, such as malabsorption syndrome
             or major resection of the stomach or small bowel that may alter absorption of the
             medication.

          -  A minimum washout period of 5 days or 5 half-lives between the last dose of tyrosine
             kinase inhibitor therapy and the first dose of study treatment is required (whichever
             is shorter). A shorter washout period may be considered in the event of disease flare,
             after discussion with the Overall Principal Investigator. No washout is required if
             the most recent anti-neoplastic therapy is lorlatinib.

          -  Patients must have recovered from treatment toxicities to ≤ Grade 1 or to their
             pretreatment levels except for adverse events that in the investigator's judgment do
             not constitute a safety risk for the patient.

          -  Patients can either be chemotherapy-naive or have received chemotherapy for
             locally-advanced or metastatic disease. Acute effects of therapy must have resolved to
             baseline severity or to CTCAE grade ≤1 except for adverse events that in the
             investigator's judgment do not constitute a safety risk for the patient.

          -  Recovery from effects of any major surgery or significant traumatic injury at least 28
             days before the first dose of study treatment.

          -  For all women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test must be obtained at
             the baseline visit before starting study treatment. For women who are not
             postmenopausal (≥ 12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile
             (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to remain abstinent or use two adequate
             methods of contraception, including at least one method with a failure rate of &lt; 1%
             per year, during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of
             study drug.

               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                  methods of contraception.

               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
                  tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of
                  combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine
                  devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom
                  and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of &lt;1% per year.
                  Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.

          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent or use a barrier method of contraception (e.g.,
             condom) during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of
             study drug and agreement to refrain from donating sperm during this same period

          -  Men with a pregnant partner must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for the
             duration of the pregnancy.

          -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
             postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Patients with untreated, controlled asymptomatic CNS lesions are permitted to enroll
             aslong as the CNS was not a site of progressive disease on lorlatinib monotherapy. If
             the CNS was a site of progressive disease on lorlatinib monotherapy, treatment of CNS
             lesions is required for enrollment. If CNS lesions are resected, a washout period of
             at least 28 days is required. This period may be shortened to 14 days with Overall PI
             approval.

          -  The use of seizure prophylaxis is allowed as long as patients are taking non-enzyme
             inducing anti-epileptic drugs (non-EIAED). If patients were previously on EIAEDs and
             these have been discontinued, they must have been discontinued for at least 7 days
             prior to treatment start. If patients require an anti-epileptic medication, then a
             CYP3A4 non-EIAED can be used such as levetiracetam, valproic acid, gabapentin,
             topiramate or lacosamide.

          -  Patients requiring steroids for control of CNS metastases must be at a stable or
             decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to enrollment

          -  Patients with asymptomatic leptomeningeal disease are eligible for participation in
             this trial. However, patients who had progression of leptomeningeal disease on
             lorlatinib will be required to undergo CNS radiation to meet eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 3 weeks prior to
             entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 3 weeks earlier.

          -  Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 1 week prior
             to study entry and/or during study participation. If the half-life of the
             investigational drug is known, then a period of 5 half-lives is required (or 1 week
             whichever is shorter) is required between discontinuing the investigational drug and
             starting study treatment.

          -  Radiation therapy (except palliative to relieve bone pain) within 7 days of study
             entry. Palliative radiation (≤ 10 fractions) must have been completed at least 48
             hours prior to study entry. Stereotactic or small field brain irradiation must have
             been completed at least 48 hours prior to study entry. Whole brain radiation and
             radiation for leptomeningeal metastasis must have been completed at least 7 days prior
             to study entry. Acute effects of radiation must have resolved to baseline severity or
             to CTCAE grade ≤1 except for adverse events that in the investigator's judgment do not
             constitute a safety risk for the patient.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Patients with predisposing characteristics for acute pancreatitis per the
             investigator's judgment (e.g. uncontrolled hyperglycemia, current symptomatic
             gallstone disease) in the 2 weeks prior to randomization

          -  History of hypersensitivity to lorlatinib or any of its excipients. In addition,
             subjects who are unable to tolerate the 50 mg dose of lorlatinib will not be permitted
             to enroll unless doses of lorlatinib below the entry level are being investigated
             (e.g. dose level -1) and they have previously tolerated lorlatinib monotherapy at the
             dose being investigated.

          -  History of extensive, disseminated, bilateral or presence of Grade 3 or 4 interstitial
             fibrosis or interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis, hypersensitivity
             pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, obliterative
             bronchiolitis or pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with history of prior radiation
             pneumonitis are not excluded.
