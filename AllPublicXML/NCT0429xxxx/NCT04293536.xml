  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been estimated that in the United States alone 48 million operations are performed
      annually and most involve the use of multiple surgical items, including needles and other
      sharp objects, surgical sponges, and surgical instruments1. Textile material and instruments
      forgotten in a patient undergoing an invasive procedure is a negligence of an entire team
      responsible for maintaining patient safety. A retained surgical foreign body (RSFB) usually
      requires at least a second surgery for retrieval of the object, and also carries a risk for
      major complications including morbidity and death2. Retained foreign bodies are underreported
      to minimize exposure to possible litigation3. Therefore, the real occurrence of RSFB is
      underestimated, recently there has reported an incidence of 0.356 / 1,000 patients whereas
      others reported a rate of 1/5000 with an associated mortality ranging from 11 to 35% 4-5.

      Therefore, there is a need for improved systems and methods for identifying and tracking
      surgical items, including needles and other sharp objects, surgical sponges, and surgical
      instruments during a surgical procedure.

      All cases investigated due to retained material during hospital surgical treatment will be
      included. Incidence, type of procedure performed, the prevalence and guilty of the personal
      actuating will be considered.
