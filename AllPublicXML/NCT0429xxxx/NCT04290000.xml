      Development of CAR-T cell against CD19 B lymphoma and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia leaded to
      2 authorized medication: Yescarta and Kymriah. Despite impressive outcomes in 3 phase II
      studies, never met in relapsed or refractory diseases, half of the patients don't respond to
      this treatment.This can be explained by a low expansion, functional alteration or short
      persistence of infused cells. Determination of reasons for treatment failure is the first
      step for optimization of this therapeutics. This project aims to bank blood samples from a
      cohort of patients treated with CAR-T cell for hematological malignancies in Montpellier
      University Hospital. Clinical data related to samples will be collected. This samples will be
      used to determine factors influencing efficacy of CAR-T cells treatments.

    <description>The aim is only to collect biological samples. This collection will be used later to determine factors influencing efficacy of CAR-T cells treatments.
Blood samples (additional tubes) and marrow (quantity taken in addition from the same aspiration) will be collected in addition to those useful for the follow up of the patients at specific points in his treatment and follow up.
In case of invasion, a skin biopsy will be made, 2 days and 8 days after the beginning of the CAR T Cell Treatment, during the patient's hospitalization and during a consultation visit in case of therapeutic progression or failure.</description>
