  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2798745 is a potent and selective oral Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4)
      channel blocker being investigated for the treatment of DME. This is a multi-center,
      open-label, single arm, 28-day treatment study with an opt-in period of additional 8 weeks of
      treatment in subjects with DME. The opt-in period will only be for subjects determined to be
      eligible to continue dosing. The study will be composed of 3 periods for all subjects:
      Screening, 28-day Treatment period, and Follow-up visit (approximately 28 days after the
      final dose).
