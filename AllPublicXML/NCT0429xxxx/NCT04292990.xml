  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to explore the significance of analgesic treatment for
      radiation-induced oral mucositis pain in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma during
      radiotherapy, and to compare the analgesic effect of morphine controlled-release tablets with
      that of fentanyl transdermal patch. Half of participants will receive morphine
      controlled-release tablets,while the other half will receive fentanyl transdermal patch.

    <textblock>
      Morphine controlled-release tablets and fentanyl transdermal patch each relieve
      radiation-induced oral mucositis pain in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. But they do
      so by different mechanisms and in different effects.

      Morphine is a classic strong analgesic, which has been widely used in patients with advanced
      cancer pain. It has achieved satisfactory results in pain control, sleep improvement and
      quality of life. Oral morphine has been regarded as the standard treatment for moderate and
      severe cancer pain.

      Fentanyl transdermal patch is a system device for transdermal delivery of drugs. It is
      compressed on a film containing fentanyl memory. The film can continuously release fentanyl
      into the blood circulation and maintain stable for more than 72 hours. It is not affected by
      gastrointestinal PH or food, and it has no hepatic frst-pass effect, with a bioavailability
      of up to 92%.

      This study will test the efficacy and safety of morphine controlled-release tablets compared
      to fentanyl transdermal patch in the treatment of pain in patients with radiation-induced
      oral mucositis.

    <measure>Pain Intensity Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Through chemoradiotherapy completion, 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported pain intensity once a day according to the numeric rating scale (NRS), with 0-10(0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as can be). The higher scores indicate worse pain.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Related Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Through chemoradiotherapy completion, 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events were recorded during treatment, and the skin was examined for local reactions during treatment and after removal of fentanyl transdermal patch.</description>

    <measure>Quality-of-Life composite Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Through chemoradiotherapy completion, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality-of-Life was assessed using Karnofsky performance status (KPS) standards of the Union for International Cancer Control and SPAASMS (Score for pain, Physical activity levels, Additional pain medication, Additional physician/emergency room visits, Sleep, Mood, and Side effects) scores before and after 3 days of treatment. The higher KPS scores(0-100) of patients indicate better quality of life, but the higher SPAASMS scores(0-31) mean worse outcome.</description>
