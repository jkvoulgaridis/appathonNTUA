  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burkholderia pseudomallei is responsible for melioidosis, a disease that can present a range
      of signs and symptoms and can be treated by a specific drug regimen. Diagnosis of melioidosis
      is made by isolation of the bacteria from body fluids or tissues such as blood, skin or
      sputum. Although this is considered the gold standard, bacterial isolation has low diagnostic
      sensitivity, requires specific infrastructures (biosafety level 3 laboratories) and skilled
      staff that are not always available in LMICs. This may lead to inappropriate patient
      management and care.

      Chembio, in partnership with FIND, has developed a multiplex lateral flow immunoassay (DPP®
      Fever Panel II Assay) that is able to detect antigens from common causes of febrile
      illnesses, included Burkholderia. FIND will conduct a laboratory study in Menzies Health
      School of Research to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the DPP II Assay using
      retrospective samples that are positive for B. pseudomallei. Results will help in estimating
      the diagnostic accuracy of the assay for this pathogen.

        Sera samples were collected between December 2014 and June 2018 for the &quot;Assessment of a
        New Rapid Diagnostic Test for Melioidosis&quot; study that was conducted by the Menzies School
        of Health Research in Darwin, Australia. Patients recruited during that study presented to
        the Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH) with suspicion of melioidosis and consented to provide
        blood samples and to allow their use in diagnostic studies. Their samples are stored at
        -80°C in the Tropical and Emerging Infectious Diseases laboratory at the Menzies School of
        Health Research.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Samples that can be included in the trial must have been collected exclusively during the
        &quot;Assessment of a New Rapid Diagnostic Test for Melioidosis&quot; study (HREC 04/09) conducted by
        the Menzies School of Health Research. They must be well-characterized with confirmation of
        presence or absence of B. pseudomallei by bacterial culture.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Samples with volume &lt;120 µL

          -  Samples collected during projects other than the HREC 04/09 project
