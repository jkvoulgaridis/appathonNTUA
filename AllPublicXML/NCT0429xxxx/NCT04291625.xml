      in congenital ptosis on Egyptian children. included 20 eyelids from 17 Egyptian children with

      This is a prospective non-randomized study to evaluate the recent intraoperative
      lagophthalmos formula method for levator resection in determining postoperative eyelid height
      in congenital ptosis on Egyptian children. The study included 20 eyelids of 17 Egyptian
      children with congenital ptosis with levator function of 4mm or better, they underwent
      levator muscle resection guided by the recent intraoperative lagophthalmos formula.

      Preoperative MRD 1 (Margin-to-reflex distance 1) and levator function were measured, then
      intraoperative palpebral fissure opening was determined from formula: Intraoperative
      lagophthalmos=9.08 - 0.48×Preoperative MRD1 - 0.26× Levator function. Postoperative MRD 1 was
      measured after 1 day, 1week,1month, 3 months and 6 months .Success was defined as
      postoperative MRD 1 ≥ 3 mm and difference between both eyelids height ≤ 1 mm at 6 months.

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Levator muscle resection</intervention_name>
    <description>Surgery was performed under general anaesthesia. Two milliliters of 2% lidocaine with 1:100 000 epinephrine is injected subcutaneously. After the upper eyelid incision at the desired crease line, the orbital septum was opened and the preaponeurotic fat was identified and dissected off the levator aponeurosis. The aponeurosis was disinserted from the tarsus, and the complex of levator aponeurosis and Muller muscle was dissected free from the conjunctiva. The desired eyelid height was determined from the proposed formula.
Satisfactory Intraoperative lagophthalmos was defined as a difference of less than 1 mm between recommended by the formula and actual intraoperative lagophthalmos.
After permanent fixation, a caliper was used for precise measurement of lagophthalmos in a supine position. Additional sutures were placed on the medial and lateral sides for satisfactory eyelid contour. The redundant levator complex was excised. Eyelid crease was made by placing three interrupted sutures</description>
