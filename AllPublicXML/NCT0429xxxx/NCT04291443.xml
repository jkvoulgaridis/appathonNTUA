  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of previous studies for early detection of Orthodontically Induced Inflammatory
      Root Resorption (OIIRR) were conducted to assess individual biomarkers which are
      representative of single biological pathway. To our Knowledge, no studies have been employed
      Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) proteomic analysis to identify potential biomarkers for
      OIIRR. Therefore; the aim of this study is to use the advantage of testing a package of
      biomarkers via doing proteomic analysis of GCF which could help in making a more precise
      personalize diagnosis and treatments, thereby providing orthodontists additional information
      that cannot be deduced from clinical parameters.

    <textblock>
      Orthodontic patients with age range (18-years) indicated for bilateral maxillary first
      premolars extraction as part of their orthodontic treatment using specific fixed orthodontic
      appliance design with moderate anchorage were recruited for this study. Both of these
      premolars were allocated randomly to a heavy ( 225g) and light (25g) force in a split mouth
      design with a 1:1 allocation ratio. (GCF) was collected from the gingival sulcus of these
      teeth before extraction at six time intervals which are baseline, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week , 2
      weeks, 3 weeks and 4 weeks. Plaque and Gingival Indices were recorded for those patients at
      each timeline. Premolars will be extracted after 4weeks to be examined by stereomicroscopy
      for surface area evaluation of root resorption. Proteomic analysis will be carried out on the
      GCF sample. The proteomic analysis of the collected GCF will be obtained by using
      matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/ time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS).
      MS spectra will be used to search human protein sequence data bases for protein
      identification and the development of &quot;Protein Print&quot; specific for these biological
      conditions.

    <masking_description>The GCF measures were coded by a clinician who bonded the appliance using patient ID number and the side of the arch (either right or left sides) to which orthodontic force (either heavy or light force) was allocated blindly for the investigator and outcomes assessor because the clinician could know the type of force from the shape of archwires. The surgeon who extract the teeth was also blinded. The extracted premolars were coded to be masked to the investigator who measured the root resorption areas. All outcome assessors of proteomic analysis as well as the statistician was blinded.</masking_description>
