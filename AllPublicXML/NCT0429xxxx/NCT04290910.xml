  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study evaluating a clinically managed weight loss program. The program
      consists of a 17-week weight loss program which involves a multidisciplinary team where
      personalized interventions are given to participants from the team based on the participants
      goals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinically managed weight loss program is managed by a clinical team including a Program
      Manager, Registered Dietitians, Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology-Certified Personal
      Trainers, Clinical Psychology Associate or Cognitive Behavioural Therapist, and a Physician.
      The team will collaborate together to prescribe a plan best suited for the participants'
      needs with the focus on lifestyle changes, such as, sleep, mental health, and behaviours.
      Outcome measures will be collected as part of the pilot study, such as, anthropometric
      measurements and body composition, cardiovascular assessment, clinical chemistry, physical
      activity, nutrition, and behaviour and health screening questionnaires.

    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured through the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire. The SF-36 measures nine areas: physical functioning, role functioning (emotional), role functioning (physical), energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health, and health change. A higher score indicate greater levels of quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep will be measured through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire measures the quality and pattern of sleep in adults, and includes seven components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. A score of 5 or less is indicated as good sleep quality where a score of 6 or more is indicated as poor sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Intervention Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention adherence will be measured by checking if participants have attended each appointment with the health care professional as implemented by the program. If the participant has attended 80% or more of their appointments, this would be classified as good intervention adherence to the program.</description>

    <description>There are three components of the intervention, this includes: psychology, nutrition, and physical activity. For the psychological portion, a therapist will assess the participant at baseline to determine if there are barriers associated with making lifestyle changes. For nutrition, the dietitian will assess the participant and create a meal plan based on their nutritional needs and guide the participant to reaching their nutritional goals. The psychological and nutrition portion may be interchangeable depending on the participants needs. For physical activity, the personal trainer will assess the participant and create an exercise plan that consists of resistance training and weight bearing exercises suitable for the participant while also guiding the participant to reach their exercise goals.</description>
