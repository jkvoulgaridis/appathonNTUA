      The aim of this study was to compare the parameters of scapular muscular endurance, scapular
      stabilization, scapular dyskinesia, upper extremity functional status and postural alignment
      of adult women aged between 40-65 years old who were performing clinical pilates exercises
      regularly compared with sedentary adult women in the same age group and to determine whether
      regular exercise had an effect on these parameters. A total of 70 individuals were included
      in the study, including 35 individuals performing regular clinical pilates exercises and 35
      individuals with sedentary lifestyles. Clinical pilates group was selected from the
      individuals who participated in the exercise program under the control of a physiotherapist
      regularly for 1 hour, 2-3 days a week for at least 6 months. Socio-demographic
      characteristics, health status and exercise habits of the participants were recorded. For
      scapular muscle strength assessment, digital hand dynamometer; for scapular muscular
      endurance assessment, Scapular Muscular Endurance Test (SMET) and Shoulder External Rotation
      Fatigue Protocol; for the assessment of scapular dyskinesia, Lateral Scapular Slide Test
      (LSST) and Lennie test; for assessment of upper extremity functional status, Disabilities of
      the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (DASH); for the assessment of postural alignment,
      the New York Posture Assessment Test were used.
