  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The indication of antibiotic prophylaxis in burn patients remains highly controversial and
      hasn't reached a consensus. The objective of antibiotic prophylaxis would be to reduce the
      risk of post-operative local and systemic infections. Burn surgery is associated with a high
      risk of bacteremia and postoperative infections and sepsis. However, antibiotic prophylaxis
      exposes to the risk of selecting drug-resistant pathogens as well as adverse effects of
      antibiotics (i.e Clostridium difficile colitis).

      Recommendations regarding perioperative prophylaxis using systemic antibiotics vary across
      sources. The lack of data precludes any international strong recommendations regarding the
      best strategy regarding antibiotic prophylaxis.

      The goal of this project is therefore to determine whether peri-operative systemic
      antibiotics prophylaxis could reduce the incidence of post-operative infections in burn
      patients.

      The intensive care unit investigator will verify the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria.

      The following parameters will be collected at ICU/burn centers: Hemodynamic parameters;
      sepsis organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, Glasgow Coma scale; Medical history /
      comorbidities; Concomitant treatment; Burn wound bacterial colonization; Biological
      parameters.

      The inclusion and randomization will be performed as late as possible before the first
      surgical procedure.

      Randomization: Burn patients with deep burn between 5 to 40% TBSA requiring at least one
      excision surgery graft will be randomized to receive antibioprophylaxis (or placebo) 30
      minutes before the incision with either first generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) (if
      absence of colonization to Pseudomonas aeruginosa); or piperacillin-tazobactam (if the burned
      area is colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa). We chose to target specifically Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa because it has been associated with significant morbidity and risk of graft lysis
      in burn patients.

      No specific exams are required during the 7 days, 28 days and 90 days follow up visits.

      The end of research visit is the 90-day follow-up visit. If the patient has been discharged
      from the hospital, the 90-day visit will consist of a telephone contact with the patient if
      he or she has been discharged home or with the medical team of the healthcare structure if
      the patient has been discharged to another structure.
