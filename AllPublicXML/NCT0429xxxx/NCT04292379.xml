  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will implement and evaluate an integrated, evidence-based bundle of family-centred,
      emergency mental health and addictions care. This care bundle will provide high value to
      families, matching resources and services to need while eliminating healthcare inefficiencies
      and closing care gaps. The bundle will introduce two well-established tools for healthcare
      providers to use in EDs, walk-in clinics, and urgent mental health care appointments. These
      tools are the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) and HEADS-ED, an assessment mnemonic
      (Home; Education &amp; Employment; Activities &amp; Peers; Drugs &amp; Alcohol; Suicidality; Emotions &amp;
      Behaviours; Discharge or Current Resources).

      The bundle will also introduce new processes to improve healthcare system efficiencies,
      navigation and transitions between healthcare sectors. For families who receive care in the
      ED, we will remove the physician gatekeeper role so that children/youth who are screened as
      low-risk will be offered a follow-up appointment in an urgent mental health care clinic
      within 24-48 hours. Those who screen as high-risk will see a mental health specialist and
      undergo a HEADS-ED assessment. Families who follow up in the clinic will receive care that
      applies a Choice And Partnership Approach (CAPA). CAPA is a collaborative approach to
      healthcare, where healthcare providers work in partnership with children/youth and their
      parents to identify choices for care that best match individual needs and preferences.

      Study Goal: Our goal is the right care, with the right people, at the right place and time.

      Study Design: To measure the bundle's impact, we will use an interrupted time series (ITS)
      design.
