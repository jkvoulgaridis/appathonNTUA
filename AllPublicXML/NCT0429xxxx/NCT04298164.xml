  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to look at whether a group programme designed for parents of
      children with a diagnosis of Autism is effective. The programme is called The START Programme
      Â©- as it aims to provide a Supportive and Therapeutic environment to help parents gain
      Acceptance and reach Resolution so that they can Take action to live more consistently with
      their values. The programme was developed by two psychologists in Longford/Westmeath,
      Ireland, Dr. Michelle Howard and Kara McDermott in 2013, because they identified a lack of
      therapeutic support for such parents. The programme draws on research and theory from a
      branch of therapy called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, as well as some other
      psychological techniques. Individuals who agree to participate in the research will be
      assigned at random to the intervention or to a treatment as usual control condition. They
      will be asked to fill out 4 questionnaires, on 3 different occasions, with a 7 week gap
      between the first time and second time, and a 3 month gap between the second and third time.
