  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue influences the kinematics of the knee. Decreasing the tone of the suboccipital
      musculature may decrease the tone of the knee flexors. Inhibition of the suboccipital
      musculature is used to improve ischiosural muscle tension.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the stretching of the
      miodural bridge in the modification of the posture in professional soccer players of 3rd
      division.

      Randomized clinical trial. 30 players will be randomized to the two study groups:
      experimental (technique of stretching technique of the miodural bridge) and control (without
      intervention). A blinded evaluator will perform three evaluations: pretreatment,
      post-treatment and follow-up. The study variables will be: modification of posture and weight
      distribution (plantar pressure platform). The sample distribution will be calculated using a
      Kolmogórov-Smirnov analysis. The changes after each evaluation will be analyzed with the
      t-student test of related samples and through an ANOVA of repeated measures the intra and
      intersubject effect will be observed. The effect size will be calculated using Cohen's
      formula.

      After stretching the miodural bridge, it is expected to see improvement in posture changes.

    <description>An evaluation will be carried out with a pedometric platform. For the evaluation of plantar pressures, we use a plantar pressure platform (Podoprint® S10Pro model). This platform has 4,096 sensors, which allow a maximum pressure of 100 N / cm2 per sensor and has a sampling frequency of 150 Hz. All measurements will be made in accordance with international standards for anthropometric evaluation. All the evaluated players will adopt a relaxed and inert bipedal orthopedic position (arms held at the sides of the body, barefoot, with clothes that allowed to see the feet, legs and knees). With eyes open and looking at a fixed point, at a distance of 1.50 m for 20 seconds.</description>

    <description>An evaluation will be carried out with a pedometric platform, to assess the distribution of body weight after the intervention by stretching the Miodural Bridge. The unit of measure will be the percentage of weight in each of the evaluations</description>

    <description>The intervention will take place over a period of 4 weeks, with 2 weekly sessions, with an estimated execution time of 1.50 to 3 minutes each. A manual therapy technique of inhibition of the suboccipital musculature and an axial traction of the upper hemiarchy will be performed</description>

    <description>The patient will be lying supine, relaxed. The physiotherapist, located at the patient's head, will cover the occipital bone with one hand while the palm of the hand will rest on the lambdoid suture, and the fingers will be introduced into the suboccipital space. The other hand, with a glove, will be inserted into the patient's oral cavity, resting respectively the index and middle fingers, each in an upper dental hemiarchy, on the chewing face of the tooth. An axial traction will be carried out until the three tension barriers of equal size between them are overcome, in an estimated time between 1.50 and 3 minutes. All manual therapy sessions will be performed by the same physiotherapist, following the same protocol and under the same conditions.</description>
