  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Persons living with chronic conditions often have decreased ability to perform
      Activities of Daily Living (ADL) tasks, stressing a need to develop and evaluate intervention
      programs addressing decreased ADL ability. Guided by the British Medical Research Council's
      guidance (MRC) on how to develop and evaluate complex interventions, the program &quot;A Better
      everyday LifE&quot; (ABLE), a home-based intervention program, was developed and feasibility
      tested. The current phase concerns a full-scale evaluation of the ABLE program, including
      evaluation of effectiveness, processes and cost-effectiveness.

      Material and Methods: The design involves a randomized controlled trial with an internal
      pilot. Eighty home dwelling persons living with chronic conditions, experiencing problems
      performing ADL, are randomized to either intervention (ABLE) or control (usual care).

      Co-primary outcomes are self-reported ADL ability measured using ADL-Questionnaire (ADL-Q)
      and observed ADL motor ability measured using Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS).
      Secondary outcomes are perceived satisfaction with ADL task performance, and observed ADL
      process ability. Data is collected at baseline, post intervention and six months after
      baseline. Process evaluation data is collected using registration forms, logbooks and
      semi-structured qualitative interviews.

      The economic evaluation will be performed from a health care sector perspective with 6 months
      follow-up. Costs will be estimated based on micro costing and national registries. Effects
      will be Quality Adjusted Life Years and changes in AMPS ADL ability.
