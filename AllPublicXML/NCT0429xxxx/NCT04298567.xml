  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researcher want to gather more information on the effectiveness and safety of
      Rivaroxaban(Xarelto) when given together with Acetylsalicylic Acid to patients suffering from
      coronary artery disease (a condition that affects the blood vessels supplying the heart) and
      / or peripheral artery disease (a condition that affects the blood vessel of the lower limbs)
      in the routine clinical practice in India. The study plans to enroll about 300 male or female
      patients who are at least 18 years old and are already on the treatment with the two drugs.
      Researchers are especially interested whether patients experience under treatment any events
      such as minor or major bleedings, stroke, sickness of the heart or blood vessels. In addition
      information on why and when treating doctors are deciding to start or stop the treatment with
      Rivaroxaban and Acetylsalicylic Acid are of interest for the researchers.
