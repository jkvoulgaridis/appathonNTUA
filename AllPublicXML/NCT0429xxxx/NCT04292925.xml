  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: To examine the feasibility of a new treatment protocol in improving executive functions
      deficits and participation in daily activities of adults with TBI at discharge and one month
      post discharge.

      A single blind (assessors) randomized control trial (RCT) with two groups, experimental and
      control .

      This study will include 40 adults hospitalized in the inpatient Head Trauma unit.

      Potential patients will be approached by occupational therapists working in the inpatient
      Head Trauma rehabilitation unit and be invited to participate in the study. If they agree,
      they will be asked to sign an informed consent form. Then they will undergo a screening
      assessment. Participants who are found eligible will be then administered a cognitive
      assessment battery. Then they will be randomly allocated to either the experimental (new
      treatment protocol) or the control (conventional therapy) group. In both groups the
      intervention will include 18 treatment sessions of 45 minutes, between three to five times a
      week depending on the participant's state, over a period of four to six weeks. Following the
      intervention, participants will undergo the assessment again. Participation questionnaires
      will be administered by telephone one month post discharge.
