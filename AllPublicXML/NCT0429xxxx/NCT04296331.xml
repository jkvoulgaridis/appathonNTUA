      &quot;Enhancing a universal testing and treatment strategy in jail to promote viral load
      suppression among justice-involved people living with HIV&quot; is an observational research study
      led by Dr. Anne Spaulding, MPH of Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health and Dr.
      Matthew Akiyama, MSc of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center.
      Due to the high rates of undiagnosed Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the correctional
      setting and the short length of stay in jails, this study aims to evaluate whether care
      coordination within the D.C. Central Detention Facility (DC DOC) and upon release, including
      testing procedures and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, can improve the connection of
      adults (age 18 and over) living with HIV to care in the community.

      The researchers will retrospectively look at the aggregate-level de-identified data of
      roughly 3,000 individuals admitted to the DC DOC over a 6-month period to determine the most
      effective HIV diagnostic test for routine opt-out testing in the correctional setting. Over
      the course of these 6 months, the correctional facility will transition from using POC only
      to POC + Ag/Ab, to solely using Ag/Ab, each for a 2-month duration. Individuals from this
      time period who are identified by corrections staff as HIV-positive either through testing
      upon admission, their electronic medical record (EMR) or self-report, and have a known
      release date will be considered eligible for the follow-up study to assess if care
      coordination is effective in linking others with HIV leaving the DC DOC to care. This
      follow-up will enroll 100 of these individuals who have consented to participate following
      their release from the DC DOC, and will consist of a chart review of their DC DOC EMRs and
      those from their community healthcare provider for up to two years after their release.

      This innovative study will be the first to assess the feasibility, process measures, and
      estimate cost-effectiveness of a rUTT intervention in a large urban jail located in
      Washington, DC - 1 of the 50 communities targeted for EtHE efforts (&quot;What is&quot;, 2019). Our aim
      is to determine the most effective HIV diagnostic test to use for routine opt-out testing in
      the correctional setting.

      We hypothesize that the combination of opt-out POC and Ag/Ab tests offered at intake will
      maximize the yield of PLWH detected, provision of test results, ART initiation, viral
      suppression, and cost-effectiveness.

      We will examine administrative, de-identified, aggregate data for approximately 3000
      individuals (based on 500 individuals currently accepting HIV testing per month) over 6
      months. For individuals who provide consent to release their jail medical records after
      incarceration, we will retrieve the mean time from: 1) positive test to receipt of test
      results, 2) receipt of test results to first dose of ART in jail, 3) receipt of post-test
      counseling to meeting the discharge planner, and 4) ART initiation to viral suppression
      defined as a viral load &lt;200 copies/mL. We will calculate the implementation costs of each
      strategy using observation of staff time, market values for items used in the intervention,
      and process measure data collected through chart review (for individuals who consent to
      release their jail medical records after incarceration). Units of resource items, such as
      staff time and diagnostic tests, will be multiplied by their unit costs to calculate total
      costs.

      Please note: This protocol does not constitute research involving prisoners (as outlined by
      the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services Office for Human Research Protections -
      https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/faq/prisoner-research/index.html)
      since we will not be:

        1. Obtaining identifiable private data or information about prisoner subjects through
           intervention or interaction with them while incarcerated.

        2. Seeking the informed consent of prisoners to be subjects in research;

        3. Using, studying or analyzing, for research purposes, identifiable private information
           about prisoners, or identifiable specimens obtained from prisoners; or

        4. Surveying prisoners for this research study.

      The overarching goal of this pilot study is to assess 3 HIV testing strategies as the entry
      point into a rUTT jail-based intervention to promote HIV viral suppression among individuals
      with undiagnosed and diagnosed HIV infections. Among individuals within the DC Department of
      Corrections (DC DOC) we will examine whether opt-out Point-of-Care (POC) rapid testing, 4th
      generation laboratory-based antigen/antibody testing (Ag/Ab), or POC and Ag/Ab testing are
      most effective in identifying HIV infection upon entry into the jails, linking persons to
      care and obtaining viral load suppression. During the medical intake, jail nurses will
      sequentially use, for 2 month each: 1. POC only; 2. POC + Ag/Ab; 3. Ag/Ab only as part of
      standard clinical care (POC: INSTI® rapid test; Ag/Ab: ARCHITECT® laboratory-based test).
      Upon anticipation of release, those who are on ART will be invited to participate in a
      follow-up study regarding their coordination of care while in the DC DOC system and
      post-release, as well as their current viral load status.

      The specific aims are: (1) Compare the feasibility of 3 testing strategies using
      administrative, de-identified, aggregate data to measure the number/percentage of entrants
      who do not opt out of testing and receive their test results in jail. (2) Compare 3 testing
      strategies for time to return of preliminary and confirmed test results, jail-based ART
      initiation (or reinitiation in known PLWH), and referral to discharge planners among
      justice-involved PLWH who consent to release their jail medical records after incarceration.
      (3) Assess the cost of implementing each testing strategy and relative cost-effectiveness of
      the 3 testing strategies in terms of process measures, time to ART initiation, and viral
      suppression.

      This observational study is being conducted by Dr. Anne Spaulding, MD MPH of Emory
      University's Rollins School of Public Health and Dr. Matthew Akiyama, MD MSc of Albert
      Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center through the support of the
      National Institute of Health (NIH) via NYC Center for AIDS Research (CFAR).

      Setting and location The DC DOC is a large urban jail with nearly 8000 intakes per year and
      an average daily population of approximately 2000 individuals. It is estimated that the HIV
      prevalence in this system is approximately 4% with a mean of 60 known PLWH in the population
      at any given time. About 1-3 new HIV diagnoses are made each month with the current POC HIV
      testing program in place. The patient population is predominantly racial/ethnic minorities
      (97% overall; 88% Black, 20% Hispanic - not mutually exclusive due to more than 1
      race/ethnicity), and 91% are at or below the 200% poverty level (HRSA, 2017). As part of the
      Unity Health Care (UHC) clinical program, individuals with newly diagnosed HIV will be
      offered rapid ART initiation, ideally within 24-72 hours of diagnosis with an integrase
      inhibitor-based regimen as per DHHS guidelines (&quot;Guidelines&quot;,2019). Individuals who are known
      to be HIV-positive through the electronic medical record (EMR) or self-report do not undergo
      HIV testing. For those who are ART-experienced, the individual's existing ART regimen is
      restarted. If ART-naïve, an integrase inhibitor-based regimen will be started within 24-72
      hours. Community follow-up is offered within 1-2 weeks of reentry and supported by jail
      discharge planners and community health workers (CHWs). UHC recently began a new 5-year
      contract to provide jail health services, ensuring a consistent healthcare provider for the
      duration of this study. DC has expanded Medicaid, which is an essential to developing an rUTT
      model since it is imperative to ensure no break in ART coverage. Potential participants for
      this study will be recruited from the DC DOC system

      It is estimated that aggregate-level data will be collected for 3,000 individuals who are
      admitted to the DC DOC system over the 6-month study period and accept HIV testing upon
      entry. Of those tested, preliminary eligibility will be based on the following criteria:

        1. Admitted to DC DOC between January 15th, 2020 and June15th, 2020, or 6 months beyond the
           start date if enrollment begins after January 15th, 2020

        2. Has initiated ART by time of release

        3. Being HIV-positive: confirmed either through HIV testing upon entry, was known to be
           HIV-positive through the EMR, or self-reported being HIV-positive

      For the past 12 years DC DOC has offered opt-out POC testing with the INSTI® finger stick
      test at entry. During booking (in the intake medical evaluation unit, prior to processing
      individuals into jail) jail nurses will sequentially use, for 2 month each: 1. POC only; 2.
      POC + Ag/Ab; 3. Ag/Ab only as part of standard clinical care (POC: INSTI® rapid test; Ag/Ab:
      ARCHITECT® laboratory-based test). To assist UHC with this transition, we have secured
      in-kind donation of INSTI® rapid test kits (see letter of support). Over 6 months of testing
      we anticipate approximately 3000 individuals will be tested (based on 500 individuals
      currently accepting HIV testing per month). The number of new HIV diagnoses that will be made
      is not known; however, we anticipate the number will be higher using Ag/Ab testing than the
      1-3 new diagnoses that are made each month using the current POC rapid testing strategy.

      After each of the 3 testing phases the project team will request, from DC DOC, data from
      their EMR. Specifically, they will request administrative, de-identified, aggregate data that
      does not contain any of the 18 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
      identifiers for: 1) the total number of entrants, 2) the number of entrants with HIV test
      results (indicating they have not opted out of testing), 3) the number of post-test
      counseling visits (indicating receipt of test results), 4) the number of positive HIV tests,
      and 5) the median and mean length of stay for the entire population. The individuals for whom
      these data are available and are on ART at time of jail release are considered &quot;EMR-eligible
      participants.&quot; Aggregate-level data will be collected on all individuals admitted to DC DOC
      beginning January 15th, 2019.

      Participants for the post-release portion of the study will be recruited at exit from the DC
      DOC system. Currently the DC DOC provides all patients who are on ART with a 30-day supply
      upon release. Inmates who are released and have entered the jail during the study period will
      receive an invitation letter to participate in the study that will be attached to their
      30-day supply of ART, which they will pick up at release.

      'Invitation to Participate Letters' from UHC will inform EMR-eligible participants that they
      may be eligible to participate in a paid observational research study about the effectiveness
      of opt-out rUTT strategies for HIV (see attached letter). Potentially eligible participants
      are instructed to contact the UHC research coordinator (RC) if they are interested in being a
      part of the study, or to find out more information. The letter will state that for this
      observational study participants will only have to continue their standard HIV care with
      their provider. They will only have to meet with the study team once in order to conduct the
      eligibility screening and sign the informed consent authorizing the study team to receive the
      participants EMR from DC DOC and their community provider for two years following their
      release.
