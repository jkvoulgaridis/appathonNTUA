      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of triamcinolone
      acetonide in patients with serous pigment epithelial detachment associated with age-related
      macular degeneration.

      This study is planned as a follow-up. Patients with with serous pigment epithelial detachment
      associated with age-related macular degeneration included in it will receive triamcinolone
      acetonide in accordance with the approved indications for use indicated in the instructions
      for the use of drugs in Ukraine.

      The treatment proposed in this study is based on the world experience and scientific
      developments of the Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue Therapy of the NAMS of
      Ukraine &quot;. Therefore, it is expected that the benefit / risk ratio in relation to the
      participation in this study should not be different from that described in the scientific
      literature and the benefits outweigh the risk. It is known that the absence of treatment in
      these diseases leads to an irreparable loss of central vision.
