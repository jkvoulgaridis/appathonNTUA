  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single center，observational cohort study to explore the relationship between reproductive
      tract microbiota and pregnancy outcome in the patients accepted IVF/ICSI. To investigate
      whether there is a correlation between reproductive tract microbiota and IVF/ICSI outcomes.
      Whether there are differences in reproductive tract microbiota (such as vagina, follicular
      fluid, uterine cavity, etc.) in patients with different pregnancy outcomes.

      A single center，observational cohort study will enroll 120 infertile participants and then
      divide them into 3 groups: 1)Male infertility；2)Recurrent implantation failure; 3)Recurrent
      spontaneous abortion. The study will last for 1 year and recruit participants in Reproductive
      medicine center of Peking university third hospital. Each participant will be followed up for
      at least 1 year. Collect samples and record information at the first month, then follow-up 2
      months to record the pregnancy outcomes. DNA will be extracted from the samples and then have
      sequence to figure out the compositions of microbiota.
