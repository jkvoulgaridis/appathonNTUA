    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the biological effects of DS-8201a on patients with HER2 positive
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced). DS-8201a works by binding to a
      protein called HER2 that is present on the surface of tumor cells. This allows DS-8201a to
      kill the tumor cells by damaging their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), resulting in tumor cell
      death. This study looks at how DS-8201a may affect the levels of certain proteins and immune
      cells in tumors and how well the drug works against tumor cells by examining cells from a
      small piece tumor taken before and after DS-8201a is given.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the effects of trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) on topoisomerase 1 cleavable
      complex (Top1cc) formation in biopsy specimens from patients with HER2-expressing advanced
      solid tumors, at early and late post-treatment time points, thereby establishing the degree
      and duration of DS-8201 target engagement.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess any associations between plasma concentrations of DS-8201a and the effects of
      DS-8201a on Top1cc formation in tumor biopsy specimens.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of DS-8201a administered intravenously every 3
      weeks, in 21-day cycles, at a dose of 5.4 mg/kg.

      III. To determine the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR])
      for patients administered intravenously with DS-8201a every 3 weeks, in 21-day cycles, at a
      dose of 5.4 mg/kg.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of DS-8201a on CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation in tumor,
      tumor PD-L1 and HER2 expression, and DDR signaling (gamma H2AX, RAD51, and phosphorylated
      [p]NBS1) in biopsy specimens.

      II. To examine genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) that may be associated
      with DS-8201a response or resistance.

      III. To examine any associations between baseline tumor HER2 amplification or HER2 expression
      level and response to DS-8201a.

      IV. To evaluate the effects of DS-8201a on tumor levels of HER2 and DDR-associated proteins.

      V. To examine any tumor genomic alterations that may be associated with resistance to
      DS-8201a.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
      Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             meet the following eligibility requirements:

               -  They must be stable on their anti-retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy
                  from an HIV perspective

               -  They must have a CD4 count of greater than 250 cells/mcL over the past 6 months
                  on this same anti-retroviral regimen and must not have had a CD4 count &lt; 200
                  cells/ul over the past 2 years, unless it was deemed related to the cancer and/or
                  immunotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression

                    -  For patients who have received chemotherapy in the past 6 months, a CD4
                       count &lt; 250 cells/ul during chemotherapy is permitted as long as viral loads
                       were undetectable during this same chemotherapy

                  infection and must not have had an opportunistic infection within the past 6
                  months HIV-infected patients should be monitored every 12 weeks for viral load
                  and CD4 counts

          -  For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral
             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated

          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load

          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after
             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression for &gt;=
             1 month after treatment of the brain metastases

          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial

          -  The effects of DS-8201a on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because HER2 antibodies conjugated to topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agents are known to be
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation and for at least 4.5 months
             after the last dose of study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4.5 months after completion of DS-8201a administration

          -  Women of non-child-bearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a
             documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL [&lt; 147 pmol/L]
             is confirmatory) are eligible. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
             menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods
             outlined for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT
             during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive
             method

          -  Subjects must not freeze, donate, or retrieve for their own use ova or sperm starting
             at screening, throughout the study period, and for at least 4.5 months after the final
             study drug administration. Preservation of sperm or ova should be considered prior to
             enrollment in this study

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with DS-8201a, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with DS-8201a

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy (including antibody drug therapy, retinoid therapy,
             hormonal therapy for cancer) within 4 weeks or five half-lives, whichever is shorter,

                  severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], restrictive lung disease,
                  pleural effusion, etc.), and any autoimmune, connective tissue, or inflammatory
                  disorders with potential pulmonary involvement (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis,
