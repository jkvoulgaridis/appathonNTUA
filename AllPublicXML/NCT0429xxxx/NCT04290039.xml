    <textblock>
      This randomized, three-sequence, three-period, phase 1 study is designed to assess the
      bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of sublingually administered atropine sulfate
      ophthalmic solution 1% USP (at 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg; test) compared to atropine sulfate
      injection administered IV (1.0 mg; reference).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, three-sequence, three-period crossover study to assess the
      bioavailability and PK of a single dose of atropine administered sublingually in healthy
      adult volunteers. At least 15 healthy male and female volunteers will be enrolled to obtain
      approximately 12 evaluable subjects in the per protocol population. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of three treatment dosing sequences (A, B, or C).

             must have used an acceptable method of birth control for at least 2 months prior to
             Screening, and must agree to continue using an acceptable method of birth control from
             Screening to Follow-up (Day 21).

             A female of childbearing potential is defined as postonset menarche and premenopausal
             female capable of becoming pregnant. This does not include females who meet any of the
             following conditions: menopausal &gt; 2 years, tubal ligation &gt; 1 year, bilateral
             salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy.

             Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with a failure rate of
             less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and when applicable, in
             accordance with the product label. Examples include oral contraceptives, injectable
             progestogen, implants of etonogestrel or levonorgestrel, estrogenic vaginal ring,
             percutaneous contraceptive patches, intrauterine device or intrauterine system, or

             Visit.

          4. In the judgment of the investigator, the subject is in good health, based on review of
             medical history and the results of screening evaluation (including vital signs,
             physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and routine clinical laboratory testing, performed
             no more than 14 days prior to randomization into the study)

          5. Able to comply with the dosing instructions and available to complete the study

             a negative hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) confirmation test and who no longer
             require antiviral therapy, are eligible for participation. (Screening tests will not
             be repeated prior to subsequent dosing.)

          5. Subjects who took any prescription medications (with the exception of oral
             contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy) within 30 days of screening. Prior to
             each dose, the investigator will review prohibited medication use and determine
             whether the subject should be terminated from further dosing.

          6. Subjects who took any over-the-counter medication/vitamins/herbal supplements in the
             last 72 hours prior to screening. Prior to each dose, the investigator will review

             further dosing.

          7. Subjects with glaucoma and/or history of ocular surgery (including Lasik), ocular
             trauma, or congenital ocular disorder

          8. Subjects with any history of heart disease including but not limited to coronary
             artery disease, arrhythmia (treated or untreated), congestive heart failure,

          9. Subjects with clinically significant arrhythmias or abnormal conduction; abnormal
             conduction is defined as a prolonged PR or QRS, or a QTc ≥ 450 msec for males or ≥ 470
             msec for females

             radiation therapy to the head and neck

         12. Males with history of symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy; males or females with a
             history of hesitancy or retention

         13. Subjects with a blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mm Hg taken after the subject has been seated
             and resting for at least five minutes

         14. Subjects with a history or current diagnosis of myasthenia gravis

         15. Subjects with a history of drug or alcohol abuse in the last two years or evidence of
             a positive urine drug test at screening. (This screening test will not be repeated
             prior to subsequent dosing.)

         16. Subjects with a known sensitivity or prior adverse reaction to atropine

        Subjects cannot be rescreened for exclusionary laboratory test results. Potentially
        exclusionary vital sign results may be repeated once. If a subject's repeat vitals remain
        exclusionary or the investigator determines that the repeat vital signs could pose a risk
        to the subject participating in the study, then the subject will be excluded.
