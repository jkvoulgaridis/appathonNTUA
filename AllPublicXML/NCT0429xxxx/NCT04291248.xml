    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib combined with AK105
      injection or AK105 monotherapy in subjects with MSI-H or dMMR advanced solid tumors. In this
      study, 138 subjects will be enrolled, and those who met the admission criteria will divide
      into cohort 1 (anlotinib combined with AK105) and cohort 2 (AK105 ). The first phase of this
      study is a randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled, multicenter design, in which 30
      subjects are randomly enrolled in two cohorts. The second phase is to continue enrollment of
      cohort 1 or cohort 2 when which cohort has the better clinical benefit than the other one.
