  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of passive smoking on oxidative
      stress and dental caries in children.A total of 180 children were included to the study as
      follows; 90 children exposed to passive smoking, and 90 children in the control group
      (unexposed controls). Also demographic data were recorded (age, gender, parental education
      levels, child's tooth-brushing habit and child's daily dietary sugar exposure, family
      income). Dental examination of children were performed and caries prevalence of the patients
      were recorded. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected from children. Saliva 'cotinine
      levels' and oxidative stress markers 'total antioxidant status' (TAS), and' total oxidant
      status' (TOS) were evaluated by using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The obtained
      data parameters of the two groups were evaluated and comparison was performed.
