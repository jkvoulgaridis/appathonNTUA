  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether a stretching intervention is superior to a
      usual care control condition (moderate/vigorous activity 30 minutes daily, 5 days per week)
      for pregnant women from 27 to 37 gestational weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although being sedentary can lead to excess risk for maternal and child mortality and
      morbidity, most pregnant women reduce their physical activity and only 8% meet the
      recommendations in the 3rd trimester.

      In a prior randomized control trial, it was found that fewer women who stretched developed
      preeclampsia than did women who walked (3/60 &quot;stretchers&quot; vs. 10/64 &quot;walkers&quot;, p=.05).

      In this study, participants will either receive a stretching intervention
