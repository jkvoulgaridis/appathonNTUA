  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access program in the USA to enable eligible patients with previously
      treated small cell lung cancer to access lurbinectedin treatment prior to FDA approval. Sites
      must apply to participate in the program. A medical doctor must assess whether the potential
      benefit outweighs the risk of the investigational therapy considering the program eligibility
      criteria and the individual patient's medical history.
