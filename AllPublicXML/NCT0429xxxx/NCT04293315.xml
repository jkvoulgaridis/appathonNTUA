    <textblock>
      Introduction: Early detection of certain types of cancer significantly increases the
      likelihood of successful treatment and reduces mortality from these causes. However, the use
      of screening and the early detection of selected tumors such as colorectal cancer (CRC) are
      lower than those expected in our country. The objective of this project is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a multicomponent strategy that improves the screening and early detection of
      CRC in the population at risk of Primary Health Care Clinics (PCCs) of the public health
      system.

      Population: people leaving in the catchment area of 10 selected primary care clinics from the
      public health system in the province of Mendoza, Argentina.

      Design and methods: a Randomized clinical study by clusters. 10 PCCs will be included: 5 will
      be randomly assigned to receive an intervention to increase the CRC screening rates
      (improvement cycles) and 5 to the control arm (usual care). 150 participants will be included
      in each PCCs, in total, 1500 participants.

      Intervention: An innovative vision is proposed, which combines a participatory and dynamic
      methodology based on improvement cycles. This approach includes the implementation of
      participatory learning sessions for health providers, involving the effectors of the design
      of the intervention. In the intervention branch at least 3 workshops (sessions) will be held
      with the members of the care system, in order to identify opportunities for improvement
      oriented to the design and application of an innovative intervention based on best practices.
      Each one of the sessions will constitute an analysis of the improvement cycle, following the
      following steps: 1) Selection of participants of the initial workshop; 2) Development of work
      model based on bibliographic review and initial qualitative phase; 3) Initial workshop with
      effectors for training in continuous improvement, objectives, interventions and data
      collection; 4) Learning workshops to discuss results, applicability of interventions and
      modifications to the work plan; 5) Closing session to evaluate preliminary results and
      discuss continuity of interventions beyond the project.

      Outcomes: 1) Percentage of the population at risk that completes the screening; 2) Percentage
      of the population classified as at habitual risk or increased by risk factors.
