    <textblock>
      The I-MAT trial is a phase II randomised and placebo-controlled trial for patients with
      Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) to explore efficacy and tolerability of avelumab as adjuvant
      immunotherapy.

    <textblock>
      The I-MAT trial is a phase II, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled,
      multi-institutional trial for patients with stage I-III Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).
      Treatment will be avelumab vs placebo for 6 months duration. The primary aim of the I-MAT
      trial is to develop an effective, well-tolerated adjuvant immunotherapy regimen for patients
      with stage I-III MCC, post a range of definitive loco-regional treatment options.

      Biological differences for Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV)-positive versus MCPyV-negative
      patients in the adjuvant setting will be explored.

    <description>RFS, the primary endpoint, is anticipated to be analysed over an average planned follow-up of 3.5 years per participant. An analysis of RFS at the 24 month time point of follow-up per participant will also be conducted as it is anticipated that the minimum follow-up per patient will be 24 months and the sample size rationale utilises RFS rates at 24 months in historical controls. RFS is defined as the time from treatment initiation until the first date of any signs or symptoms of recurrence of tumour.</description>

         16. Any acute or chronic psychiatric problems that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             make the patient ineligible for participation due to compliance concerns.

         17. Patients with prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation.

         18. Patients who are involuntarily incarcerated.
