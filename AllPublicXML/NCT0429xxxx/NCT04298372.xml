      This phase II clinical trial aimed at influencing the improvement of major organ functions,
      especially the objective response rate, in Amyloid light-chain amyloidosis involving
      myocardium.

      This study was designed according to the 18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography
      imaging, which successfully demonstrated a significant reduction in the amount of amyloid in
      the heart when administered by merging thalidomide and dexamethasone in patients involving
      myocardium, and reported that this reaction leads to an improvement in cardiac function.
      Amyloid light-chain amyloidosis patients at age 19 or older with refractory or relapsed who
      participants should have never been exposed to lenalidomide within 5 years. Planned initial
      dosage of the current regimen are as follow;

        -  Lenalidomide : D1~D21 daily oral administration, starting dose 15mg, with an increase of
           5mg every cycle, if tolerated, up to 25mg.

        -  Dexamethasone : D1~D4 daily oral administration or intravenous injection, 40mg(or 20mg
           for age for age ≥ 65 years old) Patients will be treated every 4 weeks as one cycle, and
           up to 12 cycles of treatment will be conducted. The investigator is working on a total
           of 30 patients, the primary endpoint of this study is objective response rate and
           secondary endpoints are cardiac/renal/hepatic function, 18F-florbetaben positron
           emission tomography imaging parameter, overall survival period, progression-free
           survival period, toxicity profile.
