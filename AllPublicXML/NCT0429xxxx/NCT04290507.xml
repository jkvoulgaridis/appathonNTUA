  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is a severe life-threatening reaction following exposure to an antigen. Its
      incidence is progressively increasing in the general population over years, accompanied with
      an increased number of hospitalizations. Although rare, this condition is often associated
      with a significant morbidity and mortality. The mortality rate has been recently estimated at
      0.84 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.88) per million per year in the French adult population. Age, chronic
      medication and cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities have been reported to increase the risk of
      a severe reaction. Obesity, age and cardiovascular comorbidities have been identified as risk
      factors for fatal anaphylaxis. However, the risk factors for death after ICU admission have
      not been elucidated yet.
