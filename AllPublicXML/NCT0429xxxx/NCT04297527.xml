  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifty five participants diagnosed with CNSLBP, will randomized into three groups. Group I (18
      subjects) will receive 15 sessions of Conventional Physiotherapy program (CPP) 5 times per
      week, Group II (19 subjects) will receive 9 sessions of SNAGs, and Group III will receive CPP
      plus SNAGs. Outcome measures are pain, ROM, spinal mobility, fear avoidance behaviour and
      function. Measurements will record before, after and 6 month after the end of the treatment.

      Inclussion criterias are; low back pain for at least 3 months, intensity of pain ranges from
      3 to 6 according to VAS. Exclussion criterias are; undergoing surgical operation in the
      lumbar region or having a surgical indication, having an exercise therapy and / or physical
      therapy in the last 1 year, a history of trauma involving lumbar region and systemic and
      inflammatory disease targeting this region, participants using corticosteroids for a long
      time and being pregnant.Acording to our criterias 55 participants diagnosed with CNSLBP will
      randomised into three groups. Group 1 will receive Conventional Physiotherapy programme
      consisting of Hot pack, US and TENS applications. Group II aill receive Lumbar SNAGS
      consisting of Lumbar Extension SNAGS in prone, SNAGS in lion position and Lumbar flexion
      SNAGS in sitting, techniques. Group III will receive 9 sessions of SNAGs, and Group III will
      receive CPP plus SNAGs.Outcome measures are pain, ROM, spinal mobility, fear avoidance
      behaviour and function. Measurements will record before, after and 6 month after the end of
      the treatment. All treatment groups were treated with the same researcher. All assessments
      were made by another blind researcher three times at before, after and 6 month after
      treatment.
