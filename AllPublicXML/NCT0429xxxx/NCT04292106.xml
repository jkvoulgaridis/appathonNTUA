  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Red Spinach is a natural food which is a rich source of nitrates, which are beneficial in
      hemodynamics, cardiovascular function, and have natural hypotensive and antianginal effects.
      Red spinach extract has been shown to be beneficial in exercise performance, albeit mostly in
      aerobic exercise. In a previous study in our lab, we found that dietary nitrate consumption
      resulted in significantly greater isometric force production in teenage males. However,
      currently there is little know regarding the effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on
      isometric strength, resistance exercise and cognitive performance.

      This research study is designed to measure the effects of red spinach extract (RSE) on
      markers of physical and cognitive performance during and following anaerobic exercise.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-34 years old Participants must have at least 1 year of resistance training
             experience.

          -  Free of any physical limitations, medications, and supplements that may affect
             performance, as determined by a health and activity questionnaire.

          -  Are free of musculoskeletal injuries

          -  Are not taking medications that may interfere with study measurements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants that cannot take either the RSE or placebo supplement will be excluded,
             as this will be a double-blind study.

          -  Furthermore, participants that cannot participate in pre- and post-research testing,
             and/or those that cannot commit to regular training sessions will be excluded.

          -  Inability to perform physical exercise (determined by health and activity
             questionnaire)

          -  Taking any other nutritional supplement or performance enhancing drug.

          -  Any chronic illness that causes continuous medical care
