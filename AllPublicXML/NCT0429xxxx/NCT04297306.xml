  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a vital part of cardiopulmonary conditioning, this means improving general
      fitness. Undertaking surgery has been likened, physiologically, to running a marathon. It is
      essential that before any operation the patient undergoing the procedure is as optimised as
      possible.

      Bariatric surgery is no exception. Patients with a high weight often have other conditions
      most commonly related to the heart and lungs through the excess visceral fat content. This
      places this group of patients at particular risk of potentially, albeit rare, of having a
      major and possibly catastrophic cardiac event on the operating table during anaesthetic.
      Pre-operative conditioning is therefore vital in this group of patients who are often young
      and not other than their weight necessarily unwell. Exercise plays an important role in the
      run up to surgery however, many pre-operative exercise prescription programs in the past have
      failed, often related to the lack of compliance. However, this maybe due to the poor body
      image they have of themselves presenting in public to the gym or swimming pool.

      Current Virtual Reality Games propose that, through their use they encourage exercise and
      increase heart rate. Given the more personalised nature of this form of media over public
      engagement, this new media may offer an opportunity to explore whether there is any benefit
      in terms of pre-conditioning this group of patients prior to their surgery. This study aims,
      in its first instance, to evaluate whether the Virtual Reality promoted exercise games
      encourage and can sustain increased activity prior to surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that the annual social care costs of obesity to NHS local authorities is Â£352
      million. Obesity surgery currently offers the only long term cure but it carries substantial
      risk to a group of patients who are often young with other obesity related health concerns;
      including of the heart and lungs.

      The need to improve the condition of the heart and lungs within this patient group prior to
      surgery is essential. Activity can improve these organs and promote a much lower risk during
      surgery, reducing the risk of heart attacks or dangerous abnormal rhythms of the heart from
      occurring during the procedure.

      Although exercise alone cannot support long term weight-loss it is vital to promoting a
      stronger healthier heart in the short term prior to surgery.

      This study aims to explore the use of Virtual Reality Gaming to increase activity within this
      patient group compared to simply encouraging exercise as is undertaken in standard current
      practice. The initial consideration is as to whether this new media is capable of increasing
      activity in this group and hopefully improve their heart and lungs going into surgery.
