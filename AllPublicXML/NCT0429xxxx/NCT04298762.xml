  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Documenting cancer stage is the most important determinant of treatment approach and survival
      for cancer patients. However, oncologists do not routinely document a patient's cancer stage
      in the structured field in electronic health records. This quality improvement pilot study
      evaluated the impact of sending an email to physicians at a cancer center of a large academic
      hospital with individualized data on their rates of cancer stage documentation using a
      structured field. The investigators assessed patient-level documentation and physician-level
      rates of staging documentation over 15 months including a three-month pre-period, a six-month
      pilot phase and a six-month follow-up period. The investigators also estimated staging
      documentation rates separately for each physician's new versus established patients.
