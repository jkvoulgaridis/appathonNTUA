  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PAPRIKA establishes a technologically enabled and personalized prehabilitation and follow-up
      after surgical intervention program for patients undergoing elective major surgery Program
      creates close collaboration between the medical environment and the patients empowering them
      to co-create their own care.

      It is at the first stage aimed to high-risk patients undergoing major surgery. Better
      condition before the surgery is proved to reduce the perioperative complications and to
      improve patients' health-related quality of life while cutting the associated costs. The
      concept integrates short-term (average 4 weeks) preoperative interventions including
      endurance training, promotion of physical activity and nutritional and psychological support.
      Interventions are planned both at community and at hospital reducing unnecessary interactions
      between patients and tertiary care.

      PAPRIKA tackles three major drivers: i) human perspective ii) organizational challenges and
      iii) technical aspects. The project is based on previous experience on prehabilitation and
      the already refined service using design thinking methodologies. It will be also based on the
      proven reduction of associated costs for the healthcare system.

    <description>Prospective sample of risk patients who are candidates for major surgery attended in the outpatient offices of the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona.
Inclusion criteria: i) American Society of Anesthesiologists Index (ASA) 3-4; and / or, ii) age ≥ 75 years; and / or iii) major aggressive surgery; and, iv) solid organ transplant candidate.

    <description>The preoperative standard measures consist of physical activity recommendation and advice on both smoking cessation and alcohol intake reduction. Moreover, in patients presenting with anemia, the anesthesiologists will assess its etiology and treat it accordingly, and nutritional intervention will be performed by a registered dietitian in to those patients at risk of malnutrition (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool ≥2).</description>
