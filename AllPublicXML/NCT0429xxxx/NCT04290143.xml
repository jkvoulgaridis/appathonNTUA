      Introduction: The beneficial health effects of healing waters have been reported by numerous
      studies. However, the lack of proper placebo substance makes the &quot;medication-like&quot;
      investigation of healing waters difficult. The investigators aimed to develop and validate an
      easy-to use cheap method capable of producing placebo from tap water.

      Methods: Both medical water and tap water will be colored. The temperature and the pH of the
      tap water will be adjusted to the temperature pH of the healing water. The patients will be
      divided into two groups, colored healing water and placebo group. A single 20 minutes-long
      treatment will be performed in bath tubs. Considering the healing waters odor, the treatment
      will be given in the same room. Patients will be asked to tell whether they are treated with
      colored healing water or placebo or could not tell. Questions will be asked before the
      treatment, 10 minutes after the beginning of the treatment, immediately after the end of the
      treatment and after shower. The study will be performed in a double blind setup. Patients
      will be scored, one point for each correct answer.

      Target patient number:174
