  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Multi-center, Open-label, Randomized Controlled,phase 2 clinical trail of an immune
      checkpoint inhibitor in patients with advanced or recurrent gastric and esophagogastric
      junction adenocarcinoma, including two arms to compare the efficacy and safety of
      Albumin-bound Paclitaxel Plus SHR-1210 （PD-1 inhibitor）regimen and Albumin-bound Paclitaxel
      single-agent regimen in second-line treatment.
