      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase 1: To characterize the safety and tolerability of isatuximab in kidney transplant
           candidates.

        -  Phase 2: To evaluate the efficacy of isatuximab in desensitization of patients awaiting
           kidney transplantation.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Phase 2: To characterize the safety profile of isatuximab in kidney transplant
           candidates.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of isatuximab in kidney transplant
           candidates.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab.

        -  To assess the overall efficacy of isatuximab in desensitization of patients awaiting
           kidney transplantation.

      The study will have a screening period of up to 28 days, a treatment period of up to 12
      weeks, a site visit FUP of up to 26 weeks, and an extended FUP until study cutoff.

      The study duration that involves site visit per participant (ie, screening, treatment, site
      visit FUP) will be approximately 42 weeks.

      The study duration including extended FUP per participant will be approximately 78 weeks
      (depending when the participant is enrolled).
