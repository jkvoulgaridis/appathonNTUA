  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine differences between NAFLD and NASH subjects with respect to hepatic FA
      metabolism (uptake, oxidation, and re-esterification) and hepatic VLDL-TG secretion and
      peripheral kinetics (oxidation and tissue storage). 8 non-diabetic upper-body obese subjects
      with NAFLD and 8 with NASH (biopsy proven) will be studied in the overnight fasted state.
      VLDL-TG stable isotope will be used in combination with hepatic vein catherization to
      directly measure splanchnic VLDL-TG uptake and secretion. FFA (palmitate) tracers as well as
      adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies will be used to measure whole-body substrate
      turnover and flexibility as well as tissue specific substrate handling during fasting and
      hyperinsulinemic conditions.
