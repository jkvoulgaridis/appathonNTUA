    <textblock>
      The design of the study includes 3 groups for women with premenstrual syndrome, 1low dose
      acupuncture in the low-dose group, 2 high dose acupuncture in the high-dose group, and 3 the
      drug group (contraceptives) . Serum marker change of PGE2, CA125, E2, and progesterone in
      enrolled patients will be measured before and after treatment, along with VAS and MDQ
      questionnaires. The treatment efficacy of different groups and the relationship between PMS
      and patients TCM syndrome pattern will also be recorded and estimated.

      Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is the sum of a group of symptoms (including physical and
      psychological symptoms) that occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Women who
      have such symptoms have been estimated as high as 75%; of which 3% to 8% are severe symptoms,
      called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (premenstrualdysphoric syndrome, PMDD). The two groups
      are very similar. PMS is mostly for physical discomfort, while PMDD is for emotional
      problems, affecting women's sleep seriously.

      Regarding the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), western medicine adopt oral
      contraceptive pills (OCP) as the first-line medication. However, the common side effects of
      OCP, such as headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, depression, breast pain and so on are
      also troublesome, In recent years, some women also use acupuncture as an adjunctive
      replacement therapy because of its safety and fewer side effects. Nevertheless, the factors
      affecting treatment effect of acupuncture and moxibustion. such as the selection of acupoint
      s ( of which meridians) or number(dose) of acupuncture ,etc., maight affect the efficacy, yet
      the relevant research on this issue is not enough. In traditional Chinese medicine theory,
      acupuncture and moxibustion regulate the energy of the meridians and adjust blood and qi,
      which in turn help the balance of yin and yang. Female menstrual cycle is a process of
      conversion between yin and yang in TCM theory. While in western medicine, it is regulated by
      the endocrine system.
