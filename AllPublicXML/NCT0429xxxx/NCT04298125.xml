  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Expecting intervention as delivered in prior studies in a clinical setting is described
      in a previous approved IRB submission (Protocol 202954). The current project will seek to
      engage community stakeholders to translate Expecting to a community-delivered intervention
      and to test its acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity in a proof of principle study with
      60 expecting mothers.

      The aim of this study is to adapt and determine acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of
      the research- clinic-based Expecting intervention with pregnant women with obesity in
      community settings. Specifically, the investigators will show effective application of the
      Replicating Effective Programs (REP) framework (e.g., fidelity, feasibility, acceptability)
      to translate the research clinic-based intervention to community settings. REP provides a
      four-phase process for implementing evidence-based interventions and has demonstrated
      effective application to translate clinical interventions to community settings. Built into
      the REP framework is the collection of feedback from community stakeholders, iterative
      piloting of the intervention in the community, and a process for standardizing the
      intervention across community settings. Following adaptation, the updated intervention will
      be piloted. The pilot study will include 60 expecting women. The investigators will randomize
      half to receive the community-adapted Expecting intervention (Intervention, N=30) and half to
      receive standard of care (Control, N=30).

    <description>The Expecting intervention at the ACNC includes three 30-45 minute, in-person exercise sessions per week. The sessions are gradually increased in length over the first weeks of participation, and are comprised of 15-30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (recumbent bike, walking on a treadmill or on an elliptical machine) as well as 5-10 minutes of resistance training using hydraulic exercise equipment. The sessions conclude with stretching exercises. Throughout the session, a personal trainer assesses the rating of perceived exertion using the 6 to 20 point Borg scale of exhaustion.41 Between sessions, participants are asked to monitor their daily step count with a target of 10,000 steps per day using a pedometer provided to the participant. This number is reported to or downloaded by the personal trainer at each in-person session. These elements will be adapted to provide a similar exercise experience that is accessible to women in their local community.</description>
