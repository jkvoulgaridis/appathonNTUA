  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual Reality allows the integration of cognitive rehabilitation in a more ecologically
      valid context.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether this methodology has more impact on
      psychosocial rehabilitation than a paper and pencil personalized program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments are frequently present on many psychiatric diseases, such as
      schizophrenia, depression, etc. and are not always given sufficient attention despite its
      limitations in activities of daily living (ADL's). Current cognitive rehabilitation methods
      mostly rely on paper-and-pencil tasks targeting isolated domains, which is not consistent
      with everyday life, and have limited ecological validity.

      Virtual Reality (VR) has shown to be a solution for the development of accessible and
      ecologically valid systems but, does it have more impact than a paper and pencil personalized
      intervention?

      Through a participatory design approach, with health professionals, the investigators have
      developed:

      a motor-accessible and cognitive-personalized VR-based system, where conventional cognitive
      tasks were operationalized in meaningful simulations of ADL's (Reh@City) and; a web tool
      which generates personalized paper and pencil tasks (Task Generator).

      The investigators goal is to have a sample of 30 inpatients from a psychosocial
      rehabilitation unit, with no age limit, randomly allocated in two groups: 1) the experimental
      group, where participants will perform 30 minutes of the VR training with Reh@City; and 2)
      the control group, where participants will perform 30 minutes of the paper and pencil
      training with the Task Generator.

    <description>Change from baseline in the Beck Depression Inventory - II. It is a self-report inventory that aims to measure the severity of depression. Can be scored between 0-63. Minimal depression, 0-11; Mild depression, 12-18; Moderate depression, 19-24; Severe depression, above 25.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in the Barthel Index. It's a scale that measures functionality, with features of activities of daily living with the item: bowel control, bladder control, personal hygiene, using the toilet, eating, transferring, walking on a level surface, getting dressed and undressed, going up and down stairs, taking a shower. The maximum score obtainable is 100 points: scores between 91-99, correspond to slight dependence; 61-90, to moderate dependence; 21-60, to serious dependence; and 0-20, to total dependence.</description>

    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life - Bref (WHOQOL-Bref) - Quality of Life Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End (8 weeks) and 8-weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the WHOQOL-Bref Quality of Life Assessment. This scale is divided in four domains, physical health, social, psychological and environmental. For the physical health we use the questions: 3 (inverse), 4 (inverse),10,15, 16, 17, 18. For the psychological, questions: 5, 6, 7, 11, 19, 26 (inverse). For the social domain, the questions: 20, 21, 22. For the environmental domain, the questions: 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 25. The main score is obtained through the sum of the four domains and higher scores correspond to higher perceived quality of life.</description>
