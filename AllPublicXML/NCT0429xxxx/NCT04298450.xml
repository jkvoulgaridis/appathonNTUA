  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosis is a disabling condition that typically has its onset in adolescence and early
      adulthood. Many young people with psychosis have difficulty navigating services or are
      reluctant to engage in treatment until their illness becomes an emergency. Consequently,
      nearly half of all new psychotic disorders are diagnosed in the emergency department (ED).
      Despite the rationale and evidence for early psychosis intervention (EPI), around half of
      youth do not access these services. The investigators will use short message service
      (SMS)/text messaging, a low-cost, low-complexity, youth-friendly approach, to improve
      transitions in care from the ED to EPI services, investigating the intervention's effect on
      attendance at the first consultation appointment, longer term service engagement, and
      system-level outcomes. The investigators will also evaluate cost-effectiveness and user
      perspectives of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), the investigators will recruit a
      consecutive series of 186 participants aged 16 to 29 referred by the CAMH ED to CAMH's EPI
      program for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a 2-way SMS intervention involving
      reminders, psychoeducation, and check-ins. The primary outcome will be rate of attendance at
      the first consultation appointment assessed through chart reviews. Secondary outcomes will
      include indicators of long-term service engagement as well as symptoms and functioning 6
      months following study enrollment and health service utilization for up to 2 years using
      administrative data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES).
      Administrative data will be used for an economic analysis. Participants who receive the
      active intervention will be asked to complete a web-based survey evaluating their experience
      and a subgroup will be asked to participate in in-depth in-person qualitative interviews.
      Patients and family members with lived experience will be engaged in all aspects of the
      project, including shaping the intervention and study design.

      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will result in increased rate of
      attendance at the first EPI consultation appointment, as well as improved longer-term
      engagement in outpatient EPI services compared to the sham comparator. Demonstrating evidence
      that this low-cost, low-complexity, youth-friendly intervention improves engagement in
      outpatient EPI services has the potential to improve long-term outcomes for young people with
      psychosis.

    <intervention_model_description>Immediately after study enrollment, participants will be randomized using an electronic data management system to the active or sham intervention. Randomization will be stratified by sex and referral source (main emergency department vs. Bridging Clinic), using a computer algorithm to perform a blocked randomization assignment within strata.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants will not be notified of treatment assignment, but based on the nature of the intervention, they cannot be fully masked. Their care provider may know treatment assignment if disclosed by the participant, or if they get notified that the participant is in distress. Treatment assignment will be known by the research personnel involved in managing the intervention and the database linking participant information to study identification numbers. Treatment assignment may be known by a co-principal investigator providing clinical supervision for adverse or serious events. Research personnel involved in qualitative interviews will also be aware of treatment assignment since only individuals receiving the active treatment participate. The lead principal investigator and research personnel involved in the chart review (where the primary outcome will be extracted) and other analyses will be masked to treatment assignment.</masking_description>

    <measure>Service engagement - Service Engagement Scale (SES)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Service Engagement Scale is a brief, validated, clinician-rated tool designed to measure engagement with community mental health services. In 14 items, it assesses patients' availability for treatment, collaboration, help seeking behaviors and treatment adherence on a four-point Likert scale with total scores ranging from 0-42, and higher scores indicating difficulties in service engagement. The Service Engagement Scale total score and treatment adherence score will be extracted through chart reviews.</description>

    <measure>Change in psychotic illness as measured by the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) is a clinician-rated measure of the patient's symptom severity and treatment response prior to and after initiating an intervention. It includes subscales for Severity and Improvement. The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale ranges from 1-7 with higher scores indicating higher severity of illness, relative to other patients with the same diagnosis. The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale ranges from 1-7 with 4 indicating no change, 1 indicating very much improved, and 7 indicating very much worse relative to the patient's illness at the beginning of the intervention. Scores will be extracted through chart reviews.</description>
