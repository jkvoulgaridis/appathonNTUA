  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been no previous qualitative study conducted in a low-income setting which has
      aimed to explore the experience of individuals who enrol into a clinical trial for the
      management of a life-threatening illness. We plan to collect data from trial participants,
      their next-of-kin, and researchers working on a multi-site randomised controlled trial for
      the treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals recruited into clinical trials for life-threatening illnesses are particularly
      vulnerable and this is especially true in low-income settings. The decision to enrol may be
      influenced by existing inequalities, a poor healthcare infrastructure and the fear of death.
      Where patients are confused or unconscious the responsibility for this decision falls on the
      relatives. The objectives of this study are to learn from the experience of participants,
      relatives and researchers involved in a randomised controlled trial, AMBITION (ISRCTN
      72509687), which is testing a novel treatment approach for HIV-associated cryptococcal
      meningitis and is recruiting participants from multiple sites across sub-Saharan Africa.

      We will collect data from trial participants and their relatives who provided consent on
      their behalf in Gaborone, Botswana; Kampala, Uganda and Harare, Zimbabwe. Interviews will
      follow a narrative approach and encourage the drawing of timelines. This will be supplemented
      by direct observation of the research process at each of the three recruiting hospitals. In
      addition, interviews will take place with researchers from the African and European
      institutions that form the partnership through which the trial is administered. Findings from
      the interviews will be prospectively fed back to the individual sites and Trial Management
      Group to improve the ongoing trial.

    <description>Interviews with AMBITION trial participants and their next-of-kin will be semi-structured and follow a loose interview guide that adopts a narrative approach to understand the experience of being diagnosed with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, being approached and enrolling into the trial, undergoing invasive procedures, completing follow-up and then exiting the trial. Interviews will take place during and after the trial.
Interviews with researchers will follow a thematic line of enquiry to understand how the trial can be improved for participants as well as how transnational research partnerships could be optimised for the benefit of researchers.
Direct observations will help to contextualise the findings from the interviews by situating them within the clinical environment.</description>
