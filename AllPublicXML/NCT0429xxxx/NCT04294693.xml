  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the functional ability and quality of life in
      those patients who received a total joint arthroplasty (TJA) for reasons other than having a
      solid tumor at the location of the joint.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty(THA) for
      non-solid tumor related reasons, are most often those children who developed osteonecrosis or
      avascular necrosis(AVN) as a side effect of their therapy for leukemia. Other patients
      undergo TKA or THA after degeneration of their joints secondary to trauma, infection,
      rheumatologic conditions, or congenital deformity. While not all cases of injury to the knee
      or hip result in the need for a joint replacement, the quality of life is believed to be
      improved in these children, as having a functioning joint without pain is believed to be
      better for the patients' quality of life than ambulating with a painful and/or partially
      necrotic joint.

        -  Study Population 1 -- Recent Patients: Subjects that have undergone surgical
             intervention within the past two years from date of study approval and received a
             total joint arthroplasty and follow up care with Dr. Nathan Donaldson in the
             Orthopedics Institute at Children's Hospital Colorado (information about the surgical
             process and arthroplasty type as well as patient and surgeon reported pain and
             function will be collected via chart review).

          -  Study Population 2 - New Patients: Subjects that are scheduled to undergo a total
             joint arthroplasty and/or receive follow-up care with Dr. Nathan Donaldson at
             Children's Hospital Colorado (information about all processes will be collected
             prospectively via patient interaction and chart review).
