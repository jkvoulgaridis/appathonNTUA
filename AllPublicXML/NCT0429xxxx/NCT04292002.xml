  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is called Test@Work. In this project the investigators will offer general health
      checks and tailored health advice to up to 650 employees in the construction industry at
      sites across the East Midlands. The investigators will assess reach and uptake, and evaluate
      the views and perceptions of employees, managers and the delivery team. Health checks will
      include Body Mass Index (BMI; weight/height), waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, mental
      health screen, sexual health consultation and an opt-in rapid screening test for human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Employees will be provided with a resource pack with
      information and signposting around physical activity, diabetes risk, diet, and
      musculoskeletal health. A digital resource providing information and signposting about
      workplace health screening and HIV testing will be developed and provided to managers at the
      participating worksites 2 weeks before their health check event.

      Employees will be offered an additional text messaging service involving receipt of a series
      of messages with advice around HIV and testing alongside general health information.
      Employees will complete post-health check exit questionnaires and an exit interview. Managers
      will complete a post-event evaluation questionnaire and post-event interview. Mixed-methods
      evaluation will include assessment of reach, uptake, and intervention implementation
      processes.

      The investigators will collect evaluation data with employees and company representatives.

      Employees: will complete exit-questionnaires and be invited to a brief exit interview.

      The investigators will collect by anonymous questionnaire: age, gender, country of birth,
      ethnicity, postcode, sexual orientation, employment status (FT/PT, permanent, agency,
      contract worker), reasons for attending, health perceptions, prior HIV testing history,
      influence of work on health, perceptions of employers provision for health and wellbeing,
      perceptions towards HIV testing in the workplace, range of tests undertaken, views about the
      workplace health check and future health intentions. Personal identifiers will not be
      collected and questionnaire data will not be provided to employers. Those employees who agree
      to be interviewed after the health check will be invited to a brief independent confidential
      interview with the project researcher.

      Company representatives: will complete brief post-event questionnaire and be invited to
      post-event interview

      The investigators will ask about the organisational/employee profile, their perceptions of
      company provision for health and wellbeing, perceptions towards the usefulness of the
      implementation toolkit and towards HIV testing in the workplace, method of delivery and their
      confidence to support employees who disclose a positive test outcome, views about the
      workplace health check and future implementation intentions.
