  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will aim to determine the association of mood disorders (MDO) with
      preclinical and clinical cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors among children.

      The investigators will also aim to identify traditional and non traditional predictors of CVD
      risk among children with MDO.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if mood disorders in children have an impact on
      stiffness of arteries and/or cause the arteries to not work as well and if MDOs impact blood
      pressure over a 24 hour period of time.The investigators also want to determine if children
      with mood disorders have any risk factors or blood tests that can predict how stiff arteries
      are or how well arteries function and if these are associated with cardiovascular disease
      risk. The investigators also want to determine if children with mood disorders have greater
      adverse childhood experiences, worse emotional regulation and poorer quality of sleep. The
      investigators hope that information from this study could help in earlier detection of
      cardiovascular disease risk in children.

    <measure>Arterial stiffness as assessed by Pulse wave velocity</measure>

    <measure>Arterial stiffness as assessed by Ambulatory Arterial Stiffness Index (AASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Ambulatory Arterial Stiffness Index will be determined from data obtained from vascular measures and during 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Arterial stiffness increases as the regression slope approaches 0 and the AASI approaches 1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arterial stiffness as assessed by Augmentation Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Augmentation Index (measured as a percentage) will be determined from a vascular assessment and data obtained during 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A greater Augmentation Index represents a stiffer, less compliant vessel.</description>

    <measure>Endothelial function as assessed by Laser Doppler flow perfusion</measure>

    <measure>Mean Blood pressure (mmHg)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Mean daytime systolic blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) will be determined from 24-hour blood pressure monitoring.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Adverse Childhood Events (ACEs) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric ACEs questionnaire contains 17 yes or no questions about stressful or traumatic life events. Greater exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is associated with poorer physical and mental health. Some researchers have suggested that an ACEs score of greater than or equal to 3 or 4 significantly increases the risk for health problems, however, there is no widely accepted threshold for how many ACEs endorsed is clinically significant or more predictive of these problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Emotion Management Scale (CEMS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Emotional management scale is a questionnaire that consists of 33 questions (3 point Likert scale) examining youth's ability to regulate appropriately the youth's negative emotions (i.e. anger, sadness, and worry). Generally, poorer emotion regulation capabilities are associated with poorer health outcomes, with most research looking at CV outcomes in adults.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior Assessment for Children (BASC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Assessment for Children is a questionnaire that consists of 189 questions (True/False and 4 point Likert scale). It is a broad behavioral screening measure commonly used in child and adolescent psychology and psychiatric settings.It has three primary scales: internalizing (e.g., depression, anxiety), externalizing (e.g., aggression, hyperactivity), and total problems (combination of internalizing and externalizing plus attention problems and withdrawal subscales). Scores between 60-69 are considered &quot;at risk&quot; for clinical problems and scores of 70+ are considered clinically significant presence of those symptoms. Any scores that are not in this range are considered to be within normal limits and not indicative of difficulties.</description>
