  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      60% of hypopharyngeal cancers were locally advanced at the time of diagnosis. The standard
      treatment was surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Compared with traditional surgery and
      postoperative radiotherapy, induction chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy has a better
      laryngeal retention rate without reducing the curative effect, and established an organ
      function preservation treatment strategy. Induction chemotherapy can reduce tumor burden and
      reduce distant metastases. At present, induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment for the laryngeal preservation in locally
      advanced hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancer. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of a PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab combined with chemotherapy as induction therapy in
      hypopharyngeal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study, planned to enroll 100 patients
      with localized hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who are newly treated and could accept
      radical treatment. Patients would be treated with toripalimab combined with docetaxel and
      cisplatin for two cycles. After the induction chemotherapy is completed, the investigator
      choose appropriate radical treatment (surgery or chemoradiotherapy) based on tumor
      evaluation. The primary endpoint is overall objective rate (ORR), the second endpoint include
      major pathologic response (MPR), 2-year DFS for surgery patients, 2-year PFS for radiotherapy
      patients, OS and QOL.
