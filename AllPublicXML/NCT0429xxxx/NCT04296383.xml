  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children is one of the major diseases in children's
      respiratory department in China, but there are still large clinical unmet needs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to further verify the clinical value and safety of Xiyanping injection in children
      with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia, to provide references for subsequent confirmatory
      research, and to provide more reasonable and standardized application guidance and basis for
      clinical practice, we intend to adopt more rigorous Scientific design to carry out a
      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled study of Xiyanping injection in
      the treatment of children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia.
