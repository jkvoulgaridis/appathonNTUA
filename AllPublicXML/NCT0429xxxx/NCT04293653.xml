  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the ProPEL study the effect of a protocol designed for elderly patients about to undergo
      emergency abdominal surgery will be investigated. The protocol addresses issues of both
      frailty and ceiling-of -care decisions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the &quot;ProPEL&quot; study the investigators will introduce a patient protocol designed for
      patients above 75 years where emergency laparotomy or laparoscopy is indicated.

      Patients with abdominal pathology requiring emergency surgery will be evaluated for frailty
      by the surgical team using standardized frailty scores.

      The results from the scorings indicate whether the patient should be offered surgery or
      palliation. The clinical decision is made together with the patient and/or relatives in a
      shared-decision-making process.

      If surgery is planned, the patient enters a specific care-bundle for emergency laparotomy.
      Mortality and morbidity will be analyzed in patients treated according to the principles of
      this bundle. The bundle will be applied to all patients above 75 years undergoing emergency
      laparotomy/laparoscopy with a Clinical Frailty Scale scoring from 1-6.

      Essential elements in this care-bundle are frailty scoring, surveillance and Optimizing of
      patients, surgical treatment within pre-defined criteria, and monitoring for delirium
      postoperatively.

    <description>Number of patients having a postoperative complication as defined by the European Perioperative Clinical Outcome Definitions (EPCO) will be reported. The EPCO definitions state universal description of various common postoperative complications, like f.ex pulmonary complications, major adverse cardiac events, urinary tract infections and so on. Thus, postoperative complications are reported in a uniform way.
We will grade complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. According to this classification postoperative complications are graded from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates least severity of complication and 5 indicating worst severity. We will report number of patients having complications from grade 2 to grade 5.</description>

    <description>Activity of Daily Living (ADL) is measured using the Barthel ADL-index (Norwegian Version), a validated 10-item questionnaire. In this scale the patients level of functioning is described and assigned from 0 to 20 points. Zero points indicate total dependency and 20 points indicate Complete independency in Activities of Daily Living.</description>
