  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective interventional study conducted at Oregon Health &amp; Science University
      that will measure the pre- and post-intervention characteristics of women with stress urinary
      incontinence undergoing an 8-week home yoga-Pilates intervention. The investigators plan to
      deliver this method of exercise to patients through a web-based video in order to increase
      accessibility and compliance and decrease patient costs. The investigators will assess
      changes using a pre- and post-treatment 1-day voiding diary, answers to questionnaires
      International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form and Patient Global
      Impression of Improvement questionnaire), transperineal ultrasound, and physical exam.

    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) affects up to 1/3 of women and negatively impacts multiple
      aspects of a woman's life. Pelvic floor physical therapy has been shown to improve stress
      incontinence through multiple mechanisms, including rhabdosphincter hypertrophy. Yoga and
      Pilates have also been shown to improve stress incontinence but there is a key gap in
      understanding how yoga-Pilates impacts urethral function and if these exercises represent a
      viable option for treating SUI.

      To fill this gap a new exercise is proposed: a web-based 8-week yoga-Pilates pelvic floor
      workout. The investigators plan to enroll women with SUI and compare urethral rhabdosphincter
      cross-sectional area in a pre-post intervention study. The investigators will also administer
      validated quality of life and severity measures for SUI to evaluate the potential efficacy of
      yoga-Pilates. The overarching goal of this project is to determine how yoga-Pilates impact
      urethral function and if these exercises decrease SUI symptoms.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that participants will report a minimally important change score difference of -2.5 utilizing the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (range 0-21, lower scores indicate less bother from incontinence).</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that this program will cause hypertrophy of the urethral rhabdosphincter with an increase in urethral cross sectional area of 0.25cm2 +/- 0.6cm2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the change in Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that the majority of patients will report an answer of at least &quot;a little better&quot; on the PGI-I post-intervention (range 1-7; 1: &quot;very much better&quot;, 2: &quot;much better&quot;, 3: &quot;a little better&quot;, 4: &quot;no change&quot;, 5: &quot;a little worse&quot;, 6: &quot;much worse&quot;, 7: &quot;very much worse&quot;)</description>

    <description>The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will cause a change in number of incontinence episodes on a 24-hour voiding diary.</description>

    <measure>Assess the effect of the intervention on the levator hiatus area and anteroposterior diameter using transperineal ultrasound.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators also hypothesize that the levator hiatus area and anteroposterior diameter will change over time due to hypertrophy of the levator muscles.</description>
