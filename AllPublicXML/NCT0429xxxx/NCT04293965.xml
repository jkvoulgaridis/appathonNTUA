    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open label, First-In-human (FIH), Phase I clinical study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of
      single dose and multiple doses of X842 capsules in healthy subjects.

      The study comprises a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) part, a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) part,
      and a Food Effect (FE) study.

The 6 subjects in Group A will take the study drug (X842) in fasted condition and subject in Group B will take the study drug in fed condition in the 1st cycle. In the 2nd Cycle, subjects in Group A will take the study drug in fed condition, and subjects in Group B will take the study drug in fasted condition. The interval between the two cycles is at least 7 days.</description>
