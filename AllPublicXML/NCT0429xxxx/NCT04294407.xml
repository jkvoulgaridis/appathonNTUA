    <textblock>
      This study intends to use an dynamometer and surface electromyography to objectively and
      quantitatively measure the corresponding force and electromyography signal generated when the
      hand joint receives stretching by doing circular motion, and further explore the differences
      and relationships of existing muscle spasm classification, kinetic and kinematic data, upper
      extremity performance, activity of daily life. In addition, to investigate the differences of
      kinetic and kinematic data between stroke patient and healthy participants during doing hand
      circular motion activity.

      Purpose 1 : To collect upper limb muscle activity parameters of healthy adults and stroke
      patients to establish a database of doing hand circular motion activity.

      Purpose 2 : To test the reliability of this refined muscle testing by collecting the muscle
      activity during hand circular motion activity.

      Purpose 3 : To compare the results of the EMG signal strength with other evaluation methods
      such as the modified Ashworth scale and dynamometer to understand the relationship between
      the EMG signal and each evaluation results.

      Purpose 4 : To compare the differences in electromyographic signals, muscle strength, and
      joint angle between healthy adults and stroke patients.

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale--Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) is a useful assessment tool to classify spasticity.The testing procedure of the MAS is to passively move the joint by the examiner and to feel the resistance during the movements. The scoring of the MAS included 6 level (0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, 4), where no increase muscle tone was score as 0 and rigid joint was score as 4. These data would be collected three times. (Baseline, 3 days after baseline, 6 days after baseline)</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Scale is an assessment scale for upper limb function of stroke patients. The scale has 33 movements, which can be rated as 0 to 2 points, of which 0 is impossible and 1 is achievable. 2 points can be completely achieved. FMUE scale has good reliability and validity.</description>

    <description>ARAT is a tool used to evaluate the function of upper limbs of stroke patients. The main test content is to reach out and grasp different objects in a standardized environment, and score the action based on the time to complete the action. There are 19 test items, each of which is scored 4 levels (0 ~ 3). The higher the score, the better the movement performance.</description>
