  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on
      memory in cognitively unimpaired older adults and in patients amnestic mild cognitive
      impairment (aMCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study will use repetitive
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) to stimulate nodes of the Default Mode Network
      (DMN)- which is thought to support episodic memory and to be affected by Alzheimer's
      pathology.

      We will use functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) to assess changes in functional network
      architecture following the stimulation. We will also assess putative cognitive improvements
      resulting from the stimulation by in-depth memory testing.

    <description>Active rTMS will be administered with a MagPro X100 stimulator (MagVenture, Denmark), using a 70 mm figure-of-eight liquid cooled coil capable of doing active or sham stimulation (e.g. the Cool B70 coil or the Cool B65 A/P coil). Active rTMS will be delivered at 80% of a patient's active motor threshold. rTMS will be administered in an excitatory iTBS pattern. Stimulation parameters will remain well within established safety guidelines (Rossi et al. 2009).</description>

    <description>SHAM stimulation will also be administered with a MagPro X100 stimulator (MagVenture, Denmark), using a 70 mm figure-of-eight liquid cooled coil capable of doing active or sham stimulation (e.g. the Cool B70 coil or the Cool B65 A/P coil). SHAM rTMS will be delivered at 80% of a patient's active motor threshold. SHAM stimulation will be delivered to the exact same cortical targets as active rTMS. While no electromagnetic stimulation will be delivered during SHAM, the sounds will approximate active stimulation and skin electrodes will approximate the sensation of active rTMS. Inclusion of a sham condition in this protocol is critical to measure whether or not the stimulation is improving memory performance, or whether practice effects or other non-specific effects are responsible for any changes in memory which may be observed.</description>
