  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a rare injury that leads to permanent neuromotor impairment
      and sudden disability. Approximately 25,000 people experience cervical SCI in the United
      States, Europe, and Japan every year. The purpose of this study is to see if elezanumab is
      safe and able to improve Upper Extremity Motor Score (UEMS) in participants with acute
      traumatic cervical SCI.

      Elezanumab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of SCI. Elezanumab is
      a monoclonal antibody, that binds to an inhibitor of neuronal regeneration and neutralizes
      the inhibitor, thus potentially promoting neuroregeneration. This study is &quot;double-blinded&quot;,
      which means that neither trial participants nor the study doctors will know who will be given
      which study drug. Study doctors put the participants in 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms.
      Each group receives a different treatment. There is a 1 in 3 chance that participants will be
      assigned to placebo. Participants 18-70 years of age with a SCI will be enrolled.
      Approximately 54 participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 36 sites
      worldwide.

      Participants will receive intravenous (IV) doses of elezanumab or placebo within 24 hours of
      injury and every 4 weeks thereafter through Week 48 for a total of 13 doses.

      There will be a higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a
      hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood
      tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute traumatic cervical SCI, motor level of injury of C4, C5, C6, or C7 with no
             damage to cord in thoracic (T2 and beyond) and lumbar regions that, in the
             investigator's opinion, would significantly limit recovery.

          -  Maximum screening UEMS of 32.

          -  American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A or B.

          -  Able to initiate study drug administration within 24 hours of injury.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of complete spinal cord transection.

          -  Significant concomitant head injury with a clinically significant abnormality on a
             head computed tomography (CT).

          -  One or more upper extremity muscle groups untestable (e.g., immobilized or restricted
             by a cast) during the screening ISNCSCI examination.

          -  Known history prior to randomization of clinically significant medical or surgical
             conditions (other than current acute SCI) or any other reason, including any physical,
             psychological, or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would
             compromise the safety or interfere with the participant's participation in this study,
             or would make the participant an unsuitable candidate to receive study drug, or would
             put the participant at risk by participating in the study, including history of or
             abnormal screening lab or imaging results that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             are indicative of any irreparable cardiac, endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic,
             immunologic, infectious, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal,
             dermatologic, psychiatric, renal, neurologic, and/or other major disease that would
             preclude administration of elezanumab.

          -  Known receipt of any other investigational product within 30 days or 5 half-lives of
             the drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug or is currently

          -  Female who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or considering becoming pregnant during the
             study or for within 39 weeks (5 half-lives) after the last dose of study drug.
