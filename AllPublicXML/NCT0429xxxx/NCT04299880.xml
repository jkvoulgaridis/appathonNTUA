      This is an open-label, multi-center, multi-national, non-randomized rollover study designed
      to allow continued access to napabucasin for patients who have participated in a Boston
      Biomedical-sponsored study and are being treated with napabucasin (monotherapy or
      combination) and who are deriving continued clinical benefit in the parent study at the time
      of closure.

      This is an open-label, multi-center, multi-national, non-randomized rollover study designed
      to allow continued access to napabucasin for patients who have participated in a Boston
      Biomedical-sponsored study and are being treated with napabucasin (monotherapy or
      combination) and who are deriving continued clinical benefit in the parent study at the time
      of closure. Individual patients will continue to be treated with napabucasin (monotherapy or
      combination) in accordance with the parent study under which they were enrolled. If the dose
      was reduced in the parent protocol, the dose of the last visit of the parent study will be
      used. Patients will be monitored to determine long term safety and tolerability of
      napabucasin.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. The patient is currently participating in a BBI-sponsored parent study of napabucasin
             and must be receiving napabucasin as monotherapy or as part of a combination
             treatment.

          2. Written, signed consent for trial participation must be obtained from the patient
             appropriately in accordance with applicable International Conference on Harmonisation
             (ICH) guidelines and local and regulatory requirements prior to the performance of any

          4. Currently has no evidence of progressive disease, as determined by the investigator,
             during treatment with napabucasin (either as monotherapy or as part of a combination
             treatment regimen) or are deriving clinical benefit despite disease progression
             according to Investigator's clinical judgement.

          5. Continued ability to swallow and retain orally administered study drug(s) and does not
             have any clinically significant GI abnormalities that may alter absorption such as
             malabsorption syndrome.

          6. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test at screening.

          7. Non-fertile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception while on study and for
             6 months following the last dose and not currently nursing; males agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception while on study and for 3 months following the last
             dose (Appendix 3).

          8. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this
             trial must receive protocol treatment and be followed at their current (parent study)
             participating center.

          9. Patient agrees not to participate in other interventional clinical studies during
             their participation in this trial. Patients participating in surveys or observational

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Permanent discontinuation of napabucasin in the parent study.

          2. Napabucasin dose interruption for &gt;4 weeks between the last dose on the parent study
             and first dose on the rollover study.

          3. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Women should not breastfeed while taking
             study treatment and for 4 weeks after the last dose of napabucasin. Women undergoing
             combination backbone therapy should not breast feed while on combination backbone
             therapy and for the period of time following discontinuation of combination backbone
             therapy as specified in the parent protocol.

          4. Hypersensitivity to napabucasin or one of the excipients.

          5. Any active disease condition which would render the protocol treatment dangerous or
             impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy.

          6. Any condition (e.g. psychological, geographical, etc.) that does not permit compliance
