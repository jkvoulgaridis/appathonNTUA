      Short title The BLIS study

      Full title A feasibility study assessing compliance, acceptability and colonisation with
      different dosing regimens of the probiotic supplement Streptococcus salivarius K12
      (Bactoblis速) in adults

      Population 50 human adults with or without a history of significant sore throat in the past
      12 months. We primarily aim to recruit participants with a history of sore throat, however we
      will also recruit healthy individuals if we are struggling to meet our recruitment target.

      Interventions

      Two groups will receive two different dosing regimens of Ssk12 probiotic oral lozenges:

        -  Group A: two SsK12 lozenges at night on days 1, 7 and 14.

        -  Group B: one SsK12 daily at night for 14 days. Throat swabs will be taken at baseline,
           and days 2, 7, 14, 21, 35

      Objectives

        1. To evaluate the prevalence of colonisation with SsK12 (as determined by real-time
           Polymerase Chain Reaction [PCR] and culture of participant-take whole-mouth swabs at
           pre-determined time points during the study)

        2. To evaluate the acceptability of the two dosing regimens (as measured by
           participant-completed questionnaires)

        3. To evaluate participants compliance with the two dosing regimens (as reported by
           participants during completion of the questionnaires)

      Rationale SsK12 probiotic supplements are recognised as safe food ingredients, and there is
      preliminary evidence to support their use as prophylactic therapy to prevent episodes of
      pharyngo-tonsillitis. Existing clinical trials have all given SsK12 once daily over a period
      of months. It remains unclear whether a once-daily dosing regimen is needed in order to
      establish and maintain colonisation.

      Study design This is a prospective study for which we will recruit healthy adult participants
      with and without a history of sore throat/ pharyngo-tonsillitis. We will evaluate [1] the
      acceptability and feasibility of two different dosing regimens of SsK12 supplements (taken as
      oral dissolvable lozenges), and [2] compare the prevalence of colonisation with SsK12 at
      various time points in order to determine how long colonisation is maintained following a
      loading dose. A baseline whole-mouth swab will be taken, and participants will be randomly
      assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to one of two groups ('A' or 'B'). Group A will take two SsK12
      lozenges at night on days 1, 7 and 14. Group B will take SsK12 at night for 14 days.
      Participants will be provided with instruction on how to perform a self-taken whole-mouth
      swab, and asked to take swabs on days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 35, and return these to the study
      team by post. They will also be asked to complete two short online questionnaires (on day 14
      and day 35) about their compliance with the probiotic, as well as their views on the dosing
      regimen and other aspects of the study. Maintenance of colonisation will be assessed using
      analysis of the returned throat swabs. No follow-up will be undertaken after day 35.

      Sample size Total = 50 (25 in group A, and 25 in group B)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults over 18 years of age

          -  Fully conversant in the English language

          -  Able and willing (in the investigator's opinion) to comply with all study requirements

          -  Willing to take SsK12 and return throat swabs according to the study protocol

          -  We primarily aim to recruit participants with a history of sore throat, however we
             will also recruit healthy individuals with no history of sore throat if we are
             struggling to meet our recruitment target of 50. We are defining a 'history' of sore
             throat as two or more episodes of significant (as judged by the participant) sore
             throat/pharyngo-tonsillitis episodes in the past 12 months. However, if we are
             struggling to recruit, a decision may be made by the chief investigator to alter this
             definition to one or more episodes in the last 12 months, after consultation with the
             study team.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Involvement in a study involving the receipt of an investigational medical product
             within 30 days prior to, or during, the study period.

          -  Active symptoms of sore throat or other infection at the time of recruitment

          -  Presence of a chronic disease/condition (such as those affecting the oropharynx)
             which, in the view of the investigator, might impact on colonisation, impede analysis
             of the study results, put the participant at increased risk, or impact on the ability
             of the participant to follow the study procedures

          -  Participant unable to give informed consent

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state, or use of
             immunosuppressant medication (including oral steroids) within the last 30 days

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any of the study
             treatment

          -  Current smokers (including e-cigarettes/vaping)

          -  Any other clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) abnormality on
             clinical examination
