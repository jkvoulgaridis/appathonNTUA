  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare effect of combined block of ACB (adductor
      canal block) with IPACK (Interspace between the Popliteal Artery and the Capsule of the
      posterior Knee) block and/or Intra-articular block in immediate postoperative and early
      postop rehabilitation and pain management in patients undergoing primary TKA. The secondary
      objective is to review both in-hospital and post-discharge pain levels and narcotic usage of
      primary TKAs, with a minimum 6-week postoperative follow-up.

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>outcome measure will be taken 24 hours postoperatively, 48 hours postoperatively, 72 hours postoperatively, 2 weeks (± 4 days) postoperatively, and 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale measures the patient's level of knee pain on a scale of zero to ten via what the patient expresses verbally. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) represents the degree of pain that the patient is experiencing at the time the measure is taken. Zero represents &quot;pain-free&quot;. A 10 would represent pain so excruciating as to warrant emergency medical assistance, or as it is described to the patient, &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;. Obviously, the lower the number, the better the outcome. There is no subscale.</description>
