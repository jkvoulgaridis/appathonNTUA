  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy periods is a significant problem in reproductive age .It affects about a third of women
      in the childbearing period

      Any of the following is considered to be heavy menstrual bleeding (Bleeding that lasts more
      than 7 days,Bleeding that soaks through one or more tampons or pads every hour for several
      hours in a row.Needing to wear more than one pad at a time to control menstrual flow.,Needing
      to change pads or tampons during the night or Menstrual flow with blood clots that are as big
      as a quarter or larger) .

      Heavy periods can be caused by organic cause as fibroids, adenomyosis, polyps or they can be
      dysfunctional.Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is irregular uterine bleeding that occurs in the
      absence of recognisable pelvic pathology, general medical disease, or pregnancy. It reflects
      a disruption in the normal cyclic pattern of ovulatory hormonal stimulation to the
      endometrial lining.

      Several treatment options include: hormonal treatment as norethisterone acetate,oral
      contraceptive pills, gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogue. ,tranexamic acid or non
      steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

      The investigators plan to do a comparative study between norethisterone acetate and
      tranexamic acid regarding their control of the heavy periods as well as their effect on the
      uterine and endometrial vasculature.

      This is a Randomised controlled trial.The investigators will randomise 120 women who suffer
      from heavy periods (age range 35-49 years old) without organic cause (Dysfunctional bleeding
      ) into 2 groups, group A (60 women) : They will take norethisterone acetate 15 mg daily from
      day 5 to day 26 of the period for 3 months.

      Group B (60 women): They will take 1 gm tranexemic acid three times daily from the start of
      menstrual period up to 5 days.The dose might be increased per day (Not more than 4 gm per
      day).

      The investigators will check endometrial thickness, endometrial volume, uterine artery
      Doppler indices as well as endometrial and subendometrial indices before starting the
      treatment and 3 months afterwards.
