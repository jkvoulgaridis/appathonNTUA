  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) can occur after a person has had a stem cell or
      bone marrow transplant. In cGVHD, the donor cells attack the recipient s body. Researchers
      want to see if a drug called ibruntinib can block one of the proteins that lead to the immune
      reaction that causes cGVHD.

      Objective:

      To see if ibrutinib as a first-line treatment can help people with newly diagnosed cGVHD.

      Eligibility:

      People age 18 and older with newly diagnosed moderate or severe cGVHD

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with

      medical and medicine histories

      physical exam and vital signs

      electrocardiograms (to measure heart function)

      assessment of their ability to perform daily activities

      blood and urine tests

      assessment of their general well-being.

      Participants will visit the Clinical Center every 2 weeks for the first 2 months. Then they
      will visit every 4 weeks.

      Participants will take ibrutinib by mouth once every day of every cycle. One cycle is 28
      days. Treatment will last up to 2 years. Participants will keep a medicine diary.

      Participants will take tests to measure lung function. They may have computed tomography
      scans of their chest. They will complete questionnaires about their symptoms and how cGVHD is
      affecting their body and quality of life. They will repeat the screening tests.

      Participants may have optional blood tests and/or skin biopsies to better understand the drug
      s effect on the body.

      Participants will be contacted by phone 30 days after treatment ends. They will also be
      contacted once a year for 2 years to discuss how they are feeling and if they have taken any
      other medicines to treat cGVHD.

      Background:

        -  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is the leading cause of late morbidity and
           non-relapse mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
           (alloHSCT), occurring in 40-60% long-term survivors.

        -  Chronic GvHD occurs due to the dysfunctional peripheral tolerance during post-transplant
           hematopoietic reconstitution that allows the development and persistence of alloreactive
           donor-derived T and B cells.

        -  Prednisone is the front-line therapy; however, about 50% of patients have
           steroid-refractory disease and there is no standard second-line therapy.

        -  The most attractive approach for controlling chronic GvHD would be early therapy
           intervention which could prevent the most severe and irreversible clinical
           manifestations.

        -  Anti-B-cell therapy delivered early in chronic GvHD could be effective and
           steroid-sparing.

        -  Ibrutinib, reversible small molecule inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase, has been
           shown to be well-tolerated and effective in phase 1b/2 trial for steroid refractory
           chronic GvHD.

      Objective:

      -To evaluate efficacy of ibrutinib as a first-line treatment for persons with newly diagnosed
      chronic GvHD by measuring the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial
      response [PR]) at 6 months, according to the 2014 NIH Consensus Criteria

      Eligibility:

        -  Newly diagnosed, moderate or severe chronic GvHD according to the 2014 NIH Consensus
           Criteria, requiring systemic immunosuppression

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old

        -  Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 60%

        -  History of prior alloHSCT; any donors, conditioning regimens and graft sources are
           allowed

        -  Adequate cardiac, hepatic and other organ function

        -  Adequate laboratory parameters

      Design:

        -  Multi-center, non-randomized, phase II study

        -  Two-stage design will be used to determine the overall response rate (CR + PR) at 6
           months

        -  Continuous daily dose of 420 mg by mouth, with the potential for dose reductions to 280
           mg and 140 mg

        -  The accrual ceiling will be set at 40 patients, allowing for a total of up to 28
           evaluable subjects.

        (according to the 2014 NIH Consensus Criteria, requiring systemic immunosuppression

        2.1.1.2 History of prior allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) (any donors,

        2.1.1.3 Subjects may have ongoing acute GvHD features (e.g., erythematous rash, elevated
        liver enzymes, diarrhea) which are in the opinion of the investigator responding to
        therapy.

        because tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be teratogenic, female subjects of childbearing
        potential and men must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control (hormonal

        or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, during the period of
        therapy, and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

        disease, with the following exceptions:

          -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no evidence of active disease present
             for more than 3 years prior to prior to study treatment initiation and felt to be at
             low risk for recurrence

        to 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone equivalent for more than 7 days. Subject may be on steroids
        that were used to treat acute GvHD and then developed chronic GvHD before completing a
        taper. At the time of enrollment, the dose should be less than or equal to 0.5 mg/kg/day of
        prednisone equivalent

        with no dose increase in the preceding 2 weeks before study treatment initiation

        2.1.2.4 Prior or current treatment with:

          -  Ibrutinib since the time of transplant (patients may have received ibrutinib prior to
             transplant for indications other than chronic GvHD)

          -  Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) for acute GvHD less than or equal to 2 weeks prior

             hypertension at any time

        2.1.2.6 Uncontrolled infections (including prior aspergillosis) not responsive to
        antibiotics, antiviral medicines, or antifungal medicines

        2.1.2.7 Known bleeding disorder or subjects who received a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A
        inhibitor less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of ibrutinib or requirement

        2.1.2.10 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ibrutinib has potential for
        teratogenic and abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
        adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ibrutinib,

        breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ibrutinib. Women who are
        planning to become pregnant and men who plan to father a child while enrolled in this study
        or less than or equal to 30 days after the last dose of study drug are excluded.

        2.1.2.11 Any other reason at the discretion of the investigators and documented in the
