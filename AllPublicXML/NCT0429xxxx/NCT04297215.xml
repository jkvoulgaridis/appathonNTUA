  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2000 therapeutic clothing or functional textiles based on silver or chitosan as
      antibacterial agents were introduced as therapeutics of atopic dermatitis (AD). These agents
      aim to reduce skin colonization with Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. S. aureus induces further
      dysregulation of the inflammatory process and increased colonization with S. aureus is
      correlated with increased AD severity. Based on the theoretical mode of action and clinical
      experience, we assume a higher effectiveness of antimicrobial therapeutic clothing compared
      to control therapeutic clothing on reducing AD severity. The goal of this study is to assess
      the effectiveness of antibacterial clothing based on silver or chitosan on the
      doctor-reported AD severity in patients with moderate to severe AD. Secondary goals are to
      retrieve information about the effect of antimicrobial clothing on clinical symptoms, quality
      of life, S. aureus colonization, AD medication use and the satisfaction regarding the
      clothing.

      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Patients will be
      randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to either therapeutic clothing without antimicrobial agents,
      antimicrobial therapeutic clothing based on chitosan or antimicrobial clothing based on
      silver for 12 months.
