  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) leads to adenomas and eventual adenocarcinomas in colon
      and less frequently, duodenum. Chemopreventive strategies have been studied in FAP patients
      to delay the development of adenomas and cancers. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor have shown the regression of colorectal and
      duodenal adenomas in FAP patients. However, these drugs showed gastrointestinal damage and
      cardiovascular risks, and new preventive strategies are needed. Niclosamide, an
      anti-helminthic drug, has recently been suggested to have a suppressive effect on
      tumorigenesis via inhibition of Wnt pathway, and have no significant safety issues. The
      investigators devised a double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
      niclosamide on polyps of colorectum and duodenum in FAP patients.

      This clinical trial is a double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
      niclosamide on polyps of colorectum and duodenum in FAP patients. FAP patients, satisfied an
      enrollment criteria, will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive niclosamide (650 mg)
      or placebo tablets orally once a day for 6 months. The base-line and six-month endoscopic
      examination (colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy) will be
      recorded, and photographs will be taken at the tattoo-marked area. The number and size of
      polyps, and a qualitative assessment of the total extent of polyposis will be measured. If
      there is no significant improvement in any of the 12 initial cases (niclosamide 8: placebo
      4), this trial will be discontinued.

    <description>At the base-line endoscopy (colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy), india-ink tattoo will be placed in the ascending colon, sigmoid colon/rectum, and duodenum. In case of the subjects with retained rectum after colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, sigmoidoscopy will be performed. The base-line and six-month endoscopic examination will be recorded, and photographs will be taken at the tattoo-marked area and used for measurements of the number and size of polyps. The diameter of a polyp will be measured with the aid of biopsy forceps included in the photographic field, and only distinct polyps at least 2 mm in diameter will be counted.</description>

    <description>A qualitative assessment of the total extent of colorectal polyposis will be conducted via video review(at base line and month 6) by two endoscopists experienced in the management of FAP, and scored as the same as, better than, or worse than base-line endoscopic findings, without the endoscopists' being aware of treatment group.</description>
