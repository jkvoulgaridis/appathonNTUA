  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate an innovative post-acute continuation/transition planning
      treatment strategy that leverages intensive treatment followed by online,
      videoconferencing-based &quot;booster&quot; sessions for youth with selective mutism (SM). Twenty
      children between the ages of 4 and 10 and their caregivers will participate in an intensive
      group behavioral treatment (IGBT) for SM and will be subsequently randomized to receive
      either (a) six, biweekly, hour-long, videoconferencing-delivered booster sessions or (b) no
      additional treatment for 12 weeks. All families will participate in assessments at the
      following time points: Intake (i.e., 4-5 months prior to the IGBT); Baseline (i.e., 1 month
      prior to the IGBT), Post-IGBT (i.e., 2 weeks following the IGBT), Biweekly (i.e., between
      Post-IGBT and School Year Follow-Up), and School Year Follow Up (i.e., 16 weeks following the
      IGBT).

    <description>The CGI-I Scale (Guy &amp; Bonato, 1970) is a widely used global improvement measure; improvement is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Independent evaluators masked to family participation/progress during the intensive group behavioral treatment (IGBT) will complete the CGI-I rating. &quot;Treatment Response&quot; is defined as an independent evaluator rated CGI-I rating of 1 or 2 (ratings &gt;/= 3 represent &quot;Treatment Nonresponse&quot;).</description>

    <description>The ADIS (Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996) is a well-supported semi-structured diagnostic interview assessing child mental disorders in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Disorders are assigned a clinical severity rating (CSR) along a 9-point scale ranging from 0-8 (CSRs &gt;/= 4 indicate diagnostic criteria were met). Independent evaluators masked to family participation/progress during the intensive group behavioral treatment (IGBT) will administer the ADIS and determine CSRs.</description>

Child communicative behaviors are coded (e.g., nonverbal, barely audible, verbal) and tallied.</description>
