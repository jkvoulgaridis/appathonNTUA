  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that affect social
      communication and interaction and includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior (DSM
      5). In France, national guidelines about practices recommends early and specific
      interventions but care pathway are not well described for ASD children. The national health
      insurance information system record demographic data, medical condition, and reimbursed drug
      over 98% of the French population. In addition, the ELENA cohort is a large cohort of
      children with ASD followed for 6 years. Data collected include clinical characteristics of
      children (IQ, severity of ASD...) and parents (educational level, professional status...).

      The first objective of this project is to identify patterns of care trajectories using data
      from ELENA cohort matched to data from national health insurance information system.
      Secondary objectives are to examine the links between patterns of care trajectories and
      clinical characteristics, social environment of autistic children.
