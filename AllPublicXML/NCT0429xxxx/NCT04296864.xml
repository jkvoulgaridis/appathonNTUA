             antihistamines, topical mast cell stabilizers, and topical tacrolimus and at least 3
             months for topical and oral cyclosporine, and systemic corticosteroids. Such therapy
             must remain current throughout duration of study;

          -  have both of the following at Visit 1:

               1. a history of AKC or diagnosis at this visit (by meeting inclusion 7 and 8) AND

               2. a history of or present with chronic blepharoconjunctivitis, upper tarsal
                  papillary hypertrophy, lid changes, or atopic dermatitis;

          -  be able to self-administer or receive subcutaneous injections satisfactorily or have a
             caregiver at home routinely available for this purpose. If unable to administer at

             one eye at Visit 2 (baseline):

               1. &gt;2 score in corneal staining

               2. &gt;2 score in conjunctival redness

               3. &gt;2 score in at least one of the following lid disease signs: i. lid margin
                  redness ii. lid excoriation iii. changes in mucocutaneous junction iv. lid
                  thickening/lichenification;

          -  present symptoms of active disease, defined as having both of the following in at
             least one eye at Visit 2 (baseline):

               1. &gt;2 score in ocular itching AND

               2. &gt;6 total composite score for the individual symptoms of ocular itching,
                  tearing/watery eyes, ocular discomfort, photophobia, and nonpurulent mucous
                  discharge;

          -  have an ocular or systemic condition or a situation which, in the investigator's
             opinion, may put the patient at increased risk, confound study data, or interfere
             significantly with the patient's study participation;

          -  manifest in either eye symblepharon, significant conjunctival scarring, and/or fornix
             shortening;

          -  have planned surgery (ocular or systemic) during the trial period or within 30 days
             after the study period;
