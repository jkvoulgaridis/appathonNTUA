    <textblock>
      Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare chronic inflammatory arteritis, which lacks an effective
      well-accepted intervention strategy. Here we tried to classify TAK patients in 3 levels,
      including mild, moderate, and severe, and prescribe methotrexate and tofacitinib randomly in
      mild and moderate patients, to observe the relatively better treatment strategy, facilitating
      better intervention strategy in TAK patients.

    <textblock>
      The Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare chronic inflammatory arteritis, which lacks effective
      well-accepted intervention strategy. Previous studies have revealed that methoxamine,
      tofacitinib, adalimumab, and tocilizumab were effective in controlling disease activity and
      preventing disease relapse in some TAK patients. However, we believed that different patients
      should be prescribed different drug combinations, i.e. personalized medicine, to obtain the
      optimal intervention effect.

      So, here we tried to classify the TAK patients into three levels, and prescribe different
      drug interventions to discover the relatively better treatment strategy.

      1. Patients were classified as mild, moderate and severe group according to the disease
      severity of TAK patients.

      2. Based on the TAK patients in the ECTA cohort (Clinical trials. No: NCT03893136), we tried
      to compare the treatment efficacy between Tofacitinib (TOF) and methotrexate (MTX) in mild
      and moderate patients, with a randomized open-label study.

      Other important detailed description of the study are listed as follows:

        1. Basic treatment of prednisone: The initial prednisone dose is 40mg.qd.po, and maintained
           for 1 month. After 1 month's treatment, the dose is gradually tapered to 15mg by 5mg per
           2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose is decreased to 5mg by 2.5mg per 3 months. The 5mg is
           the final target maintained dose. In the treatment, if the relapse occurs, the dose of
           prednisone returned to the last dosage. For example, if the patient gets a relapse at
           the dose of 15mg of prednisone, then the dose of prednisone returned to 20mg.

           The relapse of TAK is defined according to the &quot;2018 Update of the EULAR recommendations
           for the management of large vessel vasculitis&quot;. Relapse includes major relapse or minor
           relapse. Major relapse: Recurrence of active disease with either of the following: a.
           Clinical features of ischemia* (including jaw claudication, visual symptoms, the visual
           loss attributable to TAK, scalp necrosis, stroke, limb claudication). b. Evidence of
           active aortic inflammation resulting in progressive aortic or large vessel dilatation,
           stenosis or dissection. Minor relapse Recurrence of active disease, not fulfilling the
           criteria for a major relapse.

        2. TOF: 5mg bid p.o.

        3. MTX: 15mg qw p.o.

        4. Treatment shift: if the TAK patients in the TOF group failed to reach clinical remission
           at the end of the 24th week, they would be shifted to MTX group starting a new round of
           induction and complete the rest 24-week follow-up; and vice versa.

      In the follow-up, the disease remission and related markers are monitored.

After the 24 weeks of treatment, the disease remission is evaluated (primary endpoint). If the disease activity is alleviated, the strategy would be maintained for another 24weeks, otherwise, the treatment strategy would be shifted to the opposite for 24weeks.
