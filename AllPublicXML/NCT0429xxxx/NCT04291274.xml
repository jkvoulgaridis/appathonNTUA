  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term effect of general anesthesia on developing brain is the focus of clinicians
      when infants exposed to general anesthesia for a long time during operation. A retrospective
      study showed that children exposed to long-term or repeated operations, the anesthetics had a
      higher incidence of cognitive impairment in adolescence than those did no. When infants with
      hearing impairment undergo bilateral cochlear implant surgery, they are at high risk of
      long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities caused by anesthesia. In this study, investigators
      intend to observe the long-term behavioral abnormalities of hearing-impaired infants after
      intravenous or inhalation anesthesia by a ambispective cohort study.
