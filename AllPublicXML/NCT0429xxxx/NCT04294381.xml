      Health care decisions should include patients' health outcome goals and care preferences so
      as to enable a unified set of individualized patient outcome goals, rather than disparate
      disease-specific goals that do not reflect patient choice and commitment. This study utilizes
      a skilled professional interview and a simple tablet-based tool to enable patient choice of
      health behavior goals. The tool guides the patient to choose a specific, measurable,
      attainable, realistic and time-based (SMART) goal. The hypothesis of this study is that the
      implementation this patient choice tool will increase the likelihood of patient adherence to
      the goal and increase patient self efficacy.

      Patients who participate in the Women's Heart Clinic at Hadassah will be recruited to
      participate in the study. Patients are to be included in this study if they have undergone
      cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or stroke,)
      had an active cardiac symptom (e.g. chest pain or arrhythmia) or had three or more active
      risk factors (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral artery disease, current
      smoker, family history of premature coronary disease, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced
      hypertension/pre-eclampsia, or obesity). Patients are excluded if they arere pregnant, have
      type 1 diabetes, a psychiatric diagnosis that precluded participation, dementia, or if they
      were under the care of another multi-disciplinary clinic. The Hadassah Heart Center for Women
      follows a team-based approach, consisting of a cardiologist, nurse, nutritionist, physical
      therapist and psychologist. At the first visit, patients met with all five professionals. The
      nurse interviews the patient and assists in baseline data collection. The physician obtains
      the history, conducted physical examinations and determined cardiac care plans. The
      nutritionist assesses the patient's diet and assists the patient with determining SMART
      (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound) goals using the table tool. The
      physical therapist performs an assessment of physical activity capacity and behaviors,a 6
      minute walk test, and assists the patient in determining SMART goals for increased physical
      activity. The psychologist assessed patient for active mental health concerns that would
      interfere with self-care, assisted her in developing a plan to maximize self-care and
      developed a referral plan for patients who required mental health intervention. Patient cases
      are reviewed in a multi-disciplinary meeting after the visit and a comprehensive letter
      including specific recommendations from each member of the team was sent to the patient (In
      Israel, letters are given to the patient rather than directly to the referring physician.)
      Follow up appointments are scheduled according to clinical indications.

      Baseline data collection included age, medical history, country of birth, education, and
      monthly income. Cardiac risk factors included the inclusion criteria as described above.

      Health behaviors including nutrition behaviors, physical activity behaviors, smoking and
      alcohol consumption are measured using a culturally-adapted translation of the Healthy Heart
      Score and Mediterranean Diet Score. The patients fill out the Depression, Anxiety, Stress
      Score and the Brief Experiential Avoidance Score, health self efficacy and overall quality of
      life.

      Patients will be followed by telephone at 1 and 2 months, return for follow up visit at month
      3, telephone follow up will be done at months 4 and 5, and the patient will return at month 6
      for outcomes evaluation, which will include nutrition and physical activity assessment, and
      health self efficacy, Health Heart Score, Brief Experiential Avoidance Score, Health self
      efficacy and
