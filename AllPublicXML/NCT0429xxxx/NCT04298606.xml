    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the side effects of a vaccine called CIMAvax-EGF and to see
      how well it works in preventing lung cancer from developing in patients at high risk for lung
      cancer or coming back (recurrence) in stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer survivors. In
      many cancers such as lung cancer, there is a protein receptor called EGFR (epidermal growth
      factor receptor) that is overexpressed within these cancers. Activation of EGFR has shown to
      lead to tumor growth and development. Previous studies have indicated that EGFR activation is
      present in the airways of cancer-free subjects as well. CIMAvax-EGF vaccine works by causing
      the body to make antibodies against EGF that is being produced that could be possibly driving
      the risk for developing cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of the vaccine based on circulating EGF and anti-EGF antibodies.

      II. To access the molecular profile of blood, bronchial and nasal brushes, and bronchial
      biopsies to identify molecular markers associated with treatment and response.

      III. To establish the safety of recombinant human EGF-rP64K/montanide ISA 51 vaccine
      (CIMAvax-EGF) treatment in cancer-free individuals using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation
      Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE version 5).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate quality of life score changes using European Organization for the Research and
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-Core 30 (C30) in patients who
      are at high risk for development of lung cancer or recurrence during CIMAvax-EGF treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      LOADING PHASE: Patients receive recombinant human EGF-rP64K/montanide ISA 51 vaccine
      intramuscularly (IM) at 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive recombinant human EGF-rP64K/montanide ISA 51 vaccine IM
      once every 4 weeks (Q4W) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 60 days.

    <description>The response to the vaccine will be measured using circulating EGF and anti-EGF antibodies replicating the results from the Cuban and Roswell trials. Human EGF will be determined by the Roswell Park Flow and Image Cytometry CCSG supported Resource using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). EGF antibodies will also be determined, by the Roswell Park Flow and Image Cytometry Resource using an in-house assay developed in cooperation with the Centro de Immunologia Molecular in La Habana, Cuba.</description>

    <measure>Molecular biomarker analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will access the molecular profile of blood, bronchial brushes, and bronchial biopsies to identify molecular markers associated with treatment and response. Biomarker scores will be analyzed for the molecular profile endpoint to test if they are significantly different post-treatment compared to pre-treatment (via paired t-test) or if a change in biomarker score (post-versus pre-) is significantly different among responders versus nonresponders (via t-test) as defined by histology and circulating levels of EGF ligand and anti-EGF antibodies. In addition to these biomarkers, gene expression signatures will be analyzed. These include gene expression signatures associated with EGFR activity, the high-grade lesion molecular subtype, and the immune-associated signature predictive of progressive/stable lesions compared with regressive lesions.</description>
