  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase III parallel-group randomized controlled trial is to assess the
      efficacy of open dialogue about complementary alternative medicine integrated in conventional
      oncology care (ODC-COC). The investigators hypothesize that patients in the intervention
      group participating in an ODC-COC with a nurse specialist report better quality of life
      compared to patients in the control group receiving standard care alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients randomized to the intervention group will participate in a scheduled ODC-COC with a
      specialist nurse, who has completed the Fellowship in Integrative Medicine at the University
      of Arizona. This is a training program for health professionals in empowering individuals and
      communities to optimize health and well-being through evidence-based, sustainable and
      integrative approaches. The ODC-COC will be based on the fundamentals of person-centered care
      according to this program and include patient preferences and wishes, reliable information
      and counselling and advice about the potential risks and benefits of using complementary
      alternative medicine as an adjunct to conventional oncology care.

      The dialogue lasts approximately 60 minutes and will take place as soon as possible and no
      later than two weeks after enrolment. The same nurse will conduct all dialogues. According to
      patient needs and wishes there may be a follow-up dialogue over the telephone or in the
      Oncology Outpatient Clinic. The potential second dialogue is estimated to last approximately
      30 minutes.

      Participants in the control group will receive standard information including reference to
      www.KABcancer.dk, which is a website presenting research on CAM, including information about
      its potential effects and outcomes.
