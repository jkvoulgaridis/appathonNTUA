    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the impact of land based or aquatic based group exercise on the
      balance, walking, balance confidence, and quality of life of people with idiopathic Parkinson
      disease. Participants will be randomized to participate in a land based or aquatic based
      group exercise program 2 times per week for 12 weeks. Prior to and after participation,
      balance, walking, quality of life, and balance confidence will be measured by a blinded
      examiner.
