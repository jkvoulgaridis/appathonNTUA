  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to clarify whether if starting antiretroviral treatment based
      on dual therapy (DTG + 3TC) could provide less control of residual HIV replication and,
      therefore, a detriment on immune activation and inflammation compared to starting with triple
      therapy, and could worsen the patients' long-term prognosis. For this purpose, we have
      designed a randomized clinical trial where we will assess the immunological recovery
      (CD4+/CD8+), immune activation, proliferation, senescence and apoptosis in T lymphocytes CD4+
      and CD8+ cells by flow cytometry, the immune activation of monocytes/ macrophages and plasma
      concentrations of various inflammatory mediators by ELISAS, and the thymic function, the
      cellular reservoir of HIV and the degree of HIV DNA transcription by digital dropped PCR.
