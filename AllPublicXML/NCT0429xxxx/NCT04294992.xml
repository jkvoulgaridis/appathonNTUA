      3. Scientific committee approval (Was it scientifically approved by the department?) Yes

      Date of approval: Sunday ,1ST September,2019

      Background and Rationale:

      Regional anesthesia is commonly associated with intraoperative shivering which reaches
      40-60%. Spinal anesthesia contributes in impairment of thermoregulation, and predisposes
      patients to hypothermia, which reduces the threshold for shivering and vasoconstriction.
      Other mechanisms responsible for shivering include increased sympathetic tone, pain, and
      systemic release of pyrogens. Shivering causes increase in metabolic activity, oxygen
      consumption, intracranial, and intraocular pressure. Shivering is also responsible for
      increasing cardiac output, peripheral resistance, carbon dioxide production, and lactic
      acidosis. Furthermore, shivering interferes with electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximetry.
      1 Post anaesthetic shivering is one of the most frequent problems in the early recovery phase
      following general anaesthesia. It was considered as the sixth most important problem of
      current clinical anaesthesiology among 33 low morbidity clinical outcomes. Previous studies
      have found that shivering occurs up to 60% of patients in the postoperative period and varies
      according to sex, age, drugs used for anaesthesia and the duration for the surgery.2 Since
      shivering is a response to hypothermia, body temperature should be maintained within
      36.5-37.5°C, however, shivering may be also seen in normothermic patients undergoing regional
      anesthesia. A number of factors responsible for developing of hypothermia in regional
      anesthesia including age, level of sensory block, temperature of the operating room and
      infusion solution.3 Perioperative hypothermia and shivering can be prevented by physical
      methods like surface warming or pharmacologically by drugs such as pethidine, tramadol,
      clonidine, doxapram, opioids, neostigmine, magnesium sulfate and ketamine.4 Pethidine is the
      most commonly used drug for post spinal anesthesia shivering. The disadvantage of pethidine
      is that it can cause respiratory depression in the presence of previously administered
      opioids or anaesthetics. Moreover, hypotension, nausea and vomiting are also important side
      effect of pethidine.5 Pethidine, which is considered as a time-tested drug for control of
      shivering, can have adverse effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting.
      which begs to investigate the efficacy of other drugs.6 5-HT antagonists had been effectively
      introduced for management of perioperative shivering by inhibiting thermoregulatory response
      by central mechanism. Ondansetron is a 5-HT antagonist which had been effectively used in
      treatment of postoperative shivering.7 Granisteron, a new generation of 5-HT antagonists, had
      been also reported effective in the prevention of Postoperative shivering.9-10 No data are
      available about the comparison of both drugs, ondansetron and granisteron, for prophylaxis
      against post-spinal shivering The aim of the investigator's study is to compare the efficacy
      of granisteron to ondansetron for prevention of intra- and post spinal anaesthesia shivering.
