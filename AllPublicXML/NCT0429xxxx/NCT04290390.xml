             blood sample collection of each period.

        advancing age (&gt; 35 years of age) that may alter patterns of follicle development and/or
        confound interpretations of data regarding patterns of follicle development)

        Exclusion Criteria

        Contraindications for enrollment will be the same as those for use of CHCs and additional
        criteria important to the objectives of this study and include:

             diagnosed at screening with a chlamydia or gonococcus infection may be included in the
             trial following treatment; partner treatment is also recommended. Investigators should
             make a determination if participants are at high risk for reinfection, eg, multiple
             sex partners, untreated partner, and whether such participants can be included.

          -  f. History of pelvic inflammatory disease since the participant's last pregnancy.

          -  g. History of toxic shock syndrome.

          -  h. In accordance with the Bethesda system of classification: Women with a current
             (within the last 20 months) abnormal Papanicolaou smear (Pap smear) suggestive of

          -  n. History of retinal vascular lesions, unexplained partial or complete loss of
             vision.

             in an investigational study involving no drug or device administration.
