  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The two-year prospective study aims at investigating the benefits of frequent replacement
      (monthly) orthokeratology lenses in myopia control in terms of effectiveness in control and
      prevention of ocular complications. The secondary objective will be investigating the use of
      weekly protein removal system in monthly replacement modality orthokeratology lenses on
      surface deposit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-year randomized trial. Existing orthokeratology lens wearers (aged 8-13 years),
      who have completed a 2-year myopia control using orthokeratology, will be recruited and
      monitored for another two years. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to monthly or
      yearly replacement modality. Axial elongation and ocular conditions will be compared between
      the monthly and yearly replacement groups.

      Subjects on monthly replacement lenses will be randomly assigned to normal cleaning and
      intensive cleaning groups. Subjects in normal cleaning group will be provided with
      complimentary contact lenses solutions for daily cleaning and disinfection. In addition to
      the daily procedures for lens case, subjects in the intensive cleaning group will be required
      to perform weekly protein removal. All subjects on yearly replacement lenses will be required
      to performed intensive cleaning such that they will follow normal daily cleaning and
      disinfection as well as weekly protein removal.

    <intervention_model_description>All subjects will be randomly assigned to use monthly or yearly replacement orthokeratology for a period of 24 months. Subjects on monthly replacement modality will be randomly assigned to normal cleaning and intensive cleaning groups. Subjects in normal cleaning group will be provided with complimentary contact lenses solutions for daily cleaning and disinfection. In addition to the daily procedures for lens case, subjects in the intensive cleaning group will be required to perform weekly protein removal.
Intensive cleaning is indicated for yearly replacement modality, thus, no randomization of care procedures in this group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Menicon Progent A+B is a commercially available protein remover for rigid lenses. It has received FDA clearance and been launched in Hong Kong for over a decade. The product contains two separate sterile solutions, one with sodium hypochlorite and the other with potassium bromide. By mixing the two solutions in a special vial, it can clean and remove protein deposits on the lenses. Parents of subjects assigned to use weekly protein remover will be required to soak the cleansed lenses in the solution mixture for not more than 30 mins every week. All lenses must be rinsed thoroughly with saline and cleansed with daily cleaner again before daily disinfection.</description>
