  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current international guidelines for CRC surveillance in IBD recommend as first choice
      the use of chromoendoscopy, and as an alternative high-definition white light endoscopy
      (HDWLE) for optimal dysplasia detection, based on data from clinical trials. However, data on
      the superiority of CE over HDWLE are not consistent in literature. The investigators
      hypothesize that the better performance of CE in some clinical trials is the result of the
      associated longer procedural time and the fact that every colon segment is examined twice.
      Currently, no studies have been published evaluating the dysplastic yield of back-to back
      HDWLE compared to HDWLE with a single pass or CE in patients with IBD. In the present study,
      the investigators aim to compare the yield of dysplasia/CRC between 1) regular HDWLE, 2)
      HDWLE back-to-back, and 3) CE.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators assume based on previous research a yield of 12% using high-definition
      white light endoscopy and 24% using either chromoendoscopy or high-definition white light
      endoscopy with a second examination (Imperatore et al 2019). To show non-inferiority of
      back-to-back HDWLE compared to CE, with a non-inferiority margin of 10% (power 80% and alpha
      5%,) a total of 226 patients per group is required.

      To demonstrate a superiority of back-to-back HDWLE compared to a regular HDWLE, with a 1:2
      allocation ratio of single-pass vs back-to-back , 113 and 226 patients per group are needed
      to achieve 80% power with an alpha of 5%. Therefore, the investigators will include 226
      patients in group back-to-back HDWLE, 226 in group CE, and 113 patients in group regular
      HDWLE. This amounts to a total of 560 patients. To account for any screen-failures The
      investigators will include at most 5% (of 560) additional patients until 80% power is
      reached.
