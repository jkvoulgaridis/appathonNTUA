    <description>The SLEDAI-2K Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K; 30 days) measures disease activity. It is a global index and includes 24 clinical symptoms and laboratory variables that are weighted by the type of manifestation, but not by severity or dynamic of the individual item. The total score falls between 0 and 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.</description>

    <description>The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Disease Activity Index 2004 (BILAG 2004) grading is anchored in the physician's intention to treat. Disease activity is graded separately for 9 body systems (constitutional, mucocutaneous, neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory, gastrointestinal, ophthalmic, renal, hematology) to 5 different grades (A to E) as follows:
A (&quot;Active&quot;) = Severely active disease B (&quot;Beware&quot;) = Moderately active disease C (&quot;Contentment&quot;) = Mild stable disease D (&quot;Discount&quot;) = Inactive now but previously active E (&quot;Excluded&quot;) = Never affected</description>

The Investigator will rate the overall status of the study participant in response to the following statement:
&quot;Please mark a vertical line on the scale below to assess the overall status of the study participant's Systemic Lupus Erythematosus signs and symptoms and the functional capacity of the study participant. The very far left end is 'very good, asymptomatic and no limitation of normal activities'; the very far right end indicates 'severe disease' . This refers to the most severe possible disease, and does not reflect the most severe ever seen in a particular patient, but the most severe disease ever seen in all SLE patients.&quot; When scoring the PGA, the assessor should always look back at the score from the previous visit.</description>
