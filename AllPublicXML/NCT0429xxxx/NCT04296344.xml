  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is prevalent in the U.S., with impact on physical and psychological functioning
      as well as lost work productivity. Minority and lower socioeconomic populations have
      increased prevalence of chronic pain with less access to pain care and poorer outcomes.
      Acupuncture therapy is effective in treating chronic pain conditions including chronic low
      back pain (cLBP), neck pain, shoulder pain and knee pain from osteoarthritis (OA).
      Acupuncture therapy, including group acupuncture, is feasible and effective, and specifically
      so for underserved and diverse populations at risk for health outcome disparities.
      Acupuncture therapy also encourages patient engagement and activation. As chronic pain
      improves there is a natural progression to want and need to increase activity and movement
      recovery. Diverse movement approaches are important both for improving range of motion,
      maintaining gains, strengthening and promoting patient engagement and activation. Yoga
      therapy is an active therapy with proven benefit in musculoskeletal pain disorders and pain
      associated disability. The aim of this pilot feasibility trial is to test the bundling of
      these two care options for chronic pain, to inform both the design for a larger randomized
      pragmatic effectiveness trial as well as implementation strategies across underserved
      settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to assess the feasibility of a low-cost, integrative intervention
      for chronic pain that can be replicated and implemented in underserved medical settings
      across the U.S. Over the course of 18 months, the study team will recruit at least 150
      outpatients with chronic pain from the Institute for Family Health (IFH) Family Medicine
      sites and Montefiore Medical Group sites, both Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).
      Treatment will consist of ten consecutive weekly group acupuncture therapy treatments. Yoga
      therapy treatments will start at week three and will consist of eight consecutive yoga
      therapy sessions that occur immediately following in a room adjacent to acupuncture therapy.
      Sessions are bundled to facilitate attendance that might be affected by two separate trips a
      week for participation. The primary outcome will be pain interference and pain intensity.
      Secondary outcomes will be pain free days, depression, functional status, patient activation,
      and pain medication utilization. These will be used during the pre-intervention phase, during
      which patients are receiving usual care only, and compared to the period after patients
      receive the combined acupuncture and yoga sessions. Data will be collected for 10 days before
      acupuncture and yoga therapy, and up to 24 weeks following the end of treatment.

      The study will use a 'multiple settings across baseline' quasi-experimental design. This is a
      repeated measures design, and each study participant will have multiple pre- and
      post-measures. The multiple pre-measurement points allows the study team to document and
      monitor what may be variable patterns of pain pre-intervention. This design optimizes
      feasibility and acceptability to patients and participating health centers while still
      generating meaningful outcome data. Specifically, the study team has not proposed
      randomization within the practices, rather allowing sites to offer the intervention to all
      patients with target diagnoses who meet eligibility criteria. To collect pre-acupuncture
      assessments of pain, the study team will include a 10 day intake run-in period prior to the
      initial acupuncture session that ensures treatment within a time frame that is consistent
      with typical time to appointments for many consultations.

    <measure>Change in Brief Pain Inventory: Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI is a nine-item measure which that asks patients to indicate how their pain influences function: select aspects of their everyday life including mood, walking, sleep and their ability to work over the past 24 hours, as well as the level and intensity of pain. This measure will be adapted for use by phone, modifying a question which asks participants to refer to a diagram of the body. total score from 0 to 10, with higher score indicating worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Free Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure to report the number of pain free days in the previous 2 weeks. This measure will be used pre- and post-intervention.</description>
