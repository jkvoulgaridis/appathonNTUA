  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation has been consistently associated with psychoneurological symptoms (PNS) among
      breast cancer survivors (BCS). Evidence supporting interventional strategies promoting
      symptom-self management in reducing inflammation-induced PNS in BCS is limited. Current
      guidelines for BCS encourage the consumption of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. The
      omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), abundantly available in fish, has a role in
      inflammatory downregulation. Low dietary DHA has been associated with inflammation and
      fatigue in BCS. Dietary planning targeting increased fish consumption thereby reducing red
      and processed meats are components of the major nutritional recommendations for BCS. A
      critical gap exists in knowledge regarding interventions promoting adherence to dietary
      guidelines in BCS supporting PNS self-management. This investigation uses personalized meal
      planning among BCSs (n=150) who are 1-2 years post-treatment for early-stage breast cancer
      and experiencing PNS (pain, fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance, stress) to evaluate the
      feasibility of a personalized meal planning approach in supporting adherence to current
      dietary guidelines for BCS. As a first step in this program of research, we will evaluate the
      feasibility of an personalized meal planning approach in promoting adherence to dietary
      guidelines for BCS through evaluating the feasibility of a personalized meal planning
      approach in a cohort of BCSs with respect to recruitment, group allocation, salivary
      inflammatory quantification and receptivity to and adherence with dietary interventions. This
      investigation will also contribute to a preliminarily evaluation of the efficacy of high or
      low fish diet in reducing inflammation (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-a) and PNS symptoms. Nationally,
      there is a priority for the development of personalized health strategies supporting
      self-management of adverse symptoms. This investigation focused on PNS in BCS is an initial
      step in generating new knowledge in efficacious approaches toward guiding decisions on
      dietary behavior change strategies that are personalized, cost-effective, and sustainable.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline depressive symptom at week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, Week 3 and Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale is 20-item self-report instrument. Each item is scored 0-4 at a 4-point scale, yielding a total between 0 and 80. A higher score indicates a worse depressive symptom.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline pain at week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, Week 3 and Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Pain Inventory short form assesses the severity of pain, location of pain, pain medications, amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week, and the impact of pain on daily functions. Each item is scored 0-10 at a 10-point scale, with 0 representing no pain or no pain interference and 10 representing worst pain or complete pain interference. The mean of 4 severity items will be used as a measure of pain severity, and the mean of the 7 interference items will be used as a measure of pain interference.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline fatigue at week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, Week 3 and Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Fatigue Inventory short form is a 9-item scale to assess cancer-related fatigue and its impact on daily functioning. Each item score 0-10 at a 10-point scale. On the BFI, severe fatigue can be defined as a mean score of 7 or higher.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline sleep disturbance at week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, Week 3 and Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The 21-item General Sleep Disturbance Scale consists of items evaluating various aspects of sleep disturbance (quality and quantity of sleep, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, excessive daytime sleepiness, and medication use) over the past week. Items are rated on a scale ranging from 0 (never) to 7 (every day). All items are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 (no sleep disturbance) to 147 (extreme sleep disturbance).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline perceived stress at week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, Week 3 and Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of stress will be measured by the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The final score is obtained by reversing responses to the four positively stated items and then summing across all scale items. A higher score represents a higher perceived stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline salivary inflammatory markers at week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To quantify salivary inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα), salivary samples will be collected at baseline, week 3, and 10 during the study period. Salivary assay kits (multiplex) specific to the inflammatory markers of interest will be used to quantify salivary samples according to established protocols.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Personalized Meal Plan</intervention_name>
    <description>Personalized dietary plans will be developed incorporating the NPAGCS, while personalizing the plan based upon anthropometric characteristics, gender, age and self-reported activity level upon entry into the investigation, goals, typical dietary consumption patterns, and food preferences. A trained research assistant will use the USDA MyPlate88 site (www.choosemyplate.gov) to enter participant characteristics and determine the appropriate calorie level. A daily checklist will be then generated outlining the number of daily servings that should be consumed for each food group. Information will also be provided regarding serving sizes for different foods in the respective food groups and education will be provided regarding tailoring personal dietary preferences to meet the guidelines. Participants will be provided with a printed copy of their meal plan and instructed to initiate it for a 8-week period.</description>

    <description>Following randomization, participants will be provided with fish to be consumed for 6 weeks. As a component of the dietary intervention, participants in high and low omega-3LC group will be provided with frozen, wild caught salmon (or if they dislike salmon, prepackaged, individual use foil packs of chunk light tuna). Salmon and chunk light tuna were chosen due to high omega-3LC content, low methylmercury content, low cost and ease of use. Vacuum packed, frozen salmon will be delivered to participants in large freezer bags and instructed to arrange visit times to ensure they can go directly home following the visit. Instructions for safe storage, fish handling and recipes to avoid fatigue of fish will be also be provided to participants when they receive the fish.</description>
