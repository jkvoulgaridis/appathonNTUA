      In normal-weight patients, numerous studies show an equivalence of efficacy between
      dinoprostone and balloon to induce labor. In obese patients, this efficacy is not known,
      although inductions of labor are more frequent. MODOBAT aims to describe the ability to
      obtain a vaginal delivery of two modality of induction of labor (vaginal dinoprostone and
      single balloon Foley catheter) in obese women at term.

      Obesity has for several decades become a global epidemic in developed countries. In case of
      pregnancy, obesity leads to an increased risk of obstetric complications, the indications of
      induction of labor are then more frequent. Unfortunately the rate of failed induction is also
      higher and therefore the risk of caesarean section is increased in obese women compared to
      normal-weight patients when induction of labor is indicated. However, in this context
      effectiveness of each mode of induction is not known. Some retrospective studies would
      suggest that the balloon would be more effective because it would not be affected by the
      increase in fat mass but this result are not , but the to confirm this hypothesis.

      The aim of this study is to describe the caesarean section rate in induction of labor by
      vaginal dinoprostone and single balloon Foley catheter in obese women. Patients in the
      vaginal dinoprostone arm will be included retrospectively and patients in the single balloon
      Foley catheter arm will be included prospectively.
