  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a bioimaging study of 89Zr-M7824 PET scans in patients with advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer who will be receiving M7824 alone or with standard of care
      chemotherapy. M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein that combines an anti-PD-L1 antibody and
      the extracellular domain of TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) as a TGFβ neutralizing 'trap', into a
      single molecule.

    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown improved treatment outcome in patients with NSCLC;
      however, there is room to further improve benefits. A novel agent such as M7824, a fusion
      protein which targets the tumor microenvironment where it blocks both the cell intrinsic
      PD-L1/PD-1 interaction and the immunosuppressive TGFβ, is hypothesized to be more effective
      than agents that target only a single pathway.

      This study aims to investigate functional imaging with 89Zr-M7824 to characterize the
      biodistribution of M7824 to support its clinical development. In Part A, we will evaluate the
      biodistribution of zirconium-89 (89Zr) labelled M7824 in a small cohort of lung cancer
      patients unselected for PD-L1 status (n=3). In particular, we will examine the ability of
      89Zr-M7824 to detect and quantitate intra-tumoural PD-L1 expression and correlate this with
      PD-L1 assessment in archival tissue. Based on this, Part B will gather additional data about
      the biodistribution of 89Zr-M7824 in an additional 9 patients. The requirement for patients
      in Part B to have high levels of PD-L1 positive cells in tumours based on a fresh biopsy or
      archival tissue at study entry will be informed by the data generated in Part A. Safety will
      be formally assessed also as a secondary endpoint at the end of Part A of the study and
      addressed if necessary. After completion of 2 imaging cycles, patients who do not show
      complete response to M7824 monotherapy after 3 therapeutic doses of M7824 may be transitioned
      to M7824/chemotherapy combination

    <description>Patients (pts) will receive an initial trace (100 mg, IV) dose of zirconium-89 (1.8-2.5 mCi) labelled M7824 (89Zr-M7824) on day 1, sequential PET imaging over 1 week will be performed to determine the biodistribution 89Zr-M7824 into the tumour and normal tissues. All patients who remain on study after Day 14 will have a 1200 mg dose of M7824 q2w beginning on Cycle 1 Day 15. Pts will then receive a 2nd infusion of 100 mg of 89Zr-M7824 with cold M7824 making a total dose of 1200mg on Day 29. All patients will then receive a dose of cold 1200mg M7824 on Cycle 1 Day 43. Patients will continue to receive a therapeutic dose of 1200 mg q2w of M7824 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not achieve a CR after 3 doses of M7824 in Cycle 1, may then commence treatment with concurrent chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed at conventional doses.</description>
