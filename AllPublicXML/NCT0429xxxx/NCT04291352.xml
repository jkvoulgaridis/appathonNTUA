  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Taurine, in combination with standard iron chelation therapy, is more effective
      than chelation therapy alone in reducing cardiac iron overload, oxidative stress and cardiac
      damage in β-Thalassemia.

      Protocol: Sixty subjects with transfusion dependent β-Thalassemia receiving deferasirox iron
      chelation therapy will be recruited and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either (1) placebo and
      continuation of their iron chelation or (2) a combination of iron chelation plus taurine.
      Transfusion and safety visits will be scheduled monthly with clinical/biochemical assessment
      visits every three months. The efficacy of taurine combined with standard chelation therapy
      will be assessed at baseline and 12 months posttreatment by both cardiac T2*MRI, and cardiac
      function. The recruitment period is projected to be 12 months from initiation.

        Participant inclusion criteria

        Participants who meet all of the following criteria will qualify for entry into the study:

          1. Diagnosis of transfusion-dependent Thalassemia being followed at the RBC clinic at TGH

          2. Age 18 or older
