  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effects of a resistance exercise training program on heart rate
      variability in a group of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. The study design is
      a randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study will be carried out in children diagnosed with cystic fibrosis
      aged 6 to 18 years. Individuals will be divided into two groups: control group (CON) and
      strength training (ST). Heart rate variability will be analyzed using KUBIOS and measured
      using a Suunto watch, with subjects in lying position without movements or speaking for 5
      minutes. Patients in the ST group will complete an individualized guided strength program for
      8 weeks (3 sessions of 60 min/week). Training prescription will be individualized and based
      on the 5 repetition maximum test (60-80%). Upper and lower limbs exercises will be used,
      including seated bench press, seated lateral row and leg press. Outcome measures will be
      performed at baseline and after 8 weeks.
