  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To know the effects of a physical therapy intervention in patients hospitalized with pleural
      effusion. The investigators will study the effects of the intervention in hospital stay,
      health status, psychologica distress and quality of life.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form measures walking, moderate- and vigorous intensity, and total PA and daily time spent sitting on weekdays. PA was reported in MET·minutes/week and days per week and was scored using standardized IPAQ scoring protocols to yield total metabolic equivalent minutes (MET·minutes/week) of PA per week. Sitting time was reported as the amount of time in hours and/or minutes participants spent sitting on a weekday during the past seven days.</description>
