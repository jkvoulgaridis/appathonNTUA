  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteochondral defects (OCD) of the talus are pathologic lesions of the talar cartilage and
      its subchondral bone and might severely deteriorate the quality of life. For the treatment of
      multiple and/or large talar OCDs and in patients with failed previous surgical treatment the
      Ankle Spacer was developed. Six patients are included in a prospective clinical and
      radiological study with a follow-up of two years.

      One surgeon in the investigator's center implanted 10 Ankle Spacers between April 2018 and
      October 2020. The average age was 41.7 years (20 - 70 years). All patients get a standard
      followed-up at 6 weeks, 12 weeks. After the first four patients, all following patients are
      enrolled in a prospective study and where followed up after 1 and 2 years additionally. The
      American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Score, the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score
      (FAOS), the European Foot and Ankle Score (EFAS), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain
      are collected. Radiographic parameters such as implant loosening, cystic changes,
      lateral/medial prominence of the implant, congruency to the talar rounding, progression of
      osteoarthritis or bone ware of the tibia plafond are recorded. The Ankle Spacer is a
      one-piece implant system that replaces the articulating upper talus surface of the
      tibio-talar joint, and offers several implant sizes in order to fit to the different talus
      sizes. It is anatomically designed to the native upper talus surface to provide an optimal
      fit to the distal articular surface. It has a rough titanium plasma spray (TPS) coated under
      surface with two posts and spikes for implant fixation. The rough surface enables secondary
      fixation by means of bone ingrowth and the spikes at the posterior part of the prosthesis
      allowing for optimal adherence of the implant and for minimal iatrogenic damage upon
      fixation. By these means, the anatomical situation and the natural congruency of the ankle
      joint are mirrored to an optimal extent.

        osteoarthritis of the talus with up to grade two (Kellgren-Lawrence-Score) osteoarthritis
        on the tibial site are included.
