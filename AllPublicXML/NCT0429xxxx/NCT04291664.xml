  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I multi-center, open-label, study of DST-2970 to determine the MTD, overall
      safety/tolerability, PK/pharmacodynamic parameters, and efficacy in prostate cancer
      patients.The study will include a dose escalation phase followed by a dose expansion phase.
      Each cohort will consist of a &quot;run-in&quot; period to assess pharmacokinetic trough, as well as
      C1hour, C2hour, and C3hour levels of standard of care abiraterone acetate, followed by a
      minimum of an 80-hour washout (treatment delay), then initiation of treatment with DST-2970.

      The patient population that will be evaluated in this study include patients with castration
      sensitive or castration resistant prostate cancer who experience a rising PSA, with or
      without radiographic progression, while taking abiraterone acetate.

      In this protocol, &quot;initial PSA response to abiraterone&quot; is defined as having a ≥ 30% drop in
      PSA levels (confirmed by a second PSA level one month later) during the first 6 months of
      treatment with abiraterone. These patients who subsequently experience a rise in PSA while on
      abiraterone are considered as having &quot;acquired resistance&quot; to abiraterone in the context of
      this protocol. Patients not meeting the definition of having an &quot;initial PSA response to
      abiraterone&quot; are considered as having &quot;primary resistance&quot; to abiraterone in the context of
      the protocol.

      In the dose escalation phase, all patients with a rising PSA can be enrolled, whether they
      had an &quot;initial PSA response to abiraterone&quot; or never responded to abiraterone.

      Two expansion cohorts will be opened. One expansion cohort will evaluate patients who did
      achieve an &quot;initial PSA response to abiraterone&quot; within the first 6 months of treatment as
      defined above, but subsequently progressed by PSA with or without radiographic progression. A
      second expansion cohort will evaluate patients who did not achieve an &quot;initial PSA response
      to abiraterone&quot; as defined above but have PSA progression with or without radiographic
      progression.

      The rationale of the study is to determine if the better bioavailability of DST-2970 will
      overcome resistance to abiraterone acetate experienced in these two clinical settings.

      In all cohorts, treatment will continue until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,
      investigator and/or sponsor decision, intercurrent illness or patient withdrawal of consent.

      Patients will be monitored regularly with physical examination and laboratory tests.
