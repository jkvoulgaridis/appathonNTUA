  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy to diagnose significant prostate cancer in patients with
      suspicious lesions in mpMRI (multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging) by comparing
      prostate biopsies performed by cognitive fusion with respect to those performed with software
      fusion (BK-fusion®). Half of the patients included will undergo a systematic prostate biopsy
      + target biopsies by cognitive fusion and the other half of the population, will undergo a
      systematic prostate biopsy + target biopsies by software fusion.

      Various techniques have been developed to perform targeted prostate biopsies aimed at
      suspicious lesions detected in mpMRI. The two most frequently used are cognitive fusion, in
      which the physician locates the areas where the mpMRI detects suspicious lesions and directs
      the puncture by ultrasound; and software fusion, in which the images of the mpMRI are
      integrated by a software with the ultrasound allowing to direct the puncture to the lesion
      itself. Both forms of fusion biopsy have proven to be superior to systematized prostate
      biopsies in the detection of significant prostate cancer, although neither has demonstrated
      superiority over the other.
