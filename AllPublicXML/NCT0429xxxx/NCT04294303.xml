  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a major public health problem worldwide. Heart failure is one of the most
      common causes for hospitalizations among people over 65 years of age in the United States.
      Nationwide, approximately 25% of patients admitted to a hospital for heart failure are
      readmitted to a hospital within 30 days.Multiple transitional care interventions, including
      telemonitoring, aimed to decrease hospital readmission rates and improve quality of life in
      heart failure (HF) patients have been explored. Most studies evaluated effectiveness of
      telemonitoring used in conjunction with other interventions. In this study, investigators
      studied the role of a potentially cost-effective, telemonitoring program in reducing
      readmissions and improving quality of life among patients admitted with HF exacerbation in a
      teaching hospital. They aimed to determine impact of a standalone telemonitoring system.

      Primary outcome: Rate of hospital readmission for heart failure Secondary outcomes: Quality
      of life, Perceived effect of the intervention on heart-failure related care

      60 patients will be recruited for this study. After signing the consent form, participant
      will be randomized to receive usual care (i.e. they will get the current standard care for
      patients with heart failure) or usual care and participation in the iGetBetter program.
      Participant will complete a questionnaire in the hospital about their quality of life.
      iGetBetter group will be given a Bluetooth-equipped scale, blood pressure cuff, and a tablet
      with a data plan. Participant will check their weight and blood pressure at home daily, using
      the equipment provided. This information will be sent via the internet to iGetBetter's web
      server, where the data will be temporarily stored. The data will be monitored by the
      physician researcher. If their blood pressure is high (e.g. greater than or equal to 140/90
      for two days in a row) or they gain a significant amount of weight (e.g. 2 pounds in two
      days), the study team will be automatically notified. A member of the study team will alert
      participant cardiologist and the cardiologist will have the option to make any
      recommendations, such as contacting the subject to schedule an office visit.

      Total participation in this study will last 45 days after patient is discharged from the
      hospital.

      Regardless of the assigned group, participant will be asked to complete two questionnaires
      after 45 days. A member of the research team will contact participant by phone to complete
      these questionnaires. One of these questionnaires will investigate their quality of life; the
      other will assess how participant feel the care they have received has affected their health.
      Patients assigned to the iGetBetter group will also complete a third survey about their
      satisfaction with the program.

Felt more in the control of the disease
Felt more connected with the medical team
Felt that it reminded to take the pills
Each question is answered on the following scale: very true, true, somewhat true, and not true at all.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the telemonitoring group were given an iPad with installed iHealth application, a scale, and an electronic blood pressure monitor (a mobile web-based telemonitoring system). These devices were interconnected via Bluetooth. The iPad had permanent internet connection. Patients were taught to use the equipment to check and record their weight, blood pressure, and heart rate every morning, for 45 days after the hospital discharge. Data was automatically uploaded via iHealth application in a secure database.</description>
