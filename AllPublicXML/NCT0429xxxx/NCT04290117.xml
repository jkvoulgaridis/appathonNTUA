    <textblock>
      The aim of the present project is to combine &quot;Acceptance and Commitment Therapy&quot; and &quot;sleep
      hygiene + light-therapy (so-called chronotherapy)&quot; serially in a sample of employees to
      reduce levels of subjective exhaustion.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective exhaustion measured by the German Version of the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>approx. every two weeks, and at follow up (i.e., approx. 5 weeks after last training session)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall mean score as well as three subscales of Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure ( P = physical fatigue; E= emotional exhaustion; and C= cognitive weariness, each ranging from 1-7).
Note: Higher scores indicate higher levels of exhaustion (overall as well as on each scale P, E and C)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective well-being as assessed by General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>approx. every two weeks, and at follow up (i.e., approx. 5 weeks after last training session)</time_frame>
    <description>Sum over twelve items, higher scores indicate worse psychological well-being</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective well-being as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>approx. every 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sum over each of the subscales assessing somatic, depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms. The subscale assessing panic symptoms, alcohol abuse and intake of medication will be categorically evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of circadian rhythm</measure>
    <time_frame>Actimetric devices are worn during 2 x 28 days continuously. The outcome of actimetric data are aggregated per person and training episode</time_frame>
    <description>Actimetric devices are worn during 2 x 28 days continuously. These devices store the amount of activity in a resolution of 30 Hz 24/7. For data analyses, these activity data will be aggregated to three values (stability, variability and relative amplitude) per participant and training episode by non-parametric circadian rhythm analyses; higher values indicate higher stability, variability and amplitude</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective and objective sleep quality: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>PSQI is collected approx. every four weeks and at follow up (i.e. approx 5 weeks after last training), the single question and actimetric data are measured daily</time_frame>
    <description>Subjectively assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, higher scores indicate worse subjective sleep quality), by a single question about sleep quality (higher scores indicate worse quality) and by actimetric analyses</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective sleepiness in the morning</measure>
    <time_frame>KSS is measured daily</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), higher scores indicate higher sleepiness</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in daytime subjective sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>ESS approx every four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS): higher scores indicate higher sleepiness</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Chronotype</measure>
    <time_frame>approx. every 4 weeks and at follow up (i.e., approx. 5 weeks after last training session)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by a short version of the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, higher scores indicate a later chronotype</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Burnout severity</measure>
    <time_frame>every 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Maslach Burnout Inventory using sumscores of the subscales emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal achievement. Higher scores indicate higher exhaustion, depersonalization and better personal achievement</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Absences</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed daily</time_frame>
    <description>Numbers of days absent if available from the employer</description>
