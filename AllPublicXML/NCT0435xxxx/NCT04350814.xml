  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Depression affects 12.6% of Canadians at some point in their life. Depression is
      associated with staggering personal and economic costs. There are several treatments that
      have been shown to treat episodes of depression when they occur. Unfortunately, more than
      half who respond to these treatments go on to re-experience an episode of depression. Even
      with psychological and pharmacological interventions designed to prevent future episodes,
      relapse and recurrence of the disorder remain alarmingly high. A patient-focused and
      self-directed intervention that harnesses the effects of an Eastern-influenced concept,
      called self-compassion, has shown tremendous promise in treating acute depression.
      Self-compassion is being moved by one's own suffering, and a desire to alleviate such
      suffering.

      Objectives: In the proposed project, the investigators will examine whether a self-compassion
      intervention is effective in preventing relapse/recurrence of depression over a 12-month
      period among people who are at high risk for relapse. The investigators will also examine
      whether the intervention works to prevent depression by increasing the innate ability to
      bounce back from stress, a concept known as resilience.

      Methodology: 120 participants with a history of depression will be randomly assigned to the
      self-compassion intervention or a self-assessment reflection condition, and their respective
      relapse rates will be examined over a period of 12 months.

      Importance to Research: This will be the first study to examine the effects of
      self-compassion as a preventive intervention for depression.

      Impact on health: If successful, this new intervention can be used by thousands of people in
      Saskatchewan and Canada who are at risk for depression relapse.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible to participate in the study, participants must be: a) 18 years old or
             older; b) have experienced at least one episode of depression; and c) exhibit elevated
             residual symptoms of depression—as indicated by a score of 5 or more on the Patient
             Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001). As the majority of
             people experience both depression and anxiety symptoms concurrently, participants
             experiencing elevated anxiety symptoms will not be excluded from the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if they indicate: a) a current diagnosis
             MDD, substance use disorder, psychosis, or mania in accordance with the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—5 (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association,
             2013); b) the presence of major health conditions (e.g., cardiovascular diseases,
             cancer, hypothyroidism, etc.); and c) currently undergoing psychological or
             pharmacological treatment at the time of recruitment
