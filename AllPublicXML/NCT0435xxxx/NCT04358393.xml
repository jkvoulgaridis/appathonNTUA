      This is a two-parts study that will initially evaluate the safety and tolerability of APG-115
      as asingle age in Part I, followed by a combination of APG-115 + 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) in
      part II.

        1. The Dose escalation of APG-115 will use standard 3+3 design. APG-115 is
           administeredorally once daily (QD) on Day 1-5 every 28 day cycle. The starting target
           dose is 100 mg(dose level; DL1) and will be increased in subsequent cohorts to 150 mg
           (DL2), 200 mg(DL3) and 250 mg (DL4), accordingly.

        2. 5-AZA is administered at 75 mg/m2/d SC daily on Day 1-7 every 28 days.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a two-parts study that will initially evaluate the safety and tolerability of APG-115 as a single agent in Part I, followed by a combination of APG-115 + 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) in part II.
The Dose escalation of APG-115 will use standard 3+3 design. APG-115 is administered orally once daily (QD) on Day 1-5 every 28 day cycle. The starting target dose is 100 mg (dose level; DL1) and will be increased in subsequent cohorts to 150 mg (DL2), 200 mg (DL3) and 250 mg (DL4), accordingly.

    <description>Part I is to assess the safety and tolerability of APG-115 by assessing the Dose Limiting Toxicity of APG-115 . End points included: Incidence of DLTs during the first 3 weeks of treatment of each dose cohort; Severity and frequency of any adverse event(s) (AE) and serious adverse event(s) (SAE) based on NCI CTCAE 5.0</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a diagnosis of histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory (R/R)
             acute myeloid leukemia by WHO classification for which no available standard therapies
