  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent studies, it has been observed that robotic devices make a positive contribution to
      motor recovery and the activities of daily living. However, studies about the effects of
      stroke rehabilitation with robotic devices are limited.

      This study aimed to investigate the effect of upper extremity robotic rehabilitation on motor
      function and quality of life in stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors have difficulties in participating in activities of daily living due to
      functional disabilities. The majority of patients after stroke need rehabilitation to gain
      independence in daily life as the first target. Therefore, different treatment approaches are
      used in stroke rehabilitation.

      The use of technology in stroke rehabilitation has become very common in recent years.
      Robotic devices used in rehabilitation enhance the healing process by giving patients more
      intensive and task-oriented exercises. A lot of systematic and meta-analysis studies have
      shown that robot-assisted devices provide positive motor recoveries, especially in the
      treatment of upper extremities. However, the optimal timing, duration, and dose of robotic
      rehabilitation that should be applied after stroke remain uncertain.

      In the light of this information, this study examines the effects of the robotic device
      produced for upper limb rehabilitation on daily life activities and motor function.

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and at six weeks of the beginning of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment is an index to assess physical performance in individuals who had a stroke. This index consists of 33 items. Each item scored between 0 and 2. The highest score for the upper extremity is 66.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and at six weeks of the beginning of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth Scale is used for measuring the spasticity of upper extremity skeletal muscle. The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) is scored from 0 to 5 to measure the resistance encountered when performing passive muscle stretching. The lowest score is 0 (no spasticity) and the highest score is 5 (severe spasticity).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper Extremity Motor Activity Log</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and at six weeks of the beginning of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Upper Extremity Motor Activity Log consists of two subscales (amount of use and quality of movement) that determine how often the patient uses the affected side in daily life activities and how successful this activity is. Items on each scale are scored between 0 and 5.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and at six weeks of the beginning of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale is designed for stroke patients but can be also used for other diseases. The scale has 22 items divided into 4 areas of daily life. These areas are mobility, kitchen, domestic and leisure activities. Each item scored between 0 and 3. The highest score of scale is 66.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mini-Mental State Examination is used to determine the cognitive level. This scale consists of 11 items. The highest score is 30. 24 and higher scores are considered normal.</description>
