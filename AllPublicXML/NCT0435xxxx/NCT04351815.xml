  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluated the interest of a short-term (2 weeks) prehabilitation program
      compared to no prehabilitation before thoracic or urological surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prehabilitation is a form of global strength training, aims to improve functional capacity
      before surgery.This preparation compensate for its decrease due to the intervention. This
      process includes physical training, nutritional and psychological care.

      Previous studies consider 4 weeks to be the ideal duration time for such program. However,
      extended program duration may reduce subject compliance and may not be possible for patient
      who can not or do not want to postponed their surgery.
