  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multimorbidity is common, especially in the elderly population and is associated with a
      higher risk of mortality and disability, lower quality of life, polypharmacy, increased
      healthcare use and costs. Physical inactivity increases the risk of multimorbidity and
      individuals with multimorbidity are more likely to be physically inactive. Physical activity
      can prevent and treat several diseases. Physical Activity on Prescription (PAP) is an
      evidence-based method used in health care to increase physical activity. The aim of this
      study was to investigate whether self-reported physical activity level increase and sedentary
      time decreases in individuals who have received PAP in health care completed with enhanced
      individual support by physiotherapist at PAP-reception in wellness center for six months and
      to compare individuals with one diagnosis to individuals with multimorbidity.

      The study population consisted of 331 adults who received PAP in health care and enhanced
      individual support by a physiotherapist at PAP-reception during six months. Data has been
      collected retrospectively from a local register with questionnaires from the PAP-reception.
      Self reported physical activity minutes/week and hours of sedentary time/day were measured at
      baseline and at six months. Differences in physical activity minutes and sedentary time from
      baseline to six months have been compared between individuals with one diagnosis and
      individuals with multimorbidity.

        The study population consists of men and women aged 20-93 years who received PAP from
        health care and enhanced individual support by physiotherapist at PAP-reception in wellness
        centre in central and western Gothenburg in 2015-2016. The majority of the study population
        had a multimorbidity and the most common diagnosis was musculoskeletal disease.
