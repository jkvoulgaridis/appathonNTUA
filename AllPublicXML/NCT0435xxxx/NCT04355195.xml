  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project &quot;QV-Delirium&quot; is based on the decision of the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) of
      May 18th, 2017. The aim is to improve inpatient care for older patients who are undergoing
      inpatient surgery and thus to specifically reduce the postoperative risk of delirium. This is
      achieved through the implementation of evidence-based and consensus-based measures to prevent
      postoperative delirium in a comprehensive structured concept in routine care. The transparent
      documentation in an electronic patient file enables the relationships between the symptoms to
      be depicted in accordance with the clinical circumstances and the genesis of the
      postoperative delirium to be recorded and treated at an early stage.The independent Institute
      for Quality Assurance and Transparency in Health Care (IQTIG) receives the elements
      predefined (e.g. incidence of delirium) by IQTIG with which the quality is measured. The
      content of the additional elements from the routine data (see primary and secondary outcome
      measures) is merged internally and with BARMER data for a joint evaluation.
