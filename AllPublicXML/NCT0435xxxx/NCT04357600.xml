      The study aims to evaluate the effect of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell therapy on patients
      who suffered from liver cirrhosis caused by Hepatitis B.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating the effect and safety of stem cells therapy in patients with liver
      cirrhosis that is specifically caused by Hepatitis B infection, the participants will be
      chosen based on inclusive and exclusive criteria to ensure the eligibility of the patients
      for this study. The patients will be given therapy in the form of allogeneic mesenchymal stem
      cells transplantation, the stem cells in this study were provided from Prodia Stem Cell
      Indonesia (ProSTEM). The stem cells being will also be subjected to certain criteria to
      ensure safety. The data of this study will be derived from the observation results of the
      patients' liver damage status in weeks 4, 6 and 12. Aside from that, hemodynamic will be
      conducted as a part of the observation

    <description>All research samples will be treated by Intravenous injection of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells and hemodynamic observation will be done for 24 hours after treated. Periodic post-treatment observation will be done on 1st month, 3rd month, and 6th month after therapy. The Independent variable in this research is Child-Pugh B Cirrhosis caused by Hepatitis B, while the dependent variable is the degree of liver function damage consisting of an examination of liver function, Child-Pugh score, and MELD score.</description>
