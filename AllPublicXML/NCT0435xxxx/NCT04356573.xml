      The specific hypothesis is that the consumption of 2 Hayward green kiwifruit (containing
      actinidin protease) prior to 100g of ground beef will increase the rate of protein digestion
      from the beef in the elderly, leading to an increased uptake of the essential amino acids.
      Furthermore, this increased essential amino acid availability will produce a greater
      postprandial net anabolic protein response, as well as increased fractional synthetic rates
      of muscle and liver proteins.

      The specific hypothesis is that the consumption of 2 Hayward green kiwifruit (containing
      actinidin protease) prior to 100g of ground beef will increase the rate of protein digestion
      from the beef in the elderly, leading to an increased uptake of the essential amino acids.
      Furthermore, this increased essential amino acid availability will produce a greater
      postprandial net anabolic protein response, as well as increased fractional synthetic rates
      of muscle and liver proteins.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will use a double-blinded crossover design
      involving two intervention arms; in both arms 100g of ground beef (cooked weight) will be
      consumed following either 2 Hayward green kiwifruit (containing actinidin protease) or 2
      Hort16A Gold kiwifruit (devoid of actinidin protease) by elderly subjects.
