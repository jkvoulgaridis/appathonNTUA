      AIM: To verify the effect of a feedback system on optimizing quality during CPR on
      mannequins.

      Hypothesis: The quality of CPR performed by healthcare professionals through a defibrillator
      monitor with a feedback system is higher than those that do not use a feedback system on a
      manikin.

      METHOD Type of study: Pre-experimental with pretest-postest design. Sample: Health
      professionals of the General Emergency Service of the Virgen de la Arrixaca University
      Hospital (HCUVA).

      Sampling type: Non-probabilistic for convenience. Variables: sex, age, profession, years of
      experience, last CPR training received, last time performing CPR, depth, frequency, quality
      CPR, perception of the quality of CPR.

      Statistical analysis: Student's t for related samples and McNemar.
