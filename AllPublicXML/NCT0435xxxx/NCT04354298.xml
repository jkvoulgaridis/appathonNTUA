  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this work is to maintain or improve daily function of people with PD by
      addressing cognition. The overall objective is to discover interventions that aid in
      cognitive functioning. The central hypothesis is that engagement in an improvisational dance
      (ID) class will benefit cognition among people with PD. Improvisational dance involves
      spontaneously generated movement, similar to how one moves in everyday life. The literature
      shows that ID classes positively impact motor impairments associated with PD, such as
      balance, gait, and functional mobility. Along with being physically demanding, ID requires
      the use and coordination of a number of cognitive capacities to properly execute movements.
      This type of activity challenges, and thus may strengthen, cognitive processes such as motor
      planning, decision making, flexible thinking, initiation, and execution, which may give
      people cognitive based strategies to be utilized in various aspects of daily life. By
      improving motor function and/or cognition, ID may also contribute to improved daily
      functioning, or the ability to perform and participate in daily activities. Despite these
      theoretical links, evidence for the effect of ID on cognition and overall daily function is
      limited. The current project objective is to address this gap and better understand the
      effects of ID for people with PD. Specifically, it will test the effect of IMPROVment®, a
      method of ID designed for people with PD, on cognition and daily function.

      Participants' cognition will be assessed at baseline (T1) using the NIH Toolbox Cognitive
      Battery, the Alternate Uses Task, and the Weekly Calendar Planning Activity. Global cognition
      will be assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. They then will be randomly assigned
      to either the immediate intervention (ID) or waitlist-control (WC) group. The ID group will
      start the 12-week IMPROVment® intervention, which consists of weekly ID classes that progress
      according to a standardized method while the WC group will receive no intervention and
      continue with their regular daily routine and activity level. After 12 weeks, both groups
      will complete cognitive testing again (T2). Cognitive test scores will be compared across
      time points and between groups using a mixed model repeated measures ANOVA. The investigators
      hypothesize that IMPROVment® will have positive effects on the cognitive abilities of people
      with PD. Participants will also complete two questionnaires to assess daily function at T1
      and T2: Older Americans Resources and Services Scale- Extended Version and PROMIS
      Satisfaction with Participation in Discretionary Social Activities. These scores will be
      compared similar to the above aim. The investigators hypothesize that IMPROVment® will have
      positive effects on daily function in people with PD.

      Participant mood will be assessed in two different ways. The first being to investigate the
      immediate effect of participating in an IMPROVment® class on mood, fatigue, and anxiety. The
      investigators hypothesize that mood will positively improve from pre to post of each class.
      To assess this, participants will respond to a scale assessing mood, specifically sadness,
      nervousness, energy, and overall well-being before and after each class every week. The
      second measurement is to investigate the effect of IMPROVment® on anxiety, fatigue, and
      depression. The investigators hypothesize that IMPROVment® class will decrease feelings of
      depression for those with PD. All participants will fill out the Parkinson's Anxiety Scale,
      the Parkinson's Disease Fatigue Scale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale short form before
      and after participating in the 12-week IMPROVment® program.

      Achievement of these aims will provide further support for the IMPROVment® method for people
      with PD experiencing cognitive deficits. The long-term impact will better cognition and daily
      functioning in people with PD, and thus enhanced everyday lives.

    <measure>Change in Cognition (National Institute of Health Toolbox: Cognitive Battery)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and After the 12-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A comprehensive, performance-based test comprised of motor, emotion, sensation, and cognition assessments. For the purpose of this study, the investigators will be using the cognitive battery to assess processes involved in learning and comprehension (i.e. thinking, remembering, problem-solving, judging). The battery consists of tasks involving the use of executive function, memory, attention, and language.</description>
