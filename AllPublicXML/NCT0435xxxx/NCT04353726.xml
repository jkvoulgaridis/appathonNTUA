  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is to develop a weight loss and weight maintenance program through dietary
      modifications for adults with obesity. Although scientific studies have shown the feasibility
      of rapid and safe dietary weight loss and subsequent weight maintenance, no efficacious
      dietary weight management program is widely available, and thus bariatric surgery remains the
      most reliable approach for weight loss/management. Safe and effective dietary weight loss and
      subsequent weight maintenance require flexible, individualized advice by an experienced
      dietitian/nutritionist.

    <description>During a 12-month period, participants will attend a total of 22 diet improvement sessions, each of which will last approximately 1 hour. Twelve sessions will be held in the first 5 months and will be focused on safe and efficient weight loss. The participants will learn to create a personalized weight loss diet from their kitchen based on their diet practice and food preference. The next 10 sessions will be held in the last 7 months and will be focused on weight maintenance and healthy eating. The participants will build skills to select foods and create meals that prevent them from overeating.</description>
