  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of YH001 administered intravenously (IV) in
      combination with Toripalimab. The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of YH001 when administered in
      combination with Toripalimab to subjects with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will have a run-in phase to explore the safety and tolerability of YH001 as a
      single agent for 21 days as DLT observation period then followed by a combination phase to
      further explore the safety and tolerability of YH001 combined with Toripalimab (anti-PD-1
      antibody) for each dose level during dose escalation.

      The dose escalation will follow the traditional &quot;3 + 3&quot; dose escalation scheme. These
      subjects will be treated with YH001 and Toripalimab. YH001 will be administered intravenously
      every three weeks (Q3W) for 15 weeks (5 cycles) at doses of Dose A, Dose B, Dose C, Dose D,
      Dose E, Dose F and Dose G. Toripalimab will be administered by IV (Q3W) by the fixed dose of
      240 mg from the 2nd cycle to 5th cycle. A single subject will be enrolled at Dose A as
      starting dose of YH001, and subsequent cohort will be expanded to include 3-6 subjects.
