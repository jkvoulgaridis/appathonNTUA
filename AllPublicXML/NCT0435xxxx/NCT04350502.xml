  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of pleural infection is increasing worldwide since the last two decades.
      Antibiotics are one of the cornerstones of the treatment of this disease and must be
      associated to a correct evacuation of the pleural effusion.

      Data concerning the pleural diffusion of antibiotics currently used in community acquired
      pleural infection are scarce. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the pleural
      pharmacokinetic of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in patients with a complicated pleural
      infection (patients who need a chest tube insertion).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only scarce data are known on the pleural diffusion of antibiotics. Most of these data are
      concerning antibiotics that are not commonly used for the treatment of community-acquired
      pleural infections. Moreover, these data are obtained from studies using heterogenous
      methodologies (single or repeated evaluation of the antibiotic concentration in the pleural
      effusion, with or without correlation to the serum concentration; animal model or very
      specific population (i.e. uninfected patients or following lung surgery).

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the pleural pharmacokinetic of amoxicillin
      and clavulanic acid in patients with a community-acquired complicated pleural infection.

      Patients with a complicated pleural infection will be managed according to the French
      guideline with a chest tube drainage associated to a treatment with amoxicillin (2g*3 by day)
      and clavulanic acid (200mg*3 by day). Repeated samples of pleural fluid and serum will be
      taken to evaluate antibiotics' concentrations at H0; H½; H1; H2; H3; H4; H8 and H24.

      The follow-up and management of the included patients will not be modified by the study
      protocol except for the pleural and serum samples. Clinical, biological and radiological
      (chest x-ray and/or thoracic ultrasound) evaluation will be performed daily. Success of the
      pleural drainage will be assessed at day 3.
