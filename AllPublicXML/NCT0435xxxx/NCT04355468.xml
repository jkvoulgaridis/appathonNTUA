  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proper assessment of pain and adequate analgesia in thoracic surgery is a challenging issue
      for medical practitioners. Basic aspects of thoracic anaesthesia are general anesthesia,
      intubation with double lumen tube and separation of lung ventilation, however proper
      analgesia needs to be standardized. Role of opioids in this clinical setting is reduced due
      to high risk of respiratory system complications. Instead, use of opioid free anaesthesia and
      regional anaesthesia is proposed. The aim of this study is to compare the use of opioid
      anaesthesia with opioid free anaesthesia and paravertebral block.

    <description>General anaesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.1 mgkg-1, propofol 2 mgkg-1 and cisatracurium 0.15 mgkg-1. Anaesthesia was maintained with one minimal alveolar concentration (MAC1) sevoflurane. Patients awoke from anaesthesia in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) where extubation was performed by an anaesthetist after administration of incremental doses of atropine and neostigmine, as required. After surgery, if a patient complained of pain then she/he was given i.v. oxycodone by an anaesthetist before commencing the patient controlled analgesia (PCA). This dose was titrated to achieve adequate analgesia or until side effects occurred. Each patient then commenced PCA. The PCA solution was oxycodone (1mgml-1) and the PCA was programmed to allow a self-administered bolus dose of 1mg oxycodone with a lockout time of 5 min. Additionally, patients were given 1 g intravenous paracetamol every 6 h and 100mg of intravenous ketoprofen every 12 h.</description>

    <description>In patients in the Control group for surgical analgesia fentanyl was used. For induction of anesthesia used 1.5 µgkg-1, then fractional doses of fentanyl 1 to 3 µgkg-1 were administered if heart rate (HR) or mean blood pressure rose more than 20% above the base-line value obtained just before surgery commenced.</description>

    <description>In the OFA group, a single-shot ThPVB was performed at the Th3 to Th4 level, approximately, 2.5 to 3 cm lateral to the tip of a spinous process. Plain bupivacaine (0.3 ml kg-1) was then injected after a negative aspiration test for air or blood. The efficacy of the blockade to cold was checked after 20 min with a plastic ampoule of saline kept in the freezer. A difference in the sensation to cold between the blocked and unblocked sides was taken to indicate an effective block. After ThPVB was performed a continuous intravenous infusion of lidocaine and ketamine was started: immediately after induction of anesthesia, lidocaine was administered as a bolus i.v. at a dose of 1.5 mgkg-1 and ketamine in bolus i.v. 0.35 mgkg-1, followed by an infusion of lidocaine 2.0 mg/kg-1/ h for 2 hours, continued at a dose of 1.2 mg/kg-1/ h and ketamine infusion 0.2 mg/kg-1/ h for 2 hours, continued at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg-1/ h.</description>
