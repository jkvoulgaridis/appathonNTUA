  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The series of the 3-year study aims to explore parents' experience of caring for a child's
      weight change among parents of children and adolescents with cancer, examine the associations
      and trends among muscle wasting and health-related variables, and then implement and assess
      effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach with a personalized physical activity (walking)
      training intervention on improving muscle mass and other health-related variables.

      Specific aims, year by year

        1. The aim for Year 1 is as follows:

           Aim 1: To explore parents' experience of caring for promoting a child's exercise among
           parents of children and adolescents with cancer.

        2. The aims for Year 2 are as follows:

           Aim 2-1: To examine the associations between the degree of muscle wasting and
           health-related variables (fatigue level, symptom distress level, physical activity
           involvement, dietary intake, and QoL) among children and adolescents with cancer.

           Aim 2-2: To examine the trends of changes in muscle wasting and health-related variables
           (fatigue level, symptom distress level, physical activity involvement, dietary intake,
           and QoL) during the first 6 months of cancer treatment among children and adolescents
           with cancer.

        3. The aim for Year 3 is as follows:

      Aim 3: To examine the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach with a personalized
      walking exercise program on changes in body composition and health-related variables (fatigue
      level, symptom distress level, subjective physical activity involvement, objective physical
      activity measurement, dietary intake, and QoL) among children and adolescents with cancer.

    <description>This assessment includes weight loss grading and muscle power grading. Weight loss grading uses a 5x5 matrix to grade the patient's level of cancer-associated weight loss.Grade 0 = complete paralysis; Grade 1 = flicker of contraction present; Grade 2 = active movement with gravity eliminated; Grade 3 = active movement against gravity; Grade 4 = active movement against gravity and some resistance described as poor, fair, or moderate strength; and Grade 5 = normal power.</description>

    <time_frame>week 4</time_frame>
    <description>MFS versions are designed for ages 5-18. The parent proxy reports, which include children 2-4 years of age (toddler), are used to assess the parent's perception of their child's fatigue. The instrument consists of 18 items. Patients are assessed on how often a particular problem occurred in the past month by using a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 and rescaled to 0-100, so that higher scores indicate fewer symptoms of fatigue.</description>
