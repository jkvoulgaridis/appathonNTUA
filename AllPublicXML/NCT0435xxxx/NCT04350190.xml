      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To determine the clinical efficacy of apatinib mesylate tablets combined with PD-1 in the
      treatment of recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Ⅰ.To explore the adjuvant medication regimen of recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma.

      Ⅱ.Provide high-level evidence-based medical evidence for the new individualized treatment
      strategy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Eligible patients begin to use apatinib mesylate tablets and PD-1, apatinib mesylate tablets
      at the recommended dose of 250mg,orally, QD, continuous administration, 4 weeks (28 days) as
      an observation cycle. Until the disease progressed or unbearable adverse reactions appeared.
      If missed medication occurs during the medication period, it is confirmed that the next
      medication time is less than 12 hours, then there will be no replenishment. The recommended
      dose of PD-1 is 200mg/time, Q2W, intravenous injection, 4 weeks (28 days) as an observation
      cycle, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
