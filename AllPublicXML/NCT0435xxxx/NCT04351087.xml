  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to conduct a randomized trial comparing the clinical outcomes of PRP (standard
      intervention) versus Microfragmented adipose tissue (investigational) for the treatment of
      knee osteoarthritis.

      Hypothesis: Both interventions will result in significant improvement in patient-reported
      outcomes. We hypothesize that Microfragmented adipose tissue will provide superior outcomes.

      Background

      Knee osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Standard of care treatments
      for knee OA include activity modification, weight loss, therapeutic exercise and injections
      like corticosteroids and viscosupplement. These commonly used non-operative treatments focus
      on symptom palliation, but are not disease modifying.

      Orthobiologics have emerged as a promising treatment for knee OA. The most widely studied
      orthobiologic is platelet-rich plasma (PRP). PRP is a dense concentration of platelets
      derived from autologous whole blood and platelets are concentrated 2-5x compared to baseline.
      The platelets have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective properties.6 PRP has
      been shown superior to placebo and viscosupplement for knee OA in several clinical trials.

      While PRP is the most widely studied and used orthobiologic, it contains only platelets.
      Therefore, a simple, office-based intervention able to collect additional reparative cells to
      treat knee OA would be ideal. Adipose (fat) is a known source of reparative cells like
      pericytes and it can be easily and safely aspirated in the clinic. The adipose tissue
      aspiration and processing is accomplished through a simple process. After local anesthesia to
      the site of adipose aspiration (lower abdomen or buttock), 30ml of adipose is aspirated
      through a cannula. That adipose is then processed in accordance with FDA guidelines including
      minimal manipulation to remove oils.. Using minimally manipulated Microfragmented adipose
      tissue has been shown safe for use as injection therapy for knee OA for 3 years.

      Methods:

      Patients / Outcome Measures / Sample size: Patients with unilateral symptomatic knee OA will
      be recruited from the sports medicine and orthopedics clinics, as well as advertising flyers
      within the clinic. All patients' first visit will include a medical evaluation and assess
      best treatment plan for that patient, regardless of candidacy for this study. This evaluation
      includes x-rays of their knees as a standard part of the evaluation. If they meet criteria
      and choose to enroll, they will be randomly assigned to either the PRP or Microfragmented
      adipose tissuetreatment group. Patients will complete follow up visits and surveys at defined
      time points through 12 months.

    <description>157cc of whole blood will be harvested via standard venipuncture from the antecubital fossa and mixed with 24cc ACD-A (manufacturer recommends 8cc ACD-A per 52cc of whole blood). 156ml of whole blood will be processed in the FDA Cleared Angel cPRP system at 2% hematocrit. 1ml of whole blood and the resultant PRP will be analyzed in the Sysmex XN-350 for complete analysis (platelet, leukocyte, red blood cell counts). The remaining PRP will be injected under sterile technique using ultrasound-guidance through a superolateral approach. For patient comfort, 2cc of 1% lidocaine can be administered using a 26-gauge needle (into soft tissues only). PRP will then be injected using a 25-guage needle. A maximum of 6ml of PRP will be injected. Injection site will be cleaned and bandaged and patient will be dismissed with post-injection precautions and 1 month follow-up scheduled.</description>

    <description>Adipose is aspirated from the subcutaneous tissue of the buttock or abdomen. Aspiration site is injected with 10ml 1% lidocaine with epinephrine. A small poke incision is made with an 11-blade scalpel. Then 120ml of Klein solution is injected into the adipose tissue. Solution sits for 15 minutes to allow for adequate anesthesia. Aspiration cannula is inserted and moved in a back and forth motion for 2 minutes to allow for adipose aspiration. 30ml fat will be aspirated. Aspiration site is cleaned and bandaged. The aspirated fat is processed using the Lipogems system. 30ml of adipose is transferred to the device, saline is run through the device to remove oils and then approximately 5-7ml of adipose tissue is removed and ready for injection. The Microfragmented adipose tissue are then injected in identical fashion to the PRP above.</description>
