  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to learn more about on the safety of the drug Xarelto. The
      study will enroll patients for whom the treating doctor are prescribing Xarelto for the
      prevention of brain attack or the prevention of blockage of an artery in the non-central
      nervous system. Only patients suffering from decreased renal function and irregular heart
      beat will be considered. The study plans to include 500 Taiwanese adult male and female
      patients with the age above 20 years. Patients will be followed up based on routine medical
      practice over a period of 12 months and information on their well-being and any medical
      events will collected.
