  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess Elelyso treatment on bone disease in Gaucher
      patients currently treated with other enzyme replacement therapy.

      Experience from early access program (2009-2012) has suggested that some patients who have
      been stable on imiglucerase have shown poor scores of QCSI with Fat Fraction below the cut
      off point of 0.23 which is considered &quot;bone at risk&quot;, and have demonstrated remarkable
      improvement upon switching to Elelyso, including particularly 2 patients who did not have any
      change in dose or any drug interruption prior to the switch.

      These findings may be explained by the better glycan structure of imiglucerase (see Tekoah et
      al, 2013). The fact that in many patients prevention of bony complications is the main
      indication for ERT highlights the importance of this study, as all clinical trials of all
      ERTS heretofore did not include the bones as primary or secondary end-points but only as
      exploratory, and as such had only limited value,

      Open-label study in patients with Gaucher disease currently treated with commercial ERTs.
      Eligible patients will receive intravenous (IV) infusions of Elelyso every two weeks. The
      infusions will be administered at the selected medical center or in the home care setup. The
      dose of Elelyso will be the same dose of the other ERTs . Bone parameters QCSI and BMD will
      be assessed at baseline, 12 months and 24 months.

      The intention is to open 3 more sites in Israel thereby making this IIR a multi center
      national trial
