    <measure>Change of patient's perception of vulvovaginal dryness</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change of patient's perception of vulvovaginal dryness associated with vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women in Hyalo Gyn gel group compared to no-treatment group. The vulvovaginal dryness was reported on a four-point scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe).</description>

    <description>Change of patient's perception of vulvovaginal dryness associated with vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women in Hyalo Gyn gel group compared to no-treatment group. The vulvovaginal dryness was reported on a four-point scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of patient's perception of vulvovaginal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change of patient's perception of symptoms associated with vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women in Hyalo Gyn gel group compared to no-treatment group. Each symptom (dryness, irritation/itching, soreness, dysuria, dyspareunia) will be reported on a four-point scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the average score of Vaginal Health Index (VHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change of VHI in postmenopausal women in Hyalo Gyn gel group compared to no-treatment group. VHI will be calculated on the basis of vaginal elasticity, vaginal fluid volume, vaginal pH, vaginal mucosa epithelial integrity, and vaginal moisture on a scale ranging from 1 (poorest) to 5 (best). VHI assigned score is the sum of subscores and ranges from 5 to 25. A lower score corresponds to a greater atrophy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of vaginal pH</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change of vaginal pH in postmenopausal women in Hyalo Gyn gel group compared to no-treatment group. The pH values are grouped on a four-point scale and scored respectively: pH lower than 5 = 0; pH between 5 and 5.49 = 1; pH between 5.5 and 6.49 = 2; pH higher than 6.49 =3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of sexual function through questionnaire Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of sexual function in postmenopausal women in Hyalo Gyn gel group compared to no-treatment group. Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire consists of six domains - desire (two items), arousal (four items), lubrication (four items), orgasm (three items), satisfaction (three items), and pain (three items) - answered on a five-point Likert scale (0, no sexual activity; 1, never/very low; 5, always/very high). A score is calculated for each of the six domains, and the total score is obtained by summing all of the items. Total score ranges from 2 to 36. A lower score corresponds to a greater sexual dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of sexual function through questionnaire Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of sexual function in postmenopausal women in Hyalo Gyn gel group compared to no-treatment group. Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) questionnaire consists of 13 items scored on a five-point scale (0, never; 1, rarely; 2, occasionally; 2, frequently; 4, always). The total score is obtained by summing all of the items. Total score ranges from 0 to 52. A higher score corresponds to a greater sexual dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Amelioration of the vaginal maturation (VM) index</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Amelioration of VMI in postmenopausal women in Hyalo Gyn gel group compared to no-treatment group. Vaginal maturation (VM) index is calculated quantifying the percentages of parabasal, intermediate, and superficial cells. The following formula is used: VMI = [1(% superficial cells)] + [0.6(% intermediate cells)] + [0.2(% parabasal cells)]. The index ranges from 0% to 100%.The higher the maturation index, the higher the number of mature cells (0%-49%, low stimulation of the vaginal epithelium; 50%-64%, moderate stimulation of the vaginal epithelium; 65%-100%, high stimulation of the vaginal epithelium).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's global assessment of overall satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's global assessment of overall satisfaction in postmenopausal women in Hyalo Gyn gel group compared to no-treatment group.Patient's global assessment (PTGA) is evaluated as the patient's overall satisfaction of the treatment scored on a four grade scale, ranging from 0 to 3 (0= dissatisfied or very dissatisfied, 1= moderately satisfied or satisfied, 2= very satisfied and 3= greatly satisfied). A higher score corresponds to a greater satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease in the method of Hyalo Gyn gel administration</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Ease in the method of Hyalo Gyn gel administration will be reported by the patients as excellent, good, acceptable, bad or unacceptable</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local tolerability at the application site</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Local tolerability of Hyalo Gyn gel at the application site will be evaluated by both the clinician and the patient through a 5-point scale: 5 = excellent (no reaction), 4 = good (small reaction that spontaneously resolves), 3 = moderate (reaction tolerated with difficulty by the subject), 2 = poor (reaction needing interruption of treatment), 1 = bad (serious reaction)</description>
