  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most previous clinical trials that addressed exercise for sarcopenic elderly subjects focused
      on community-dwelling older adults who were relatively healthy. There is a notable paucity of
      high-quality research investigating the effects and feasibility of exercise for hospitalized
      or institutionalized older people, who are generally frailer and more severe in functional
      impairment than those living in the community. Moreover, most reported exercise programs were
      of long-term duration, which typically lasted 3 to 6 months with two sessions per week. It
      remains unclear whether short-term exercise would be effective for treating sarcopenia.
      Therefore, the investigators aimed to assess the effectiveness of short-term exercise for
      treating sarcopenia in hospitalized older patients aged 80 years and over.
