  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to understand the interaction between HIV and the host at the
      earliest stages when HIV medications are paused. Volunteers with HIV will interrupt
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) and then have intensive studies preformed two to three times per
      week. Most will resume therapy within three weeks, even if the virus does not rebound during
      this time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, people living with HIV will undergo intensive sampling prior to and following
      an interruption of their antiretroviral therapy (ART). Individuals will be asked to resume
      ART once the virus is detectable, or after approximately three weeks if the virus remains
      undetectable.

      Individuals who were able to control their virus before ART (&quot;controllers&quot;) will be able to
      participate in an extended treatment interruption and have less restrictive ART restart
      criteria.

      The overall goal of the study is to characterize the interaction between the host and the
      virus at the earliest stages of virus replication and to identify predictors of rebound
      before virus becomes detectable.
