  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trial for the evaluation of diagnostic tests. The sample was composed of adults
      under mechanical ventilation who passed the spontaneous breathing trial and was ready to be
      extubated. The maximum expiratory pressure measured in the usual way and the maximum
      expiratory pressure generated during the induced cough were taken as predictor variables. The
      outcome variable was extubation failure, measured at 72 hours and at 7 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After completing the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), with the extubation decision defined
      by the physician in charge of the patient and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) as usually
      measured greater than 30 centimeters of water (cmH2O). Following this, the patient was
      allowed to rest for 5 minutes in the same condition. With the patient in the supine position
      sitting 45 ° to 60 °, the closed suction catheter was removed, an elbow was placed at 90 °
      and a bacterial filter in series with the endotracheal tube (ET), an adapter was also coupled
      with a outlet port to the aneroid pressure gauge. In series an inspiratory unidirectional
      valve was placed that did not allow expiration. Immediately 2 ml of physiological solution
      was slowly instilled through the port in the 90º elbow to trigger the cough reflex. The
      presence or absence of reflex cough and the MEP during induced cough (MEPic) value were
      verified.

      As a safety method, the procedures were stopped if the patient presented signs of intolerance
      such as respiratory rate (RF)&gt; 35 breaths per minute, saturation &lt;90%, heart rate (HR)&gt; 140
      beats per minute or increase of 20 % of resting levels.
