  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers are often treated with external beam radiotherapy. Current radiotherapy treatments
      are performed using computed tomography (also known as CT) scans which may not always clearly
      identify the cancer. In some instances, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be able to
      better identify cancers. Therefore, efforts are currently underway to use the MRI scans to
      improve radiotherapy treatments or eventually even use radiotherapy equipment that only uses
      MRI scans to guide treatments. This new technology that will only use MRI scans to guide
      treatments is called the Linac-MR (linear accelerator with an MRI). The purpose of this pilot
      phase of the study is to test whether the Alberta linac-MR P3 system at the Cross Cancer
      Institute can acquire high quality MR images safely. It will allow the researchers to develop
      the best collection of MR images possible with this new machine, in order to allow them to
      visualize tumors for future patients that are treated on this machine.

      This prospective, pilot phase, clinical trial is an imaging study to optimize the necessary
      MR sequences on the Alberta linac-MR P3 system to allow for MR-guided radiotherapy in adult
      patients with cancer that are treated with high dose external beam radiotherapy. Each
      participant will undergo a single MR imaging session (30 - 40 minutes) on the Alberta
      linac-MR P3 system. Towards the end of the study, patients will be approached to participate
      in an optional sub-study, where they will undergo a total of five MR imaging sessions
      (performed every two to five days) to allow for an assessment of inter-fraction motion.

    <description>Clinical radiologists, medical physicists, and radiation oncologists will work together to develop MR sequences that can delineate tumour target volumes on the Alberta linac-MR P3 system. Over the course of the trial, the clinical radiologists will work with medical physicists to optimize these sequences to allow for the development of optimal MR images, with the goal to develop of series of protocols that can be utilized to provide clear MR image guidance for each tumour group.</description>
