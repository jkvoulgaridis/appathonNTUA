  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether daily use of azithromycin will reduce the rate of exacerbations
      and improve lung ventilation and perfusion assessed by XE-MRI. The sensitivity of XE-MRI to
      detect COPD progression will be compared with standard clinical assessment measures including
      standard lung function tests, 6 minute walk test, and patient reported quality of life.

    <description>A moderate COPD exacerbation is defined as new or increased COPD symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence) for at least 2 consecutive days that lead to treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. A severe COPD exacerbation is defined as new or increased COPD symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence) for at least 2 consecutive days that lead to hospitalization or death.</description>
