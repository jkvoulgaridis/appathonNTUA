  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial (IA)
      delivery of Dexamethasone and Ketorolac into the arteries supplying the sphenopalatine
      ganglion (SPG) - a collection of neurons that plays an important role in headache disorders -
      in patients with refractory migraine, cluster headache and trigeminal neuralgia. All patients
      must fail standard treatments prior to enrollment in the trial.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an outpatient, minimally invasive method to deliver Dexamethasone
      and Ketorolac to the SPG via the intra-arterial route. A microcatheter will be advanced via
      the radial (preferably) or the femoral artery (in case the radial approach is not feasible)
      using fluoroscopic guidance and standard interventional techniques, into the distal internal
      maxillary artery. This artery is a branch of the external carotid artery and supplies the
      territory of the sphenopalatine ganglion. The microcatheter will be advanced to the ostium of
      the distal small branches that supply the SPG (i.e. small arteries feeding the vasa
      nervosum). Once the microcatheter is in a good position, 15 mg Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate
      and 15 mg of Ketorolac Tromethamine will be infused over 30 minutes.

      The procedure will be performed with local anesthetic at the arterial puncture site.
      Conscious sedation will be used for anxious participants. After the procedure, the
      participant will be observed for 5 hours in ICU setting and then discharged to home.

      The procedure will be performed unilaterally for participants with cluster headache and
      trigeminal neuralgia. The procedure could be performed bilaterally for participants with
      migraine.
