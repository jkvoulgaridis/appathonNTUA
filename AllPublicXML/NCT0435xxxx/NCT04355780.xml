  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done because researchers want to learn more about genes that control the
      immune response in the participant's lungs and blood when the participant have lung disease
      leading to respiratory failure.

      Primary Objective

      To evaluate the feasibility of performing single cell gene expression analyses on tracheal
      aspirates from immunocompromised pediatric patients with immune compromising conditions,
      including HCT recipients.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess whether cell composition and activation states in longitudinally obtained
           tracheal aspirate and blood samples are able to distinguish unique immunopathology for
           each of the early post-HCT lung diseases.

        -  To assess whether cell composition and activation states in longitudinally obtained
           tracheal aspirate and blood samples are different between two immunodeficient patient
           populations (alloHCT vs non alloHCT) with lung disease and respiratory failure.

        -  To test the hypothesis that allogeneic T cell responses are implicated in the
           pathogenesis of early post-HCT lung diseases.

      Exploratory Objectives

      To correlate immune cell signaling in the lower respiratory tract and blood of patients with
      early post-HCT lung diseases with the presence or absence of pathogenic microbes at each
      site.

      This study involves a Tracheal aspirate, Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and blood samples. The
      tracheal aspirates and blood samples will be obtained within 24 hours of intubation, then
      twice more every 3 -4 days, and then once a week until the patient is extubated. If the
      primary treatment team performs bronchoscopy with BAL, then an aliquot of residual BAL fluid
      will be obtained.
