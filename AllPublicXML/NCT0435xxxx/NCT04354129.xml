    <textblock>
      This study will assess the relative safety, tolerability, and participant satisfaction in
      participants using the rapid manual push method with Cutaquig®. The hypothesis being that
      treatment with Cutaquig® by rapid manual push method will improve the safety, tolerability
      and patient satisfaction of participants with PID or SID.

      Cutaquig® by rapid push is already approved in Canada and has proven to be efficacious in
      preventing significant infection. However, relative safety, tolerability, and patient
      satisfaction have not been studied in these patients. The information gained from this study
      will improve the safety and tolerability knowledge database and will support the optimal use
      of Cutaquig® - thus benefitting both physicians and patients.

    <textblock>
      Primary and secondary immunodeficiency diseases (PID and SID, respectively) affect the
      development and/or function of the immune system, resulting in increased frequency of
      infection. Treatment of these disorders using Cutaquig® (a subcutaneous immunoglobulin
      infusion (SCIG)) was licensed in Canada in 2018 and has proven to be effective in preventing
      significant infection. Other brands of SCIG can be given by the participant using a syringe
      (called rapid manual push method), which shows the same efficacy as administration by a
      programmable pump. The rapid manual push method has the potential to improve quality of life,
      reduce infusion time, and reduce the cost of administration. This study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and patient satisfaction of Cutaquig® by the rapid manual push method
      in participants with PID or SID. It will also compare the efficacy of Cutaquig with prior
      SCIG treatment, if applicable, in participants with PID or SID.

    <description>The primary objective is to assess safety of cutaquig® in patients with PID or SID by rapid push at infusion volumes ranging from 15 mL/infusion site to a maximum of 60 mL/infusion site into a maximum of 4 infusion sites and
assess safety of a maximum infusion speed of 120 mL/h for all sites combined (2 mL/min)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Key secondary objectives are to assess by a questionnaire
time to infuse cutaquig®
total volume infused per infusion site
total volume infused per infusion
frequency of infusion
number of injection sites
ease of infusion (injectability) Other secondary objectives are to
assess patient quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction by using the EQ-5D-5L (descriptive system compromises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety and depression).

        This study will observe approximately 30 adult patients with PID or SID requiring IgG
        replacement therapy, regardless of gender or treatment regimen. Patients will be enrolled
        from about 2-5 centres in Canada.
