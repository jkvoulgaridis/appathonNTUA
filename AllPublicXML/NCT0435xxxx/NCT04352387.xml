  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to examine the feasibility of a culturally-adapted
      group-based Montessori Method for Dementia program in Chinese community and examine its
      effects on engagement and affect in community-dwelling people with dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who were aged 60 years or over and with mild to moderate dementia were recruited from
      six community centres and three care homes. Participants were randomly assigned to either the
      intervention group to attend the Montessori-based activities or the comparison group to
      attend the conventional group activities for one hour twice per week over eight weeks. All
      sessions were videotaped to facilitate analysis. Observations of engagement and affect were
      conducted for each intervention session on the individual participant for a ten-minute period
      at the beginning, middle, and end of the activity in order to have observations from multiple
      time points. The Menorah Park Engagement Scale and the Apparent Affect Rating Scale were used
      to assess the engagement and affect during the activities based on observations.
