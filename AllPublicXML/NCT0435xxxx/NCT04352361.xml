      This study is designed as a single-center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled,
      single-dose escalation trial. The dose groups are 25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg respectively. The
      next dose should be tested only if the previous dose has demonstrated to be safe and
      tolerated, and each subject will receive either the experimental drug or a placebo only once.
