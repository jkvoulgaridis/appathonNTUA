    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-interventional trial to measure the health related quality of life
      of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on a fixed LAMA/LABA/ICS triple
      therapy (Trimbow®) and characterisation of determinants of treatment adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of COPD therapy is the prevention of exacerbations and clinical
      deterioration. To achieve these goals, treatment adherence (i.e. taking medication as
      prescribed) is important. However, non-adherence (not taking medication as prescribed) is
      common in COPD and can be affected by lifestyle changes or use of multiple inhalers.

      The effects of Trimbow® on patients' health related quality of life, adherence and clinical
      outcomes have not been assessed in a UK real-world setting. This non-interventional trial
      aims to collect data from COPD patients under routine care over a 6 month period, for whom
      their doctors has decided to prescribe Trimbow® as per the authorised indication. We plan to
      investigate any changes in quality of life, as well as changes in lung function and the need
      for any additional therapy over 6 months. We also plan to investigate the adherence or
      reasons for non-adherence to Trimbow® as used in everyday routine.

        Patients will only be included in the Non-Interventional Trial if Trimbow® has been
        prescribed in line with its current marketing authorisation and the guidance specified in
        the summary of product characteristics (SmPC).

        Physicians are urged to offer enrolment to all of their eligible patients consecutively as
        they present for their routine visit, and not select patients from their patient database.

        Eligible patients may only be included in the NIT after providing written (witnessed, where
        required by law or regulation), IEC-approved informed consent, or, if incapable of doing
        so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable representative of the
        patient.
