  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many human populations across the world are deficient in the intake of dietary fiber. This
      decline in fiber consumption parallels an increase in prevalence of a multitude of diseases
      (e.g. colorectal cancer, multiple sclerosis). A possible link for this association between
      dietary changes and the diseases could rest in the trillions of commensal gut microbes that
      digest dietary fibers, provide energy for colonic cells, and modulate the immune system.
      However, the molecular mechanisms that link fiber deficiency via the activities of the gut
      microbiome to various diseases have been poorly understood. The investigators previously
      showed that, in a mouse model with a defined human gut microbiota, removal of fiber from the
      diet favors proliferation of bacteria that degrade the gut's protective mucus lining (Desai
      et al., 2016, Cell). In the proposed project, the investigators aim to translate our findings
      from mouse studies to humans using a 2x2 crossover study among healthy adults. Forty
      participants will be randomly assigned to a low- or high-fiber dietary intervention and then,
      following a washout period to reverse any changes, switched to the other diet type. By
      employing longitudinal sampling of stool collections, the investigators envision that
      participants will exhibit increased abundance and activities of mucolytic bacteria when fed a
      low-fiber diet. The unique selling point of the proposed study involves setting up
      high-throughput culture collections of mucus-degrading bacteria, whose abundances and
      activities will be investigated by sequencing and enzymatic assays in stool. Additionally,
      the investigators will measure inflammatory markers in blood using CyTOF to assess whether
      short-term fiber deficiency exerts detectable changes in the host immune function. Thus, the
      proposed dietary intervention clinical trial will help elucidate the role of fiber deficiency
      in various chronic diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Industrialized nations tend to consume less dietary fiber and, in many nations with a
      Western-style diet, average consumption is half the recommended daily intake of 25-38 g/day.
      Dietary fiber is an important component of a healthy diet because it increases fecal bulking
      and laxation, lowers cholesterol and regulates levels of blood glucose. The connection
      between low fiber-intake and disease may rest with the gut microbiota, the trillions of
      commensal microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteria found in the gut
      are responsible for an array of functions that support human health, including conversion of
      host-indigestible fibers into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which provide energy for
      colonic cells, support mucus production, and modulate the immune system (Martens et al.,
      2018, Nat Rev).

      The investigators have recently investigated the effects of a fiber-free diet in a
      gnotobiotic mouse model with a 14-member synthetic microbial community showing that
      mucus-degrading bacteria outcompete fiber-degrading bacteria, causing degradation of the
      colonic mucus layer (Desai et al., 2016, Cell). One member of this synthetic community,
      Akkermansia muciniphila, is a commensal bacterium found at 1-4% relative abundance in the
      human gut and feeds specifically on the host-secreted mucins (Belzer and de Vos, 2012, The
      ISME Journal). However, this bacterium is significantly enriched in the gut of patients with
      multiple sclerosis and colorectal cancer, suggesting that its mucolytic capabilities may play
      a role in these diseases (Weir et al., 2013, PLoS One; Jangi et al., 2016, Nat Commun). A
      microbial shift toward enrichment of mucolytic bacteria could be an important precursor to
      gut-linked diseases. While observational studies have identified a lower risk of irritable
      bowel diseases (IBD) in people who consume diets high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables (Hou
      et al., 2011, Am J Gastroenterol), no study has explicitly investigated the effects of fiber
      on the functional capacity of the human gut microbiome in the context of effects on the
      mucus-degrading microbiome. Based on our published work in mice, for the current project, the
      investigators hypothesize that deficiency of dietary fiber in humans promotes increased
      activities of mucus-degrading bacteria, thereby reducing the mucus lining in the intestine.
      The investigators request pump priming to initiate this pilot project, as it will generate
      foundational datasets to inform numerous follow-up studies.

      Thus, the current project seeks to translate findings from mouse models to humans, using a
      crossover study among healthy adults. Participants will be randomly assigned to a first
      dietary intervention that is low or high in fiber and then, following a washout period
      intended to reverse any compositional changes, switched to the second diet type. The diets
      will be evaluated by a nutritionist to ensure that they differ in fiber content, but are
      comparable in terms of caloric and macronutrient content. The targeted amount of dietary
      fiber intake from the high-fiber test meals will be around 30 g/d more than the low-fiber
      diet. In addition to dietary records, the investigators will administer questionnaires,
      obtain basic clinical measures (blood pressure, weight, height, waist/thigh circumference),
      collect blood samples for immunological assays and collect stool samples before and at the
      end of each diet intervention for sequencing and functional profiling of bacterial
      communities.

      The investigators will recruit healthy volunteers to participate in a 2x2 crossover design
      controlled-diet study. After statistical consultation, the investigators conclude that the
      investigators require a sample size of n=17 in each sequence group (a total sample size of
      N=34) to have 90% power to detect a -0.5 difference in means for alpha diversity (Shannon
      index, based on comparable dataset from David et al., 2014, Nature) under the two diet
      conditions. Thus, in case of dropouts, the investigators have decided to enroll a total of
      N=40 participants in the study. Volunteers who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will
      be randomly assigned to a high- or low-fiber diet intervention and then, after a week-long
      washout period, will receive the second diet type. High and low fiber meals containing a
      variety of fiber types will be served to participants at a designated drop-off site (home or
      workplace) for one week in order to decrease variance in fiber intake, increase adherence to
      the diet, and maximize knowledge of the nutritional content in participants' diet.
      Nutritionally balanced dietary interventions are designed by a qualified dietitian at SERVIOR
      &quot;Repas sur roues&quot; catering service in conjunction with the LIH study team. Participants on
      both diet interventions will be given multivitamin supplements in order to further ensure
      they receive essential vitamins and minerals.

      At the baseline visit, our team will work with nurses from the Clinical and Epidemiological
      Investigation Center (CIEC, headed by Dr. Manon Gantenbein) to collect demographic data,
      anthropometry, early life history, family medical history, detailed dietary patterns, and
      biological samples (blood, urine, and stool). Participants will use the MyFitnessPal app to
      log their diet throughout the study, except for foods or beverages provided during the
      dietary interventions. After each intervention period, a week-long washout period will be
      employed to reverse any changes that occurred due to the diet.

      Mid-way through each intervention and washout period, the investigators will administer a
      brief survey containing questions relevant to our research objective. At each of these
      visits, CIEC nurses will collect biological samples and anthropometric measures. Participants
      will also be asked to drop off a stool sample for the next two days. All participant data
      will be pseudonymized when exported from Research Electronic Data Capture application
      (REDCap) for analysis and will be handled in accordance with the General Data Protection
      Regulation (GDPR). The study will be submitted for ethical approval by the Ministry of Health
      and for review by CNER before being opened for recruitment as early as March 2020.

    <ipd_description>Sequencing data from microbiome samples and isolates will be uploaded to public repositories (ENA/EBI). Pseudonymized participant data will also be shared with collaborators and may be available to other researchers upon request and based on the participants sharing preferences as indicated in the consent form.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data will become available to share with other researchers at the time of publication. Accession numbers for sequencing data will be published in the manuscript.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>All IPD will be pseudonymised. Researchers requesting use of this data should make an inquiry by email to the Principal Investigator explaining the purpose of their proposed work and what types of metadata they are interested in before any data sharing can be approved. In keeping with data minimization policies, we will share only the data that is relevant for the proposed analyses. Furthermore, data may not be shared if the participant has indicated on their consent form that they do not wish their data to be used in follow up studies (in the same or a different field of research).</ipd_access_criteria>
