  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies that have examined the effects of compression stocking on athlete's performance have
      been carried out in a single test, i.e., the athlete's was examined during
      running/riding/jumping with and without the compression stocking.

      Yet, using the stocking during all training session and for longer period of time might
      further enhance the performance. Compression stocking were found to have a positive effect on
      the athlete' recovery. We hypotheses that if the athlete will train with the stocking on a
      regular basis and his/her recovery will improve, it will also improve the performance. In
      addition, the athlete's body may need an adjustment period to use the compression stocking.
      As such, the advantages of using compression stocking might only be revealed after training
      with the socks during a period of time and not just performing the tests/competitions with
      it.

      All runners will be examined for: demographical parameters, time of 5 Km run, distance of
      forward jumping with two leg.

      The sample will be divided into 2 research group: research group - all training with
      compression stocking and control group -training without compression stocking. Both groups
      will continue their training program for 8 weeks according to their coach. A second
      examination for the same tests at the end of the 8 weeks.
