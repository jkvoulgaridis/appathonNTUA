  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is currently the therapeutic standard
      for patient with Breast Cancer. Symptoms are common among patients receiving this treatment.
      Ten percent of them will develop severe and chronic radio-induced toxicities, such as breast
      radio-induced-fibrosis impairing their quality of life (QoL). Yet, paying attention to
      symptom improves the empowerment and psychological adjustment to the disease. Web-based
      systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been shown to
      prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control, and to enhance
      patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being.Benefits of
      systems to elicit e-PRO improve reliable measure of health-related quality of life (QoL)
      remains discussed.

      To date, there are few specific treatments for these severe radio-induced fibrosis except the
      antifibrotic combinaison Pentoxifylline/Vitamin E with inconsistent result.

      Since 2000, we and others have developed a mechanistic approach modulating the severity of
      RIF by targeting the Rho/ROCK/CTGF pathway, especially by inhibiting Rho activation by
      pravastatin. Our preclinical data, then followed by the Phase II PRAVACUR-01 trial, concluded
      that the use of pravastatin has an anti-fibrotic action on different experimental models and
      reduces the severity of the grade of fibrosis in 50% of patients.

      Patients can now benefit from this new anti-fibrotic agent.

      Taken as a whole, these data encourage combining both drug (pravastatin) and
      non-pharmacological intervention , in particular e-PRO, in the RIF management.

    <description>Statements of symptoms and patients' health status (PROs) will be collected via a web interface, including access and use in patients with burden symptoms.
The platform will include four items concerning 7 side effects of fibrosis of grade &gt; 2 in breast cancer. Patients will be encouraged to evaluate on a 5-point Likert scale the frequency, the intensity and the repercussions on the daily life of some symptoms during the last 7 days, in particular on:
general pain
anxiety
sadness
texture of the treated breast
Patients will also be invited to express themselves on the severity of two other symptoms of their choice, to their worst degree, by listing and rating them on a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;None&quot; to &quot;Very severe&quot; Finally, the aesthetic impact will be evaluated by patients on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 to 100mm</description>
