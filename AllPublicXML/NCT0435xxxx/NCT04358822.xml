  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sequence of events at the time of delivery includes delivery of the infant, clamping of
      the umbilical cord, and lastly delivery of the placenta. There are some benefits for delayed
      cord clamping. This study aims to compare the effects of two different duration of delayed
      cord clamping.

      Infants will be randomized into two groups based on the duration of delayed cord clamping: 30
      seconds vs 120 seconds. Different hemodynamic effects will be measured in each group at
      different time intervals. The hypothesis of the study is that delayed cord clamping for 120
      seconds is associated with better cardiac output and with other hemodynamic advantages.

      The study will include full term infants delivered via cesarean section. Written informed
      consent for participation in the study will be obtained from parents prior to delivery.
      Newborns will be randomly assigned into two groups according to the duration of cord
      clamping: Group 1: the cord will be clamped at 30 seconds, and Group 2: the cord will be
      clamped at 120 seconds of life. Stopwatch will be started when infants buttocks (or head if
      breech) are delivered from the uterus. The time elapsed will be counted aloud by the
      investigator in 10-second intervals. During this time, the infant will be held in linen on
      the mothers legs. Care will be taken not to apply traction on the cord. Milking of the cord
      will not be allowed. Immediately after resuscitation, infants will be attached to the leads
      of the electrical cardiometry device. Device output will be imported at 5, 10, and 15 minutes
      after birth in both groups. A follow up measurement will be imported later at 24 hours of
      age. In addition, a peripheral blood sample will be obtained at 24 hours of age for
      assessment of hemoglobin, glucose and bilirubin concentrations. .

      The calculated sample size is 31 newborns in each group. This number will be adequate to
      detect an effect size of 10% in the mean cardiac output between the two groups with 95%
      confidence and 80% power. The study plans to recruit 34 infants in each group (10% attrition
      rate).
