    <description>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are used for cell preparation. PD-1(programmed death 1) positive T cells are isolated from peripheral blood by blood cell apheresis method and transduced with lentivirus loaded with &quot;enhanced receptor&quot; and &quot;superamplification factor&quot;. The obtained ScTIL is used for one-time intravenous infusion.</description>
