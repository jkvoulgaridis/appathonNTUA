    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, ambispective, low-interventional clinical study evaluating molecular
      genetic markers for non-invasive differential diagnosis of benign and malignant pigmented
      skin and mucosal neoplasms. In retrospective cohorts genetics markers will be identified. In
      prospective cohort non-invasive adhesive system will be tested to identify malignant or
      benign lesions with prespecified sensitivity and specificity compared to other non-invasive
      techniques (i.e. dermoscopy) and using histopathological examination as a &quot;golden standard&quot;.

After biopsy cytological slides and FFPE tissue blocks will be prepared. All three types of obtained samples will be investigated separately (adhesive patches, cytologic slides and FFPE tissue blocks) for genetic markers whereas cytologic slides and FFPE tissue blocks will be processed also routinely and regular cytologic and histopathologic report will be generated.</description>
