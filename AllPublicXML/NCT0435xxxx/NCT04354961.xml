      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase II study assessing the efficacy and
      safety of Almonertinib versus Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin as first-line treatment in patients
      with EGFR mutation positive locally advanced or metastatic Pulmonary Adenosquamous Carcinoma.
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either Almonertinib (110mg, po, once daily)
      or paclitaxel (175mg/m2, iv) plus carboplatin (AUC=5, iv) in a 1:1 ratio.

                  the first dose of study drug.

               4. Medications that are predominantly CYP3A4 strong inhibitors or inducers or
                  sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic range within 7 days of
