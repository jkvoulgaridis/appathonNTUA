  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study was to evaluate clinically the effect of laser photocoagulation in
      comparison to the non-resorbable dense polytetrafluroethylene (dPTFE) membrane on the soft
      tissue healing during socket preservation with bovine bone xenograft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as randomized, controlled, clinical trial. patients who were
      undergoing tooth extraction and socket preservation were divided into two groups: Group I:980
      nm Diode laser was used to seal the socket by photocoagulation .Group II : a non-resorbable
      dPTFE was used to seal the socket and stabilized by suturing to the soft tissue margins of
      the socket

      All patients were clinically and radiographically evaluated at the baseline and on the second
      , third and fourth weeks postoperatively.Then recalled after 4 months for the final
      radiographic examination.

    <time_frame>at 2nd, 3rd and 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>clinical examination and scoring according to Landry healing index. A score of 1 to 5 was given to the surgical site indicating the improvement of the nature of the soft tissue . A score of 1 meaning the least healing and 5 being excellent healing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>soft tissue thickness in millimeters.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The thickness of the soft tissue in the center of the socket was measured at the baseline and after 4 months on the cone beam computed tomoghraph using the ruler tool to measure the thickness in millimeters.</description>

    <measure>Bone width and height measured in millimeters</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>bone dimensions were measured on the baseline cone beam computed tomograph and after 4 months also on the recall cone beam computed tomograph.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pain score on the visual analogue scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was measured on the first , forth and seventh day postoperatively. The visual analogue scale comprises a scale graded from 1 to 100 to express the pain on a a ruler the the patient uses to point out the pain score visually with 0 meaning no pain and 100 meaning maximum pain.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The need for the extraction of nonrestorable maxillary anterior tooth for untreatable
             caries, endodontic treatment failure or root fracture.

          2. Type I postextraction sockets according to the classification proposed by Elian et al.
             with all bony walls intact .

          3. Adult patients (aged 18-50 years).

          4. A good standard of oral hygiene, as determined by the registration of an O'Leary
             Plaque Index of less than or equal to 10% after phase I therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The presence of any systemic disease that could complicate bone and soft tissue
             healing of the grafted socket.

          2. The presence of any local factor that may interfere with extraction as tooth
             ankylosis.

          3. Smoking.

          4. The presence of bone dehiscence and fenestrations of the post-extractive alveolus
             (Type II and III sockets).

          5. Subjects who had undergone radiation therapy.

          6. Patients who had been subjected to or who were under bisphosphonate therapy.
