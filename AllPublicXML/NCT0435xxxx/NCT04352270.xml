  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized trial is to determine whether comprehensive,
      accessible, and animation-style videos are a more effective method of therapeutic patient
      education (TPE) based on clinical outcomes than paper handouts in Spanish and
      English-speaking communities. The clinical outcomes being measured are the severity, sleep
      affected by atopic dermatitis (AD), and the amount of itch experienced.

      Patients will be recruited, stratified, and then randomly assigned into one of two
      intervention groups.The patient participants will be children anywhere on the spectrum of
      mild to severe AD and they will be stratified into four strata: a) Those with severe AD and
      no medical intervention escalation, b) Those with mild AD and no medical intervention
      escalation, c) Those with severe AD and medical intervention escalation, and d) Those with
      mild AD and medical intervention escalation. Group 1 will be a paper handout for group 1 and
      an educational video for group 2 as a form of TPE. Subjects will be recruited in clinic after
      they are screened for AD during their regular dermatology appointment. The research team will
      provide the patient and parent with a brief introduction to the study, what it involves for
      the patient, any foreseeable risks, and the compensation. If they agree to participate, a
      consent/permission form will be given to the parent/guardian to sign. After an initial
      evaluation of the patient's AD, subjects will receive an initial survey and POEM
      questionnaire on an iPad via RedCap that will address the condition of their AD. The patient
      will be administered a form of TPE as the intervention. The intervention will first be
      viewed/read in clinic, followed by a brief set of questions from the research team to
      determine the amount of information retained on an immediate level. A follow-up appointment
      will be scheduled for the patient. Group 2 will receive a slip of paper with a link to the
      videos, so the TPE will be accessible outside the clinic.

    <measure>Change in eczema severity based on the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) is a validated 7 item instrument with response categories from 0 to 4 where No days = 0, 1-2 days = 1, 3-4 days = 2, 5-6 days = 3, Every day = 4. Scoring for the POEM ranges form 0 to 28 and is interpreted by 0 to 2 = Clear or almost clear, 3 to 7 = Mild eczema, 8 to 16 = Moderate eczema, 17 to 24 = Severe eczema, 25 to 28 = Very severe eczema.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in eczema severity based on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is an investigator-assessed instrument measuring the severity of clinical signs in atopic dermatitis (AD). The suggested severity strata for the EASI are: 0 = clear; 0·1-1·0 = almost clear; 1·1-7·0 = mild; 7·1-21·0 = moderate; 21·1-50·0 = severe; 50·1-72·0 = very severe</description>
