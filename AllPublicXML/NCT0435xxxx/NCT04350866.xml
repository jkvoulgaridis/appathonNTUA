  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic insomnia, one of the most common health problems among Veterans, significantly
      impacts health, function, and quality of life. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia
      (CBTI) is the first line treatment; however, despite efforts to train VA clinicians to
      deliver CBTI, there are still significant barriers to providing adequate access to insomnia
      care. Up to 44% of Veterans seen in Primary Care report insomnia, making it an optimal
      clinical setting for improving access to insomnia care. Furthermore, Brief Behavioral
      Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI), adapted from CBTI as a briefer, more flexible treatment, is
      easily delivered by Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) clinicians and can greatly
      improve access to care for Veterans with insomnia. Yet, simply training PCMHI clinicians to
      deliver BBTI is not enough. Implementation strategies are needed for successful uptake,
      adoption, and sustainable delivery of care.

      This stepped-wedge, hybrid III implementation-effectiveness trial involves four VA Medical
      Centers: Baltimore, Durham, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. The hybrid design allows for
      testing of implementation and treatment effectiveness. The stepped-wedge design allows for
      fewer sites to achieve adequate power as all sites are exposed to BBTI training (BBTI) and
      BBTI+Implementation Strategies (BBTI+IS). The target sample are PCMHI clinicians and the
      impact of a bundle of strategies on the success of sustainable delivery of BBTI in Primary
      Care. Retrospective data collected from VA electronic health records will be used to obtain
      variables of interest related to Veteran treatment outcomes and data related to PCMHI
      clinician delivery of BBTI.

      Aim 1 will compare the impact PCMHI clinicians trained to deliver BBTI vs. the impact of BBTI
      training plus 12-months of access to an implementation strategy bundle (BBTI+IS). BBTI+IS vs.
      BBTI training alone is expected to result in more Veterans with access to insomnia care in
      PCMHI.

      Aim 2 will identify specific strategies that promote successful implementation of BBTI in
      PCMHI through the use of qualitative interviews and surveys with clinical stakeholders at
      each study site.

    <description>Site PIs and PCMHI clinicians trained to deliver BBTI will complete a quarterly survey about strategies from the bundle being utilized (e.g., &quot;Did providers use X strategy to promote delivery of BBTI?&quot;). These surveys will assess the uptake of strategies, longitudinally, across study phases. Response choices will be yes, no, or not able to accurately assess.
Site PIs and PCMHI clinicians will also be asked to rate each strategy on its importance (i.e., how vital a strategy is to improving implementation [high/low]) and its feasibility (i.e., how possible a strategy is to implement [high/low]).</description>

During this phase, sites will receive access to and support for the bundle of implementation strategies, both from the hub site and their local champion/internal facilitator. During this phase, PCMHI clinicians trained in BBTI will receive feedback as necessary regarding their BBTI skills from their local champion/internal facilitator. During this phase, PCMHI clinicians will also complete quarterly surveys regarding implementation strategies they are using and which strategies are/are not helpful. Qualitative interviews will be conducted at the end of this phase.</description>
