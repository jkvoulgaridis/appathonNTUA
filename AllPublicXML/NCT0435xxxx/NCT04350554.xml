  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women living with HIV face multiple challenges regarding pregnancy, encompassing not only
      their intention to procreate, but also difficulties during the course of pregnancy.

      Compared to HIV-negative controls, HIV-infected women have a higher risk of pregnancy
      complications such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, or preterm labor. In addition, the
      treatment of HIV among pregnant women entails specific difficulties, such as changes in
      bioavailability of antiretroviral drugs, or the concern about the association of certain
      antiretrovirals with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

      There is very little evidence about pregnancy among women living with HIV in Spain. Very few
      studies have been published, performed in single centers or in small cohorts with a limited
      number of patients. The Cohort of the Spanish AIDS Research Network (CoRIS) offers a unique
      setting to answer questions that are unlikely to be answered by a single study.

      The aims of this study are (i) to describe the incidence of pregnancies and their temporal
      trends from 2004 to 2019, (ii) o describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of
      women who become pregnant, (iii) to assess the diagnostic delay among women diagnosed with
      HIV infection after becoming pregnant, (iv) to investigate the clinical course during
      pregnancy and its predictive factors, (v) to describe the antiretroviral treatment
      administered to pregnant women, (vi) to describe clinical outcomes after pregnancy, (vii) to
      describe the outcome of the conception in terms of interrupted pregnancies, spontaneous
      abortions, term pregnancies, type of delivery (vaginal or caesarean section) and HIV
      infection of the newborn, and (vii) to evaluate attitudes towards pregnancy (ie. planned
      pregnancy) and social support among women who become pregnant during the year 2020.

      Study population will be women from the cohort of the Spanish AIDS Research Network (CoRIS)
      who have become pregnant in the period 2004-2010.

        The Cohort of the Spanish AIDS Research Network (CoRIS) is a prospective multicentre cohort
        of HIV-positive treatment-naïve patients aged &gt;13 years, recruited from 46 centres from 13
        Autonomous Regions in the Spanish public healthcare system. Recruitment and follow-up
        started in 2004 and are still ongoing. From 2004 to the last update in November 2018,
        15,509 patients have been included in the cohort. This study will be performed using the
        update of November 2019, that will be available in June 2020.
