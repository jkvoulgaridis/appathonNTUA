  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase Ib/IIa to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral treatment with OST-122 in
      patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis over 28 days. This trial will also
      explore pharmacokinetics (PK) profile and preliminary therapeutic efficacy associated with
      OST-122 through biomarker analysis and clinical, endoscopic and histologic assessments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OST-122 is an oral, gut-restricted and subtype-selective Jak3/Tyk2/Ark5 inhibitor for the
      local treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's
      disease and, potentially, fibrotic lesions in Crohn's patients. The compound was well
      tolerated in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and has been shown to be stable during the
      GI transit, while no significant plasma levels were detected. The gut-restricted PK profile
      of OST-122 lowers the risk of systemic toxicities inherent to other JAK inhibitors. In the
      current proof of concept study, the compound's safety, PK profile and trends of efficacy will
      be investigated in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
