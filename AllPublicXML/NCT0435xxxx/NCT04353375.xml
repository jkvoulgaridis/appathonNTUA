    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm, multicenter and open-label study to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety and pharmacokinetic of HMPL-453 tartrate in patients with advanced intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around 29 patients with metastatic or local advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with
      FGFR2 fusion, who have failed at least one systemic therapy will be treated with HMPL-453
      till disease progression or death.
