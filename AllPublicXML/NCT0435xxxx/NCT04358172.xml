    <textblock>
      A randomised control trial to evaluate the effect of a mobile application on partial denture
      wearers's dental knowledge, oral hygiene and denture hygiene. The null hypothesis of the
      study states that there will be no difference in dental knowledge, oral and denture hygiene
      among patients educated using the mobile application compared to those educated using the
      conventional method of verbal instructions accompanied by demonstrations on dental models.

    <textblock>
      Partial denture wearers are at higher risk of developing caries and periodontal disease.
      Thus, providing oral and denture hygiene care instructions after denture delivery is crucial
      for prevention of oral diseases. A mobile application was developed using the progressive web
      application technology for chairside education and to serve as a reference material. The
      effect of the mobile application on patient's dental knowledge compared to the conventional
      method was evaluated using a knowledge questionnaire administered before and after education.
      The knowledge scores obtained were analysed using the Two-way mixed ANOVA test. Patients'
      oral hygiene was assessed by comparing the Silness and Loe Plaque Index and Gingival Index
      scores before and after education. Denture hygiene was evaluated by comparing the denture
      plaque score before and after education. Statistical analysis of the Plaque Index, Gingival
      Index and denture plaque score was done using Mann-Whitney U Test and Friedman Test.
