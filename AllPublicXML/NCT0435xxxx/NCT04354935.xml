    <textblock>
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation) is a a recent technique to stimulate the brain in a way that non-invasive, for
      therapeutic purposes. The first trials of analgesic use of rTMS date back to about 15 years
      ago. years and clinical use has now entered the practice of some specialized centers. Used at
      a frequency less than or equal to 1 Hertz (Hz; a stimulation per second), it is called bass
      rTMS. frequency and results in inhibition of cortical excitability at the level of the
      stimulated area. Conversely, a stimulation with a frequency higher than 5 Hz, called
      high-frequency rTMS, will have an excitatory effect on the targeted neurons. In addition to
      its local effects at the stimulation site, rTMS can also have effects on distance on regions
      other than those directly targeted. The impact of this treatment would be the local
      modulation of the cerebral plasticity and also act on the anatomical connectivity and
      functional brain function in both healthy subjects and those who are patients with
      psychiatric disorders

      Main objective :

      To show the effectiveness of rTMS carried out in open on the symptoms of depression resistant
      in common practice between the Baseline and the end of the initial treatment (between 4 and 6
      weeks).

      Secondary Objectives

      Evaluate the tolerance of the rTMS carried out in open on the symptoms of depression
      resistant in common practice between the Baseline and the end of the initial cure (between 4
      and 6 weeks)

      Evaluate the impact of this treatment on :

        -  The response rate

        -  The remission rate

        -  Quality of life

      The criteria main evaluation :

      The evolution of the HDRS-17 score (Hamilton depression scale, 17 items) between the Baseline
      and the end of the treatment. initial treatment (4 to 6 weeks)

      The evaluation criteria secondary :

        -  Responder patient rate (defined as a 50% decrease in the rate of

           % of HDRS score)

        -  Rate of patients in remission (defined by HDRS score&lt;8)
