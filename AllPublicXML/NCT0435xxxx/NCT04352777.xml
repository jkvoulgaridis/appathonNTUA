  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform an in depth analysis of changes in the tumor immune
      microenvironment in patients undergoing treatment with standard of care endocrine therapy and
      abemaciclib in the advanced setting via singe cell RNA sequencing. The investigators will
      also correlate changes in serum estrogen levels to changes in tumor and peripheral immune
      cell repertoire and function (including regulatory T cell populations, B cells,
      myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations, T cell activation and T cell exhaustion).This
      study has two cohorts with 15 patients in each cohort.

                  (IHC), irrespective of staining intensity.

               -  HER2 negative status is determined by:

               -  IHC 1+, as defined by incomplete membrane staining that is faint/barely
                  perceptible and within &gt; 10% of invasive tumor cells, or

               -  IHC 0, as defined by no staining observed or membrane staining that is incomplete
                  and is faint/barely perceptible and within ≤ 10% of the invasive tumor cells, or

               -  FISH negative based on:

               -  Single-probe average HER2 copy number &lt; 4.0 signals / cell, or

               -  Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio &lt; 2.0 with an average HER2 copy number &lt; 4.0 signals
                  /cell

          4. Patients should have plans to initiate standard of care endocrine therapy with
             non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (letrozole, anastrazole) OR fulvestrant plus
             abemaciclib in the advanced/metastatic first-line or second-line setting per treating
             oncologist discretion

          5. Patients should be willing and able to undergo fresh biopsy pretreatment and at 4
             weeks into treatment.

          6. Patients should have an accessible lesion representative of recurrent or metastatic
             breast cancer for biopsy. Patients will undergo a tissue biopsy or tissue collection
             for research purposes only. Sites for tissue acquisition include the breast,
             skin/chest wall, soft tissue, liver, bone. Research directed lung biopsies and brain
             biopsies are not permitted. Procedures for tissue acquisition are restricted to those
             performed under local anesthesia or IV conscious sedation; biopsies that require
             general anesthesia are not permitted in this situation.

          7. Patients who received chemotherapy must have recovered (Common Terminology Criteria
             for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade ≤1) from the acute effects of chemotherapy except for
             residual alopecia or Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy prior to randomization. A washout
             period of at least 21 days is required between last chemotherapy dose and
             randomization (provided the patient did not receive radiotherapy).

          8. Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the
             acute effects of radiotherapy.

          9. The patient is able to swallow oral medications.

         10. The patient has adequate organ function for all of the following criteria, as defined
             in below.

               -  ANC ≥1.5 × 10^9/L

               -  Platelets ≥100 × 10^9/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL. * Patients may receive erythrocyte transfusions to achieve
                  this hemoglobin level at the discretion of the investigator. Initial treatment
                  must not begin earlier than the day after the erythrocyte transfusion.

               -  Hepatic

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN *Patients with Gilbert's syndrome with a total
                  bilirubin ≤ 2.0 times ULN and direct bilirubin within normal limits are
                  permitted.

               -  ALT and AST ≤ 3 × ULN

                    -  Abbreviations: ALT = alanine aminotransferase; ANC = absolute neutrophil

             with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs).
             Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or similar treatment) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          4. History of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction to local anesthetics (e.g.,

          7. Patients with disease not amenable to biopsy

          8. The patient has serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in
             the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for
             example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen
             therapy, severe renal impairment [e.g. estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30ml/min],
             history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or

             resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea).

          9. Females who are pregnant or lactating.

         10. The patient has active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous [IV]
             antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable
             viral infection (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known
             active hepatitis B or C [for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive]. Screening
             is not required for enrollment.

         11. The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of
             cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but

             cardiac arrest.

         12. History of bleeding disorder that would make serial biopsies unsafe.

         13. Patients of active anticoagulation for history of venous thromboembolism,
             cardiovascular conditions.
