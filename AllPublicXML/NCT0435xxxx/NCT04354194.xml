  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment on
      pain intensity, disability level and psychosocial factors in patients with chronic
      non-specific neck pain. We hypothesed that osteopathic manipulative treatment is better than
      conventional physiotherapy in management of pain, disability and depression.

      This study will conduct between April 2020 and July 2020 at Denizli State Hospital.
      Participants who were diagnosed as chronic non-specific neck pain by a specialist physician
      will include the study. They will treated at physical therapy clinic. Inclussion criteria
      will; participants diagnosed as non-specific neck pain by the physician and Non-spesific neck
      pain at least 3 months. Exclussion criteria were; participants who have had surgery or are
      indicated for surgery, participants who have had exercise therapy and / or physical therapy
      in the last 1 year with a history of trauma to the cervical region, participants who have had
      neck pain that develop due to a particular cause such as tumor, compression fracture,
      metastasis and infection. According to power analysis, 102 participant will include the study
      with 95% coincidence interval and 80% power. Participants will be divided into 2 groups.
      Randomization method will be closed envelope. Group 1 will receive Conventional Physiotherapy
      Programme (CP), Group 2 will receive Osteopathin Manipulative Treatment (OMT). Pain Intensity
      at rest and activity, psychological state( Beck Depression Inventory) and Disability level
      (Neck Disability Index) will assess at baseline and 3 weeks.

    <description>Conventional Physiotherapy consist of Hotpacks, TENS and US.The participants were positioned in sitting and supported with a pillow under the head, 20 min hot pack was applied. Therapatic Ultrason were applied with the frequency of 1 MHz, intensity of 1,5 watt/cm² and duration of 5 minute. TENS was applied to the cervical region with 2-channel, 4 surface electrodes at 60-120 Hz, and 50-100 pulse duration for 20 minutes.</description>
