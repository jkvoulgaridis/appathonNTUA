      The purpose of this research is to test the use of Acetazolamide in preventing post-operative
      cerebrospinal fluid leak in patients having endoscopic skull base surgery (it is a surgery
      performed through the nose and sinus).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Elective transsphenoidal resection of a tumor expected to result in an intraoperative
             high flow CSF leak; such tumors include craniopharyngioma, meningioma, and Rathke
             cleft cyst.

          -  Elective transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary adenoma, with BMI &gt;25, or with
             observed low or high flow CSF leak during surgery, conferring an elevated risk of
             postoperative CSF leak.

          -  Patients who voluntarily sign Informed Consent

          -  Male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential and at risk for pregnancy
             must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during study treatment
             and for at least 1 month after stopping study treatment. Male subjects should refrain
             from donating semen during treatment and 1 month after stopping treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults unable to consent

          -  Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Prisoners

          -  Patients with prior adverse reactions to acetazolamide or who are taking aspirin
             concomitantly (which may increase the risk of adverse reactions to acetazolamide)

          -  Patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which may
             increase the risk of adverse effects of acetazolamide)

          -  Acetazolamide therapy is contraindicated in situations in which sodium and/or
             potassium blood serum levels are depressed, in cases of marked kidney and liver
             disease or dysfunction, in suprarenal gland failure, and in hyperchloremic acidosis.

          -  It is contraindicated in patients with cirrhosis because of the risk of development of
             hepatic encephalopathy

          -  Sulfonamide allergy

          -  Pregnant females, breastfeeding females, and males and females of childbearing
             potential who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of
             contraception
