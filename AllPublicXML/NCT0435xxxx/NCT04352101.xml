  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether bupropion (vs escitalopram) increases functional
      connectivity (FC) within reward-related neurocircuits and decreases motivational deficits in
      depressed patients with increased inflammation and anhedonia. Participants will be randomized
      to take bupropion extended release (XL) or escitalopram for 8 weeks.

    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to determine the mechanism of action of an
      antidepressant of known efficacy (bupropion) and to tie this mechanism of action to a
      biomarker of inflammation in support of precision medicine for the treatment of major
      depression (MD). MD is a devastating disease affecting approximately 10% of US adults and
      being the leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite availability of several classes of
      antidepressant medications, initial treatment response is low (around 30%), and approximately
      1/3 of depressed patients are non-responsive to conventional antidepressant therapies.
      Although extensive reviews of the literature suggest that available antidepressant
      medications are equally effective, recent studies suggest that there may be differential
      responsiveness to conventional antidepressants among subgroups of depressed patients. One
      subgroup of depressed patients who may exhibit differential antidepressant responsiveness are
      those with increased markers of inflammation. Data from previous studies support the notion
      that differential responsiveness to conventional antidepressants exists and may be revealed
      by pretreatment levels of inflammation as indexed by the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive
      protein (CRP).

      This study proposes to use a mechanistic clinical trial design with drugs of known efficacy
      to take the first step toward establishing whether antidepressants that target dopamine (e.g.
      bupropion) might be a better choice for depressed patients with increased inflammation and
      anhedonia than an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Accordingly, 50 depressed
      patients with a CRP&gt;2mg/L and increased anhedonia will be randomized to 8 weeks of bupropion
      or escitalopram in order to analyze data from 40 patients (accounting for drop outs). All
      depressed patients will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine
      functional connectivity in reward-related circuits at baseline and 4 and 8 weeks along with
      objective and clinical assessments of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) positive (motivational)
      valence constructs at baseline and 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks.

      The researchers hypothesize that patients who receive bupropion versus escitalopram will
      exhibit increased functional connectivity between ventral striatum and ventromedial
      prefrontal cortex in association with decreased motivational deficits and anhedonia.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Targeted FC will be calculated as the degree of correlation in activity between a 3mm3 radius sphere in VS and the vmPFC cluster identified as being reward-sensitive in neuroimaging meta-analyses and as used to define vmPFC in previous work. Z-scores will be extracted and the change in mean FC values compared to baseline will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The EEfRT task is a multi-trial game in which participants are given an opportunity to choose different task difficulty levels to obtain monetary rewards (easy tasks have low rewards while hard tasks have higher rewards). The task is 20 min, and first 50 trials are analyzed. Each trial has a high, medium, or low probability of success, and this information is given to the participant when they are deciding between easy and hard tasks. The proportion of hard-task choices across each level of probability is calculated. Lower proportions of hard task choices indicate decreased motivation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS-C) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SHAPS-C is a 14-item clinician-administered scale assessing the amount of pleasure during common daily activities that the participant has experienced in the past week. Responses are given on a scale of 1 to 4 where 1 = lots of pleasure and 4 = no pleasure. Total scores range from 14 to 56 with lower scores indicating greater enjoyment of activities.</description>

    <measure>Change in Motivation and Pleasure Scale-Self-Report (MAP-SR) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MAP-SR is an 18-item self-report inventory that has been validated in psychiatric populations and is designed to disentangle motivational and consummatory components of everyday activities over a 24-hr period. Responses are given on a 5-point scale where 0 = no pleasure or motivation and 4 = extreme pleasure or motivation. Total scores range from 0 to 72 and higher scores indicate greater motivation and pleasure during everyday activities.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Report (QIDS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The 16 item QIDS-SR is a self-reported measurement of depression severity. Responses are given on a 4-point scale where 0 = no problems and 3 = severe problems. Respondents provide answers for 14 of the 16 items (depending on their symptoms). Total scores range from 0 to 42 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms of depression.</description>
