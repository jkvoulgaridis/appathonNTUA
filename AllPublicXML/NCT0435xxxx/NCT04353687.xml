  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the progression of surgeon efficiency and
      proficiency of traditionally open or laparoscopic surgeons performing robotic-assisted
      inguinal hernia repair throughout their learning curve.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational pilot study evaluating surgeon efficiency
      and proficiency of traditionally open or laparoscopic surgeons performing robotic-assisted
      inguinal hernia repair. The study will focus on surgeon intraoperative efficiency and
      technical performance outcomes as well as conversions, intraoperative complications, and
      mental and cognitive workload. Surgeon subjects will be assessed for technical proficiency
      through a study specific technical proficiency form and the GEARS scale by independent
      surgeons.

        The intended study population will be compromised of general surgeons. All surgeons will be
        qualified general surgeons by training and experienced in performing open or laparoscopic
        inguinal hernia repair and will be transitioning to robotic-assisted inguinal hernia
        repair. All surgeons will have zero or minimal experience with robotic-assisted inguinal
        hernia repair.
