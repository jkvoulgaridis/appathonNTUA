  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the project is to perform a post marketing clinical study to confirm safety
      and clinical effectiveness of WET® gel in the treatment of nasal dryness.

      This investigation will be carried out following the CE marking of the WET® gel device and is
      mainly intended to answer questions relating to clinical safety or performance (i.e. residual
      risks) of the device when used in accordance whit its approved labelling.

      The study is also aimed at defining the optimal dose regimen of WET® gel.

    <description>At the screening/baseline visit (Visit 1, Day 1), eligible patients will be assigned to treatment with WET® gel, at the dose of 3-4 nasal applications/day (according to necessity), 1or 2 puff/nostril, for maximum 14 days.
Treatment will be administered according to patient's need without any relation with the time of the day (i.e. day time or night time administration), however within a maximum of 4 applications/day, which must include one administration in the morning upon awakening and one administration in the evening before retiring to bed.</description>
