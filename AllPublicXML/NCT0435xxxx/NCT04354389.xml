  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The study population
      is defined as subjects diagnosed with lower respiratory tract COVID-19 who require
      supplemental oxygen ≥2 LPM at the time of randomization.

      This study is a two-staged design. The objective of Stage 1 is proof of concept by 22
      subjects. Subjects with COVID-19 and clinically significant impairment of respiratory
      function will be enrolled and evaluated. If pre-determined safety and efficacy parameters are
      achieved, the study will proceed to Stage 2 and expand enrollment with an additional sixty
      (n=60) subjects or more to provide adequate power to potentially demonstrate statistically
      significant therapeutic efficacy.
