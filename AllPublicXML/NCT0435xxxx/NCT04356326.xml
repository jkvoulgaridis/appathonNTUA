      A randomized clinical trial to assess the efficiency of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) 150
      mg/day started before 15 weeks of gestation in the prevention on maternal and f≈ìtal
      complications in pregnant women with chronic hypertension.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hypertension affects 1 to 5% of women of childbearing age. According to the
      literature, about 45% of pregnant women with chronic hypertension will develop complications
      such as superimposed preeclampsia (PE), placental abruption, Intra Uterine Growth Restriction
      (IUGR), perinatal death, maternal death, or preterm delivery. To date, there is no curative
      treatment of vascular complications of chronic hypertension during pregnancy. The only
      effective treatment, once the complications are established, is usually stopping the
      pregnancy and delivering the placenta. The preventive treatment of these complications is
      therefore an important axis in the improvement of maternal and perinatal health.

      Due to the very high risk of superimposed PE in chronic hypertensive patients and despite the
      lack of objective evidence of the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of
      superimposed PE in this population, the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care
      Excellence), associated with the Royal College of Gynecology-Obstetrics, recommends since
      2010-2011 the use of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of this complication in chronic
      hypertensive pregnant women; then it was followed by the &quot;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
      (USPTF)&quot; in 2014. Recently, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) adopted
      the suggestions of the USPTF and issued the same recommendations in 2018. The French college
      of obstetric (CNGOF: National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians), however,
      does not recommend the use of low-dose aspirin in pregnant chronic hypertensive women because
      of insufficient data.

      Indeed, although the efficacy of low-dose aspirin is assumed in patients with previous PE,
      few studies have evaluated its efficacy in patients with chronic hypertension. Moreover, most
      of the controlled prospective studies using very low doses of aspirin (less than 100 mg) and
      starting after 15 weeks of gestation do not seem conclusive. For these reasons, the
      investigators propose to conduct a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
      trial to analyze the effectiveness of aspirin dosed at 150 mg and introduced before 15 weeks
      of gestation in women with chronic hypertension.

      The primary endpoint is a maternal and perinatal composite morbidity and mortality including
      superimposed PE, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery &lt; 37 weeks of gestation,
      placental abruption, perinatal death, or maternal death.
