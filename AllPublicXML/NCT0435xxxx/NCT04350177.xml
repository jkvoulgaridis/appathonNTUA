  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety and tolerability of drug IkT-148009 in healthy elderly
      volunteers (55 to 70 years old). It also looks at the movement of IkT-148009 in the body.
      This first-in-human study is designed in 2 parts. In Part A, healthy participants will take a
      single, oral dose of IkT-148009 or placebo. Part A participants will be at the study site for
      approximately 4 days. In Part B, healthy participants will take an oral dose of IkT-148009
      once a day for 7 days. Part B participants will be at the study site for approximately 9
      days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, Phase 1 study in elderly (55 to 70 years old) subjects, otherwise
      considered to be healthy with the objective of identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of IkT-148009 tablets in two different settings; a
      single dose and a multiple dose setting. Escalation to the next dose will be undertaken only
      after safety, tolerability and PK data have been reviewed by the Safety Review Committee
      (SRC) and agreement reached that it is safe to increase the dose.

      The single ascending dose cohorts will consist of up to 7 visits over a period of up to 28
      days prior to dosing and 14 days after dosing. Multiple ascending dose cohorts will consist
      of up to 12 visits over a period of 49 days including 7 days of dosing.

    <intervention_model_description>Sentinel dosing will be employed for each cohort, with one subject randomized to receive IkT-148009 and the other placebo on the first day. These two subjects in each cohort will be monitored for 48 hours after dosing before deciding to dose the remainder of the cohort. As such, the other six subjects in the first cohort will be dosed approximately 48 hours later. Each cohort will be monitored for at least 48 hours before deciding whether to sentinel pair in the next (higher dose) cohort, and each cohort will be dosed at approximately weekly intervals in order to allow adequate time for collection and review of safety and PK data.</intervention_model_description>

TSH levels will also be monitored. CBC assessments will include hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, reticulocyte count, white blood cells (WBC) count with differential, platelet count and PT-INR. PT-INR should be reported in both prothrombin time and international normalized ratio. Men and women will undergo additional laboratory tests for reproductive organ function to include leutenizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone and inhibin B.</description>
