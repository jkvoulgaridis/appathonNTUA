  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychotherapy interventions can roughly be grouped into compensation-oriented strategies
      (compensating for and and modifying personal deficits of patients) versus
      capitalization-oriented strategies (building on patients' personal strengths). Improvement of
      emotion regulation (compensation-oriented) as well as the activation of resilience
      (capitalisation-oriented) have been identified as important transdiagnostic factors in the
      treatment of mental disorders. The study aims to compare compensation vs. capitalization
      strategies by using two online programs, centered either on emotion-regulation (&quot;REMOTION&quot;)
      or on activating resilience (&quot;Res-Up!&quot;). Res-Up! and REMOTION are administered as stand-alone
      intervention or as add-on treatment to standard psychotherapy.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to three study conditions (Res-Up!, REMOTION, waiting
      control group). Outcomes are assessed at baseline, after six weeks and after twelve weeks.

    <description>Res-Up! is an internet-based intervention focusing on patients' strengths and positive experiences that have effects on distress, protective factors and quality of life.

A variety of elements based on different psychotherapy approaches (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Emotion Focused Therapy, Positive Therapy etc.) are integrated in the program. Participants should work through one module per week. The intervention is conducted as I-CBT via the platform Minddistrict.Res-Up! is administered as a standalone or an add-on treatment to psychotherapy.</description>
