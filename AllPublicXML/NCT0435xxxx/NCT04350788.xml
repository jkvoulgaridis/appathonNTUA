  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the feasibility of the enhanced survivorship
      care plans (ESCPs, regular SCPs with the a web-based couple-focused symptom self-management
      project (PERC) or National Cancer Institute prostate cancer web links) and to conduct an
      initial benefit assessment of enhanced survivorship care plans among prostate cancer patients
      transitioning from active treatment to post-treatment self-management, and their partners.

      Participation of this study lasts for about for 16 weeks. Depending on participants' need for
      information, it takes 10-30 minutes of their time each week to review the information about
      prostate cancer.

      Eligible and consented patients with newly treated localized prostate cancer and your partner
      (couples) are randomly assigned to the regular survivorship care plan (SCPs) with the NCI
      website or the enhanced survivorship care plans (SCP plus the web-based prostate cancer
      education program, PERC) groups. They complete baseline (T1, prior to randomization) and
      4-month post-T1 follow-up measures (T2).

  <detailed_description>

      Methods: A two-group randomized controlled pretest-posttest design will be used and collect
      data at baseline (T1) and 4 months later (T2) among 50 patients completing initial treatment
      for localized prostate cancer and their partners. First, the investigators will assess the
      feasibility of ESCP by recruitment, enrollment, and retention rates, program satisfaction
      with the ESCP, and perceived ease of use of the ESCP. To achieve the secondary aim, the ESCP
      users will be compared with the standardized SCP users and assess their primary outcomes of
      QOL (overall, physical, emotional, and social QOL), secondary outcomes (reduction in negative
      appraisals and improvement in self-efficacy, social support, and health behaviors to manage
      symptoms), and number of visits to post-treatment care services at T1 and T2. The primary and
      secondary outcomes are assessed using measurements with sound psychometrical properties. The
      investigators will use a qualitative and quantitative mixed methods approach to achieve the
      research aims.

      Conclusions: The results from this study will help design a definitive randomized trial to
      test the efficacy of the ESCPs, a potentially scalable program, to enhance supportive care
      for prostate cancer patients and their families.

    <time_frame>Baseline upon enrollment, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change in QOL determined using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General Scale (FACT-G) v.4, a 27-item measure yielding total score and scores for physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being of demonstrated reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change. FACT-G consists of 4 subscales: physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and social well-being (SWB). Scores on the four subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 108 with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Change from baseline is the post-Baseline values minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <description>The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. EPIC will be used to measure change in appraisal of symptoms scores among patients from Baseline (T1) to T2 (4 months post T1). EPIC contains 26 items within 5 domains: Urinary Incontinence, Urinary Irritative/Obstructive, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better appraisal of symptoms. Change from baseline is the post-Baseline values minus the Baseline value.</description>
