  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether neuroproprioceptive &quot;facilitation, inhibition&quot; physical
      therapy induces plastic and adaptive processes of the CNS (white matter integrity changes),
      if they relate to clinical improvement, and whether therapeutic effect differs between
      different kinds of therapies.

    <textblock>
      In the Multi-Arm Parallel-Group Exploratory Trial, patients with multiple sclerosis were
      divided into three groups by an independent study coordinator, and underwent three kinds of
      neuroproprioceptive &quot;facilitation, inhibition&quot; physical therapy. At baseline and after the
      end of the two months' therapeutic program, a blinded assessor evaluated clinical outcomes
      and data from DTI .

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Magnetic resonance imaging on a 3T magnetic resonance scanner (Siemens Trio Tim, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel phased-array head coil. A diffusion tensor was fitted to each voxel of the brain, and a fractional anisotropy (FA) map was created for each subject. The images were further analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).
Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a scalar value between zero and one that describes the degree of anisotropy of a diffusion process. A value of zero means that diffusion is isotropic, i.e. it is unrestricted (or equally restricted) in all directions. A value of one means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. FA is a measure often used in diffusion imaging where it is thought to reflect fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination in white matter. The FA is an extension of the concept of eccentricity of conic sections in 3 dimensions, normalized to the unit range.</description>

    <measure>the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, MSWS - 12</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale is a self-assessment scale which measures the impact of MS on walking. It consists of 12 questions concerning the limitations to walking due to MS during the past 2 weeks. Each item can be answered with 5 options, with 1 meaning no limitation and 5 extreme limitation.
A total score can be generated and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale by subtracting the minimum score possible (12) from the patient's score, dividing by the maximum score possible minus the minimum possible (60-12 or 48), and multiplying the result by 100. Walking improvement on the MSWS-12 is indicated by negative change scores.</description>

    <measure>the 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, MSIS -29</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>a 29-item self-report measure with 20 items associated with a physical scale and 9 items with a psychological scale. Items ask about the impact of MS on day-to-day life in the past two weeks. All items have 5 response options: 1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5&quot;extremely&quot;. Each of the two scales are scored by summing the responses across items, then converting to a 0-100 scale where 100 indicates greater impact of disease on daily function (worse health).</description>

    <description>MPAT is method developed and verified by our team. In this therapy, patients are corrected into a postural position where the joints are functionally centered. Somatosensory (manual and verbal) stimuli are then applied to activate motor programs in the brain, which then lead to the co-contraction of the patient's whole body when laying, sitting, standing up or moving forward. Activated programs are repeated under various conditions and in different situations and environments to teach the patients to automatically use the acquired motor skills in daily life. Therapy was realized within the ambulatory area of the Department of Neurology at Kralovske Vinohrady University Hospital in Prague.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Vojta's reflex locomotion</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>VRL is a standard approach for patients with MS in the Czech Republic. In the therapy, global patterns of the reflex locomotion are activated by stimulation of specific zones, with the individual placed in a precisely determined initial position (supine, prone and side laying, low kneeling position). These movement patterns have the qualities of the forward movement (locomotion) and the movement responses are precisely defined. Reflex locomotion (reflex turning and reflex creeping) is used in therapy to activate involuntarily responses of muscle function, which are necessary for spontaneous movements. Therapy was realized at the Department of Rehabilitation and Sport Medicine at Motol University Hospital.</description>

The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability (minimum 0 - the worse, maximum 10 - the best). Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist.</description>

        <title>White Matter Integrity</title>
        <description>Magnetic resonance imaging on a 3T magnetic resonance scanner (Siemens Trio Tim, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel phased-array head coil. A diffusion tensor was fitted to each voxel of the brain, and a fractional anisotropy (FA) map was created for each subject. The images were further analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).
Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a scalar value between zero and one that describes the degree of anisotropy of a diffusion process. A value of zero means that diffusion is isotropic, i.e. it is unrestricted (or equally restricted) in all directions. A value of one means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. FA is a measure often used in diffusion imaging where it is thought to reflect fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination in white matter. The FA is an extension of the concept of eccentricity of conic sections in 3 dimensions, normalized to the unit range.</description>

        <title>the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, MSWS - 12</title>
        <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale is a self-assessment scale which measures the impact of MS on walking. It consists of 12 questions concerning the limitations to walking due to MS during the past 2 weeks. Each item can be answered with 5 options, with 1 meaning no limitation and 5 extreme limitation.
A total score can be generated and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale by subtracting the minimum score possible (12) from the patient's score, dividing by the maximum score possible minus the minimum possible (60-12 or 48), and multiplying the result by 100. Walking improvement on the MSWS-12 is indicated by negative change scores.</description>

            <description>MPAT is method developed and verified by our team. In this therapy, patients are corrected into a postural position where the joints are functionally centered. Somatosensory (manual and verbal) stimuli are then applied to activate motor programs in the brain, which then lead to the co-contraction of the patient's whole body when laying, sitting, standing up or moving forward.
16 face-to-face sessions (1 hour, twice a week for two months). Group 3 used the whole time Functional electric stimulation during activities of daily living and underwent 2 individual sessions.</description>

Patients received the device to use as much as they felt they were able to during their normal daily living activities thereafter.

        <description>a 29-item self-report measure with 20 items associated with a physical scale and 9 items with a psychological scale. Items ask about the impact of MS on day-to-day life in the past two weeks. All items have 5 response options: 1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5&quot;extremely&quot;. Each of the two scales are scored by summing the responses across items, then converting to a 0-100 scale where 100 indicates greater impact of disease on daily function (worse health).</description>
