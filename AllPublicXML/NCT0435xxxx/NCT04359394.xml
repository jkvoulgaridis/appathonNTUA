  <brief_summary>

      This registry is a prospective observational study in order to describe primarily the natural
      course of PP subtypes and to gain detailed information about their phenotype.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is to describe the natural course of disease in different subtypes of PP. The
      network builds on a static registry that was based on a one-time clinical characterization of
      PP patients in Europe (ERASPEN). The International Rare and Severe Psoriasis Expert Network
      (IRASPEN) already has multiple clinicians involved who have successfully characterized and
      included their patients in ERASPEN. IRASPEN addresses the question of temporal evolution of
      clinical features and is actually a non-interventional prospective registry that aims to
      describe the clinical course and responses to already established treatments of a large
      number of PP patients over a period of 5 years. The data collection with this registry will
      give insight on the natural course of PP disease revealing the burden of disease including
      frequency and severity of flares and the role of therapeutic interventions.

    <description>modified PGA (physician's assessment of psoriatic lesions) scoring the erythema, pustules, and scaling of all GPP or PPP lesions from 0 to 4. Each component is graded separately, the average is calculated, and the final PGA is determined from this composite score. A lower score indicates a lesser severity, with 0 being clear and 1 being almost clear.</description>

    <description>Measure of severity and area of psoriatic lesions in patients with psoriasis. It is a tool that provides a numeric scoring for a patient's overall GPP disease state,ranging from 0 to 72. It is a linear combination of percent of surface area of skin that is affected by erythema, pustules and scaling and the severity of erythema, pustules, and scaling (desquamation) over 4 body regions.</description>

    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) consists of 10 questions concerning patient's perception of the impact of skin diseases on different aspects of their health related QoL over the last week. The DLQI evaluates the impact of the patient's skin disease on daily activities, leisure, work and personal relationships. Each question is scored on a 4-point Likert scale.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol is a generic questionnaire. It is a preference based health status and multi attribute utility scale that produces a single index score for each state of health. These score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is equivalent to full health and 0 equivalent to death</description>

    <description>The psoriasis symptom scale (PSS) is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to assess how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives to be. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. Moreover, the questions are of a general nature and hence are relatively free of content specific to any sub-population group. The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month.</description>

    <description>The disease VAS is a unidimensional measure of disease intensity. The VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line, 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. To avoid clustering of scores around a preferred numeric value, numbers or verbal descriptors at intermediate points are not given. The disease intensity VAS is self‐completed by the respondent. The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their current disease intensity.</description>

    <description>The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations.
