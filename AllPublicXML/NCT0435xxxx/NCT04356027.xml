    <measure>Sensitivity and specificity of Virtual Flow Reserve (VFR) against Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity and specificity of the VFR compared with FFR; Index ≤ 0.80 is scored &quot;positive&quot; while Index &gt; 0.8 is &quot;negative&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall diagnostic accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Overall diagnostic accuracy is defined as the proportion of correctly classified lesions among all lesions
Overall Diagnostic Accuracy= (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN), where TP denotes the number of True Positives, FN denotes the number of False Negatives, TN denotes the number of True Negatives, and FN denotes the number of False Negatives.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive predictive value (PPV)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>PPV is defined as the proportion of lesions with the disease and with a positive test result among the group of lesions with a positive test result.
PPV= TP/(TP+FP), where TP denotes the number of True Positives and FP denotes the number of False Positives.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative predictive value (NPV)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>NPV is defined as the proportion of lesions without the disease and with a negative test result among the group of lesions with negative test results.
NPV= TN/(TN+FN), where TN denotes the number of True Negatives and FN denotes the number of False Negatives.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between VFR and FFR</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation between VFR and FFR will be estimated as the R^2 correlation coefficient from the simple linear regression model using VFR value as the independent variable and FFR as the dependent variable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area under curve (AUC) against FFR</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>AUC will be estimated as the area under the ROC curve. To construct a ROC curve, we plot 1-specificity on the x-axis and sensitivity on the y-axis. Sensitivity and specificity are calculated at various values of VFR and FFR, and the AUC curve will be drawn using logistic regression.</description>
