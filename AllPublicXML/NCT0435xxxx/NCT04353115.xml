  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the early 2000s, vestibular rehabilitation has been proposed as a therapeutic tool to
      improve the balancing function and the various motor skills in children, in particular in
      children with hearing loss suffering from concomitant vestibular deficit. It has been
      demonstrated in adults with vestibular deficit that the fact of adding to the classic
      exercises on the control of balance per se and habituation, specific exercises of adaptation
      and substitution of the vestibulo-ocular reflex brought therapeutic benefit. These exercises,
      which are started in the presence of the physiotherapist and then continued by the patient
      himself at his home, aim to improve the stabilization of the gaze during head movements. In
      pediatrics, however, performing them is more difficult than conventional exercises, since
      their immediate interest is not well understood by the child, who may be reluctant to perform
      them. The present project aims to enrich the therapeutic offer by a pediatric rehabilitation
      method of eye stabilization sufficiently playful to win adherence to treatment, including in
      the absence of the physiotherapist when the child is at home.

    <measure>Numbers of patients able to use the serious game without side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>the purpose is to defined the proportion of patients able to use the serious game without side effects for 20 minutes a day, 2 days a week for 5 weeks in the presence of a doctor or physiotherapist at the hospital in addition to the usual rehabilitation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>side effects after the 5 weeks of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The side effects collected after the 5 weeks of intervention or at the end of the intervention if it is interrupted before the end are:
Intolerance to the screen sickness technique, motion sickness type (dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, eyestrain, visual disturbances, inability to stand after a session) By means of an adapted questionnaire SSQ (Child Simulator Sickness Questionnaire), adapted and translated into French.
Values from 0 to 70 : 70 means that childs feel sick</description>

    <description>Description: will be defined using a Likert scale of faces after each session (5 questions, from 1 to 5 points). 1 being not at all satisfied with the game and 5 being completely satisfied with the game after each session. Suggestions for modifying the game will also be collected</description>
