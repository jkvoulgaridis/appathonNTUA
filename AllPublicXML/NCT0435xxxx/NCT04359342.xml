  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of an 8-week high-intensity interval
      training (HIIT) or HIIT plus resistance training program combined with post-exercise protein
      supplementation on cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiometabolic risk indices in previously
      untrained individuals.

    <measure>Inflammation status</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be assessed by using the standardized and validated EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire, consisting of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems.
The patient ticks the box next to the most appropriate statement in each dimension (scale: 1-5; lower value = better outcome). The digits for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale (0-100, higher value = better outcome).</description>
