  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blackground:

      Currently research on alternative forms of cognitive training in patients diagnosed with ADHD
      is gaining interest. Especially, the use of Virtual Reality video games. Our team has
      developed an innovative video game based on Virtual Reality, &quot;The Secret Trail of Moon (TSTM)
      as a cognitive tool to train 5 main areas of deficit in patients with ADHD. It is superiority
      study comparing TSTM with therapeutic chess and control group.

      Methods:

      This study is prospective, unicentric, randomized with a control group. 105 patients
      diagnosed with ADHD and pharmacologically stable, aged between 12 and 22 years. These
      patients will be randomized intro three groups: TSTM group (The Secret Trail of Moon); TC
      group (Therapeutic Chess) and CG (Control Group). Objective and subjective measures of the
      patient, parents and teachers will be included. Patients´visit will be different for each
      group. The TSTM group will have 15 face-to face visits: pre-inclusion visit, inclusion visit,
      12 training visits and final visit. CT and GC group patients will have 3 face-to- face visits
      (pre-inclusion, initial visit and final visit) and 12 email or phone communications during
      training.

      Discussion: This study aims to demonstrate the added efficacy of cognitive training to drug
      treatment. It is a study that tries to demonstrate the superiority of cognitive training with
      TSTM compared to a traditional cognitive training (TC) and a control group.

      TSTM is presented as a new and powerful cognitive tool thanks to four factors that make it
      unique: the feeling of immersion in the scenarios, the variety of mechanics, the
      personalization and the playful aspect.

    <measure>Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-5 (ADHD-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is made up of the 18 symptoms. The symptoms are divided into 9 for inattention, 6 for hyperactivity and 3 for impulsivity. Parents and teachers must answer yes/no to each of them. For its diagnosis, 6 or more of the attention deficit symptoms and/or 6 more of hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms must be fulfilled. Depending on the symptoms met, the inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive or combined profile is specified.</description>

    <description>The SNAPIV is a scale for the assessment of ADHD symptoms. It consists of 18 scalar items from 0 to 3, of which 9 assess attention deficit and another 9 assess hyperactive-impulsive component. The cut-off points for attention deficit are 2.56 for teachers and 1.78 for parents. For hyperactivity-impulsivity they are 1.78 for teachers and 1.44 for parents. For both components, the points are 2 for teacher and 1.67 for parents.</description>

    <measure>The Conners Comprehensive Behaviour Rating Scale (CBRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Conners scales are a set of scales for the assessment of patients with ADHD. This revised and abbreviated version of the Conners scale is designed to be answered by parents of children ages 6-18. It consists of 10 items with a Likert type response: 0= not true at all/never; 1= just a little true/occasionally; 2= Pretty much true/often; 3=very much true/very often.
The cut-off points are divided by gender. For children, a score above 16 is suspected ADHD. While for girls, a suspected diagnosis of ADHD is from 12 points</description>

The third and last part, with 48 items, evaluated the population from 6 to 18 years old. All the items are of the likert type, and the parents can give scores of: 1= never or almost neves; 2= Rarely; 3= Sometimes; 4= Many times; 5= Always or almost always.</description>

    <description>The Conners CPT-3 is a computerized, standardized, and validated application test for different age and gender groups. The test consists of pressing a button each time a letter (target) appears on the screen, except for the letter X (non-target), which should not be pressed. The duration is approximately 14 minutes and the presentation interval between letters is variable (1, 2 and 4 seconds). The test provides results on hits, error of omission (undetected target) and errors of commission (reacted non-target), which are considered a measure of impulsivity. In addition, CPT3-3 provides information on mean reaction time and reaction time variability of hits.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The training in Therapeutic chess consists of four sections:
Video tutorial: Weekly videos have been recorded in which a chess board and the image of the psychologist explaining the lesson appear. Each week a chess concept will be explained.
Traditional chess exercises Therapeutic chess exercises: The exercises use the elements of chess but it is not necessary to know how to play chess to perform them. The purpose of the exercise is to work on a specific cognitive area each week.
Playing online games: The patient must play a minimum of 2 online games on the chess platform chess24.es . The psychologist will follow the progress of each patient.
At the end of the week, the patient should send an email to the psychologist with the completed exercises and then they will receive a personalised email. This group carries out all the treatment online from their home.</description>
