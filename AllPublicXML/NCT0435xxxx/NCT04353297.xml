    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability. Cost-effective post-stroke rehabilitation
      programs are critically needed. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems which enable the
      modulation of EEG sensorimotor rhythms are promising tools to promote early improvements of
      motor rehabilitation outcomes after stroke. This project intends to boost this BCI
      application beyond the state of art by providing: i) evidence for a short/long-term efficacy
      in enhancing post-stroke functional hand motor recovery; and ii) quantifiable indices (beyond
      clinical scales) sensitive to stroke participant's response to a Promotoer (BCI system
      compatible with clinical setting) -based intervention. To these aims, a longitudinal
      randomized controlled trial will be performed in which, subacute stroke participants will
      undergo a Promotoer- assisted hand motor imagery training.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major public health and social care concern worldwide, being the leading cause of
      long-term disability in adults. The upper limb motor impairment commonly persists after
      stroke affecting patients' everyday life functional independence. Despite the intensive
      rehabilitation, the variability in the nature and the extent of upper limb recovery remains a
      crucial factor effecting rehabilitation outcomes. Electroencephalography (EEG) -based Brain
      Computer Interface (BCI) technology is a potential tool to promote functional motor recovery
      of upper limbs after stroke as shown in several randomized controlled trials. The
      investigators' multidisciplinary team was successful in designing, implementing and
      clinically validating a sensorimotor rhythm-based BCI combined with realistic visual feedback
      of upper limb to support hand motor imagery (MI) practice in stroke participants. However,
      important questions remain to be addressed to translate BCI in clinical practice such as
      defining whether the expected BCI-induced early improvements in functional motor outcomes can
      be sustained in a long-term after stroke. This requires advancements in the knowledge on
      brain functional re-organization after stroke and how this re-organization would correlate
      with the functional motor outcome (evidence-base medicine). Last but not least, the
      definition of the determinants of the patient response to-treatment is paramount to optimize
      the process of personalized medicine in rehabilitation. The fundamental of this project stems
      from the investigators' previous findings on the efficacy of BCI-assisted MI training in
      subacute stroke participants. These promising findings corroborated the idea that a
      relatively low-cost technique (i.e. EEG-based BCI) can be exploited to deliver a
      rehabilitative intervention (in this case MI) and prompted the research team to undertake a
      further translational effort by implementing an all-in-one BCI-supported MI training station-
      the Promotoer. In this project, the investigators will provide evidence for a persistency (up
      to 6 months) of the significant early improvement of hand motor function induced by the
      BCI-assisted MI training operated via the Promotoer. Task-specific training was recently
      reported to induce long-term improvements (6 months follow-up) in arm motor function after
      stroke. Thus, the hypothesis is that the BCI-based rewarding of hand MI tasks would promote
      long-lasting retention of early induced positive effect on motor performance with respect to
      MI task practiced in an open loop condition (i.e., without BCI). Further hypothesis is that
      such clinical improvement would be sustained by a long-lasting neuroplasticity changes that
      would be harnessed by the BCI -based intervention. This hypothesis rises from current
      evidence for an early enhancement of post-stroke plastic changes enabled by BCI- based
      trainings. To test this hypothesis, a longitudinal assessment of the brain network
      organization derived from advanced EEG signal processing will be performed. The heterogeneity
      of stroke makes prediction of treatment responder a great challenge. The investigators
      hypothesize that the longitudinal functional and neurophysiology assessment over 6 months
      from the intervention will allow for insights in biomarkers and potential predictors of
      stroke participants' response to the Promotoer training. Some of the well-recognized factors
      contributing to functional motor recovery after stroke such as the relation between lesion
      characteristics and patterns of post-stroke motor cortical re-organization (e.g.,
      ipsilesional/contralesional primary and non-primary motor areas; cortico-spinal tract
      integrity, severity of motor deficits at baseline) will be taken into account.

    <description>The Promotoer is an all-in-one BCI-supported motor imagery (MI) training station, equipped with a computer, a commercial wireless Electroencephalography (EEG)/ Electromyography (EMG) system, a screen for therapist feedback (EEG and EMG activity monitoring) and screen for the real-time ecological feedback to patient - a custom software program that provides a for (personalized) visual representation of the patient's own hands. As such, this software allows the therapists to create an artificial reproduction of a given patient's hand/forearm by adjusting a digitally created image in shape, size, skin colour and orientation to match as much as possible the real patient hand/forearm. Training consists of the MI tasks only of the affected hand, grasping or finger extension in separate runs. The trial length will include a constant baseline period of 4 sec and a task period of maximally 10 sec for BCI intervention group. Each training session will consist of 4 runs (20 trials each).</description>
