      This study compares the efficacy of root coverage achieved by the Pinhole Surgical Technique
      (PST) technique and the Connective Tissue Graft (CTG) technique in the treatment of Miller
      class I and II gingival recession defects. All patients will receive PST in one quadrant and
      CTG in another quadrant.

      The hypothesis being tested is: Pinhole Surgical Technique outcomes are not inferior to those
      of the Connective Tissue Graft surgical technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recession is defined as the apical migration of the marginal gingiva and it leads to
      root surface exposure. It may be localized to a few sites or generalized to several teeth,
      and the severity may vary within the same person and between different people.

      A variety of surgical techniques have been recommended to attain root coverage, including
      connective tissue graft, free gingival graft (FGG), pedicle flaps, double papilla grafts,
      coronally positioned flaps, coronal positioning of previously placed FGG, guided tissue
      regeneration (GTR), and the use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM), or enamel matrix
      derivatives. A recently developed technique used to attain root coverage is the Pinhole
      Surgical Technique (PST) described by Chao. This novel approach involves the separation of
      the gingiva and periosteum from the underlying bone with instruments inserted through a
      pinhole created in the vestibular area of the involved tooth while filling underneath the
      undermined interproximal papilla with strips of a bioresorbable membrane, rather than
      transferring gingival tissue from the palate to the area of recession. The advantage of this
      technique is the preservation of the gingival tissues and its blood supply, while freeing the
      flap from its apical attachment for ease of coronal displacement and adequate root coverage.
      In addition, the lack of a secondary surgical site may eliminate the accompanying pain and
      discomfort often reported in root coverage procedures.

      The connective tissue graft technique was described by Langer and Langer in 1985, in which
      the patient's own connective tissue is taken mostly from the palate and used to cover the
      area of recession. The retro-molar pad area (tuberosity) has also been used because of the
      thickening of the sub-mucosa in that area. This graft material is carefully sutured into
      place and a coronally advanced flap placed and sutured over it, while part of the graft can
      be left exposed. Currently the connective tissue graft (CTG) is the most common and
      predictable treatment for gingival recession, and is considered the gold standard. Key
      advantages of the connective tissue graft procedure are the availability of two sources of
      blood supply to the graft: one from the recipient bed, and the other from the overlying flap,
      the perfect chromatic integration, an optimal esthetic outcome, and excellent color match. In
      addition, an increase in the thickness of the gingival tissues and the width of keratinized
      gingiva has been documented with the ability for creeping attachment which is not possible
      with the use of bioresorbable collagen membranes.

    <description>For the sites receiving the control technique (Connective Tissue Graft), the technique described by Langer B. and Langer L. will be started with a sulcular incision followed by a partial thickness flap. A CTG is then harvested according to the technique described by Bruno, the first incision is perpendicular to the 2nd premolar and 1st molar and is 2-3mm apical to their gingival margin as wide as the recipient site, followed by a second incision parallel to the for mentioned teeth, 1-2mm apical to the first incision, then the CTG is raised by periosteal elevator and released from apical and lateral attachments by sharp incision when needed. The graft is then prepared to have a homogenous thickness of 1.5-2mm. The donor CTG is stabilized to the underlying connective tissue interproximally using 4-0 Vicryl sutures. The recipient flap is repositioned coronally, to cover as much as possible of the graft with no tension, 2mm coronal to the CEJ, then sutured with 4-0 Vicryl sutures.</description>

    <description>For the sites receiving the test technique (Chao Pinhole Surgical Technique) the surgery starts with a small pinhole opening in the alveolar mucosa apical to the mucogingival junction of the affected tooth, the flap is then undermined using special instruments to create a full thickness pouch, followed by extending the pouch horizontally and coronally to undermined the adjacent papilla without incising it and free the flap for its coronal displacement. Then multiple 2x12mm strips of collagen resorbable membrane material (Bio-Gide, Geistlich Pharma AG) are packed under the papilla to secure the flap in a coronal direction. Gentle pressure is applied for 5 minutes to minimize the thickness of the blood clot after each of the procedures. The patients are advised to brush all teeth and sites except the buccal surfaces of the operated-on teeth, which are to be cleaned with 0.12% Chlorhexidine mouth rinse.</description>
