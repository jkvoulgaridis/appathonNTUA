  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the change of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio
      (NLR) after 6-week treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with or without
      immunomodulatory drugs and recognize the effect of post-treatment NLR and overall survival in
      advanced lung cancer patients by retrospective review.

      In recent years, the therapeutic strategies for lung cancer have been enriched with small
      molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy. In this retrospective study, we will observe
      the change in NLR and explore its possible association with survival among advanced lung
      cancer patients receiving Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with and without such
      immuno-modulator, Astragalus Polysaccharide Injection. It can be used to understand the
      relationship between NLR values and the survival rate of lung cancer patients after ICIs
      treatment. Physicians can refer to this result to give patients the suitable treatment
      recommendations.
