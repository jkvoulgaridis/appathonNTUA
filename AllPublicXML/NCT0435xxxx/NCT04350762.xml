  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many elderly experience weight loss and weakness with normal aging. Although there is
      extensive literature regarding nutritional advice for the elderly, there are few well-
      designed studies evaluating the effect of oral nutrition supplements in patients with weight
      loss and aging. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of dietary prescription with
      or without nutrition supplementation that includes soy protein, whey protein and fish oil in
      elderly patients who have suffered unintentional weight loss.

      This is an 8-week, randomized, pilot study with elderly subjects (age 65 and older) with
      recent unintentional weight loss who will receive either two servings of supplement powder
      and fish oil or no dietary supplementation (N=10 for each group).
