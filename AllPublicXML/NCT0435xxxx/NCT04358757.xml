  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy results in an altered immune state compared to the nonpregnant population. A
      significant proportion of women undergoing cesarean delivery recover poorly. The first step
      to determining whether this is an immune driven / associated process is to characterise what
      effects this surgery has on maternal immune function. &quot;Normal&quot; changes will be evaluated in
      maternal immune function and activity precipitated by surgery and delivery of the neonate.
      Immune response to surgery will be compared to historical immune data from patients
      undergoing non-obstetric surgery (orthopaedic patients).

  <detailed_description>

      Variations will be evaluated in baseline and postpartum leukocyte subset distribution and
      singling pathways within leukocyte subsets (including response to surgery) in women
      undergoing elective cesarean delivery compare to patients undergoing nonobstetric surgery
      (orthopaedic data from a completed study). This will help to determine whether baseline
      immune function and response to trauma (surgery) is the same in the pregnant and non-pregnant
      states. Women will also be evaluated for clinical recovery parameters using validated scoring
      measures and objective measurement of physical activity through use of a smartwatch
      (actigraph) around the peripartum period. This information is of significant importance as it
      brings us one step closer to identifying immune mechanisms that may be involved in or
      associated with poorer postpartum recovery.

      Aim- to determine whether perioperative immune function can predict women who are likely to
      have delayed physical recovery or recover poorly as demonstrated by lower scores on
      subjective clinical questionnaires and collected via watch actigraphy. This will help to
      determine whether a pre-existing deficient immune state is responsible for a worse recovery
      profile, which could be identified preoperatively. Similarly whether an impairment in
      response to surgery is demonstrable, which predisposes women to worse recovery profiles will
      be evaluated.

      Ultimately, earlier identification of at-risk parturients (for example, through a
      preoperative bedside test) may lead to earlier interventions / patient centred care, in an
      attempt to improve their recovery trajectory and patient experience.
