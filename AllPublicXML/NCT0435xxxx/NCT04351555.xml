    <measure>Major Pathological Response (MPR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization to an average of 12 weeks after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as ≤10% residual cancer cells in the surgical specimen, as assessed per central pathology laboratory post-surgery</description>
  </primary_outcome>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Event-free survival (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 21 months after the last patient is randomized</time_frame>
    <description>An event is defined as documented disease progression that precludes surgery or requires non-protocol therapy; recurrence or a new lesion, local or distant (a new primary malignancy confirmed by pathology is not considered to be an EFS event.); death due to any cause</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease free survival (DFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization up to approximately 15 months after date of resection</time_frame>
    <description>DFS is defined as the time from the date of surgery until the first date of disease recurrence (local or distant) or date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
If there is residual disease after surgery (eg. positive margins), the DFS event is the date of surgery.</description>

    <description>The cure rate is defined as the percentage of people in this study who are still alive and disease free for a certain period of time after they finished the surgery. Here five-year landmark cure rate will be calculated in the same time as OS analysis.</description>
