  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is among the most common of all chronic liver diseases. HCV
      predominantly affects liver cells and causes the liver to become inflamed and damaged. This
      can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer leaving trial participants
      with need for liver transplant. The purpose of this study is to see how effective
      Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) is in a real world setting of participants with chronic
      HCV genotypes 1 to 6 and liver cirrhosis who have never received any treatment for HCV.

      GLE/PIB is a drug developed for the treatment of HCV infection. This is a prospective
      (future), observational study in treatment-naive (those who have not received treatment)
      participants with HCV genotypes 1 to 6 and compensated cirrhosis. All study participants will
      receive GLE/PIB as prescribed by their study doctor in accordance with approved local label.
      Pediatric (12 years and older) and adult participants with a diagnosis of HCV genotypes 1 to
      6 and compensated cirrhosis will be enrolled in the study in Russian Federation.

      Participants will receive GLE/PIB tablets to be taken by mouth daily according to their
      physicians' prescription. The total duration of the study is 20 weeks, with a treatment
      period of 8 weeks and a follow up period of 12 weeks.

      There is expected to be no additional burden for participants in this trial. All study visits
      will occur during routine clinical practice and participants will be followed for 12 weeks.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study drug. A Serious Adverse Event ( SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.</description>
