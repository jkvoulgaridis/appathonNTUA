      The objective of the study was to compare the level of serum FT4 and TSH in patients with
      mild melasma and moderate-severe melasma. The determination of melasma lesion could also be
      known by using Janus II facial analysis UV light and polarization light to analyze the
      pattern of hyperpigmentation on melasma. This was a descriptive-analytic study used a
      cross-sectional method that was performed in 2019 at two different dermatology and venerology
      clinics in Indonesia, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital Jakarta and Gatot Subroto Army Hospital
      Jakarta. Forty-eight subjects with melasma, 50% diagnosed with mild melasma and 50% with
      moderate-severe melasma according to the modified melasma area and severity index (mMASI)
      score. The level of serum FT4 and TSH were then measured in both groups of the patients.

      Melasma has been suspected to be linked with thyroid hormone. There is no study that explains
      the association of thyroid hormone level with melasma severity.

      This study aims to find the difference in the levels of thyroid hormone in varying severity
      of melasma.

      This was a descriptive-analytic study used a cross-sectional method that was performed in
      2019 at two different dermatology and venerology clinics in Indonesia, Cipto Mangunkusumo
      Hospital Jakarta and Gatot Subroto Army Hospital Jakarta.

      Forty eight patients participated in this study, 50% diagnosed with mild melasma and 50% with
      moderate-severe melasma. Subjects are chosen consecutively based on mMASI and Janus II
      measurement. The level of serum FT4 and TSH were then measured in both groups of the
      patients. The data is tabulated and a comparative analysis of serum FT4 and TSH levels with
      mild and moderate-severe melasma is done. In addition, this study also analyzes the level of
      serum FT4 and TSH with the result of Janus II facial analysis system scoring. The same method
      of analysis was done to know the association between mMASI and examination by using Janus II
      facial analysis system.

      This study aims to find the difference in the levels of thyroid hormone in varying severity
      of melasma.

    <description>This subjects according to the modified melasma area and severity index (mMASI) score. Variables that are measure by mMASI scoring includes the degree of darkness and involvement of area. Darkness component is used to replace pigmentation and intensity in MASI scoring with modification (mMASI). Assessment using mMASI is highly dependent on the operator; hence, a new objective examination to assess skin pigmentation have been developed, which is the facial imaging analysis.
The level of serum FT4 and TSH were then measured in both groups of the patients. In addition, the degree of skin pigmentation was also measured by using the Janus II facial analysis system. In this study, there were two modalities used in the Janus II facial analysis system, which is the polarization light and ultraviolet light.
In addition, this study also analyzes the level of serum FT4 and TSH with the result of Janus II facial analysis system scoring.</description>
