      Context and Aims: Several studies have demonstrated an association between obesity,
      periodontitis, and exercise. This study aimed to investigate the effects of regular exercise
      on obese women with periodontal disease, using serum, saliva, and gingival crevicular fluid
      (GCF) samples.

      Settings and Design: A before-after study design was adopted to evaluate the effects of 12
      weeks of regular exercise on obese women grouped according to periodontal status, without a
      control group (no exercise).

      Methods and Material: The study sample comprised fifteen patients without periodontitis (NP
      group) and 10 patients with chronic periodontitis (CP group), from whom periodontal
      parameters were measured and serum, saliva, and GCF samples were collected. Body mass index
      (BMI), anthropometric measurements, somatotype-motoric tests, and maximal oxygen consumption
      (VO2max) were recorded at baseline and after exercise.

      Statistical analysis used: MedCalc was used for statistical analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The periodontal diagnosis of participants with generalized periodontitis stage
             III-IV/grade C. Systemically healthy participants with generalized periodontitis were
             enrolled if they were between 18 and 40 years of age, and had no allergies to
             penicillin, metronidazole or quinolones, a history of antibiotic therapy or
             periodontal therapy within the preceding six months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were excluded if they had any known systemic diseases or conditions that
             can/could influence the periodontal status, allergies to quinolones, penicillin or
             metronidazole, a history of antibiotic therapy, or periodontal treatment within the
             preceding six months
