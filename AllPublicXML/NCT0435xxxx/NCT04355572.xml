  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial of study subjects with
      PCOS and low vitamin D to 2 groups- placebo and vitamin D replacement. Participants and
      investigators will be blinded to treatment modality until the end of the trial period

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred to the pediatric endocrinology clinic or adolescent gynecology clinic at
      Yale New Haven Children Hospital with a primary complaint of hirsutism, acne, or amenorrhea
      and/or oligomenorrhea persisting 2 years after their menarche will be evaluated for
      polycystic ovarian syndrome through history, physical exam, pelvic ultrasound, and laboratory
      evaluation, to include androgen testing, thyroid testing, female hormone testing, and
      diabetic risk testing (this is standard of care). A vitamin D level will also be drawn. While
      vitamin D level is not currently part of the diagnostic algorithm for PCOS, it is not
      unreasonable to check in patients in which there is concern for an endocrine disorder. If the
      patient meets Rotterdam criteria and their serum vitamin D level is between 6 and 29 ng/mL,
      the patient and their guardian(s) will be approached for inclusion in our study by the
      physician or dedicated research nursing staff.

      If patient and guardian agree to participate and sign a consent / assent form, the patient
      will then be randomized to receive vitamin D supplement versus placebo and will be followed
      for 6 months on their randomized replacement with repeat laboratory testing of AMH, vitamin
      D, lipid profile, glucose and insulin testing, androgen testing, and female hormone testing
      at the randomization, 3 months and at the end of the course of the trial(6 months). Patients
      with vitamin D levels 5ng/mL or less will not be randomized, they will be given recommended
      treatment. Depressive symptoms will be assessed at time of randomization, 3 months post
      randomization, and 6 months post randomization using the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the
      gold standard self-report depression inventory. A depression screen is currently administered
      to all adolescents seen at Yale New Haven Children Hospital outpatient clinics with a
      protocol for patients who report clinically significant levels of depression. This protocol
      will remain in place and will not be altered during this research study.

      After post-trial testing, patients will be unblinded and patients who still have vitamin D
      below threshold will be offered vitamin D treatment.

      Aim 1: To investigate the effect of vitamin D replacement upon biochemical parameters of
      polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in adolescent female patients. Hypothesis: Replacement of
      vitamin D to normal levels in adolescents with PCOS and/or at risk for PCOS and low levels of
      vitamin D will lower serum androgen and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels.

      Aim 2: To investigate the effect of vitamin D replacement on clinical features of PCOS in
      adolescent female patients. Hypothesis: Replacement of vitamin D in adolescents with PCOS
      and/or at risk for PCOS and low levels of vitamin D will improve symptoms of menstrual
      irregularities, acne, and hirsutism.

      Aim3: To investigate the effect of vitamin D replacement on depressive symptoms in adolescent
      female patients with PCOS. Hypothesis: Replacement of vitamin D in adolescents with PCOS or
      at risk for PCOS and low levels of serum vitamin D will improve symptoms of depression.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in oligomenorrhea</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in oligomenorrhea, i.e restoration of monthly menses or improvement in the menstrual pattern during 6 months while enrolled in the trial based on self report</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) level</measure>
    <time_frame>at enrollment, at 3 months after randomization and 6 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>25-hydroxyvitamin D level will be measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or immunoassay</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in DHEAS level</measure>
    <time_frame>at enrollment, at 3 months after randomization and 6 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The serum DHEA-S concentration is the traditional marker for adrenal androgen excession because it is produced almost exclusively by the adrenal glands and concentrations remain stable across the day and cycle. Preferred testing is done by immunoassay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Androstenedione level</measure>
    <time_frame>at enrollment, at 3 months after randomization and 6 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Androstenedione concentration assesses for hyperandrogenemia as well, it is produced by the ovary and the adrenal cortex and serves as precursor of testosterone. Data suggests that levels are elevated in approximately 20% of women with PCOS. Evaluation is done by Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level</measure>
    <time_frame>at enrollment, at 3 months after randomization and 6 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>AMH is a dimeric glycoprotein of the transforming growth factor-Î² superfamily that is involved in growth and differentiation of ovarian follicles. AMH is expressed in granulosa cells in the ovary and serves as a marker of ovarian reserve as well as marker of several ovarian pathologies such as PCOS, granulosa cell tumors and premature ovarian insufficiency. Level will be measured using Immunoassay (IA)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in testosterone level</measure>
    <time_frame>at enrollment, at 3 months after randomization and 6 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Testosterone levels are elevated in vast majority of adolescents with PCOS. The free testosterone level is more sensitive for diagnosis of hyperandrogenic disorders compared with the total testosterone. Evaluation is done by Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry</description>
