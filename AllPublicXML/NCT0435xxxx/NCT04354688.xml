    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy
      of the T3 Certain Tapered with DCD as compared to T3 Certain Tapered without DCD. All
      implants will be placed in the maxilla or mandible in a single stage manner and loaded with
      prosthesis after 6 weeks of healing. Final restorations will take place no later than 4
      months following implant placement surgery. The implants will be evaluated yearly for 2
      years.

      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study that will assess the the safety and
      efficacy of the implant systems with:

        -  Resistance to countertorque testing (mobility)

        -  Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ)

        -  Changes in peri-implant crestal bone levels

        -  Confirmation of clinical benefits

      A total of 60 implants, 30 per treatment group will be placed across all participating sites.
      One patient may contribute more than 1 implant. All implants/ patients will be followed for
      up to 2 years.
