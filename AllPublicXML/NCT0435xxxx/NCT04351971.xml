  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Skeletal muscle-type pain is one of the main reasons for consultations in health
      centers. In Chile, it is estimated that the prevalence reaches 33% in men and 50% in women,
      increasing considerably with age, with cervical pain being one of the main conditions,
      estimating that 80% of the population has experienced cervicalgia at some time. lifetime. The
      main symptom is neck pain and restriction of movement, mainly affecting the mobility of the
      upper cervical region. Although there are studies evaluating the effectiveness of manual
      techniques, there are currently no studies evaluating the effects on cervical muscle activity
      and pressure threshold. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation is to evaluate
      the immediate effects of a manual therapy technique on the threshold pressure of muscular
      trigger points and on the muscular activity of the upper cervical region in patients with
      chronic pain and restriction of cervical mobility. higher.

      Methods: Clinical trial, randomized, prospective, double-blind study (patient and evaluator).
      The participants (21 subjects) were divided into 2 groups. The control group will receive a
      C0-C0 placebo mobilization technique and the experimental group will receive the C0-C1
      mobilization technique. In both groups the technique will be carried out by mobilization
      cycles of 15 seconds and 3 seconds of rest for a total period of 5 min. Pressure threshold,
      activation of the superficial deep musculature and articular range of the upper cervical
      region will be measured.

      Most cases of pain in the neck region are of mechanical origin. In Spain, its annual
      prevalence has been estimated to range between 16.7% and 75.1% 2. In Chile, the prevalence is
      estimated to be 30% in Men and 50% in women, increasing as age increases. It is estimated
      that, of these cases, 44% have a duration of 6 months or more, giving rise to difficulties
      not only at work but also in daily life, at home, economically, even in emotional aspects.

      The most common symptom is pain in the neck region, which may be associated with restricted
      movement, dizziness, and manifestations of stress. A large proportion of movement of the
      cervical spine takes place in the C1-C2 segment, where up to 50% of the total rotation of the
      cervical spine occurs. There are several techniques to restore cervical mobility, but few of
      them comply with the guidelines of the IFOMPT (International Federation of Manual Orthopedic
      Therapists) on the safety and efficacy in the treatment of hypomobility of the upper cervical
      spine, avoiding positions at the end of the cervical range of motion, especially rotation and
      extension, and there is also limited scientific evidence of its effectiveness.

      The C0-C1 dorsal mobilization technique complies with these recommendations and have been
      used in previous studies, although there is no evidence of its effects on range of motion,
      activation of deep cervical musculature and pressure threshold in patients with chronic
      mechanical cervicalgia. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation is to determine
      the effects of the dorsal mobilization technique of the atlanto-occipital joint (C0-C1) as
      adjuvant treatments for Kinesitherapy in users with chronic cervical pain of mechanical
      origin and rotation deficit in the upper cervical spine.
