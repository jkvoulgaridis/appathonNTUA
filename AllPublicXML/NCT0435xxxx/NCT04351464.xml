      Objectives: This study was planned to investigate the influence of reflexology applied to
      children with cerebral palsy together with physical therapy program involving
      neurodevelopmental approaches.

      Methods: The study involved 40 children aged,16 girls and 24 boys between 3 and 15 years and
      divided into two groups. While the children in Group 1 were given twice a week for eight
      weeks neurodevelopmental treatment, reflexology was applied to those in Group 2 together with
      neurodevelopmental treatment. Drooling Severity and Frequency Scale, Pediatric Sleep
      Questionnaire and the Children's Health Questionnaire was used to assess the drooling, status
      of sleep and quality of life in children.

      The study involved a total of 40 children aged between three and 15 diagnosed with CP by a
      pediatric neurologist. Children at levels 3/4/5 of the GMFCS who did not have any open wounds
      on the foot, where the application was to be performed, and whose parents consented to the
      child's participation were accepted in the study. However, those children were excluded who
      were treated with botulinum toxin in the last six months, underwent surgery, were treated
      with reflexology or any other alternative medicine method and who had refractory epilepsy.

    <description>Received reflexology implementation for 20-30 minutes on the sole along with the physical treatment involving NDT approaches. Within the scope of the implementation, all the reflex points on the sole were stimulated. The pituitary gland, which is related to sleep and control of salivation, oromotor area and areas of muscular and skeletal system were stimulated with further repetitions.</description>

    <description>The group received a 45-minute physical therapy program involving NDT approaches as the control group. Within the scope of this program, the children were treated with intramuscular stretching and soft tissue mobilization, exercises that improved balance and that supported the development of postural control, position shifts, and stretching and reinforcement exercises in the necessary muscle groups.</description>
