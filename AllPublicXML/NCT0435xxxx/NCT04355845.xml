        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and/or female participants who are healthy as determined by medical evaluation
             including medical history, full physical examination which includes BP and pulse rate
             measurements, clinical laboratory tests, and 12-lead ECG.

          -  BMI of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological,
             dermatological, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding
             untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of dosing), diabetes or of the
             contraindications as per the USPI for IMITREX.

          -  10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (based on ASCVD Risk Estimator)
             â‰¥7.5%.

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, cholecystectomy).

          -  Systemic therapy with any of the medications that are MAO-A inhibitors within 14 days
             or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational
             product. Concomitant use of any ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medication (like
             dihydroergotamine or methysergide), or other 5-HT agonist (Section 6.5) within 14 days
             or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational
             product.

          -  Known participation in a clinical trial of PF-06651600 within 60 days prior to the
             first dose of investigational product; participation in any clinical trial of
             PF-06651600 and the participant experienced AE that led to discontinuation or had an
             SAE that in the judgment of the investigator were PF-06651600-related.
