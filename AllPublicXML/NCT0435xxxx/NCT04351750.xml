  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms are highly prevalent among women, and menopause is one of
      the risk factors for UI. During the menopausal transition, not only the hormonal secretion is
      changed but also the level of physical activity is affected. The time spent on physical
      activity is reduced in postmenopausal women. Studies have shown that physical activity acts
      in a bidirectional manner, exerting either a preventive or an aggravating effect on urinary
      incontinence. Individuals with sedentary lifestyle and insufficient physical activity (&lt; 150
      min/week) are at risk of developing UI, and regular physical activity exerts a protective
      effect in preventing UI, but the optimal type, duration, and intensity of exercise for the
      female older adult population remain unknown. In addition, objective measurements of pelvic
      floor muscle function is needed as the use of self-reported measures may cause response bias.
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of different intensity of exercise on
      pelvic floor muscle function and HRQoL in postmenopausal women with UI. The investigators
      hypothesize that (a) both high- and low-intensity physical activities can improve pelvic
      floor muscle strength and HRQoL in postmenopausal women with UI, and (b) the improvement in
      high-intensity group is higher than that in low-intensity group. A randomized trial will be
      conducted to compare the effect of different exercise intensity on pelvic floor muscle
      function in postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence (n=90).

    <description>The participants will receive high-intensity general exercise and pelvic floor muscle training in high-intensity group. The intensity of aerobic exercise is 60 ~ 89% of heart rate reserve (HRR) or oxygen uptake reserve (VO2R), which is equivalent to the vigorous intensity exercise proposed in the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). The intensity of resistance exercise is 60~80% of 1 repetition maximum (RM), which is equivalent to the moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise proposed in ACSM. After finishing the general exercise, participants will receive pelvic floor muscle training.</description>

    <description>The participants will receive low-intensity general exercise and pelvic floor muscle training in low-intensity group. The intensity of aerobic exercise is 40~59% of HRR or VO2R, which is equivalent to the moderate intensity exercise proposed in ACSM. The intensity of resistance exercise is 40~50% of 1RM, which is equivalent to the very light-to-light intensity exercise proposed in ACSM. After finishing the general exercise, participants will receive pelvic floor muscle training.</description>

    <description>The participants will receive training sessions twice a week for 8 weeks. General exercise includes aerobic exercise (stationary bike) and resistance training (thera-band, sandbags, dumbbell and swiss ball), and the intensity and progression of both aerobic and resistance exercises will be provided as recommended by the ACSM, and the exercise will individualized based on participant's HRR, 1 RM weight and Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion Scale (Borg RPE scale). An oximeter will be utilized to monitor the heart rate and SPO2 of the participants to ensure safety during the training session.</description>
