      The purpose of this study is to compare two different platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections
      for patellar tendinosis.

      Aim: To perform a randomized, double blinded study comparing the clinical effect of PRP
      versus PRP + concentrated insulin-like growth factor (IGF) in patients with patellar
      tendinosis.

      Introduction/Background:

      Patellar tendinosis is a frustrating ailment commonly encountered in sports medicine.
      Treating this condition continues to be a significant challenge for sports medicine
      physicians. The tendinosis lesion is characterized by collagen disorganization and increased
      ground substance. One method of treating this problem is using platelet rich plasma (PRP),
      which is a concentration of platelets from the patient's own blood that provides a high dose
      of growth factors aimed at stimulating tendon healing. These injections have been used
      extensively to treat many tendon disorders including patellar tendinosis. Several studies
      have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of using PRP to treat patellar tendinosis.

      One growth factor that is known to be helpful in tendon healing is insulin-like growth factor
      (IGF). However, IGF is not found in PRP but rather in the free plasma that is spun off during
      the PRP processing. This free plasma or platelet poor plasma (PPP) is typically discarded but
      it is a known source of IGF. We have shown that concentrating PPP in the FDA cleared Plasmax
      device yields an increased concentration of insulin-like growth factor (IGF). Local IGF
      injections into the patellar tendon have demonstrated improved tendon healing, but the effect
      on clinical outcomes has never been studied in a controlled fashion.

      Research Design: Double blinded randomized comparative trial.

      Detailed Study Procedures: 38 patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment arm. 19
      patients will receive platelet rich plasma (PRP) and 19 patients will receive PRP plus
      concentrated IGF. Patient will be blinded to their treatment, but treatment team will not.
      PRP will be prepared according to standard sterile procedures out of view of the patient to
      ensure patients are adequately blinded. The injecting physician will not be blinded to
      randomization scheme.

    <description>Procedure will be carried out with excellent sterile technique. 54ml of whole blood will be drawn. 54ml will be processed by centrifugation using the GPS III system (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN) and 1 ml will undergo a complete blood count (for a baseline comparison to determine the fold increase in platelets). The resultant PRP (5ml) will be injected (after 5ml 1% lidocaine has been injected into the skin for comfort) into the patellar tendon using ultrasound guidance to accurately direct the injection to the site of the tendon abnormality. The patient will rest after the injection for 15 minutes and then be dismissed.</description>

    <description>The PRP preparation and blood draw will be identical to the above. 55ml of whole blood will be drawn (1ml will undergo a CBC and the remaining 54ml will be used to make PRP). In addition to preparing the PRP, the resultant PPP (instead of discarding it) will be placed into the Plasmax device (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN) and concentrated via a second centrifugation cycle. The plasmax concentrate (concentrated IGF) will be added to the PRP (3ml of PRP + 2ml of plasmax concentrate for a total of 5ml) and then will be injected (after 5ml 1% lidocaine has been injected into the skin for comfort) under ultrasound guidance followed by the same rest period.</description>
