  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple lines of evidence have shown that perioperative opioids requirement was associated
      with poor outcomes in cancer patients, including increased cancer progression and metastases
      and reduced survival in patients with lung, breast, prostate, and bladder cancer. Circulating
      tumor cells (CTCs) have been validated as prognostic biomarkers of a number of cancers. The
      aim of this study is to investigate the effects of perioperative opioids on the number of
      CTCs in patients receiving robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy. The difference of
      the amounts of perioperative opioids is achieved by using general anesthesia combined with
      intravenous opioid-based analgesia intra- and post-operatively in one group and general
      analgesia combined with epidural ropivacaine-based analgesia in the other group.
