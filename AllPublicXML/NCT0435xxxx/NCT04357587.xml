  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of
      cancer mortality in the United States. The current standard of care (SOC) for locally
      advanced rectal cancer includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery.
      However, great variability exists in patient's response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with
      only about 20-25% of patients achieving a complete response while other patients achieve a
      partial or no treatment response. The purpose of this study is to test the investigational
      agent, Pembrolizumab, in combination with SOC radiation and Capecitabine (or 5-Fluorouacil)
      in treatment of patients with mismatch repair deficient locally advanced rectal cancer.

      This study investigates the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of Pembrolizumab, an
      immunotherapy agent, in combination with SOC radiation and Capecitabine (or 5-Fluorouacil) in
      treatment of patients with mismatch repair deficient locally advanced rectal cancer.
      Pembrolizumab is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by enhancing the
      functional activity of the target lymphocytes (immune cells) to facilitate tumor regression
      and ultimately immune rejection. Pembrolizumab in combination with radiation and Capcitabine
      (or 5-Fluorouacil) is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for this specific indication.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and feasibility
      of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with capectiabine (or 5-Fluorouracil ) in the
      treatment of patients with MMR-d locally advanced rectal cancer

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine the treatment response in MMR-d rectal
      cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and Pembrolizumab.

    <description>Treatment response as measured by pathologic assessment of treatment response using the AJCC TRG following surgical resection.
AJCC TRG grading ranges from 0-3:
0 (complete response): no viable cancer cells
(near complete response): single cells or rare small groups of cancer cells
(partial response): residual cancer with evident tumor regression but more than single cells or rare small groups of cancer cells
(poor or no response): extensive residual cancer with no evident tumor regression.</description>

    <description>Treatment response as measured by MRI tumor regression grade.
The MRI tumor regression grade uses the following scale:
No/minimal fibrosis visible (tiny linear scar) and no tumor signal
Dense fibrotic scar (low signal intensity) but no macroscopic tumor signal (indicates no or microscopic tumor)
Fibrosis predominates but obvious measurable areas of tumor signal visible
Tumor signal predominates with little/minimal fibrosis
Tumor signal only: no fibrosis, includes progression of tumor</description>
