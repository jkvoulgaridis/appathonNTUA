  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20-30 % of colon cancer patients who have no metastasis in lymph nodes after
      definitive colectomy have recurrence with distant metastasis. These recurrences could be due
      to missed occult tumor cells or micrometastasis. Detailed examination of all lymph nodes is
      expensive and time consuming. Sentinel lymph node mapping using Indocyanine green dye helps
      in identifying the lymph nodes which are most likely to harbour metastasis. These sentinel
      lymph nodes can be subsequently subjected to detailed pathologic examination and
      immunohistochemistry which increases the likelihood of identifying micrometastasis and occult
      tumor cells. Patients found to harbour such metastasis can be treated with additional
      chemotherapy after surgery. The aim of the study is to examine the feasibility of sentinel
      lymph node mapping using Indocyanine green dye in colon cancer and evaluate the upstaging
      rate in post-operative colon cancer patients who don't have metastatic lymph nodes on routine
      histopathology.

      All patients of colon cancer fulfilling the inclusion criteria and excluding the patients
      according to the exclusion criteria will undergo standard laparoscopic/open colectomy.

      Patients will undergo intra-operative on-table colonoscopy after induction of anesthesia.
      Indocyanine green dye is injected around the tumor and followed with near-infrared scope. All
      sentinel nodes will be marked with clips/sutures for identification by the pathologist
      post-operatively. Any aberrant lymph nodes identified outside the planned resection margins
      will be excised, marked with the position of excision and sent separately from the gross
      specimen. After this the surgeon will proceed with the surgery including vascular ligation
      and resection of mesocolon.

      After surgery, all the lymph nodes identified in the specimen including the tagged sentinel
      lymph nodes will be examined using standard Hematoxylin and eosin staining. If all the lymph
      nodes are negative for metastasis, the sentinel lymph nodes will undergo additional stepwise
      sections and immunohistochemistry for pancytokeratin.
