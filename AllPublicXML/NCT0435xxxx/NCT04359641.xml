    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: display of predictive analytics monitoring on acute care cardiology wards
      improves patient outcomes and is cost-effective to the health system.

      The investigators have developed and validated computational models for predicting key
      outcomes in adults, and a useful display has been developed, implemented and iteratively
      optimized. These models estimate risk of imminent patient deterioration using trends in vital
      signs, labs and cardiorespiratory dynamics derived from readily available continuous bedside
      monitoring. They are presented on LCD monitors using software called CoMET (Continuous
      Monitoring of Event Trajectories; AMP3D, Advanced Medical Predictive Devices, Diagnostics,
      and Displays, Charlottesville, VA)

      To test the impact on patient outcomes, the investigators propose a 22-month
      cluster-randomized control trial on the 4th floor of UVa Hospital, a medical-surgical floor
      for cardiology and cardiovascular surgery patients. Clinicians will receive standard CoMET
      device training. Three- to five-bed clusters will be randomized to intervention (predictive
      display plus standard monitoring) or control (standard monitoring alone) for two months at a
      time. In addition, risk scores for patients in the intervention clusters will be presented
      daily during rounds to members of the care team of physicians, residents, nurses, and other
      clinicians. Data on outcomes will be statistically compared between intervention and control
      clusters.

    <measure>Hours free of events of clinical deterioration</measure>
    <time_frame>within 21 days of the admission</time_frame>
    <description>(1) The number of hours free of acute clinical events within 21 day of admission. Hours of acute clinical events are defined as time when one or more of the following occur:
An emergent ICU transfer (emergent defined as urgent, unplanned) and ICU stay
Emergent intubation (emergent is defined by clinician's notes as a non-planned procedure)
Cardiac arrest, if prior to ICU transfer or death
Death
A maximum score will be 21 event-free days (504 hours). Patients who are discharged from the hospital prior to 21 days without an event will be counted as having 21 event-free days. Patients who die during the admission will be counted as having 0 event-free days. Patients will be censored (with no event observed) at the time of non-emergent ICU transfer, surgery transfer, or other transfer.</description>

    <measure>Hours to proactive clinical response</measure>

    <description>We will use a Kaplan Meier or Cox Proportional Hazard Curve to determine differences in response time between display and control.
Time to the 1st order for transfusion of 3 units or more of blood ordered within 24 hours
Time to first order for IV inotropes or pressors administered
Time to first order for blood or urine culture obtained for suspicion of infection
Time to first order for lactate drawn
Time to first order for antibiotics given for suspicion of infection
Time to first order for fluid resuscitation given for suspicion of shock
Time to rapid response team (RRT or MET) call initiation.</description>

    <measure>Subgroup secondary outcome: post-ICU transfer event-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average one week</time_frame>
    <description>A subgroup secondary outcome will be a Kaplan Meier or Cox Proportional Hazard curve showing post-ICU transfer, event-free survival, hours free of the following events:
Time of emergent intubation post-ICU transfer (emergent is defined by clinician's notes as a non-planned procedure)
Time of the 1st order post-ICU transfer for transfusion of 3 units or more of blood ordered within 24 hours
Time of first order post-ICU transfer of IV inotropes or pressors administered for shock (including septic shock)
Time of cardiac arrest post-ICU transfer
Time of CHF escalation, defined by the time of first order for diuretic drip, time of first order for CVVHD, or time of dialysis initiation
Time of death post-ICU transfer
Discharge from the ICU without an event will count as &quot;infinite&quot; event-free survival.</description>
