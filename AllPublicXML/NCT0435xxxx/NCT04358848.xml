  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a follow-up evaluation of modifications made to the instructions in the User
      Manual following the initial study evaluating how well an individual can put together and use
      a Portable Oxygen Concentrator (POC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Belluscura X-PLO2R Portable Oxygen Concentrator (POC) is intended for the provision of
      supplemental oxygen to patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, such as Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and for a patient requiring supplemental oxygen, as prescribed by a
      physician. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the X-PLO2R POC can be used by the
      intended users without serious errors or problems for the intended use and under the expected
      use conditions. Specifically, the study is to evaluate if potential users of the device can
      correctly, safely and effectively set-up, activate and operate the X-PLO2R POC to receive the
      required supplemental oxygen; if the intended user can understand and apply the information
      contained in the Belluscura X-PLO2R Quick Start Guide and User Manual; and to identify any
      and all use difficulties, problems and errors made during device assembly and operation, and
      to subsequently mitigate each identified instance of use error through device and/or
      materials modification, and to subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of each modification.
