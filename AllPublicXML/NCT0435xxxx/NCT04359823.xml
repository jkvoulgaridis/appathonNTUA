  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the effects of topical lovastatin/cholesterol vs topical lovastatin
      alone in patients with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. Patients will be
      divided into two groups, topical lovastatin/cholesterol and topical lovastatin alone.
      Patients will apply topical treatment twice daily to lesions over the course of 12 weeks.
      Follow up will occur in the virtual setting and photographs will be used to document
      progress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cholesterol/lovastatin versus
      lovastatin alone to treat porokeratosis. Our working hypothesis is that both topical
      cholesterol/lovastatin and lovastatin alone are helpful in treating patients with
      disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP). Potential subjects will be approached
      by their care team member to be made aware of the study at MUSC Dermatology clinics.
      Subsequently, members of the study team will approach their own patients to ask for
      participation in this study. Pertinent project information, risks, and time commitment will
      be relayed to subjects. If subjects show interest in participating, they will be given
      consent forms to either sign or bring home for consideration. If the patient is eligible for
      the study, he or she will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. They will have a 50/50
      chance of being in either group. Neither the researchers nor you will make the choice to
      which group you are assigned. The two groups are Group A (cholesterol/lovastatin) and Group B
      (lovastatin only). The patient will not be informed of which group they are in and will not
      be informed of what their study medication is, allowing single-blinding. Researchers will not
      be masked. Enrolled subjects will be followed up at monthly intervals for three months via
      virtual check-in. At each visit, participants will undergo brief physical examination;
      additionally, clinical photographs of the lesion will be obtained. Photographs will be stored
      in the electronic medical record and stored in a departmental secure drive for further
      analysis of lesion features. At each visit a Patient Quality of Life, Physician Global
      Assessment Scale, and Actinic keratosis Field Assessment Scale will be administered. Patients
      will be contacted via virtual check-in visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Patients will be asked
      about compliance and any adverse effects experienced. Participants will also be contacted by
      phone by study team member to assess for any adverse effects at weeks 2 and 6 of treatment.
      Compounded topical medication prescribed to subjects will be self-applied twice daily. These
      medications will be prepared by Dottie's Pharmacy in Charleston, SC. They will be prepared so
      the study will remain single-blinded and associated costs will be covered by the research
      budget. Dermoscopic and clinical photographs will be subsequently analyzed for the presence
      of cornoid lamella. The team will record any additional dermoscopic or clinicals feature that
      may arise during the analyses. Frequency of dermoscopic and clinical features will be
      analyzed against clinical involution to find possible predictors.

    <measure>Physician Global Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The physician global assessment scale uses a grading system of 0-4 (clear-severe) to visually and clinically describe the patient's lesion. A higher score would indicate a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Actinic Keratosis Field Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Actinic Keratosis Field Assessment Scale measures the percent area covered by actinic keratosis on a scale of 0-4 (0 being 0% and 4 being &gt;50% total area on face or scalp), the severity of hyperkeratosis based upon size of lesion and degree of hyperkeratosis (considered positive findings if &gt;1 actinic keratosis with significant hyperkeratosis and &gt;5mm in diameter), and sun damage severity, measured positive (moderate or severe sun damage) or negative (none or mild damage), based upon severity of erythema, telangiectasia, inflammation, atrophy, and pigmentation disorders. This will be used to determine skin changes (described above) during treatment. A higher score would indicate a worse outcome.</description>
