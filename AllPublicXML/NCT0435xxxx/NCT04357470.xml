  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fracture of the distal radius (DRF) is a common musculoskeletal system injury. Fracture of
      the ulnar styloid frequently accompanies fractures of the distal radius and is seen in 50-65%
      of these cases. The loss of dexterity is common in many musculoskeletal conditions.

      The aim of this study was to investigate whether an associated ulnar styloid fracture
      following a distal radius fracture has any effect on manual dexterity.

      Patients who diagnosed with isolated DRF or DRF accompanied with ulnar styloid fracture and
      applied to hand rehabilitation unit were included in the study. The patients were divided
      into two groups according to the ulnar styloid fracture presence. USF Group was DRF with
      ulnar styloid fracture; NON-USF Group was DRF without ulnar styloid fracture.

      Pain, range of motion, Quick-DASH, hand grip and pinch strength, Purdue Pegboard Test, Jebsen
      Taylor Hand Function Test was measured at six month.

      A total of 125 patients, 68 female (54,4%) and 57 male (45,6%) were included in the study.
      The mean age of the patients was 47,15Â±13,41 (18-65) years. 65 of the patients (52%) had
      isolated fracture of the distal radius fracture (NON-USF group) and 60 patients (48%) had a
      concurrent ulnar styloid fracture (USF group).

      There was no significant difference in pain between the groups (p&gt;0,05). Joints range of
      motion were higher in the NON-USF group than in the USF group. This difference was
      statistically significant only for flexion and extension (p&lt;0,05). There was no statistically
      significant difference in Quick-DASH score between groups (p&gt;0,05). The injured hand grip and
      pinch strength values in NON-USF group were greater than the USF group but the difference was
      not statistically significant (p&gt;0,05). The manual dexterity and hand function tests showed
      that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups at six months
      (p&gt;0,05).

      There is a consensus that ulnar styloid fracture has no effect on overall hand function. But,
      there is no study dwelled on the manual dexterity. In this study, the effect of ulnar styloid
      fracture on hand function is more clearly emphasized. In conclusion, concomitant USF does not
      lead poorer manual dexterity.
