  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of study was to evaluate the effect of dental operating microscope use on the healing
      outcome of non surgical endodontic treatment of maxillary molars.

      Prior to treatment a thorough clinical and radiological examination was carried out. A
      thorough history was taken from each patient and written informed consent was taken after
      explaining the procedure, risks and benefits. Mature maxillary first permanent molar with
      diagnosis of periapical periodontitis (as confirmed clinically &amp; by periapical radiograph)
      was chosen for the study. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to either the dental
      operating microscope group or to control group (without using dental operating microscope)
      for the treatment.

      After administration of local anesthesia and rubber dam isolation of the involved tooth ;
      access cavity was prepared using carbide bur and refined using ultrasonic tip in both groups.
      In both the groups similar protocol for irrigation, obturation and post operative
      restorations was followed. Immediate post-operative radiograph was taken using preset
      exposure parameters and follow up clinical and radiographic examination was carried at 12th
      month.

    <description>After administration of LA and rubber dam isolation, acess cavity was prepared using carbide burs. Working length was determined using root ZX apex locator and was verified radiographically. Canal preparation was done with protaper gold rotary instruments. 5ml of 5.25% NaOCl was used as irrigant. After instrumentation , the canals were irrigated with 5.0 ml of 17% EDTA for 1minute followed by irrigation with 5.0 ml of 5.25% NaOCl. Canals were dried with absorbent paper points, filled with calcium hydroxide paste and access cavity was restored with IRM.At the recall appointment ; after one week,paste removal, copious irrigation was done with 5.25% NaOCl and canals were dried with paper points. Canals were obturated with Gutta-Percha and ZOE based sealer.</description>
