      INTRODUCTION: The complexity of the pathophysiology of heterogeneous diseases such as heart
      failure and obstructive pulmonary disease causes a different approach to these diseases or
      with a view as much as a better understanding of the same situations, with which the clinical
      profile of patients who are associated with an association is. It is known that regular
      physical training promotes progressive improvements in exercise tolerance, in the pulmonary
      ventilation / perfusion ratio and in respiratory function by strengthening. OBJECTIVE: To
      compare the effects of high-intensity interval training and continuous aerobic exercise, with
      peripheral endothelial function, brain natriuretic peptide levels, maximum exercise
      tolerance, distribution of lung volumes and quality of life of patients with obstructive
      pulmonary disease associated with heart failure. METHODS: This is a clinical, controlled,
      randomized and blinded trial. Peripheral endothelial function, tolerance to maximum and
      submaximal exercise, distribution of lung volumes, quality of life, presence of symptoms of
      depression and perception of clinical change will be evaluated. EXPECTED RESULTS: Incorporate
      into the care of these patients, new effective therapeutic approaches, of low cost and with
      greater technical and scientific evidence.
