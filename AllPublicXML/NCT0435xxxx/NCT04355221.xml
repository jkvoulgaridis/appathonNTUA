    <textblock>
      The current study investigated the efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency in pain reduction in TN
      patients and compared the efficacy and the impact on the quality of life of the standard
      technique with a prolonged duration technique and a higher voltage one.

      Entire enrolled patients were diagnosed as classic TN according to the international headache
      society classification (IHS, 2013) and underwent brain MRI and MRA to exclude secondary
      causes. Patients were randomly divided into three groups, Group A patients underwent PRF
      using the standard settings, group B patients underwent PRF with prolonged duration and Group
      C patients underwent PRF with higher voltage. VAS and pain amplitude reduction were recorded
      before the intervention and 1 hour, 1 day, 1week, 1 month, 6 months and 1year after it.
      Quality of life was assessed before and 1 year after the intervention.
