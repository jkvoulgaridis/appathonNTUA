  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to understand why bariatric surgery is such an effective
      treatment for obesity with a focus on brain mechanisms. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      neuropeptide, hormone and protein levels will be measured as a surrogate for changes in brain
      activity in participants before and after bariatric surgery as compared with participants
      before and after diet-induced weight loss. The investigators are studying neuropeptides and
      hormones that are know to be involved with the regulation of appetite and body weight to
      determine if some of the changes that are expected to occur after diet-induced weight loss do
      not occur after bariatric surgery. In addition, proteomic analysis will be used to uncover
      new protein biomarkers that are unique to surgical weight loss. The results of these studies
      will help explain why bariatric surgery is so effective in achieving long-term weight loss.
      Understanding how the central nervous system responds to bariatric surgery could help the
      development of alternative nonsurgical therapies for obesity and its metabolic complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral metabolic signals communicate levels of energy stores to the brain and elicit a
      host of neuronal responses that maintain energy balance; such regulatory mechanisms make it
      difficult to maintain diet-induced weight loss. The goal is to understand how these central
      regulatory mechanisms are circumvented following surgical alterations in the gut in subjects
      after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) compared to
      carefully matched diet- induced weight loss controls who achieve weight loss on a low calorie
      liquid diet. Surgery participants will be patients who have already chosen to have a
      bariatric surgery procedure with their doctor. Diet participants will be provided with the
      low calorie liquid diet for approximately 3 months and will be monitored weekly throughout
      the study.

      Surgery participants will be studied at 3 time-points:

        1. Before the intervention

        2. After surgery at 10-15% weight loss

        3. At 12 months after surgery

      Low calorie diet participants will be studied at 2 time-points:

        1. Before intervention

        2. At 10-15% weight loss (approximately 12 weeks on the diet)

      At each time-point subjects will have a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) sampling and blood will be collected in the fasting state and in response to a liquid
      meal challenge. Body weight, waist and hip circumference will be measured.

    <description>This surgery is often called gastric bypass. It is a weight-loss surgery that involves creating a small stomach pouch and bypassing part of the small intestine.
If you decide with your doctor to have gastric bypass, you can be enrolled on this arm of the study. A surgery date should be pending before the investigators screen you for the study. The study does not cover the cost of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.</description>
