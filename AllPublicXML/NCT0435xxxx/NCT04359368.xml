    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate characteristics of patients with previous hypersensitivity
      reaction grades I-IV to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject) or to iron sucrose
      (Venofer) including age, atopy status, previous allergic reactions, previous medical history,
      current medications and co-morbidities. Furthermore, symptoms on reaction such as severity
      grade of reaction will be evaluated.
