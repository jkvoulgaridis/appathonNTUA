    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence
      and how to implement such studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the
      validity of the original RCT finding.

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score-matched, retrospective
        cohort study design comparing telmisartan to other antihypertensives, including loop
        diuretics, thiazides, and dihydropyridines. Although the trial compared telmisartan with
        placebo added to usual care, the investigators selected an active comparator for this study
        because non-user comparator groups are known to often lead to confounding by indication and
        biased treatment effect estimates. This group of other antihypertensives were selected as
        the primary comparator because intolerance to ACEi was a primary inclusion criteria for the
        trial. Therefore, patients in both arms were on a mix of non-ACEi and non-ARB
        antihypertensives as background therapy.

        full code and algorithm definitions.

        The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during baseline period of 180

        For Marketscan: Jan 1, 2003 -Dec 2017 (end of data availability). For Optum: Jan 1,
