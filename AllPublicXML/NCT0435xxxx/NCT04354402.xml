  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a follow-up study to update the survival time data (overall survival,
      progression-free survival, and duration of response) of the subjects who received SyB L-0501
      at least once in Phase III Study of SyB L-0501 in combination with rituximab to treat
      recurrent/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma study (2017002) by reviewing their follow-up
      information following the study completion of Study 2017002.

      In this study, the follow-up information gathered until the end of the investigation period
      is reviewed after obtaining informed consent from the subjects or their legal
      representatives. Accordingly, no intervention, such as administration of the investigational
      product or examination, will be performed.

      Investigative methods

        1. The investigator or subinvestigator gives an explanation to a subject or his/her legal
           representative to obtain written informed consent to provision of information pertaining
           to this study.

        2. After obtaining informed consent, the investigator or subinvestigator reviews the
           follow-up information following the completion of Study 2017002 in source documents
           regarding the following items:

      1. Survival status 2. Aggravation (progression or recurrence) 3. Drugs or procedures used for
      treatment of DLBCL or prophylaxis against its progression or recurrence 4. Occurrence of
      other malignant tumors
