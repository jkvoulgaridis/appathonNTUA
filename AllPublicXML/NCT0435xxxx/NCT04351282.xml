      Primary metastatic NPC patients received chemotherapy± immunotherapy, radiation for primary
      tumors and SBRT for metastatic lesions.

      The eligible patients will receive 4-6 cycles chemotherapy±immunotherapy and radical
      radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal tumors. Then, SBRT for oligometastatic lesions will be
      assigned to eligible patients. The efficacy and side-effect will be evaluated and analyzed.
      The relation of liquid biopsy data with treatment outcome（such as EBV DNA, CTCs, CTC
      subtype，PD-L1 and so on）will be valued.
