        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18-75 years；

          2. Primary lesion is diagnosed with endometrial biopsy as adenocarcinoma of the stomach
             or esophagogastric junction, including: papillary adenocarcinoma, tubular
             adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, poorly cohesive carcinoma (including signet
             ring cell carcinoma and other variants), mixed adenocarcinoma, etc.；

          3. Clinical stage cT1N0M0, cT1N1M0, cT2N0M0；

         10. Sufficient vital organ functions；

         11. Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Preoperative examination indicates disease stage cStage II or above；

          2. Women during pregnancy or lactation；

          3. Suffer from other malignant tumors within 5 years；

          4. Preoperative body temperature ≥ 38°C or complicated with infectious diseases requiring
             systemic treatment；

          5. Severe mental illness；

          6. Severe respiratory disease；

          7. Severe liver and kidney dysfunction；

          8. History of unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 6 months；

          9. History of cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage within 6 months；

         10. Continuous application of glucocorticoid within 1 month (except for topical
             application)；

         11. Accompanied by gastric cancer complications (bleeding, perforation, obstruction, etc.)
             ；

         12. The patient has participated in or is participating in other clinical studies (within
             6 months).
