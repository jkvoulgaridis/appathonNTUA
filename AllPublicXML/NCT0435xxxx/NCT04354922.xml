  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise intervention for depression was conventionally recommended three times
      weekly with moderate intensity in previous studies, but little is known about the training
      effect of aerobic exercise at low frequency and vigorous intensity. The purpose of this study
      is to compare the training effect of aerobic exercise at different exercising frequencies and
      intensities on older adults with comorbid insomnia and depressive symptoms. In this study, we
      will investigate two types of aerobic exercise (i.e., vigorous-intensity exercise and
      moderate-intensity exercise) under different exercising frequencies (i.e., regular exercising
      pattern and weekend warrior). Individuals with chronic insomnia and depressive symptoms will
      be recruited and randomly allocated into 5 groups: 1) attention control group (stretching
      exercise), 2) moderate intensity exercise performed thrice weekly (MIE×3/wk), 3) moderate
      intensity exercise performed once weekly (MIE×1/wk), 4) vigorous intensity exercise performed
      thrice weekly (VIE×3/wk), and 5) vigorous intensity exercise performed once weekly
      (VIE×1/wk). Intervention will be maintained for 12 weeks. Outcome assessments will be
      conducted at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the intervention. Outcomes including
      depressive status, chronic insomnia, objective sleep quality and pattern (measured by
      Actigraphy), subjective sleep quality (measured by Epworth sleepiness scale, insomnia
      severity index, PSQI), anxiety status (measured by HADS and GAD-7), quality of life (measured
      by SF-12), attention level (measured by computer attention test), exercise enjoyment
      (measured by physical activity enjoyment scale), habitual physical activity level (measured
      by IPAQ), aerobic fitness (measured by metabolic cart), body adiposity (measured by DXA),
      blood chemistry, adherence, medication usage, and adverse events will be measure in this
      study. This proposed study will provide pilot evidence for the benefits, effectiveness,
      safety, adherence, and sustainability of low-frequency vigorous aerobic exercise. We expect
      the low-frequency exercise modality will enhance the practical suitability of aerobic
      exercise and will provide evidence for weekend warrior aerobic training strategy as a new
      exercise option in the management of elderly insomnia and depression.
