    <description>Subjects' participation in the study will last 26 weeks. The study includes 7 visits that consist of a Screening visit, three treatment visits and three follow-up visits.
Eligible subjects will undergo a Baseline visit (V1 at week 0) during which, after the confirmation of eligibility, assessments and ultrasound evaluation, the study subjects will be treated with the 1st injection of 2%Hyaluronic Acid and 2% chondroitin sulfate Subsequent treatments will be administered at weekly intervals during Visit 2 (V2 at week 1) and Visit 3 (Visit 3 at week 2) after the effectiveness assessments.
Study subjects will return for Follow-up visits 1 month (Visit 4 at week 6), 3 months (Visit 5 at week 14) and 6 months (Visit 6 at week 26) after the last injection</description>
