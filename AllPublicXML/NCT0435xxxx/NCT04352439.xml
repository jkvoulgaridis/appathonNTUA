    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine the safety and efficacy of low dose aspirin for the
      prevention of venous thromboembolic events among women with advanced ovarian cancer receiving
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Subjects who are receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer
      will be recruited from the Duke Gynecology Oncology clinic at Duke Cancer Institute. After
      discussion of the risks and benefits, written informed consent will be obtained for
      initiation of prophylactic, daily low dose aspirin (81 mg) therapy. Subjects will receive
      aspirin tablets in medication vials obtained from the Duke pharmacy supply and will be
      instructed to take one tablet daily until the day of their interval debulking surgery.
      Subjects will be followed throughout the primary treatment course and monitored for the
      occurrence of venous thromboembolic events. Subjects will also be instructed to complete
      medication adherence diaries that will be reviewed by the research team. The investigators
      hypothesize that daily low dose aspirin will reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolic
      events during neoadjuvant chemotherapy when compared to a historical control.

      The incidence of venous thromboembolism among the study cohort will be calculated with an
      estimated 95% exact binomial confidence interval. A drop of greater than 20% (from 8%
      estimated in the historical control to 6.4%) in rate of venous thromboembolism would be
      considered clinically meaningful. The investigators will also monitor for adverse drug events
      related to low dose aspirin use, including major or minor bleeding events, clinically
      significant thrombocytopenia (resulting in treatment delay), and gastrointestinal
      complications. Of note, low dose aspirin for venous thromboembolism prevention is already
      considered an acceptable option for standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma
      receiving antiangiogenesis agents with chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone as well as for
      postoperative prophylaxis following some orthopedic procedures. The investigators therefore
      feel the potential benefit outweighs any clinically significant risks.
