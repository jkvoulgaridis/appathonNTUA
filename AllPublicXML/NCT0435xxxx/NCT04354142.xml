  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a common chronic disease of childhood. T1DM has
      substantial impact on quality of life (QOL), including burdensome dietary restrictions and
      the need to count carbohydrates in foods to safely dose insulin. Carbohydrate counting is
      challenging, inconvenient, and, if done wrong, can cause high or low blood glucose levels.

      To address these challenges, iSpy, a novel smartphone application, was created to identify
      foods and determine their carbohydrate content using pictures or speech. This pilot study is
      to evaluate if using iSpy improves carbohydrate counting accuracy and efficiency. Pilot
      participants will have carbohydrate counting (accuracy and efficiency) and their overall QoL
      (with respect to carbohydrate counting) assessed at baseline and after 3-months.

      The investigators hypothesize that using iSpy will make carbohydrate counting easier (by
      improving accuracy and efficiency) and enhance QoL for patients and/or their caregivers. If
      so, iSpy may help lessen the burden of living with T1DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition is an integral component of management of many chronic diseases and of overall
      wellness. Helping individuals to understand what they are eating can empower them to better
      manage their diseases. For example, the growing number of youth living with Type 1 Diabetes
      Mellitus (T1DM) struggle with carbohydrate counting, an essential and daily aspect of their
      lives, because of required reliance on memorization and numeracy skills. Effective
      carbohydrate counting has been demonstrated to improve blood glucose control, while
      inaccurate carbohydrate counting results in more variable blood glucose. Concerns related to
      carbohydrate counting accuracy can also limit food choices, provoke anxiety, and decrease
      quality of life. Since there is no cure for T1DM, enhancing patients' ability to understand
      and apply carbohydrate counting is an important part in helping them manage their condition
      most effectively.

      iSpy is a novel healthcare application that addresses an important clinical need by
      facilitating carbohydrate counting using pictures or voice recognition. Proprietary
      algorithms adjust for portion size and identify hidden carbohydrates (such as in ketchup or
      other condiments) and quantify the amount of carbohydrates in a meal.

    <measure>Carbohydrate (CHO) Counting Accuracy</measure>

    <description>Assessing CHO counting using 10 food items from all major food groups. For each group, a simple food (e.g. an apple) and complex food (e.g. food with 2+ components but base food from targeted group) is included. A Co-investigator, Registered Dietitian (RD)/Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE), selected 2 sets of 10 food items for the study visits (verified that both sets were similar difficulty).
The net CHO value (true value) for each food will be based on the nutrition label, USDA Nutrient Database (Release 28), Canadian Nutrient File, or by RD/CDE.
For each food, data will be obtained from all participants:
• Estimated net CHO (in grams)
And with the above data, the following will be calculated:
% of food for which subjects estimated the CHO content within (+/-) 10 grams of true value.
Change (%) in the above accuracy measure for counting at baseline versus 3-month follow-up visit in iSpy vs control groups.</description>
