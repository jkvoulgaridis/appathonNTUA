      -  (Cause of cholelithiasis) Recently, the average age has increased, and the occurrence of
           gallstones has increased as the dietary life has been westernized due to the improvement
           of socio-economic level. When cholesterol increases, the occurrence of gallstones
           increases. Factors include high-calorie high-fat diet, increasing age, women, pregnant
           women, obesity, and oral contraceptives. There are cases. As another cause, gallstones
           occur well even when bile stasis occurs due to a decrease in motility of the
           gallbladder. These are conditions that lower mobility. And cholelithiasis has a genetic
           tendency in about 30%. In addition, since the eating habits of the family are similar,
           the genetic factors and the eating habits overlap, which often leads to the occurrence
           of cholelithiasis in the family.

        -  (symptoms of cholelithiasis) In most cases, complaints of non-specific digestive system
           symptoms, such as abdominal bloating, nausea, and especially indigestion after fatty
           diet, are often observed. According to domestic reports, the nonspecific symptoms
           complained by patients with cholelithiasis were indigestion, flatulence, frequent
           belching, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting. In general, many healthy
           people without gallstones complain of non-specific digestive system symptoms in 50% of
           cases, and there is a possibility that functional gastrointestinal diseases such as
           dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, and gastritis may be accompanied by these digestive system
           symptoms. It is difficult to know whether it is unrelated to gallstones. Symptoms caused
           by typical cholelithiasis usually have a characteristic that they often improve on their
           own after a few hours, and the start and end of the symptoms are relatively clear and
           repeatedly occur. In addition, various symptoms are displayed depending on the presence
           or absence of inflammation and progression.

        -  (Principle of treatment of cholelithiasis)

             1. Medical treatment: Medical treatment of gallstones is a method of dissolving using
                drugs to treat cholesterol gallstones in gallbladder stones. In 1973, Nakano et al.
                [1] published the first example of dissolving cholesterol gallstones using
                ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Currently, UDCA is the only drug administered to
                patients with asymptomatic or mild symptoms of cholelithiasis in actual clinical
                practice, and there is no specific prescription drug.

             2. Surgical treatment: In the case of indications of cholecystectomy, acute
                cholecystitis, severe symptoms, chronic cholecystitis with severe thickening of the
                gallbladder wall, repeated and severe symptoms, porcelain gallbladder, Patients
                with gallstones of 3 cm or more in size, patients with anomalous pancreato-biliary
                duct unions, or gallbladder polyps.

        -  (Study on increasing gallbladder contractility) So far, there have been studies that
           some drugs increase or decrease gallbladder contractility. Catnach SM et al. [2]
           reported that erythromycin increased gallbladder contractility in patients with
           autonomic neuropathy due to diabetes. Sengupta S et al. [3] reported that indoramin
           (α-adrenergic antagonist), a prokinetic agent, increased gallbladder contractility in
           patients with cholelithiasis, resulting in a significant decrease in gallbladder volume.

      Motilitone® developed in Korea is a gastrointestinal motility stimulator that stimulates
      5-HT4 receptors to increase acetylcholine secretion and has a mechanism of contracting smooth
      muscles, improving symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia in cholelithiasis It is
      expected to be able to give, and it is thought to have the effect of preventing the
      crystallization of bile acids due to an increase in the gallbladder contractility, thereby
      preventing the formation of gallstones and preventing newly generated gallstones.

      To date, there are no special drugs for dyspepsia or pain improvement in patients with
      cholelithiasis. It is hypothesized that administration of motilitone® will increase the
      contractile capacity of the gallbladder, thereby improving digestion and preventing further
      formation of gallstones. As a control group, Gasmotin® was administered to improve functional
      dyspepsia, and the degree of symptom improvement was measured and compared by completing the
      Symptom Score Questionnaire for Indigestion between the two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Severance Hospital, patients with cholelithiasis with symptoms of indigestion are divided
      into the Motilitone® and Gasmotin® groups. Provide sufficient oral and written explanation of
      the clinical trial and obtain consent from the patient who has revealed his willingness to
      participate. Randomization uses random numbers, and patient assignment by random numbers is
      managed by a third party who does not have direct contact with the patient or clinical
      history, and after obtaining consent, the group according to the random number is given and
      medication is given. It is provided to. Each drug is prescribed for 6 months. The symptom
      score check should be completed at the first outpatient visit(3 months after administration).
      We will Check the following items through abdominal ultrasound examination 6 months after
      administration.

      : Gallbladder wall thickening presence and extent, number of gallstones, maximum diameter of
      gallstones, presence or absence of sludge. The general blood test (CBD) and general chemical
      test (SMA) are conducted three times at the first outpatient visit(3 months after
      administration), and the research expenses for 3 months and 6 months are supported by the
      research fund. In the final analysis, we compare the symptom scores between the two groups
      through the Student T-test, and compare the blood test and ultrasound using the Chi-square
      test. We want to confirm the following three things through this study. ① In patients with
      cholelithiasis with symptoms of dyspepsia, prospective data on the degree of symptom
      improvement following motilitone administration can be obtained. ② It is possible to evaluate
      the degree of relief or exacerbation of gallstones through ultrasound examination. ③ It is
      expected that it will be effective in improving symptoms and alleviating cholelithiasis in
      patients with dyspeptic cholelithiasis due to increased gallbladder contractility of
      motilitone.

    <description>The symptom score check should be completed at the first outpatient visit 3 months after administration. Nepean Dyspepsia Index- Korean version will be used to check the patient's indigestion symptoms. The questionnaire contains the following gastrointestinal symptoms How often it happened / how severe the symptoms were / how much it bothered you There are five (or six) answers. Gastrointestinal symptoms included Abdominal pain, Abdominal discomfort, Having a sour stomach, Heart burn, A Spasm of the stomach, Chest pain, Early fullness, Gastric acid reflux, Satiety after eating, pressure in the upper abdomen, Bloating of the upper abdomen, Nausea, Vomiting, Burp, Hard to breathe. The answer can be selected in 5 (6) numbers; from 0 to 4 (5). We will check the total score with the sum of each score. The symptom score is compared before and 3 months after administration.</description>
