  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite perioperative autologous donation (PAD) is widely used in healthy bone marrow (BM)
      donors to restrain the hemoglobin decrease after BM harvest, this practice is not supported
      by strong clinical evidences and has been abandoned by some transplant teams. The critical
      revision of data relative to 102 BM collection procedures performed at our center between
      2014 and 2018 failed to demonstrate an advantage of 1 over 2 PAD. Conversely, clearly emerged
      that PAD reduce the hemoglobin levels at BM harvest. Basically, PAD practice consists in the
      transfer of RBCs from the subject into a plastic bag and back to the subject at BM
      harvesting. Indeed, the evidence of clinical benefits of PAD in BM donors are still elusive.
      For this reason, current procedures on unrelated donors recommend iron and vitamin
      supplementation before the BM harvest, but let the decision to perform or not PAD at
      collection centers. Detailed data on the safety and feasibility of BM harvest procedures in
      absence of PAD have been rarely reported. The investigators collect data on BM harvest in
      healthy donors who don't have PAD collected. The investigators expect that no allogeneic
      transfusions are required and that Hb levels after collection are similar to those recorded
      in the historical cohort gathered at the same center receiving 1 or 2 PAD.

    <description>Vitamin and iron supplementation is administered one-two weeks before donation, and consist of iron supplementation (i.v. infusion of 20 mg/Kg ferric carboxymaltose in saline 100 ml), s.c. injection of 1 mg of vitamin B12 and acid folic 5 mg/die per os until day +15 post BM donation. BM collection is carried out by the transplant team and a maximal dose of 20-22 ml/Kg of the donor body weight is collected under general anesthesia (induction with fentanyl 1-3 mcg/Kg, Propofol 2-3 mg/Kg, rocuronium 0,6 mg/Kg and mantenaince with sevoflurane 0,8 MAC). Noninvasive cardiac output, blood pressure and hemoglobin monitoring are carried out during the entire procedure and in in the recovery room using the ClearSightâ„¢ system (Edwards Clinical) and the Radical Pulse co oxymeter (Masimo). After discharge from the hospital, donors will be revaluated on day + 7 after BM collection, and blood tests will be repeated in outpatient setting.</description>
