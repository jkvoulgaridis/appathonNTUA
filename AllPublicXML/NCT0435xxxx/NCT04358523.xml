    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of ASC18
      tablets（ravidasvir and sofosbuvir fixed dose combination）with ravidasvir tablets and
      sofosbuvir tablets in healthy subjects after single and multiple oral dosing.

    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, crossover study will evaluate the relative bioavailability of
      ASC18 (ravidasvir and sofosbuvir fixed dose combination) tablets as compared to ad hoc
      combination of reference tablets of ravidasvir and sofosbuvir in healthy volunteers. Subjects
      will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences to receive multiple oral doses of either
      ASC18 tablets (ravidasvir and sofosbuvir fixed Dose Combination) or ravidasvir and sofosbuvir
      as separate tablets. In the crossover design, subjects will participate in 2 study periods
      with at least a 14-day washout between periods.
