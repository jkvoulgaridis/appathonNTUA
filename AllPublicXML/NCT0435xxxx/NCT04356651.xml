    <textblock>
      The population affected by degenerative knee arthritis is very large. The investigator
      performed Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN). This experiment used a randomized single-blind
      experiment to assess the immediate, short-term and long-term effects of Fu's subcutaneous
      needling (FSN) therapy on patellar pain in patients with degenerative arthritis.

    <textblock>
      The population affected by degenerative knee arthritis is very large. According to a survey
      conducted by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the prevalence of osteoarthritis of the knee
      in Taiwan is about 3.5 million people, accounting for about 15% of the total population. Its
      effects are a heavy burden on socio-economic costs, and in addition to being included in
      medical expenses, serious cases can lead to incapacity to work; therefore, the disease is an
      important factor in causing disability and disability First, it is worth our attention.

      Floating needle is a kind of dry needle therapy, which has been used in the treatment of
      degenerative arthritis for more than 20 years. It has been clearly annotated in the treatment
      strategy that it uses disposable floating needle needles at the superficial subcutaneous
      fascia, Parallel to the muscle to sweep away, and with reperfusion activities, muscle pain
      caused by muscle fascia and soft tissue pain with immediate and good pain relief effect, but
      still lack of treatment and rigorous evaluation of the establishment.

      For the reasons of the degenerative arthritis pain, the clinical observation is not entirely
      due to the cause of joint deformity or cartilage damage, soft tissue lesions around the knee
      is also a common source of pain, the use of floating needle for the diagnosis of soft tissue
      injury , And observed its efficacy, which is also the core of this study.

      This experiment used a randomized single-blind experiment to assess the immediate, short-term
      and long-term effects of floating needle therapy on patellar pain in patients with
      degenerative arthritis. The assessment tools included the VAS, WOMAC , Lesquesne index, the
      Muscle Tension Changes in the Lower Extremities, and Gyko .

    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. This tool used to help a person rate the intensity of certain sensations and feelings, such as pain. A straight line of 100mm is actually marked with 0 mm on the far left and 100mm on the far right. Two faces are drawn on both ends. Explain to the patient that 0 mm means no pain and 100 mm means very painful. From the left end The right shift indicates more and more pain. Take a pen and let the patient draw a short line vertically on the line, representing his painful position, and record the measured cm value. In this test, if the score of the subject decreases, it can represent the treatment is helpful for the improvement of the patient's pain.</description>

    <measure>Muscle tension</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle tension is the muscle's resistance to passive stretch during resting state. The measuring tool called Myotone will calculate three parameters such as tone, elasticity and stiffness automatically and get a value to represent the muscle tension. If the value decrease, it can represent the treatment is helpful for the subjective muscle relax.</description>

    <description>In this study, physician will use a disposable Fu's subcutaneous needling(FSN) to penetrate the subject's skin from anterior superior iliac spine(ASIS) to 1/3 superior border of patella. Then the physician will push forward the needle parallel to the skin surface. The physician will sway the needle 45 times in 30 seconds. After swaying the needle, the physician will instruct the subject to do sole dorsiflexion for 10 seconds resisting the physician's opposite force, then the subject take a rest for 10 seconds. The above actions are 3 repetitions. Then the subject do knee flexion and extension for 10 seconds, and take a rest for 10 seconds. These actions are also 3 repetitions. After the above reperfusion approach of muscles, the physician will take out the needle to finish the treatment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENSor TNS) is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes. TENS, by definition, covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical battery operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width,frequency and intensity. Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (&gt;50 Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (&lt;10Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction.</description>
