      This was a Randomized control Trial. Purposive sampling was done to obtained Sample (n=78)
      which were randomly allocated to Group A (n=39) and Group B (n=39). Study was conducted from
      August 2019 to December 2019 in HBS Hospital Islamabad.To determine the effects of Qigong vs.
      Shot form Sun Style Tai Chi (SSTC) on Lung function, six min walk distance, dyspnea and
      quality of life in COPD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent respiratory
      symptoms and air-ﬂow limitation. Dyspnea is related with daily life activity. COPD patients
      often suffer from dyspnea and exacerbation, which leads to inactivity, deconditioning, and
      poor functional capacity and quality of life. Several interventions have been investigated
      with the aim of improving lung function, decreasing dyspnea symptoms and improving quality of
      life in this patient.

      Tai Chi, an exercise involving both upper and lower extremities, originated from China. Tai
      chi is characterized by posture alignment, weight shifting and circular movements that
      incorporate elements of muscle endurance and strengthening, balance, relaxation and breathing
      control. Among previous studies Tai Chi in pulmonary rehabilitation showed a modest
      complementary benefit in exercise capacity.

      The Tai Chi program is a safe, effective and feasible method to improve exercise capacity and
      health-related quality of life in people with COPD. Short form sun style Tai chi is one of
      the most common styles of t'ai chi. each form can be broken down into several movements which
      make it easy to learn and teach. Compared to some other styles of t'ai chi, SSTC involves
      less difficult movements, such as less deep-knee bending and single leg standing, which may
      make it more suitable for older people.

      Qi Gong is defined as a mind-body exercise that involves whole body movements, breathing
      techniques, postural control, and internal awareness.

      effects of Qi Gong on functional capacity and lung functions in COPD patients , and concluded
      that functional capacity, dyspnea scores and quality of life was significantly improved in
      mild to moderate COPD patients.

    <description>Changes from the baseline, 6 min walk test was used to measure Functional capacity. It is a sub maximal exercise test which can aid in assessing functional capacity of patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, in this test we find out the maximum distance in meters which an individual covers in 6 min without any support.</description>

    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, It was used to measure Dyspnea score. This scale ranges from 0 to 4 in which 0 indicates that strenuous exercise leads to breathlessness&quot; and 4 means &quot;too breathless&quot;</description>

    <description>Warm-up: In warm up session joint activities were performed along with light stretching. Patients performed these activities with instructor's commands for 5 minutes.
Liu Zi Jue exercise: patients performed intact Liu Zi Jue exercise (form of Qigong).
This includes six healing sounds, Xu, He, Hu, Si, Chui, Xi and the Harmonized actions along with the instructor for 20 minutes. Cooling-down: After completion of Qigong, patient done gentle stretching to adjust back their breathing and this cool down session lasted for 5 minutes. Subjects received supervised training session for 30 min twice a week.</description>
