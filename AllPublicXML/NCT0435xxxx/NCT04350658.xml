      The procedure is performed via transfemoral or transcaprotid access; Patients were confirmed
      to be eligible for TAVR by a multidisciplinary heart team including at least an
      interventional cardiologist, a cardiothoracic surgeon and an anesthetist. All TAVR
      implantation procedures were performed with the Edwards SAPIEN 3 THV or the MEDTRONIC
      CoreValve EVOLUT . For all patients, both vascular access and aortic valve were evaluated
      before the procedure by multislice computerized tomographic angiography (MSCT) of the entire
      aorta using vascular windows settings. The prosthesis and the vascular access were left to
      the discretion of the operating team. Transfemoral access was the first choice when possible.
      All TAVR procedures were performed in the same hybrid room (in Montpellier University
      Hospital), Most TAVR were performed under sedation or general anesthesia using mild low
      profile 14-16 French delivery systems and using percutaneous or surgical vascular access.
