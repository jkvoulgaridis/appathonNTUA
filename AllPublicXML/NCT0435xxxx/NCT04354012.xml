  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this case series is to monitor time and outcome of healing of wounds
      associated with HS using Endoform [ovine forestomach], Hydrofera Blue [methylene blue and
      gentian violet], and Hypafix tape. a combination methylene blue, gentian violet, and ovine
      forestomach wound care product.

    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory disease most
      frequently affecting the axilla, groin, and inframammary regions. Symptoms include nodules,
      abscesses, sinus tract formation, malodorous drainage, and scarring. These symptoms interfere
      with everyday activities, which can lead to social embarrassment and isolation. Patients with
      HS suffer psychological effects, such as increased levels of anxiety, depression, and
      loneliness, which impair quality of life.

      Patients suffer with the burden of at home wound care for recurrent, draining nodules.
      Persistent lesions affect patients' lives by limiting their daily activities. Currently,
      patients are instructed to use gauze and tape to cover draining wounds, but this can be
      insufficient and difficult due to the nature and location of lesions associated with HS.
      Patients suffer with caring for their wounds, which can lead to frustration. Providing
      patients with a standard wound care regimen to take home can improve patients' quality of
      life and control of their disease. General recommendations for wound care in HS patients are
      limited. Improvements in the standard of care for wound management in HS are needed to aid
      patients.

    <description>Hydrofera Blue is an antibacterial foam dressing that contains methylene blue and gentian violet to manage wounds. This is a safe, non-cytotoxic product that can be worn for 7 days while not inhibiting growth factors. This products wicks bacteria into the foam and away from the wound surface using natural negative pressure through capillary flow.
Endoform (ovine forestomach) is a natural dermal template used in all phases of wound healing. This product helps to stabilize, build, and organize tissue in acute and chronic wounds.
Hypafix tape aids in stabilization of wound dressings. This productIt is easy to apply, skin friendly, and comfortable to use.</description>
