  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elastography is a new non-invasive medical technique for measuring the stiffness at a
      distance from a tissue. Recent advances in the development of elastography sequences for
      cardiac exploration suggest a more clinical approach to cardiac elastography. This study
      propose to compare myocardial stiffness of a group of coronary bypass patients without
      hypertrophic left ventricular remodeling or sequelae of myocardial infarction versus a group
      of patients who should benefit from a surgical aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis.

      The hypothesis is that the physiological adaptation to pressure overload constituted by
      aortic stenosis is responsible for a significant increase in myocardial stiffness compared to
      a reference group.
