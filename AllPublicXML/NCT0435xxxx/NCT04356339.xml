  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to learn more about the medication usage behavior among
      multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with BETASERON using the myBETAapp. Multiple
      sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the covering called &quot;myelin&quot; around the nerves of the
      central nervous system degenerate. MS is a lifelong disease therefore requiring continuous
      treatment to delay the disease progression and reduce the rate of relapse (the return of
      signs and symptoms of). BETASERON is an approved medicine used to reduce the relapse in
      patients with MS. It is injected into the tissue under the skin using BETACONNECT
      autoinjector, which automatically captures injection data including injection date, time,
      speed, and depth and uploads the data into paired myBETAapp. This allows patients to organize
      and track their progress and share the injection information with their physicians. The
      medication usage behavior to be collected in this study includes the elements to what extent

        -  taking medication matches the presciber's recommendation (adherence, compliance),

        -  treatment for the prescribed duration (persistence) is continued and

        -  injections were missed. Among MS patients treated with Betaferon using the myBETAapp the
           study will also collect information on the health-related quality of life , treatment
           satisfaction and satisfaction with treatment support.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Persistence of therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Persistence to BETASERON using the BETACONNECT device will be measured as the number of days between the initial BETASERON administration and the earlier of the last BETASERON administration using the BETACONNECT device or before a minimum 60-day gap in therapy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to BETASERON using the BETACONNECT device is a dichotomous variable (adherent or non-adherent) defined as receiving at least 80% of the expected number of injections during 6 months of treatment (or up to the point of early termination) as captured by the BETACONNECT device.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of general health status. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), where respondents indicate their health state on each dimension based on 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems).</description>
