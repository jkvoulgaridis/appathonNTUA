    <textblock>
      The Step into Support for Endurance and Strength (SISTERS) research study is evaluating
      whether a mobile health game designed to increase physical activity is feasible and
      acceptable in patients with gynecologic cancers.

      -SISTERS is testing a mobile health intervention can help increase physical activity.
      Participants will be randomized to receive either 1) a Fitbit or 2) a Fitbit + a game + help
      from a friend or family member whom you chose will help the participant reach their goals.
      (i.e. a Teammate).

      This study is a two-arm randomized controlled pilot study designed to test the feasibility
      and acceptability of using a wearable accelerometer (Fitbit) vs. a wearable accelerometer
      (FItbit) + a game designed to help participants increase physical activity + social support
      improves participants' average daily step counts.

      Eligible Participants will be randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups

        1. Fitbit (wearable accelerometer) or

        2. Fitbit (wearable accelerometer) + game + help from a self-selected teammate

      The study interventions involved in this research are:

        -  Surveys/Interviews

        -  Fitbits (also known as a wearable accelerometers or fitness trackers)

        -  Actigraph GT9X Link (a research grade accelerometer)

        -  Way to Health Platform

        -  Help from a Teammate (i.e. a friend or family member that participants choose to help
           them reach their goals)

      It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.

    <description>After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study. Participants randomized into Fitbit + Game + Support from a Teammate.
Participants will select a step goal, use a Fitbit to track daily activity, and select a teammate (e.g. family member or friend) who they think will help them achieve their goals.
Participants will participate a 3-month game designed to increase activity and then followed for another 1.5 months to see if their increased activity can be maintained without the game.
