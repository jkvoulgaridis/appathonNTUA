  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of Atomoxetine, a selective
      noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, on impulsivity in patients with Tourette's syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High impulsivity characterizes severe forms of Tourette's syndrome, in which motor and vocal
      tics are associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders as compulsive disorders,
      difficult to manage and impairing quality of life of patients and their family. Previous
      preclinical study and clinical studies in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and
      Parkinson's disease demonstrate that atomoxetine, a selective noradrenaline reuptake
      inhibitor, improves response inhibition in high impulsive individuals. However, there is no
      suffisant data in Tourette's syndrome. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the
      effects of Atomoxetine on impulsivity in 10 to 35 years old patients with Tourette's
      syndrome.

    <description>The secondary outcomes are the effects of Atomoxetine in cognition, anxiety, depression, severity of tics and compulsive disorders, as mesured with autoquestionnaries. The investigators also evaluate the tolerance of chronic administration of atomoxetine in patients with Tourette's syndrome.</description>
