  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, 12 million children in Sub-Saharan Africa and 1.9 million children in South Africa
      (SA) are orphaned by HIV/AIDS. Research addressing what can be done to support these children
      has been limited, clustered and of variable quality. Our prior work showed that an important
      support structure for care of HIV affected children (orphans) in SA is through Community
      Based Organizations (CBOs). Currently, no evidence-based CBO intervention exist. CBO
      careworkers report low efficacy in addressing the mental health and cognitive developmental
      needs of children. There is therefore a critical need to empower frontline CBO careworkers to
      be trained in addressing the mental health and cognitive developmental needs of orphans. The
      Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers (MISC) used in our previous work with
      parents in Uganda holds promise. The objective in this application is to use a mixed methods
      approach (observations, focus groups, questionnaires) to test the acceptability and
      feasibility of adapting MISC to be used by CBO careworkers instead of parents (MISC-CBO), and
      to assess preliminary outcomes. Guided by the Mathews and Hudson's framework for evaluating
      caregiver-child training programs, our approach will consist of three phases: Adapt, Process
      evaluation, Outcome evaluation. In Phase 1 (Adapt, Year 1) we will conduct formative research
      (qualitative interviews and focus groups) with community stakeholders, a Community Advisory
      Board and children to ascertain feasibility and acceptability of MISC-CBO in the SA cultural
      context with 7-11 year old AIDS orphans. In Phase 2 (Implementation and process evaluation,
      Year 2) we will recruit 80 AIDS orphans through 4 CBOs (20 children and 4 careworkers from
      each CBO). Two CBOs will be allocated to MISC-CBO and 2 will be allocated to treatment as
      usual (TAU of comparable contact hours). One year of bi-weekly (every 2 weeks) intervention
      sessions will be conducted. Process evaluation will include individual interviews,
      observations, focus groups and questionnaire-based assessment of MISC-CBO feasibility,
      adherence and fidelity. In Phase 3 (Outcomes assessment, Years 2 &amp; 3) the effects of MISC-CBO
      to promote mental health and cognitive development through the mechanism of improved quality
      of caregiving by CBO careworkers will be assessed through mental health and cognitive
      assessments at baseline (beginning of Year 2), 6, 12 and 18 months compared to TAU in the
      children and careworkers recruited in Phase 2. At the end of this formative RO1 that
      transforms a parent intervention into a CBO careworker intervention, we will have established
      the foundational assessments and intervention to apply for an RO1 to evaluate a randomized
      controlled trial designed to fully test the efficacy of MISC-CBO during the critical
      developmental window of at-risk HIV affected children aging into adolescence. This project
      will make possible the only culture-appropriate and sustainable evidence-based CBO
      intervention that can be readily and effectively implemented globally in low-resource
      settings with children generally at risk from disease, malnutrition and neglect.

      Currently, 12 million children in Sub-Saharan Africa and 1.9 million children in South Africa
      (SA) are orphaned by HIV/AIDS1. Research addressing what can be done to support these
      children has been limited, clustered and of variable quality2. Our prior work in SA (PI:
      Sharp; R01 MH078757) showed that an important care support structure for orphans is through
      Community Based Organizations (CBOs). Currently, no evidence-based CBO interventions exist.
      Moreover, CBO careworkers report a desire to learn how to address the mental health and
      cognitive developmental needs of children3. There is a critical need to empower frontline CBO
      careworkers to be trained in how to respond to the mental health and cognitive developmental
      needs of orphans. The Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers (MISC)4-6 used in
      our previous work (PI: Boivin; R34 MH082663; RO1 HD070723) with parents in Uganda holds
      promise. The objective of this application is to use a mixed methods approach to test the
      acceptability and feasibility of adapting MISC for CBOs (MISC-CBO), and to assess preliminary
      outcomes. Guided by the Mathews and Hudson's framework for evaluating caregiver-child
      training programs7, our approach will consist of three phases: Adapt, Process Evaluation,
      Outcome Evaluation. Our central hypothesis is that feasibility and acceptability of MISC-CBO
      will be established and that positive preliminary outcomes will be demonstrated.

      Aim 1: Adapt MISC to establish acceptability of MISC-CBO (Yr 1). We will conduct formative
      research (qualitative interviews and focus groups) with community stakeholders, a Community
      Advisory Board (CAB) and children to ascertain feasibility and acceptability of MISC-CBO with
      7-11 year olds affected by HIV/AIDS in SA. Hyp1: Formative work will result in an adaptation
      of MISC that is deemed acceptable.

      Aim 2: Implementation and process evaluation of MISC-CBO to establish feasibility, adherence
      and fidelity (Yr 2). We will recruit N = 80 HIV/AIDS orphans through 4 CBOs (i.e. 20
      children, 4 careworkers and CBO director from each CBO). Two CBOs will be allocated to
      MISC-CBO while the other 2 will be allocated to treatment as usual (TAU of comparable contact
      hours). After initial training, one year of bi-weekly (every 2 weeks) intervention sessions
      of MISC-CBO and TAU will be conducted. Process evaluation will include individual interviews,
      observations, focus groups and questionnaire-based assessment of feasibility of the
      intervention perceived by CBO careworkers, directors and children themselves. MISC-CBO
      adherence and fidelity will be assessed. Hyp2: CBO careworkers and directors will readily and
      reliably participate in bi-weekly MISC-CBO training and evaluation. Hyp3: Qualitative
      interviews will show that CBO careworkers and directors support the goals and affordability
      of MISC-CBO. Hyp4: Video footage and questionnaire data will show fidelity to MISC-CBO in
      terms of content and caregiving adherence.

      Aim 3: Outcomes evaluation of MISC-CBO (Yrs 2 &amp; 3). The effects of MISC-CBO on mental health
      and cognitive development through the mechanism of improved quality of CBO caregiving will be
      assessed through assessments at baseline (the beginning of Yr 2), 6, 12 and 18 months
      compared to TAU in the children and careworkers recruited in Aim 2. Hyp5: MISC-CBO
      careworkers will have significantly more positive interactions with study children compared
      with TAU careworkers. Hyp6: Children in MISC-CBO will show reduction in symptoms of emotional
      and behavior problems and increased behaviors indicative of positive emotional outcomes as
      determined by observations and questionnaire data. Hyp7: Children in MISC-CBO's cognitive
      ability tests scores will improve. Hyp8: The cognitive and mental health gains for children
      will be statistically mediated by improved caregiving quality and increased knowledge of MISC
      principles in MISC-CBO workers.

      Overall impact. This is a small-scale, developmental 3-year RO1 that builds on our
      established US-SA-NIH partnerships (Sharp, Marais, Skinner, Serekoane) to develop an expanded
      research team (adding MISC experts Boivin and Klein), and create a CAB to assist in the
      adaptation of MISC for CBOs. Our proposed research is in line with the NIH priorities as well
      as UNICEF's goal of strengthening the capacities of communities, and fits with our long-term
      research goal to address the mental health needs of HIV/AIDS affected children. At the end of
      this formative study, we will have established the foundational assessments and intervention
      to apply for an RO1 to evaluate a randomized controlled trial designed to fully test the
      efficacy of MISC-CBO during the critical developmental window of at-risk HIV affected
      children aging into adolescence. This project will make possible the only culture-appropriate
      and sustainable evidence-based CBO intervention that can be readily and effectively
      implemented globally in low-resource settings with children generally at risk from disease,
      malnutrition and neglect.

    <measure>Change in Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) Total Score as index of improvement in overall mental health in children</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months follow-up, 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 2001) is a well validated measure of mental health in children. While the measure covers several domains of emotional-behavioral psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, conduct problems, peer problems and prosocial behavior), it is most often summed to derive a total score to index overall level of mental health problems in children. The use of this measure in this way has been validated in a Sesotho speaking population of children where it was shown that the total score provides a good index of mental health problems in HIV/AIDS affected children (Sharp et al., 2014). This measure has also been shown to be sensitive to change and therefore serves as a good outcome measure to assess overall improvement in mental health as a function of our behavioral intervention.</description>

    <measure>Change in Observed Mediational Interactions (OMI; Klein, 1996) score in the caregiver's capacity to Focus the child.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months follow-up, 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The OMI is an observational measure of caregiver-child interactions. Interactions between caregiver and child are video-recorded and the components of a mediated learning experience is then coded using the OMI coding manual. Mediated learning components include two sets of measurements: cognitive and affective components. The cognitive components include the following subscale: Focusing, Providing meaning, Expanding, Regulating, and Rewarding. The Focusing subscale assesses the caregiver's capacity to focus the child's attention on a topic or object. It is the first step in providing a mediational learning experience for a child and one of the outcomes that the MISC intervention targets. The OMI tallies each instance when Focusing occurs during a 7-minute video-taped interaction. This is the unit of measurement for the OMI Focusing outcome that will be assessed here. An example of a behavior that is coded as Focusing is: &quot;Look here!&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT) overall IQ composite</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months follow-up, 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT) (Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2004) is a brief, individually administered measure of verbal (vocabulary subtest) and non verbal (Matrices subtest) intelligence. It can be used with those aged 4-90 years old and takes between 15-30 minutes to administer. The KBIT-2 generates three scores: Verbal, Non Verbal and an overall IQ composite. Theoretically the verbal subtests measure crystallised ability and the non verbal subtests measure fluid reasoning. The KBIT has been used successfully in South Africa (Ogunlade, A.O., et al.2011) and neuropsychologist and Co-Investigator Boivin has been using it in Johannesburg in yet unpublished work with the relevant population for the current research. The overall IQ composite will be used to assess change in cognitive outcomes as a function of the MISC intervention.</description>

    <measure>Change in Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) Global Executive Composite score to assess change in executive functions as a function of the intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months follow-up, 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-) (Gioia et al., 2003) is useful for evaluating and planning treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of developmental and acquired neurological conditions, including learning disabilities, low birth weight, ADHD, Tourette's disorder, traumatic brain injury, and autism. These scales include the behavior/cognitive functions of Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, and Monitor. Given this focus, the BRIEF will complement, rather than overlap with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire used for more general mental health problems. The eight non-overlapping clinical scales form two broader indexes: Behavior Regulation (three scales) and Metacognition (five scales). A Global Executive Composite score is also produced. This is our principal outcome measure from this assessment. A Sesotho version of the measure was obtained through the publisher.</description>
