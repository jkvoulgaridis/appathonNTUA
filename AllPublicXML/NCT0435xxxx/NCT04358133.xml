  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a pharmacological intervention to relieve dyspnea in intensive care unit
      patients. Indeed, opioids can be particularly beneficial since 1) dyspnea and pain share many
      similarities, 2) the benefit of opioids on dyspnea has been clearly demonstrated in other
      populations. However, to date, data regarding the impact of morphine on dyspnea in intensive
      care unit patients admitted for acute respiratory failure are scarce. There may be a
      reluctance of physicians to prescribe opioids that is not scientifically justified.

      The study will focus on patient reported outcome (PRO) criteria. The ultimate goal of this
      pilot study is to design the protocol of a future pragmatic trial.

      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center phase 2 pilot
      study.The experimental group will receive an intravenous titration of morphine followed by a
      subcutaneous administration of morphine hydrochloride for 24 hours according to a predefined
      protocol. The control group will receive placebo NaCl 0.9% administered according to the same
      protocol as the experimental arm Patients will be randomized 1:1 between low-dose titrated
      morphine (experimental group) and placebo (control group). The other treatments will be
      similar in both groups, according to the protocol and the recommendations.

      Severe dyspnea will be assessed for regularly Patients will be followed for 48 hours: 24-hour
      treatment duration, evaluation of primary endpoint for first 24 hours, collection of adverse
      events for 48 hours.
