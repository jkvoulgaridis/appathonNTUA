  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will use a pre-post design to explore the utility of using virtual
      simulations to provide participant education and counseling for adopting healthy lifestyle
      behaviors (i.e., physical activity, nutrition, smoking, alcohol use, and anxiety/distress
      screening) to 60 participants with chronic diseases where lifestyle management is paramount
      to well-being and disease control (e.g., cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis). Participants will have access to the
      simulations through a unique password-protected link over the course of one month.
      Participants will complete two study visits that are 30-60 minutes in duration each. There is
      also one optional telephone interview with a mental health professional. The telephone
      interview it estimated to be 10 minutes in duration and will be audiotapes, with
      participants' permission. The study surveys will be administrated at baseline, immediately
      following the simulation use and at one-month baseline measures. The measures will assess
      lifestyle behaviors related to healthy eating, physical activity, emotional health, smoking
      behaviors and alcohol use. Measures will also assess the psycho-social constructs of
      intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy. Finally, the usability of and satisfaction with the
      simulations will be explored through feedback surveys. The investigator will also seek
      permission to collect data from the patient's medical chart. Feedback will also be collected
      from four healthcare providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the pilot study is to assess the acceptability and potential efficacy
      of the participant education simulation on changes in participants with chronic diseases'
      lifestyle behaviors as well as motivation and self-efficacy to change.

      The primary objective is to examine the acceptability (satisfaction, usability) of using
      virtual simulations to deliver participant education and counseling for adopting healthy
      lifestyle behaviors among a sample of four healthcare providers and 60 participants with
      chronic disease. The secondary objectives include examining changes in lifestyle behaviors
      (e.g., healthy eating, physical activity) one-month following the use of the participant
      education simulations in a sample of 60 participants with chronic disease (e.g. cancer,
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, arthritis) and to explore the potential mediators
      (e.g. motivation and self-efficacy) of the simulation effects on the changes in participants'
      lifestyle behaviors.

      Participants will communicate with a virtual human, Linda, by selecting from a dynamic menu
      of dialogue options. Once the learner chooses a dialogue option, they see the virtual human
      respond by providing personalized feedback and give users an opportunity to revise their
      choice. In this study, the simulations will be a bundle of four topic-based conversations
      with Linda, which include fitness and nutrition, smoking cessation, alcohol use, distress and
      anxiety.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 years or older;

          2. Have a diagnosis of a chronic disease (e.g., osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease,
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and
             congestive heart failure) as indicated by self-report or review of the electronic
             medical record; and

          3. Receiving care within the NYU Langone Health Network (e.g., Faculty Group Practices
             and ambulatory care centers, NYU Winthrop Surgical Associates)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are unable to give informed consent

          2. Refuse to participate

          3. Any active terminal illness, mental incompetence, or uncontrolled psychiatric illness.
             These exclusions were based on the premise that the presence of any of these
             conditions would dominate the subject's perception of lifestyle management of their
             chronic disease.

          4. Unable to speak and read in English. Patients that are unable to speak and read in
             English will be excluded from the proposed project because the simulations are being
             developed in English only. Once we demonstrate the initial efficacy of this tool,
             future simulations will be developed in languages other than English. Despite the
             language restrictions, no exclusion will be made based on patient racial/ethnic
             origin.
