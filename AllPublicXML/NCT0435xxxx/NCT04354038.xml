  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations (CF PEx) vary greatly in their severity, their
      pathogens, and their treatment responses. A failure to return to baseline lung function after
      treatment may be due to persistent infection or chronic inflammation or both. This constant
      infection and inflammation are believed to be tightly connected, making it difficult to know
      the exact reason why some patients fail to respond to treatment. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate both infection and inflammation during CF PEx to allow for more personalized
      approaches to improve lung function responses and better CF PEx outcomes. Subjects will be
      asked to be in the study if they have CF, are 18 years of age or older, and are starting on
      IV antibiotics due to worsening lung infection. Subjects will stay in the study for up to 5
      years, with visits occurring once a year if hospitalized for a CF PEx. Each visit will have
      blood, sputum, and urine collected and analyzed for changes in expression of certain genes
      and proteins. These changes may relate to improvements felt by people living with CF and
      determine what treatments are most helpful.
