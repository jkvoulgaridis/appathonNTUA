      The objective of the study is to assess the impact of remote cardiac and vital sign
      monitoring in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the outpatient setting. This
      study will enroll COVID-19 positive patients previously evaluated at Mount Sinai
      Hospital/Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) and affiliated hospitals deemed appropriate for
      home monitoring. Patients will be monitored remotely in the outpatient setting for 1-3 weeks
      following diagnosis and/or treatment for COVID-19 at MSH/MSHS.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a non-randomized study. Based on clinical assessment, patients will be provided with the following home monitoring system: VitalConnect Vital Sign Patch (San Jose, California) This patch provides continuous real-time monitoring of cardiac telemetry, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. Duration of monitoring is typically up to 7 days.
This patch is applied to the upper left side of the chest wall, attached with a hypoallergenic adhesive material. (This device is FDA approved for this indication).</intervention_model_description>
