      Objective: To test the effectiveness of a collagen-based treatment for patients complaining
      of long standing facial nerve axonotmesis, who are following a proprioceptive neuromuscular
      facilitation protocol (Kabat method), compared to a group only undergoing the Kabat method.

      Methods: Patients undergoing both procedures will be compared, after randomization, to
      matched patients undergoing only Kabat procedure after 8 weeks of treatment. The outcomes
      will be electromyographic findings, validated questionnaires (Facial Disability Index, FDI)
      and clinical grading (House-Brackmann, HB). A correlation analysis will be performed between
      pre-/post-treatment diﬀerences (Δ) in outcome and clinical-demographic measures.

    <description>An electromyography coaxial needle examination will be performed on the orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris to evaluate the electrical alteration of these muscles. These muscles will be examined at rest and during voluntary activity in terms of msec of duration of voluntary activity</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial asymmetry</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Static and dynamic facial asymmetry will be evaluated and manually tested on the muscle strength of the frontalis, corrugator, orbicularis oculi, zigomaticus, caninus, platysma and orbicularis oris muscles. These clinical findings will be classified and recorded according to the House-Brackmann (HB) scale, ranging from 1 (normal) to 6 (severe dysfunction).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective facial disability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Facial Disability Index (FDI) is a 10-item self-administered questionnaire with 2 subscale scores: 5 items concern the physical function subscale, and 5 items concern the social/well-being function subscale. Each item is rated on a 6-point scale, ranging from severe disability to absence of disability. Both subscales are transformed to a score on a 100 point scale, with 100 indicating unimpaired physical or social/wellbeing function. All questions referred to the preceding month.</description>

    <description>The Kabat procedure consists of facilitating the voluntary response of an impaired muscle through a global pattern of an entire muscular section which undergoes resistance. This method considers that harmony, coordination and optimal strength of body movements mainly depend upon the fact that they are performed following diagonal lines with respect to the sagittal axis of the body, thus implying a 'rotational' effect. It will performed twice a week for 8 weeks</description>

    <description>With an insulin-type syringe and 30-gauge needle, a bolus of about 0.4 cc per point of the collagen solution will be injected in the orbicularis oculi muscle 1 cm outside the orbital rim and 0.5 cm superior and inferior to the first injection point, respectively, and in the orbicularis oris muscle, where the 2 injection points are on the border between the pars peripheralis and pars marginalis, located about 5 mm above the superior and inferior vermilion, respectively</description>
