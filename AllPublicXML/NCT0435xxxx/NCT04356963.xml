  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe and refractory pain after acute injury is a known-risk factor for chronic opioid use
      disorder. Headaches associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often severe and
      refractory. In this study, the investigators will use Virtual Reality (VR) immersion as a
      non-pharmacological adjunct to treat headache associated with acute TBI. The investigators
      hypothesize that VR therapy will decrease pain and reduce opioid use in patients with acute
      TBI.

      Each participant will undergo one VR session and two control sessions. The VR session will
      take place in a VR environment developed in our own Shock Trauma Blended Reality Center and
      last 20-30 minutes. The environment is based upon literature reviews on chromotherapy. The
      control sessions will include a 2D-tablet based session that mimics the VR content and a
      content-less placement of the VR headset. The order of these sessions will be randomized
      across patients.

      Each participant will complete a pre-study questionnaire to elicit their prior experience
      with the virtual reality as well as measures of gaming addiction/engagement, boredom, and
      expectancy. These scales will help us determine which patient-level factors predict response
      to VR. Before and after each session, participants will complete validated scales of pain,
      nausea, and anxiety.. Pre- and Post-VR opioid use will be recorded. Basic vital signs
      including heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, will be recorded before and after
      each session to monitor autonomic response. Advanced measures of autonomic response will
      include heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, and pupillometry metrics. At the
      conclusion of all sessions, participants will complete another questionnaire to document
      their subjective experience of using VR.
