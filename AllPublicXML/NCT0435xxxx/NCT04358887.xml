      This study will compare the effect of piezo Vs bur on quality of life and healing after
      endodontic surgery.

    <textblock>
      The goal of endodontic surgery has changed from mere reduction of periapical pathosis and
      preservation of periodontium to successful postoperative management of patient regarding
      function and esthetics, improving the quality of life of patient and their overall
      acceptance. Piezoelectric bone surgery is a recent and innovative technology, permitting
      selective cutting of mineralized tissues sparing soft tissues.In this study after thorough
      clinical &amp; radiographic examination patients will be given informed consent after explaining
      the treatment procedure and its associated risks and benefits. Patients are allocated into 2
      groups, group 1(piezo group) in which after flap reflection bone cutting and root end cutting
      are performed with US6 piezoelectric insert and in group 2(control) bone and root end cutting
      are performed with conventional bur. Each patient will be given a questionnaire to fill out
      for each day starting from the day of surgery for 7 days postoperatively to assess the
      quality of life. They will be also requested to note down the details of analgesic intake.
      Hemorrhage control during surgery will be assesed. Clinical and radiographic examinations
      will be performed every 3, 6 and 12 months to evaluate any evidence of signs and/or symptoms
      and after 12 month follow up post operative CBCT taken to evaluate volume reduction of lesion
      postoperatively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with no general medical contra-indications for oral surgical procedures
             (ASA-1 or ASA-2).

          2. Patients of age 16 years and above.

          3. The tooth to be treated surgically should have a periradicular lesion of strictly
             endodontic origin (chronic apical periodontitis).

          4. The nonsurgical re-treatment was judged unfeasible or had previously failed.

          5. The tooth had an adequate final restoration with no clinical evidence of coronal
             leakage.

          6. The apical area of the root canal should be devoid of the presence of a post for at
             least 6 mm.

          7. Patients with no acute symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unrestorable tooth.

          2. Fractured / perforated tooth.

          3. Apicomarginal defects.

          4. Through &amp; through lesions.

          5. Teeth with deep pockets.

          6. Serious medical illness(uncontrolled/poorly controlled diabetes, unstable or life
             threatening conditions or requiring antibiotic prophylaxis).
