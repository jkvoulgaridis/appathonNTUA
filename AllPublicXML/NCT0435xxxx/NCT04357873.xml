      Open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, basket phase II trial, evaluating the efficacy of
      pembrolizumab in combination with vorinostat in adult patients with recurrent and/or
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of different locations.

      Antitumor activity of the combination will be evaluated using the objective response rate
      (ORR) during treatment (investigator assessment).
