  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently about 90 cases of infection in children are reported every year in pediatric
      intensive care, a disease considered to be the main cause of hospitalization of children. 16%
      of invasive pneumococcal infections are linked to a genetic abnormality in immunity. Herpetic
      encephalitis has become a model of genetic infectious disease, with new mutations identified
      in the TLR3 pathway. Severe infections are no longer the result of chance and can be the way
      to reveal a primary immune deficiency. In this context, the investigators propose to evaluate
      the incidence of hereditary immune deficiency after a systematic immunological screening in
      children admitted for a severe infection in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe infection requiring admission in intensive care unit (ICU) are not so rare. A
      retrospective pilot study conducted at Montpellier University Hospital Center (UHC) between
      2013 and 2015 showed that 19.7% of the pediatric ICU admissions were related to a severe
      infection. An isolated severe infectious episode could be related to a hereditary immune
      deficiency (HID), even though there are no history of recurrent clinical signs and biological
      stigmata. For example, Gaschignard and colleagues considered that 16% of the invasive
      pneumococcal infections are related to a genetic defect of immunity (doi:
      10.1093/cid/ciu274). Growing evidence has shown that severe infectious diseases occurring in
      childhood are attributed to inborn errors of immunity (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1521651112). While
      the nosology of severe infections has strong links to inherited immune deficiency that are
      rare diseases affecting less than 1 birth / 5000, there are no prospective studies that
      assessed the incidence of primary immune deficiencies in children who presented a severe
      infection.
