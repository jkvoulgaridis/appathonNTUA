  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled phase III clinical study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus oxaliplatin and capecitabine versus oxaliplatin plus
      capecitabine in the treatment of gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with
      postoperative pathological stage IIIB and IIIC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2019, CSCO guidelines grade I recommend gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma patients, after D2 R0 resection, whose postoperative pathological stage was
      III treated with XELOX as an adjuvant chemotherapy. However, some retrospective clinical
      studies in China suggest that the 3-year DFS rate of XELOX program as an adjuvant
      postoperative chemotherapy program is still low, and the risk of recurrence is higher for
      patients with postoperative pathological stage IIIB/IIIC.In recent years, the success of the
      JACCRO GC-07 trial has provided evidence for the value of Taxoids in postoperative adjuvant
      therapy of gastric cancer. In the FLOT4 trial, the FLOT improved the DFS rate by 3 years
      compared with the ECF/ECX. At present, there is no clinical study data to prove whether the
      combined three-drug regimen can further reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence and
      improve the treatment effect compared with oxaliplatin combined capecitabine two-drug regimen
      for patients with high postoperative recurrence risk (patients with postoperative
      pathological stage IIIB/IIIC). Therefore, the investigators carried out this trial.
