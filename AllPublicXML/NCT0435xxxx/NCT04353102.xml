  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of the study drug YH002. The study is designed
      to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase
      2 dose (RP2D) of YH002 in patients with advanced solid Malignancies
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm clinical trial in subjects with advanced solid tumor receiving multiple
      doses of YH002 intravenously (IV). YH002 will be administered (IV) in 6-48 patients with
      advanced solid tumors. An accelerated titration method followed by a traditional 3+3 dose
      escalation algorithm will be utilized to determine MTD/MAD. Patients will be dosed at Dose A,
      Dose B, Dose C, Dose D, Dose E, Dose F, Dose G, and Dose H every 3 weeks (Q3W).
