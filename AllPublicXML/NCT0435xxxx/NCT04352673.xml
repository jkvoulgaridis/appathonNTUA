  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to investigate the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of elbow
      strength measurement procedures performed in different body postures and shoulder and elbow
      positions using a hand-held dynamometer in healthy individuals and to determine SEM and MDC
      values for these procedures.

      Healthy university students aged 18 years and older will be included in the study. Elbow
      flexion and extension strength will be measured in both arms in different body postures and
      shoulder and elbow positions using a hand-held dynamometer. Thus, the reliability of these
      procedures will be investigated, and the standard error of the measurement and the minimum
      detectable change will be determined. Strength measurements will be performed by two
      physiotherapists on each arm of the participants and repeated between 3 - 7 days after the
      measurement to evaluate both intra-rater and inter-rater reliability.

      3 different positions will be used for elbow flexion:

        1. Participants sit on a stool, and their arms are at the side with the elbow flexed 90°
           (forearm in supination).

        2. Participants sit on a stool, and their shoulder and elbow are flexed to 90° (forearm in
           supination) and supported on the treatment table.

        3. Participants lie supine and place their shoulders on neutral position and elbow flexed
           90° (forearm in supination).

      3 different positions will be used for elbow extension:

        1. Participants sit on a stool, and their shoulder and elbow are flexed to 90° (forearm in
           supination) and supported on the treatment table.

        2. Participants lie supine and place their shoulders on neutral position and elbow flexed
           90° (forearm in supination).

        3. Participants lie prone, and their shoulders аre placed at 90° abduction and elbows
           flexed to 90°.
