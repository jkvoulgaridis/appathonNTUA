  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhoea is described as painful menstrual periods among women who have normal
      pelvic anatomy and causes physical and psychological health to be affected with hormonal
      changes as well as some symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue and stress. Studies done
      report that women use individual methods (massage, analgesics, herbal teas, hot application
      -applying heat-, bed rest -lying in bed-, etc.) in order to cope with primary dysmenorrhoea
      and prefer family members as the first information source and therefore, it is emphasized
      that it is necessary to undertake studies that will prove efficacy of these
      non-pharmacological coping methods. Therefore, the study was experimentally done among
      students with primary dysmenorrhoea to assess the effect of massage and progressive
      relaxation exercises upon pain intensity and menstrual symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is described as suprapubic pelvis pains with cramps that begin a
      couple hours before menstrual bleeding or after menstrual bleeding or last 12-72 hours and
      occur repeatedly without organic pathology. According to De Sanctis et al. (2015), PD
      prevalence varies between 16% and 93%. PD is generally seen with sweating, fatigue,
      gastrointestinal system signs and central nerve system signs. These symptoms occurring just
      before or just after menstrual bleeding may prevent these women from attending school and
      work and joining social activities.

      In literature, there are studies that state that PD can be cured using such complementary
      therapies as essential oil acids, vitamins, acupuncture, herbal medicines, aromatherapy,
      reflexology, acupressure, massage, sport and exercise. In PD management, it is estimated that
      giving massage together with progressive relaxation exercises (PRE) will be beneficial.
      Massage intensifies blood flow in the site where it is applied and reduces muscle strain.
      Besides, it also elevates endorphin secretion and increases pain threshold. Relaxation
      exercises produce a decline in sympathetic activity, a rise in parasympathetic activity and
      as a result, a reduce in heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, oxygen requirement,
      dilatation in peripheral veins, a rise of blood flow in blood arteries and a reduction in
      muscle strain, pain or pain perception and a better sleep quality. In addition, thanks to
      deep breathing techniques performed with PRE sympathetic nerve system activity reduces; as a
      result of which pain, anxiety and depressive symptoms decrease, too.

      In literature, there are no studies where massage and PRE have been used together in PD
      management. In this sense, the study was planned to examine the effect of massage and PRE
      used together with massage upon pain intensity and menstrual symptoms in the management of
      PD.

    <intervention_model_description>The study was done experimentally in pre-test and post-test design and randomized controlled model among students with PD.
The sample size was calculated with power analysis. According to calculations, it was found that 58 students were enough for sampling through 95% of power value, 0.05 of confidence interval and 0.88 of effect size. Students who were determined to meet sampling and inclusion criteria through questionnaire and accepted to participate in the study were assigned into the experimental and control groups through randomization.
During the follow-up of the three menstruation periods, the number of groups was increased in case of drop-out and 100 students were included. However, the study was completed with a total of 97 students -50 students for the experimental group and 47 students for the control group- because 3 students of the control group withdrew from the study in the second month.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>By the experimental group in each menstrual period for 3 consecutive months: both the exercises and massage techniques were daily performed three times a day after pain had started and relaxation exercises lasted 30 minutes whereas massage was performed for 15 minutes and after that the form is filled in.
Without any application by the control group the form is filled in after pain start.
In the form, pain quality is determined with 15 descriptors that describe sensory (first 11) and affective pain (last 4). Dimension of pain is evaluated to demonstrate the intensity by using a rating of 0-3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Pain quality scores of sensory pain (0-33 score), of affective pain (0-12 score) and of total (0- 45 score) are obtained. A rise in total pain quality score indicates a rise in pain sensory. In the study in order to provide an overall intensity score; Visual analog scale is included in the scale. Visual analog scale suggests general pain intensity.</description>

Without any application by the control group &quot;Daily Symptom Rating Scale&quot; form is filled in after menstrual symptoms start.
In the scale that includes 17 symptoms, each symptom is scored according to its intensity with a five point rating between 0 and 5. An increase in scores indicates high intensity of the symptoms.</description>

    <description>Students in the experimental group were taught about massage and progressive relaxation exercises (PRE). The phases of the massage and PRE trainings were first explained by being demonstrated by the author on herself. In the meantime, the trainings were video-taped and uploaded to the mobile phones of the students. After the author, each student was made to perform massage and PRE. Both the exercises and massage techniques were daily performed 3 times a day after pain had started and relaxation exercises lasted 30 minutes whereas massage was performed for 15 minutes consecutively</description>
