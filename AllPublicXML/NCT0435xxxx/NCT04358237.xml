  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled and multicenter phase I/II study of PM01183
      in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

      The study will be divided into two stages:

        -  A dose-ranging phase I stage with escalating doses of PM01183 in combination with a
           fixed dose of pembrolizumab, followed by:

        -  A non-randomized phase II stage as an expansion study at the recommended dose (RD)
           determined during the phase I stage.

      The phase I stage will focus on the selection of the RD based on safety/tolerability, while
      the phase II stage will assess the overall response rate (ORR) and clinical response.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      • During the phase I stage, patients will start receiving pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of
      200 mg as a 30-min intravenous (IV) infusion followed by PM01183 at a starting dose of 2.4
      mg/m2 as a 1-h IV infusion on Day 1, both every 3 weeks (Q3W). A cycle is defined as an
      interval of 3 weeks.

      PM01183 dose will be escalated from the starting dose in successive cohorts of patients, with
      a pre-established fixed dose increase (in mg/m2) of approximately 30%.

      Dose escalation will follow a classical 3+3 design, according to the observed tolerance and
      safety. All evaluable patients within a dose level will be followed for at least one cycle
      (i.e., 3 weeks) before dose escalation may proceed. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be
      the lowest dose level explored during dose escalation at which one third or more of evaluable
      patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1.

      Dose escalation will be terminated once the MTD or the last dose level (i.e., DL2) is
      reached, whichever occurs first, except if all DLTs occurring at a given dose level are
      related to neutropenia. If this is the case, dose escalation may be resumed, starting at the
      lowest dose level at which exclusively neutropenia-related DLTs were observed, and will
      follow the same original schedule but with mandatory primary granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis.

      An expansion cohort to complete a minimum of 6 evaluable patients will be recruited at the
      immediate lower dose level from the MTD, or at DL2 if the MTD is not defined yet. This level
      will be confirmed as the RD if less than one third of the first 6 evaluable patients
      experience DLT during Cycle 1. Intermediate dose levels could be tested upon agreement of the
      Scientific Steering Committee members, as defined in Section 8.4, if deemed appropriate. This
      will also be discussed with Pharma Mar and MSD.

      • During the phase II stage, patients will receive pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of 200 mg as
      a 30-min IV infusion followed by PM01183 as a 1-h IV infusion on Day 1 Q3W at the RD
      determined during the phase I stage. A cycle is defined as an interval of 3 weeks. No dose
      escalation will be allowed during the phase II stage.

      Regardless of stage, patients will receive PM01183 in combination with pembrolizumab until
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal or if it is not considered in their
      best interest to continue, after specific agreement between the Investigators and the Sponsor
      (this will also be discussed with Pharma Mar and MSD). Maximum treatment period with
      pembrolizumab is 35 dose administrations (approximately 2 years). After 35 dose
      administrations, patients might continue on treatment with lurbinectedin alone.

      Radiological tumor assessments will be done every 6 weeks (± 2 weeks), or prior to every
      second subsequent cycle, while on treatment. After treatment discontinuation, patients will
      be followed until resolution or stabilization of all toxicities, if any. Patients
      discontinuing treatment without disease progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria In
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 will be followed every 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) until disease
      progression as per RECIST 1.1, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, death or the end-of-study
      date (clinical cutoff, as described in Section 2.1.1), whichever occurs first. After one year
      of follow-up, patients will be evaluated every 9 weeks (± 2 weeks) until the end of the
      study.

      After disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 or start of a new anti-cancer therapy, patients
      will be followed up for survival every 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) until death or the end-of-study
      date, whichever occurs first (a phone contact will be acceptable). An exception will be those
      patients who are clinically stable at the time of disease progression as per RECIST 1.1, who
      could remain on treatment according to the Investigator's criteria up to the next
      radiological assessment. If no disease progression as per immune RECIST (iRECIST) 1.1 is
      observed in this assessment, treatment will continue until disease progression as per iRECIST
      1.1.

      If at the end of the study (i.e., clinical cut-off, as defined in Section 2.1.1) any patients
      are still on treatment with lurbinectedin monotherapy, the investigator will evaluate if it
      is appropriate that they continue receiving that treatment. If needed, the Sponsor may
      facilitate appropriate measures to ensure access to lurbinectedin and maintenance of safety
      reporting obligations beyond study closure in those cases. According to the end of study
      definition (see Section 2.1.1), no patients will remain under treatment with pembrolizumab at
      the clinical cut-off.

      Safety will be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v.5, whereas antitumor response will be assessed using the RECIST
      1.1, and also the iRECIST 1.1 whenever applicable. These methods are generally accepted as
      standard clinical procedures in oncological studies.

             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment
             within the past 5 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ (e.g., breast carcinoma,
             cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not
             excluded.

          -  Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to
             first dose of study treatment. Brain CT-scan or MRI results must be provided at
             baseline.

          -  Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab, lubinectedin and/or any of
             their excipients.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment. Exception: patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood
             asthma/atopy; patients who require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local
             steroid injections; and patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjögren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          -  Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA is detected)
             infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required unless
             mandated by local health authority.

          -  Has a known history of active tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis).

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of trial treatment.
