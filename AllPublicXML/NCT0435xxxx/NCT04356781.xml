  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CIDP and MMN are part of a group of chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the
      peripheral nervous system. In CIDP, there is chronic inflammation of the peripheral nerves
      and nerve roots leading to demyelination. The myelin sheath is vital in the rapid propagation
      of nerve impulses between the central nervous system and the peripheral sensory receptors and
      muscles. By definition CIDP must progress over 8 or more weeks and can either have a slowly
      progressive disease course or a relapsing course with periods of improvement. Patients
      typically present with a non-length dependent neuropathy that affects motor (i.e. weakness of
      proximal or distal muscles, fatigue, swallowing difficulty, double vision, breathing
      difficulties etc) and sensory function.

      MMN is a similar condition to CIDP. It is an autoimmune demyelinating neuropathy that leads
      to slowly progressive asymmetrical weakness that worsens over years without treatment.

      IVIg is a recognised treatment for CIDP and MMN. A standard starting dose of 2 g/kg/course,
      spread over 2-5 days, has been widely used in both research and clinical practice. Due to the
      chronic nature of CIDP and MMN, most patients with these conditions require repeated doses to
      avoid relapse, but the frequency of courses and the total dose of IVIg per course required to
      achieve a steady state varies between patients. Given the modest risks involved with IVIg and
      its cost, the lowest possible dose and frequency of administration are preferred. Current
      strategies to reduce dose and frequency involve assessing clinical response to lower doses,
      but this is both time consuming and imprecise.

      The study is designed to slot into normal clinical care, with some extra blood tests
      performed at times patients would already be attending hospital. An extra blood test is
      desired 1 week following initial IVIg treatment which would require an extra visit, but this
      is an optional part of the study.

        1. Identification of suitable participant: patient with CIDP or MMN for whom treatment with
           IVIg has been decided upon by their treating neurologist.

        2. Provision of information leaflet and taking of consent. Blood test for Immunoglobulins
           (Igs), FBC, U&amp;E, LFT and ESR will be taken before initial treatment with 2 g/kg IVIg;
           this is all part of usual care.

        3. 5-30 min following final infusion of first course of IVIg, a blood test for Igs, FBC,
           U&amp;E, LFT and ESR will be taken.

        4. If the patient is willing to make an extra visit 7 days after day 1 of IVIg treatment,
           they will attend for further Igs, FBC, U&amp;E, LFT and ESR.

        5. When the patient attends at 2 weeks for post-IVIg assessment as part of usual care, a
           blood test for Igs, FBC, U&amp;E, LFT and ESR will be measured again.

        6. Usual process of IVIg treatment optimisation will then occur (as practised at the Walton
           Centre). This is part of usual care, with determination of IVIg dosing interval
           following clinical optimisation by dose suspension, followed by restabilisation and
           subsequent dose reductions to determine minimum effective dose.

        7. At the 3rd consecutive infusion of IVIg at the minimum effective dose, a pre-IVIg
           (trough) level of Igs will be taken for the minimum effective IgG level alongside FBC,
           U&amp;E, LFT and ESR.

        8. Statistical analysis looking for correlations between the initial ∆IgG values and the
           final dose and dosing interval of IVIg will be undertaken.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary research objective is to look for a link between ∆IgG levels in the blood of patients with CIDP and MMN following initial IVIg treatment and the ultimate dose required based on clinical response.
Other blood tests performed at the time of the IgG level include FBC, U&amp;E, LFT and ESR (a measure of plasma viscosity) and will allow a look at the effect of IVIg on these parameters. This could provide clarity as there is much variation in practice as to how often routine blood tests such as FBC, U&amp;E and LFT should be performed in IVIg patients, due to concerns that in some patients there may be biochemical side effects of IVIg treatment. Plasma viscosity may give an indication of risk of thrombotic side effects with IVIg and lead to guidance about, for example, when it is safe to fly after IVIg treatment. Clinical response to treatment will also be recorded</description>
