    <textblock>
      An open label study to assess the safety, tolerability, and effects of intranasal Ketamine in
      combination with rTMS for patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD).
      Patients will be given a dose of ketamine followed by 6 weeks of rTMS treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigate the effects of pretreatment using a single, sub-anesthetic dose of intranasal
      ketamine on the response to a standard course of rTMS in patients who meet the definition of
      TRD.
