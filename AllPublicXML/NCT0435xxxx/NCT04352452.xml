  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monocentric trial to evaluate differences in musculoskeletal and cognitive stress of
      robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) vs. conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS).
      Demographic and personal data are collected and pseudonymized as well as video recordings are
      performed during surgery. Simultaneously, surface electromyography (EMG) and
      electrocardiography (ECG), motion tracking data are collected. Additionally, saliva cortisol,
      perceived discomfort and mental load will be assessed within certain time intervals. The
      surgeon is not disturbed in his activity and movement by the equipment.

      Afterwards, the surgeon will be interviewed in a 15-minute standardized interview about the
      surgery process and the subjective stress sensitivity. Only routine interventions will be
      recorded, in case of unforeseen complications, the recording will be stopped immediately
