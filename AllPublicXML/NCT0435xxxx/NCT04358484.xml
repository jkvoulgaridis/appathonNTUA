  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) usually present coexisting problems in emotion
      and behavior regulation, similarly as premature children with communication or socialization
      difficulties. Caring for children with neurodevelopmental difficulties is an important
      stressor for parents. Therefore, it is essential that families are offered evidence-based
      interventions at an early stage within the public health service. Group therapy is a
      cost-effective intervention that can help parents of children diagnosed with autism and those
      born prematurely. The Incredible Years - ASLD program is an example of this sort of therapy,
      consisting of a group intervention for parents of preschool children with a diagnosis of ASD
      or Language Delay. In Spain, group interventions for children with ASD and preterm children
      presenting with Language Delay are scarce in the public health service. The Incredible Years
      - ASLD program has not been translated into Spanish and it has not been previously
      implemented in our country.

      The Incredible Years - ASLD group intervention will be carried out in three public Healthcare
      centers. It is intended to recruit 72 patients diagnosed with ASD or premature children with
      communication or socialization difficulties, which will be randomized to an Intervention
      Group or to Treatment as Usual (TAU) Group. The Intervention Group will receive fourteen
      sessions of the Incredible Years - ASLD program in addition to Treatment as Usual (TAU). In
      terms of clinical implications, this randomized pilot study could demonstrate the feasibility
      of implementing this intervention in the regular clinical settings within the Spanish public
      health service and could be a first step for future controlled studies that demonstrate its
      effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving social
      communication disturbances and a restricted pattern of interests, present before age 3.
      Premature infants are at particular risk for neurodevelopmental disturbances, such as
      language delay, difficulties in social communication and ASD.

      ASD is often associated with behavior difficulties, emotion regulation difficulties,
      psychiatric comorbidities and a dysfunctional response to sensory stimuli. Children with
      premature birth also present difficulties related to emotion and behavior regulation.

      Due to these difficulties, caring for children with neurodevelopmental disorders can be very
      stressful for parents, which could in turn lead to lower effectiveness of interventions and
      greater mental health difficulties in parents.

      Therefore, parenting interventions should not only address children's difficulties, these
      interventions should also aim to provide support for parents. Since no interventions have
      specifically addressed these two aspects in the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders,
      several therapies have been adapted for this population. This is the case of the intervention
      at hand: Incredible Years - ASD and Language Delay (IY-ASLD).

      In this intervention, in addition to learning strategies to promote the development of skills
      in children, parents receive support from other parents and from the therapists. The
      effectiveness of the Incredible Years program has been widely demonstrated in multiple
      randomized clinical trials, showing an improvement in terms of parental stress levels,
      depression and parental coping, as well as in children behavior difficulties. Incredible
      Years is also considered an evidence-based intervention according to the NICE guidelines.

      The Incredible Years Program has been adapted for parents of children between ages 2 and 5
      diagnosed with ASD, presenting ASD symptoms or language delay. A pilot study conducted in the
      UK has demonstrated high levels of acceptability, as well as a decrease in levels of parental
      stress associated with the care of their children. The results of a pilot randomized clinical
      trial in Wales have been recently published, supporting the feasibility of this intervention
      in the NHS and showing good levels of acceptability and fidelity to the program and
      compliance. The Incredible Years - ASLD Program has not been implemented in Spain and to the
      best of our knowledge it has not been used with parents of children of premature birth with
      communication and socialization difficulties.

      This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of reliably implementing the IY-ASLD parental
      program in different outpatient services of the Spanish public health service, as well as
      exploring its effectiveness in terms of reducing parental distress and improving children
      outcomes.

      The IY - ASLD program will be implemented in three sites across Spain: Hospital Sant Joan de
      Déu Barcelona (HSJD), Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (HGUGM) and Hospital
      Materno Infantil (HMI) de Málaga. In the first site the program will be implemented with
      parents of premature children with communication and socialization impairment, and in the
      other two sites the program will be applied with parents of children diagnosed with ASD. The
      IY-ASLD program consists of 14 weekly group sessions for parents of children between 2-5
      years of age. The sessions will be conducted by a therapist and a co-therapist, both trained
      in the program. A total of n = 72 parents (48 with ASD children and 24 with premature
      children) will be recruited and will be randomized to a control group (36 parents: 24 with
      ASD children and 12 with premature children) or group intervention (36 parents: 24 with ASD
      children and 12 with premature children).

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be recruited from three different sites across Spain: HSJD Barcelona, HGUGM Madrid and HMI Málaga. The first site will recruit parents of premature children and the other two sites will recruit parents of children diagnosed with ASD. Participants who meet inclusion criteria and sign the informed consent will complete a pre-intervention assessment. Families will be randomized to the intervention arm or to the treatment as usual (TAU) group, using stratified randomization regarding cognitive level. Those in the intervention arm will attend the IY-ASLD program and those in the TAU group will continue to receive usual care in their healthcare centers. After the IY-ASLD is finished, participants in both groups will complete a post-intervention assessment.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The IY - ASLD Program consists of 14 weekly group sessions for parents of children between 2-5 years of age with symptoms or a diagnosis of ASD or delayed language acquisition. The program will be conducted by a therapist and a co-therapist, trained in the model.
Fidelity to the intervention will be assessed in accordance with the regulations of the program. All of the therapists and co-therapists will be trained in the intervention by accredited trainers. The three main therapists will be supervised by accredited supervisors of the IY Program, seeking accreditation in the intervention. As the intervention IY - ASLD has not been translated into Spanish, the English materials will be used with simultaneous translation into Spanish language.</description>
