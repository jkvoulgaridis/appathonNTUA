  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the differences in cognitive function between healthy older adults,
      older adults with mild Alzheimer's type dementia and older adults with Parkinson's disease
      and if there are differences in valence assessment and activation that produce them a mood
      induction task. Subjects are assessed using neuropsychological tests and then a mood
      induction task based on movie clips is applied.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different neuropsychological tests will be used to assess the differences in cognitive
      function in the different groups, whose scores are expected to be lower in the group of older
      adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and older adults with Parkinson's disease (PD).

      After studying the cognitive function in the different groups, we proceed to check through a
      task based on movie clips if there are also differences in the valence assessment
      (liking/disliking depending on the emotion induced by scenes from different films) and
      activation (excitement caused by each one of the movie scenes), hoping to find differences
      for the negative emotions taking into account the cognitive difficulties that both (the EA
      group and the EP group) may have for processing this type of cognitively more demanding
      information; instead, it is possible that the positivity effect continues to affect these
      patients so that for positive emotions there are no differences between the different groups.
