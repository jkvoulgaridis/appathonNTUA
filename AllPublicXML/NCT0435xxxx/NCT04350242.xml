    <textblock>
      Epidemiology, a word derived from the Greek epi (on) demos (people), is a scientific
      discipline in the area of medicine that studies the distribution, frequency and determining
      factors of chemical diseases in defined human populations. It is the method of problem
      solving research used by epidemiologists, scientists, statisticians, doctors, and other
      health professionals to get to the root of health problems in a community. Beyond the
      important role of descriptive epidemiology in generating etiological hypotheses, it also
      provides a description of the frequency and / or patterns of disease occurrence at the
      individual or social level.

      In the field of medicine and physiotherapy, epidemiological studies of musculoskeletal
      injuries acquire great relevance considering that they are the main cause of disability,
      increasing their prevalence year after year and carrying high economic and social costs.
      Worldwide, the Epidemiology of musculoskeletal pathologies has been reported in both the
      general population and specific populations.

      Despite the fact that kinesiology has been an established profession in Argentina since the
      1940s, there is an evident lack of scientific information on this discipline. Currently,
      epidemiological reports of published musculoskeletal pathologies are scarce in our country.
      To our knowledge, the characteristics of the population of patients with musculoskeletal
      injuries who attend a private sports kinesiology office are not known. A study of these
      characteristics could help to better understand this population, improving routine clinical
      practice, as well as providing a database for the development of future scientific studies.

      For this reason, the main objective of this study is to describe the characteristics of the
      patients who come to an external kinesiology office at a private institution in Argentina.
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the relationship between the body mass index (BMI) and
      the affected body regions.

      Design Variables related to injury Analytical, cross-sectional and retrospective study will
      be recorded. Population Those patients who attended a private physiotherapy center in the
      Autonomous City of Buenos Aires between January 2017 and December 2019 were consecutively
      included. Those cases in which the affected body region was not recorded were excluded.

      Given the characteristics of the study, the signing of the informed consent by the patients
      was not required.

      Process The information used for the analysis was collected during the first session in an
      evaluation form, prepared by kinesiologists belonging to the institution and used since
      January 2017. All the professionals who participated in the study had a prior period of
      theoretical training in the use of the file and the registration of the data. The information
      of each patient was collected by kinesiologists from this institution and posted on a
      Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet from which the corresponding analyzes were performed.

      Sociodemographic variables The following variables will be recorded: sex, age, weight,
      height, body mass index (BMI), laterality, main sport, smoking, hours of rest and quality of
      self-perceived sleep (good, fair or poor).

      The following variables: affected body region, type of injury, duration and form of onset of
      symptoms (acute without apparent reason, acute by specific event, gradual without apparent
      reason and gradual by specific event).

      Statistic analysis Categorical variables are reported as presentation number and percentage.
      Continuous variables that assume a symmetric distribution are reported as mean ± standard
      deviation, while those with asymmetric distribution as median and interquartile range (RIC
      25-75). A univariate analysis was used to search for the association between BMI and
      probability of injury. The R Markdown program was used for data analysis.
