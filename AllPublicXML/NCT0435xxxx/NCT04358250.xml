  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale of the study is to evaluate through a prospective randomized controlled study if a
      modified direct superior posterolateral approach (sperimental approach) to the hip
      articulation which entirely spares i.e. avoids the sacrifice of the fascia lata might elicit
      a better outcome in terms of gait, balance, strengths recovery, clinical performance, patient
      reported outcome measurement (Short Form-12(SF-12); Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome
      Score (HOOS)) and overall recovery time in patients undergoing TotalHipArthroplasty with the
      aid of dedicated, modified instrumentation in order to properly access this modified route.

      The investigators expect an improvement on selected gait analysis parameters in sperimental
      approach in order of 2% of range of motion (ROM) recorded 1 month after surgery. Based on
      this assumption sample size calculation will be conducted.

    <description>BESTest (Balance Evaluation System Test) that evaluate the risk of fall . Each patient will be asked to wear a belt and two gloves containing the magnetic sensors and to follow the OAK device instruction.The portable device detects, on real time, the position and the orientation of each sensor. It yields a point-score from 0 to 24 and it has been shown that the relative optimal cut-off point was a 16 point-score out of 24: a point score between 17 and 24 classifies a subject as low risk who would otherwise be classified as being at medium/high risk (the duration will be approximately 10 minutes)</description>

Fibers of gluteus will be separated and not incised.posterior capsulotomy is performed,;femur is dislocated and neck osteotomy carried out, followed by preparation of femoral canal with progressive broach. Acetabulum is prepared with burs of increasing diameter, and acetabular cup is impacted. A polyethylene insert and a femoral rasp are subsequently introduced.All remaining definitive implants can be positioned.</description>
