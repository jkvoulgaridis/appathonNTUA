  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II trial investigating the combination
      of thoracic radiotherapy plus Durvalumab in patients with locally advanced, unresectable
      NSCLC (stage III) that are unfit for chemotherapy (e.g. due to age and/or frailty).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial investigates the feasibility and treatment efficacy when combining durvalumab
      treatment with either conventionally fractionated (CON-group) or hypofractionated thoracic
      radiotherapy (HYPO-group) in previously untreated NSCLC stage III patients prone to
      radiotherapy only.

      A safety lead-in phase with stop-and-go design will precede full enrollment into the
      HYPO-group.

      Tumor tissue as well as blood and stool samples will be collected for future biomarker
      analysis.

      It is hypothesized that TRT combined with concurrent durvalumab administration in patients
      with unresectable stage III NSCLC, who are not amenable to sequential radio-/chemotherapy

        1. is safe and feasible,

        2. will improve treatment efficacy by a synergistic effect of checkpoint inhibition and the
           photon-induction of immunostimulatory pathways.

        3. will have an effect on the immunological characteristics of the tumor, the
           microenvironment, and the systemic immune response, such as upregulation of PD-L1 or
           secretion of stimulatory cytokines and recruitment and priming of immunocompetent cells,
           which might then mediate the &quot;abscopal effect&quot; beyond the irradiated targets.

          9. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders ( including
             diverticulitis [with the exception of diverticulosis], celiac disease, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, Sarcoidosis, or Wegener's syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis,
             Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis). The following are

               -  Patients without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only
                  after consultation with the study physician.

         10. Active, uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease [e.g. ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
             disease]. Patients in stable remission for more than 1 year may be included.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable
             angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease,
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written
             informed consent.

         12. History of another primary malignancy except for:

               -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥ 5
