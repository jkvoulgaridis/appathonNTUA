  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality of life has recently appeared as a component of health. Pregnancy has an impact on
      the quality of life of the parturient, whether through physical or psychological changes.

      It is common to think that quality of life is altered in the context of a twin pregnancy, but
      this has never been scientifically demonstrated.

      The hypothesis is to observe a decrease in the quality of life of pregnant women with twins
      at the end of pregnancy, in particular in case of a pregnancy-related pathology.
