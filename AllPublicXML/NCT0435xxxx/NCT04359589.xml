      Background: Acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are a kind of diseases
      with high incidence, rapid progression, poor prognosis and high mortality and disability rate
      of the circulatory system, mainly including acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemic
      stroke and acute limb ischemia, which place a heavy burden on individuals, families and
      society due to their severe prognosis and high medical costs. At present, the diagnosis and
      treatment of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases mainly focus on single
      organ diagnosis and treatment of target organs, lacking of indicators to comprehensively
      evaluate the body's pathophysiology. As ischemic disease of the circulatory system, ischemic
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases have common pathophysiological basis such as
      ischemia, hypoxia and inflammation. These common pathophysiological basis suggests that
      different acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases can be monitored and
      evaluated from an integrated perspective, it suggests the possibility of comprehensive
      diagnosis, evaluation and treatment guidance. At present, the &quot;circulatory integration&quot;
      therapy represented by the combined treatment of heart and brain has achieved certain
      results, but there is no corresponding evaluation system to provide accurate guidance.
      Therefore, with the concept of &quot;circulation integration&quot;, it is an urgent problem to find the
      common indicators of the circulation system and construct the hierarchical diagnosis and
      subsequent evaluation system of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular integration. The
      development of efficient and comprehensive stratified diagnosis and prognosis evaluation
      system is of great significance in clinical, market and social aspects.

      At the early stage of the efforts our team, it was found that Dan Shen Su-(±)-3,
      4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DSS) could be detected in the plasma and urine of patients with
      acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke through metabolomics. It has been proved that
      it can be generated by the transformation of dihydroxyphenylalanine by proteus mirabilis, and
      its structure is consistent with the water-soluble component of salvia miltiorrhiza, which is
      related to the body's states of ischemia, hypoxia and inflammation. The findings provide a
      material basis for the &quot;circulatory integration&quot; assessment of acute ischemic cardiovascular
      and cerebrovascular diseases.

      Objectives: This study aims at acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,
      with the concept of &quot;circulatory integration&quot;, to build a hierarchical diagnosis and
      prognosis evaluation system with DSS as the core, in order to improve the diagnosis rate and
      cure rate, improve the prognosis and reduce mortality of ischemic cardiovascular diseases.

      Methods: The project included 500 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 300 patients
      with acute ischemic stroke, 300 patients with acute lower limb ischemia, and 200 healthy
      controls in the Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, Peoples R
      China. Plasma and urine were collected during the disease process. Various relevant clinical
      indicators including DSS level were included, COX model was applied to analyze the influence
      of multiple factors on the prognosis of the above diseases, and the indicators were screened
      and the integrated stratified diagnosis and prognosis evaluation system of acute ischemic
      cardio-cerebrovascular system with DSS as the core were established. The newly established
      integrated stratified diagnosis and prognosis assessment system was used to evaluate 200
      patients with each of the three diseases, and the sensitivity and specificity of the new
      assessment system were tested. And a simple, rapid and accurate method for detecting DSS was
      developed.

      The experiments as follows:

      Experiment 1. Observe the dynamic changes of DSS level in acute ischemic cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular diseases of different severity.

        1. Research object Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) group: 500 patients with AMI; Acute
           ischemic stroke group: 300 patients with acute ischemic stroke; Acute lower limb
           ischemia group: 300 subjects with acute lower limb ischemia; Control group: 200 healthy
           volunteers were included as controls. All the subjects were from the first and second
           affiliated hospitals of the Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Shaanxi Provincial
           People's Hospital;

        2. Collecting indicators Peripheral blood and morning urine were collected from the
           patients and the volunteers after admission on the first, second, third and seventh days
           for DSS detection. The investigators collected several demographics, clinical and
           analytical parameters. Age, gender, height and weight were recorded, and body mass index
           (kg/m2) was calculated. Blood pressure (BP) was measured three times or more by a nurse
           while patients were seated after 5 min of rest. Several parameters, including myocardial
           enzyme, serum uric acid, total cholesterol, total triglycerides low density
           lipoprotein-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, estimated glomerular
           filtration rate and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured. The patient was
           included in all the clinical data after admission and as the admission diagnosis,
           including: medical history (including risk factors), physical examination, laboratory
           examination, imaging examination, nursing report, records of interventional operation
           and all the indicators of in-hospital examination.

        3. Analyze the regularity curve of DSS level in disease DSS levels of blood and urine were
           detected by gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In the disease progression of
           patients with AMI, acute ischemic stroke and acute lower limb ischemia, the difference
           of DSS production was analyzed, and the regular curve of the dynamic change process of
           ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases was plotted based on the normal
           control group.

      Experiment 2. To establish an assessment system of &quot;circulatory integration&quot; for acute
      ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases with DSS as the core.

        1. The Clinical outcomes on follow up Adverse events (survival outcome) were observed and
           recorded in the hospital and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Major adverse
           events mainly include disease recurrence, cardiac death and all-cause death. The time of
           recurrence, complication or death, type of complication and cause of death were recorded
           in detail.

        2. Establish a diagnosis and treatment evaluation system Blood and urine DSS levels were
           measured by GC-MS. COX regression model analysis, including DSS level, basic
           information, risk factors, symptoms, physical examination, laboratory tests, image
           examination and electrocardiogram, assess the influence of various factors on major
           adverse events in patients with acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
           diseases and the prognosis of three diseases. Moreover, these indicators were used to
           build a scoring system, and analyze its correlation with prognosis.

      Experiment 3. To verify the &quot;circulatory integration&quot; diagnosis and treatment evaluation
      system of acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases with DSS as the core

        1. Research Object AMI group: 200 patients with AMI; Acute ischemic stroke group: 200
           patients with acute ischemic stroke; Acute lower limb ischemia group: 200 subjects with
           acute lower limb ischemia; All these subjects were from the first and second affiliated
           hospitals of the Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital;

        2. Collecting Indicators Peripheral blood and morning urine were collected and measured.

        3. Follow up and record the outcome The major adverse events were observed and recorded in
           the same way as in the above-mentioned experiment.

        4. Verify the diagnosis and treatment evaluation system The newly established &quot;circulatory
           integration&quot; diagnosis and treatment evaluation system of acute ischemic cardiovascular
           and cerebrovascular diseases with DSS as the core was used to predict the prognosis of
           the newly included 600 patients with acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
           diseases. This paper analyzes the specificity and sensitivity of the newly built
           &quot;circular integration&quot; diagnosis and treatment evaluation system through its disease
           evaluation and actual adverse events.
