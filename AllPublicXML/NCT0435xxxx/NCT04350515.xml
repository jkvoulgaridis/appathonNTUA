  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This experimental, anonymous labor study aims to examine how experiences of social exclusion
      influence individuals in their fairness-behaviour, psychophysical reactions, and emotion
      regulation depending on their extent of bitterness. Points given for fairness reasons, just
      world belief, rejection sensitivity, well-being, cognitive emotion regulation strategies, and
      heart rate variability (HRV) are measured and analyzed using structural equation modeling and
      multiple regression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Embitterment is defined as an emotional response due to an event which is subjectively
      perceived as unjust. Nonetheless, there is little empiric evidence of unjust behaviour by
      others in the interpersonal context that triggers embitterment reactions. Ostracism, is an
      act where a person is excluded from a social environment without any reasons. This
      experimental labor study examines how the experiences of this form of social exclusion
      influences individuals depending on their self-evaluated embitterment. That is,
      fairness-behaviour is assessed as well as changes in hearth rate variability.

    <measure>Points for Fairness</measure>
    <time_frame>After the second Cyberball intervention (exclusion of the subject or the avatar), at approx. 30 minutes from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Asked after the second Cyberball game session. Each participant will be asked, how many of their &quot;earned&quot; points (from the first Cyberball round) they are willing to compensate for fairness reasons towards the group. This is assessed by a Likert scale ranging from 0 - 14; giving zero points it the least one can give, 14 is the maximum.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Heart Rate Variability (HRV; RMSSD) from baseline (t0)</measure>
    <time_frame>After approx. 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 minutes from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Heart Rate Variability (RMSSDs) are assessed using the hardware of BIOPAC Systems. The extraction and analysis of the RMSSDs are performed with Kubios HRV premium (software).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Belief in a Just World</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline questionnaires at the beginning of the experiment.</time_frame>
    <description>Belief in a Just World is assessed using the german version of the &quot;Beliefs in a just world questionnaire&quot; (Dalbert, Montada, &amp; Schmitt, 1987). It contains six items, ranging from 1-6, whereas lower numbers indicate a lower belief in a just/rightful world and vice versa.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rejection Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline questionnaires at the beginning of the experiment.</time_frame>
    <description>Rejection Sensitivity is assessed using the german version of the &quot;Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire&quot; (Feldman &amp; Downey, 1994) - based on 18 items describe interpersonal interactions, where the subject has to ask someone to do something for him or her, further how much distress these interactions would provoke and the other person would decline the request. Each item can be answered on a Likert-Scale from 1-6, whereas lower numbers indicate less personal distress and expected rejection by the interacting person when being in that particular scenario. Higher Numbers indicate more distress from the scenario as well as the more is a rejection expected.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Emotion Regulation (Strategies) - Basic</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline questionnaires at the beginning of the experiment.</time_frame>
    <description>Emotion Regulation are assessed using the german version of the &quot;Emotion Regulation Questionnaire&quot; (ERQ; Gross &amp; John, 2003; Abler &amp; Kessler, 2011). This questionnaire assesses basic tendencies of the two strategies &quot;reappraisal&quot; and/or &quot;Suppression&quot; with regards to emotion regulation. It has 10 items which can be answered based on a Likert-Scale ranging from 1 - 7. The higher the number the more the person tends to use this particular strategy and vice versa.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Emotion Regulation (Strategies) - Specific</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline questionnaires at the beginning of the experiment.</time_frame>
    <description>Specific Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies are assessed using the german version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ; Garnefski, Kraaij &amp; Spinhoven, 2001). This questionnaire assesses nine dimensions of cognitive coping styles (e.g. &quot;other-blame&quot;) in response to distress. It contains 36 items which can be answered on a Likert-Scale ranging from &quot;(almost) never&quot; (0) to &quot;(almost) every time&quot; (4). Higher number indicate the higher the tendency of usage of the specific strategy and vice versa.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mindfulness Experiences</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline questionnaires at the beginning of the experiment.</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness Experiences is assessed using the Comprehensive Mindfulness Scale (CHIME; Bergomi, Tschacher, &amp; Kupper, 2014). It assesses different aspects of mindfulness experiences in daily life based on 37 items, ranging from 0 - 5. Higher number indicate the higher the awareness towards the particular experience and vice versa.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in subject's well-being - overall</measure>
    <time_frame>After 15, 20, 30, 45, and 50 minutes from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall subjective well-being is assessed by asking the participant five times &quot;How do you feel right now?&quot; The subject can answer by the use of a bipolar scale (-2 &quot;very bad&quot;, 0 &quot;neutral&quot;, +2 &quot;very good&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in subject's well-being - specific</measure>
    <time_frame>After the mindfulness task (50 minutes) from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Specific subjective well-being is assessed the &quot;Mehrdimensionale Befindlichkeitsfragebogen&quot; (MDBF; Steyer, Notz, Schwenkmezger, &amp; Michael Eid, 1997). This questionnaire contains 24 items and measures on three bipolar dimensions (mood, vigilance, and distress) present mental state. Answers can be made on a Likert-Scale ranging from &quot;absolutely not&quot; (-2) till &quot;very much&quot; (+2). The lower the number the worse the mood, or the weariness, or the distress, depending on the dimension, and vice versa.</description>
