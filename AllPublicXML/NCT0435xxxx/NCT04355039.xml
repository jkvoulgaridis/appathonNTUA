    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, open-label phase Ib study aimed at determining a
      recommended phase II dose of INCB053914 and pomalidomide with dexamethasone. The trial will
      follow a 3 + 3 phase I dose-escalation design.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center phase I clinical study aimed at determining the
      maximum-tolerated dose and safety of INCB053914 (pan-PIM kinase inhibitor) and pomalidomide
      with dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. Three
      candidate dose levels of INCB053914, 50 mg, 65 mg, and 80 mg twice daily will be considered.

      The research team will utilize a 3+3 design to determine a safe dose of INCB053914 combined
      with fixed doses of pomalidomide (4 mg Days 1- Days 21) and dexamethasone (40 mg Days 1, 8,
      15, 22).

      The first three patients will be treated with INCB053914 twice daily at a dose of 50 mg.

      Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment during the first 28-day cycle will be the basis for
      maximum-tolerated dose assessment.
