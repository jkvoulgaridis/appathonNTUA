  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective study investigating clinically and radiologically the effectiveness of the use
      of a combined hard and soft tissue graft retrieved from the maxillary tuberosity and designed
      for alveolar ridge preservation following tooth extraction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for a single mono-rooted tooth extraction are included in the study. After
      atraumatic extraction, sockets are filled with a &quot;one-piece&quot; dual tissue graft harvested from
      the tuberosity using an adjusted trephine. CBCTs are performed before the extraction and 4
      months after ridge preservation, to analyze the vertical and horizontal alterations of the
      ridge, using 'ITK-Snap' software.

      Clinical measurements of both soft and hard tissues are also assessed during the extraction
      and implant placement.
