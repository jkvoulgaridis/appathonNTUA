  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab-based therapy works in treating patients
      with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with kidney failure. Daratumumab-based therapy includes
      daratumumab, bortezomib, dexamethasone, and thalidomide or lenalidomide. Daratumumab is a
      monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.
      Bortezomib is a drug that prevents myeloma cells from getting rid of their waste products,
      leading to being targeted for death. Dexamethasone is a steroid that is commonly used, either
      alone or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide and
      thalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking the growth of new blood
      vessels necessary for tumor growth. Giving daratumumab, bortezomib, dexamethasone, and
      thalidomide or lenalidomide may be a good way to treat patients with newly diagnosed multiple
      myeloma with kidney failure.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients with newly diagnosed myeloma and acute kidney
      injury (AKI) who have renal function recovery following 2 cycles (6 weeks) of treatment with
      a daratumumab-based induction regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate at the end of 2 and 4 cycles of therapy. II. Adverse event profile
      of the combination in patients with AKI. III. Pharmacokinetic parameters of maximum
      concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), time to maximum concentration (tmax),
      clearance, and half life (t1/2) of daratumumab in combination treatment in the AKI
      population.

      IV. Global assessment of renal function at cycle initiation including creatinine clearance
      (CrCl).

      V. Timeline of changes in pharmacodynamic markers of light chains, urine paraprotein, and
      serum paraprotein measures.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) weekly of cycles 1-3 and on day 1 only of
      cycle 4, bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and dexamethasone IV or
      orally (PO) on days 1-4 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-4 and PO on days 8 and 15 of all
      cycles. Beginning cycle 2, patients may also receive lenalidomide PO daily on days 1-14 or
      thalidomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone up to but no more than 10 mg p.o. once daily [q.d.]
             or its equivalent) for symptom management and comorbid conditions. Doses of
             corticosteroid should be stable for at least 7 days prior to study treatment.)

          -  Steroids more than 160 mg IV equivalents of dexamethasone or bortezomib &gt; 2 doses of
             1.3 mg/m^2 each dosing equivalents

          -  Known significant cardiac abnormalities including:

          -  Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface
             antigen [HBsAg]). Subjects with resolved infection (i.e., subjects who are HBsAg
             negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or

             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded.
             EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs
             positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination,
             do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR

          -  Seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic response
             [SVR], defined as a viremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy)

          -  Any condition, including laboratory abnormalities, that in the opinion of the
             investigator places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in
             the study

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before study enrollment or
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are
             not excluded if they have undergone complete resection

          -  Known hypersensitivity to acyclovir or similar anti-viral drug

          -  Known severe intolerance to steroid therapy

          -  Participants with known central nervous system (CNS) involvement

          -  Poor tolerability or known allergy to any of the study drugs or compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to dexamethasone, boron or mannitol

          -  Female participants pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Participants who have undergone major surgery =&lt; 4 weeks prior to starting study drug
             or who have not recovered from side effects of the surgery

          -  Participants with any significant history of non-compliance to medical regimens or
             unwilling or unable to comply with the instructions given to him/her by the study
             staff

          -  Prior exposure to anti-CD38 therapy

          -  Radiotherapy within 14 days before enrollment. If the involved field is small, 7 days
             will be considered a sufficient interval between treatment and administration of study
             medications

          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,
             potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol

          -  Participation in other clinical trials, including those with other investigational
             agents not included in this trial, within 30 days of the start of this trial and
             throughout the duration of this trial
