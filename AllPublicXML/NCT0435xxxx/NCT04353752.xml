  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CF patients enrolled in this protocol will be recruited from patients followed by the Adult
      CF Program at National Jewish Health. Patients will be selected based on planned use of a
      CFTR modulator by their primary physician. No patient will be started on (or will switch)
      CFTR modulator agents for the purpose of the study. After enrollment, biological samples may
      be collected at two different time points prior to treatment initiation. One set of samples
      will be collected at baseline health prior to CFTR modulator initiation or change. A second
      set of samples will be obtained in subjects at the time of acute pulmonary exacerbation, if
      one occurs prior to CFTR modulator initiation or change. Post CFTR modulator initiation study
      assessments will be obtained at least one month after starting treatment and continue up to 2
      times a year (including during pulmonary exacerbations), in order to document longitudinal
      effects of therapies and changes in inflammatory biology over time. At the time of each
      biological sampling, blood, sputum sample, urine, and a quality of life assessment will be
      acquired in all enrolled subjects. In addition to demographic data, clinical data, such as
      quantitative microbiology and simple spirometry will be recorded at the time of sample
      collection.

        Subjects enrolled in this protocol will be recruited from patients followed by the Adult CF
        Program at National Jewish Health. The investigators project enrolling 80 subjects with
        diagnosed CF, 18 years of age or older, with eligible mutations for CFTR modulator
        therapies. Concomitant use of systemic steroids will be allowed, and typical co-infections
        or co-morbidities will not result in exclusion.
