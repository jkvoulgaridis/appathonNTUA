      This original article is a novel investigation on the metabolic characteristics of different
      patterns of antiepileptic drug (AED) responses in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes
      (BECTS) patients using 18F-FDG PET imaging. In this study, we demonstrated
      remitting-relapsing group showed more widespread hypo-metabolism regions than AED responders.
      Results indicated that metabolic differences had the ability to distinguish the
      remitting-relapsing patients from AED responders. 18F-FDG PET could be used as a marker to
      infer the current seizure activity of BECTS. We think that the established hybrid model based
      on PET and clinical features may be a critical reference for better personalized medication
      in patients with BECTS.

      Purpose The current drug treatment of benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS)
      mainly depends on the clinical experience of physicians. This study aimed to investigate
      different patterns of antiepileptic drug (AED) responses in patients with BECTS using
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) imaging for better
      personalized medication.

      Methods A total of 55 patients with BECTS (36 AED responders, 19 remitting-relapsing
      patients) and 23 pseudo-controls who underwent 18F-FDG PET imaging were retrospectively
      included. The group comparison was performed to investigate metabolic differences among AED
      responders, remitting-relapsing patients and pseudo-controls. Three different logistic
      regression models were employed to distinguish remitting-relapsing patients from AED
      responders based on clinical features, 18F-FDG PET images and a hybrid of both. Ten AED
      responders who reduced AED dose and one remitting-relapsing patient who relapsed within one
      month after PET examination were included in the model evaluation.
