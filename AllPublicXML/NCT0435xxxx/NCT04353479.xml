  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 study to evaluate efficacy and safety of PD1
      inhibitor Camrelizumab(SHR-1210) combined with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine in
      elderly patients with relapse and refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, no control, prospective clinical trial, 29
      relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients will be enrolled. Patients will be
      administered Camrelizumab(SHR-1210) at D1 and D15 and decitabine at D1-5. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
