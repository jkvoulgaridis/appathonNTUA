  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with chronic conditions often experience high levels of stress, anxiety and
      depression and reduced quality of life (Barlow &amp; Ellard, 2006; Pinquart &amp; Shen, 2011; Santos,
      Matos, Leal, &amp; co Céu Machado, 2017). Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI) have been found
      to improve emotional distress in clinical and non-clinical populations (Blanck et al., 2018;
      Greeson et al., 2018; Hofmann &amp; Gomez, 2017; Xunlin, Lau, &amp; Klainin-Yobas, 2020). Recent
      reviews suggest that MBIs are a promising technique to support adolescents with a chronic
      condition in managing their symptoms and ultimately enhance their quality of life
      (Abujaradeh, Safadi, Sereika, Kahle, &amp; Cohen, 2018; Ahola Kohut, Stinson, Davies-Chalmers,
      Ruskin, &amp; van Wyk, 2017).

      To test the effects of an MBI on emotional distress and quality of life and delineate the
      underlying mechanisms, the You.Mind! study uses a randomised staggered within-subjects
      design. 30 adolescents with a chronic condition (taking drop-out into account) will be
      randomised to a baseline phase of 14 to 28 days followed by an MBI, consisting of 4 online
      group sessions and online support spread over 8 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed by short,
      repeated measurements throughout the baseline, training, and follow-up phases and by
      standardized questionnaires and experience sampling measures before randomisation, at
      post-intervention and 3-months follow-up. Analysis will be based on general linear modelling
      and multilevel mixed-effects modelling. The investigators hypothesize that a MBI can help
      adolescents with a chronic condition to reduce their symptoms of stress, anxiety and
      depression, and increase their quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once a pool of 15 participants has been enrolled, they will be randomised to one of three MBI
      groups, which start their training with half a week time lag. Within each group, participants
      will be randomised to a baseline phase of 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 or 4 weeks, with 3-4 days between
      starting points of individual participants. Thus, the baseline phase will start at different
      time points for participants within the same group to enable them to start the intervention
      simultaneously while having baseline phases of varying length. Participants from different
      groups may begin their baseline phase at the same time while their intervention starts at a
      different time point. The same procedure will be repeated for the second pool of 15
      participants.

    <intervention_model_description>The study uses a randomized staggered within-subjects design in which participants are randomized to a baseline assessment phase of 14 to 28 days duration. During the subsequent intervention phase, all participants receive an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Intervention. Participants complete daily (every 3 days during intervention and follow-up phases) experience sampling method (ESM) measurements throughout the baseline, intervention and follow-up phases. Before randomisation, directly post-intervention and at 3 months follow-up, participants complete self-report questionnaires and ESM measurements.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The MBI programme adheres to a standardized protocol developed from MBSR (Kabat-Zinn, 1990) and MBCT (Segal et al., 2012) manuals and is adjusted to an adolescent population. Adjustments are based on the investigator's ample experience with mindfulness and adolescents in different contexts. Key objectives are: (1) to increase awareness of one's present moment experience; (2) to teach an attitude of openness and acceptance (non-judging) toward one's experience. This accepting attitude changes the person's relationship with the experience, being a detached and non-reactive orientation. Participants learn to recognize entanglement with one's thoughts and emotions and there is an increased understanding of one's spontaneous reactions. If adolescents adopt these skills, their negative emotions and cognitions will no longer be reinforced, creating the opportunity to deal with problematic thoughts and feelings.</description>

    <description>The MBI consists of four 2h online group sessions spread over eight weeks. In between sessions, online support will be offered to assist participants in their practice. Each session consists of guided mindfulness exercises (e.g., focus on the breath, body scan, breathing space, mindful yoga, insight meditation, walk meditation), sharing of experiences of these exercises, reflections in small groups, psycho-education (e.g., stress, depression, self-care), and review of home practices. An overview of core elements is given in Van der Gucht et al. (2017b).
The MBI is supported by homework assignments and audio material. Groups will include 5 participants, yielding 6 groups in total. The MBI will be delivered by highly qualified certified trainers with more than 10 years of experience in mindfulness meditation and extensive experience working with adolescents. Trainers will attend inter- and supervision moments on a regular basis to check treatment fidelity and trainer adherence.</description>
