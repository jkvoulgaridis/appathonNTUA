  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to confirm the performance of the ExoDx Prostate test in prior negative
      biopsy patients now presenting for a repeat prostate biopsy.

      Note: ExoDx Prostate test results are collected for correlation to biopsy results and are not
      disclosed to the physician or study subject.

      Primary Endpoint:

      Evaluate the correlation of the ExoDx Prostate test results with the outcome of prostate
      biopsies in a prior negative repeat biopsy patient cohort.

      Secondary Endpoints (exploratory):

        1. Evaluate the clinical performance of the ExoDx Prostate test at the cut-point of 15.6
           defined for the initial biopsy patient cohort.

        2. Associate ExoDx Prostate test results with other ancillary studies including the use of
           radiographic imaging (e.g. multiparametric MRI).

        3. Evaluate the correlation of ExoDx Prostate as a function of risk. It is known that a
           higher ExoDx Prostate score correlates to a higher risk of finding prostate cancer,
           including HGPC, upon biopsy.

        4. Evaluate ExoDx Prostate with and without inclusion of standard of care parameters such
           as PSA, ethnicity, DRE, age and family history.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  50+ years of age

          -  Clinical suspicion for prostate cancer

          -  Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen between 2.0-10 ng/ mL
