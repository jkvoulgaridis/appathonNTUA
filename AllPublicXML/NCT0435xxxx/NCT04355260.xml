      Objective to investigate the safety and effectiveness of Echocardiography-guided
      radiofrequency ablation in patients with Hypertrophic obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

      Percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (Liwen Procedure) is a safe and
      effective treatment approach for Hypertrophic obstructive Cardiomyopathy and results in
      sustained improvement in exercise capacity, persistent in reducing Left Ventricle Outflow
      Tract (LVOT) gradient, and sustained improvement in cardiac function.

      In patients with disabling symptoms caused by Hypertrophic obstructive Cardiomyopathy
      (HOCM),Echocardiography-guided radiofrequency ablation could be a less invasive treatment
      option.

      Percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (Liwen Procedure) is a new method
      for the diagnosis or treatment of heart disease by using a special diagnosis and treatment
      device to the heart target area under the guidance of image technology. The method breaks
      through the worldwide problem of the minimally invasive diagnosis and treatment of the
      myocardium on the beating heart, so as to avoid the X-ray radiation and contrast agent damage
      .

      As a new pathway of cardiac disease intervention, Liwen Procedure can be used in congenital
      heart disease, myocardial biopsies, drug injection, cell implantation and instrument
      implantation in addition to Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and cardiac tumors. It has important
      clinical value and broad application prospect.

      In this study, Liwen RF radiofrequency ablation system was used to treat HOCM , and evaluate
      its safety and effectiveness , in order to provide a new medical device for Liwen Procedure
      of HOCM.
