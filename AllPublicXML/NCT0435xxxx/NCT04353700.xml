  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While effects of specific exercise interventions on bone and CVD in postmenopausal women have
      been demonstrated and evaluated, the effects of randomized controlled exercise interventions,
      particularly in middle-aged premenopausal women are sparse. Therefore, it is imperative to
      examine the relation between behavioral interventions and bone and cardiovascular outcomes in
      premenopausal women as this understudied group is at high risk for the initial stages of bone
      loss and cardiovascular disease development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, it is not clear whether the intensity of Yoga interventions is high enough to
      induce positive effects on bone and cardiovascular health in a healthy population. For
      example, Hagins et al. (2007) reported that the metabolic costs of Hatha Yoga, averaged
      across the entire session, represent low levels of physical activity (walking). On the other
      hand, Ashtanga Yoga, or power Yoga, is performed at a higher intensity than Hatha Yoga and
      has been shown to elicit significantly higher heart rates than either Hatha or gentle Yoga
      (Cowen and Adams, 2007). Sun Salutations (SS) are an example of an Ashtanga Yoga sequence,
      where yoga postures are performed dynamically with combinations of forward and backward
      bending poses (Omkar et al., 2011). A previous 8-month yoga intervention found that regular
      long-term Ashtanga yoga had a small positive effect on bone formation in premenopausal women.
      Although Yoga has the potential to be an alternative physical activity to improve bone health
      and arterial stiffness, there is a lack of high-quality evidence for this type of
      intervention. Thus, the purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a 12-week
      home-based dynamic yoga intervention designed to improve bone metabolism and arterial
      stiffness in healthy premenopausal women.

    <description>A certified yoga instructor led the supervised yoga session. An exercise physiologist taught how to record your Rating of Perceived Exertion to monitor their exercise intensity during the in-home yoga intervention. During the in-home yoga intervention, participants performed 30 to 50 minutes of yoga postures three to five times a week for 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>During the in-home yoga intervention, participants performed 30 to 50 minutes of yoga postures three to five times a week for 12 weeks, including 5 minutes of warm-up exercise, 15 to 30 minutes of dynamic flow yoga postures, 10 minutes of weight barring standing postures, and 5 minutes of cool-down. These in-home sessions were a repeat of what participants learned during the first week of training session at UML. We progressively increased the intensity of the home practice sessions by adding the number of sun salutation (SS) over the 12 weeks.</description>
