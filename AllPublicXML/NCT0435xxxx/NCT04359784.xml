  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well anakinra works in decreasing the occurrence of cytokine
      release syndrome (CRS) and damage to the nerves (neurotoxicity) in patients with B-cell
      lymphoma who are receiving CD-19 targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy.
      CAR-T cell therapy may be complicated by two potentially life-threatening side effects: CRS
      and neurotoxicity. Anakinra is a drug typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but may
      also help in preventing CAR-T cell-related cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive anakinra subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 0-13 and axicabtagene ciloleucel
      via infusion on day 0.

      After completion of axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, patients are followed up periodically
      for up to 90 days.
