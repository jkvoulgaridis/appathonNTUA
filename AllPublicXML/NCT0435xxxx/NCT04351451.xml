  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium plays a role in the active transport of calcium (Ca+2) and potassium ions across
      cell membranes. Most of it is intracellular or in the bone , however less than 1% of
      magnesium is in the blood serum. Hypoparathyroidism post thyroidectomy leads to acute
      Hypocalcemia that leads to hypomagnesemia. The relation of Ca+2 and magnesium (Mg+2)
      metabolism is complex and mainly related to the interaction of these cations with parathyroid
      post thyroidectomy. (Mg+2) is an essential regulator of Ca+2 flux and intracellular action of
      Ca+2. Hypomagnesaemia impairs hypocalcaemia induced PTH release, which is corrected rapidly
      after magnesium replacement. Attempting to correct only hypocalcemia may prolong symptoms. It
      is important to monitor both Ca+2 &amp; Mg+2 levels following thyroidectomy to facilitate prompt
      resolution of symptoms.

      Aim of the study: is to highlight the prevalence of hypomagnesemia following thyroidectomy
      and its association with hypocalcemia which mandate early recognition and treatment to
      prevent prolongation of hypocalcemia and permanent hypoparathyroidism

      Methods:

      IRB obtained (E20-4615) informed consent taken from all patient. This is prospective open
      Label observational study in patients underwent thyroidectomy .the study period was from
      January 2019 to January 2020. Total of 74 patients with normal renal function. Corrected
      serum Ca+2, magnesium, phosphate level and vitamin D level are all checked pre operatively
      and in the first post-operative day.

      Result:

      Post thyroidectomy 56.8% of patients had hypomagnesemia. 59.5.1% patients had hypocalcemia
      and 41.9% of patients had low both Ca+2 and Mg+2 (P=0.004)

      Conclusion:

      Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia following thyroidectomy is of multi factorial related mainly
      to Ca+2, Mg+2 interaction.

      Methods:

      A prospective study for 1 year starting 1/1/2019 to 1/1/2020. A total 74 patients with normal
      renal function .admitted for thyroidectomy. Preoperative serum calcium, magnesium, phosphate
      and vitamin D level all checked. Postoperatively corrected serum calcium, magnesium and
      phosphate level are checked. The serum calcium less than 2.12mmol/l is corrected with oral or
      IV calcium infusion plus vitamin D depending on the severity of symptoms. Any serum magnesium
      less than 0.75mmol/l is corrected with infusion magnesium sulfate. Calcium and magnesium
      level monitored and corrected according to the result.

      Statistical analysis:

      Statistical analysis was performed using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS)
      version 23.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago ,IL,USA). If normal distributed, continuous
      variable were presented as mean (SD) Student t-test for paired observation was used for
      statistical. Pearson Chi-square test was used to compare the percentage for categorical
      variables. P less than 0.05 indicate statistically significant difference
