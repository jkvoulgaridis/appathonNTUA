  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help better understand the uptake and impact of genetic
      testing for women diagnosed with breast cancer who do not meet National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network (NCCN) criteria for genetic testing. By doing so, the research team will gain a
      better understanding of the clinical implications for offering genetic testing for all
      patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer versus only offering genetic testing to those
      meeting NCCN criteria.

      By offering genetic counseling and genetic testing to all women recently diagnosed with
      breast cancer, there will be a shortage of genetic counselors. This study will also assess
      the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to assist in the genetic counseling process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of pre-test genetic counseling using
      an artificial intelligence program and traditional in-person genetic counseling in women
      newly diagnosed with breast cancer who do not currently meet National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network (NCCN) criteria for genetic testing.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine up-take of testing for those who do not meet NCCN guidelines for genetic
           testing

        2. To assess overall patient satisfaction and comprehension in both groups

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        1. To assess mutation rate in the overall cohort

        2. Identify reasons for not pursuing genetic testing

        3. Identify any specific areas of improvement in satisfaction and comprehension

        4. Assess the impact of genetic testing on Time to Treatment in this cohort

        5. Develop workflow for offering genetic testing, providing pre-test genetic counseling,
           ordering testing, and delivering results

    <description>Mean overall patient satisfaction with decision about genetic testing as assessed by survey. The survey is a previously validated six-question Likert scale based survey. The scale ranges from 6 to 30, with higher scores indicating more satisfaction.
Satisfaction will be compared between groups with t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Published data suggest that standard deviation on the satisfaction survey is 3. A 2 point difference in average satisfaction score between groups is considered to be relevant</description>
