  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of two drugs that change the immune system and
      tumor as a possible treatment for metastatic or unresectable stage III or IV cutaneous
      melanoma.

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Atezolizumab

        -  Bevacizumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment including
      evaluations, a biopsy, and follow up visits.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved atezolizumab for this specific disease but it has
      been approved for other uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved
      bevacizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Atezolizumab and bevacizumab are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging
      the body's own immune system to attack the cancer cells and stop the growth of cancer.
      Atezolizumab and bevacizumab work by stopping various molecules on cancer cells and body
      cells from working against the immune system's natural fight against cancer.

             current or recent treatment with dipyramidole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and
             cilostazol.

          -  Current or recent (within 10 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) use of full-dose oral or
             parenteral anticoagulants or thrombolytic agents for therapeutic purpose (as opposed
             to prophylactic). Prophylactic anticoagulation for the patency of venous access
             devices is allowed provided the activity of the agent results in an INR &lt; 1.5 x ULN
             and aPTT is within normal limits (according to the institutional standards) within 14
             days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Prophylactic use of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
             (i.e., enoxaparin 40 mg/day) is allowed. However, the use of direct oral anticoagulant
             therapies such as dabigatran (Pradaxa®) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) is not recommended
             due to bleeding risk.

          -  History of abdominal or tracheoesophageal fistula, GI perforation, or intra-abdominal
             abscess within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

          -  Evidence of abdominal free air that is not explained by paracentesis or recent
             surgical procedure.

          -  Serious, non-healing or dehiscing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture.

          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or anticipation of need
             for a major surgical procedure during the study.

          -  History of intra-abdominal inflammatory process within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day
             1, including, but not limited to, peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis, or colitis.

          -  Chronic daily treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study or within
             5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab and 6 months after the last dose of
             bevacizumab. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             result within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment.
