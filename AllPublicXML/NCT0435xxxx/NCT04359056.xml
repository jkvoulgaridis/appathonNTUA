  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical pharmacy is a patient-centered discipline and improves significantly the safety of
      drug management. Regarding medications, clinical pharmacy is efficient. The investigator
      hypothesize that clinical pharmacy applied to medical devices could be as effective as in the
      medication field.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of clinical pharmacy
      activities during entire care pathways of patients implanted with a PICC line, in preventing
      complications.

      This is a preliminary, before-after, monocentric and prospective study. The study will begin
      with an observational period and will be followed by an experimental intervention period.
      Sixty-nine adult patients in each period will be included. During the observational phase, no
      clinical pharmacy activities will be performed. During the interventional phase, clinical
      pharmacists will be active during the entire patients' care pathways.
