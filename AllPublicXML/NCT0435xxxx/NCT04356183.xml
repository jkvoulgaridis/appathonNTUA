    <textblock>
      This is a small exploratory, randomized, controlled trial. Twenty-six older (ages 60-80 yr.),
      obese (BMI 30-40 kg/m2) persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (seropositive or erosive) will
      be randomized to 16 weeks of a counseling health as treatment (CHAT) program or a supervised
      weight loss and exercise training (SWET) program.

    <measure>Metabolic Syndrome Severity z-score (MSSc)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8-weeks, 16-weeks and 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to compare change in metabolic syndrome score (MSSc) between cohorts. The MS Z-score is a continuous score of the 5 MS variables. A modified Z-score is calculated for each variable using individual subject data, the ATPIII criteria (waist circumference, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure and fasting glucose) and standard deviations.
A z-score of 1 is 1 standard deviation above the mean.
A z-score of 2 is 2 standard deviations above the mean.
A z-score of -1.8 is -1.8 standard deviations below the mean. A z-score tells you where the score lies on a normal distribution curve. A z-score of zero tells you the value is exactly average while a score of +3 tells you that the value is much higher than average.

    <description>Weight loss will occur via a dietitian-led intervention targeting weight loss over 16 weeks, with weekly weigh-ins and group support sessions. Exercise training will consist of three times per week of an interval-based aerobic program plus twice-weekly resistance training. Both weight loss and exercise training will be supervised to maximize safety and adherence.</description>
