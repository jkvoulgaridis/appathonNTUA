  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of endocrine changes and their correction on
      survival and organ fuction in heart and lung transplant recipients.This study also features
      an investigation of the hormone levels and hormonal replacement therapy of the donors to
      study it's role on the function of the transplanted hearts and lungs.

      Thyroid hormones (TSH, thyroxine, tri-iodothyronin), cortisol and the antiduretic hormone
      will be studied.

      The former two hormone levels will be defined in the recipients just before transplantation
      and three days later. In case of the donors all the three hormones will be recorded in time
      of the explantation. We would like to record the hormonal replacement therapy in all our
      patients as well to see it's effect on survival and on the transplantated organ function.

      After the tranplantation during the hospital stay we record all the important hemodynamic,
      labratory paramaters, the result of the medical imagings, the medication, the length of ICU
      and hospital stay and the complications.

      Recipients will be followed for five years. Organ function will be assessed every three month
      for a year, after than every six month for further four years. We would like to record the
      result of the cardiac echocardiographies, spirometries, imagings and the complications. Our
      purpose is to compare these results against the endocrine disorders and the replacement
      therapy.
