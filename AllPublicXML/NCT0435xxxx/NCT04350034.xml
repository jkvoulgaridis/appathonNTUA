      The outcome measures included quadriceps muscle strength as measured using an isokinetic
      dynamometer, LBM is measured by DEXA and cardiopulmonary fitness was assessed by measuring
      VO2 peak during a standardized treadmill exercise test using the modified Bruce protocol. All
      outcome measures were evaluated immediately after discharge as baseline and after 12 weeks of
      intervention.

      Forty healed pediatric burn patients (24 boys and 16 girls), aged 10 - 15 years, were
      enrolled from the outpatient clinic in the faculty of physical therapy, Cairo university,
      Egypt. The inclusion criteria were: total body surface area (TBSA) of 40-60%, being
      ambulatory without an assistant. The exclusion criteria included metabolic disorders,
      neuropathy, visual or vestibular disorders, amputation, participation in another study, any
      adverse medication reactions, history of epilepsy, loss of balance, and lower or upper limb
      deformity. All patients received similar standard medical care and treatment from the time of
      admission until the time of discharge.

      Total burn surface area was assessed by the &quot;modified Lund and Browder charts&quot; method during
      excisional surgery immediately following hospital admittance. Informed written consent was
      obtained from each patient's guardian prior to enrollment.

      All procedures were approved by the ethical committee of the faculty of physical therapy,
      Cairo university, Giza, Egypt. After consent was obtained, patients were randomly assigned to
      standard of care group (SOC) or Xbox training group (Xbox).

      The Xbox group participated in a 12-week of routine physiotherapy program supplemented with
      Xbox training program (N=20). In contrast, the SOC group participated in the routine
      physiotherapy program (N=20).

      A normal activity of daily living (ADL), diet and patient's lifestyle were maintained for all
      participants as much as possible.

    <intervention_model_description>The Xbox group participated in a 12-week of routine physiotherapy program supplemented with Xbox training program. The control group participated in the routine physiotherapy program.
In the study group received Xbox training, the dose of Xbox training was 50 min, three times a week for 12 weeks, using the Xbox gaming system. The games were anticipated onto a 45-inch Samsung television. The playing area was 16 * 12 m. The content of Xbox training consisted of practicing five Xbox games (Rally Ball, Reﬂex Ridge, River Rush, 2000 Leaks and parkour). Children practiced each game for 10 min, bringing about every session enduring 50 min.</intervention_model_description>

Before the intervention started, the Xbox group was given a 45 min introductory session on how to use the xbox adventure games and its tools. All sessions were led by a single experienced physiotherapist (different to the physiotherapist who performed the assessments tests) in order to provide instruction on how to perform each exercise.</description>
