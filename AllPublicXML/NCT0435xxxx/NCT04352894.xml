  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a frequent and deadly localization of gastric
      cancer. Available imaging techniques have a low accuracy in detecting small peritoneal
      nodules, and direct laparoscopic visualization may fail too. A more accurate staging
      technique would be advantageous for individualization of therapeutic path. Indocyanine Green
      (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been reported as a tool for visualizing small peritoneal
      seedings due to the &quot;enhanced permeability and retention&quot; (EPR) effect of cancer nodules.

      Aim. To explore the feasibility and effectiveness of fluorescence-enhanced peritoneal
      carcinomatosis detection in patients with gastric cancer undergoing staging laparoscopy.

      Methods. This prospective, multicentric, single arm study will include patients with gastric
      cancer, without a radiological suspicion of peritoneal carcinomatosis, undergoing staging
      laparoscopy. An intravenous injection of ICG is given at different dosage and at different
      timepoints before the intervention. During the staging laparoscopy, the abdominal cavity
      exploration is performed using standard white-light, and subsequently using fluorescence
      imaging. Suspicious nodules are harvested, until a maximum of 5 per patient, and sent for
      definitive histological examination. Peritoneal washing is also harvested for cytologic
      assessment in all cases. The eventual benefit of fluorescence imaging in terms of additional
      peritoneal lesions that were not detected during standard white-light imaging is evaluated.

      Discussion. This study will establish if fluorescence imaging increases sensitivity and/or
      specificity of staging laparoscopy in detecting peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric
      cancer. Improved accuracy may translate in better care path selection.
