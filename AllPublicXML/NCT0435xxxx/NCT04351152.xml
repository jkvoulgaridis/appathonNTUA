  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the use of lenzilumab in addition to
      current standard of care (SOC) can alleviate the immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome
      (CRS) and prevent progression to respiratory failure and/or death in high risk patients with
      COVID-19 pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most deaths in COVID-19 patients result from respiratory distress, which appears to be driven
      in large part by a CRS mediated hyper-immune reaction ('cytokine storm') that may occur even
      in patients who appear to be resolving their infection by viral titers. In addition, GM-CSF+T
      cells are highly correlated with severity and ICU admission in the setting of COVID-19. For
      this reason, it is critical to intervene prior to the initiation of CRS and severe
      respiratory distress in patients at high risk of progression. This phase 3 randomized,
      multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial will evaluate the impact of GM-CSF
      neutralization with lenzilumab on incidence of respiratory failure and/or death in patients
      with COVID-19 pneumonia upon hospitalization. 238 patients will be randomized to receive
      lenzilumab + SOC vs. SOC in a 1:1 ratio. An interim analysis is planned for DSMB to assess
      safety &amp; efficacy data.
