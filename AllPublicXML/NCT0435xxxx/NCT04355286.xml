    <textblock>
      This will be a single clinical study conducted in 2 parts (Part 1: pilot study and Part 2:
      pivotal study). Part 1 is an open-label, 1-arm study in 8 healthy adult subjects with the
      following primary objectives:

        -  .Part 1 is an open label, 1-arm pilot study to evaluate the systemic absorption and
           effects of multiple applications of a market-image topical sunscreen formulation
           containing BEMT (6%) under maximum use conditions in healthy adult subjects.

        -  To obtain information needed for a successful pivotal study such as preliminary
           pharmacokinetic (PK) data, validation of study and analytical procedures, and the number
           of subjects needed for the pivotal (Part 2) study.

      This will be a single clinical study conducted in 2 parts (Part 1: pilot study and Part 2:
      pivotal study). The duration of study participation will be approximately 42 days for Part 1,
      including a 30 day screening period, a 4 day treatment period (Days 1 4) and subjects leaving
      the clinical research unit (CRU) on the morning of Day 5. Subjects will then return to the
      CRU for follow up visits on Days 8 and 12. On Day 12, End of Study activities will be
      completed.

      Part 1 is an open label, 1-arm pilot study to evaluate the effects of multiple applications
      of a topical sunscreen formulation in healthy adult subjects. It will include 8 subjects (4
      male and 4 female) that will be admitted to the CRU on Day -1. On the morning of Days 1
      through 4, subjects will receive a topical application of the study drug between 07:00 and
      10:00 hours followed by 3 more applications each day at 2, 4, and 6 hours after the first
      application, resulting in study drug application at 0, 2, 4, 6, 24, 26, 28, 30, 48, 50, 52,
      54, 72, 74, 76, and 78 hours relative to the first application. Each dose of study drug will
      be weighed in advance and applied by a qualified person from the CRU.

      In both parts of the study, approximately 2 mg of active sunscreen ingredient per 1 cm2 of
      body surface area (calculation per method of Du Bois et al 1989) will be evenly applied 4
      times per study day (except for a 1 time application on the first day in Part 2) to areas of
      the body typically exposed to the sun: face, ears, neck, torso, arms, and legs (at least 75%
      of the body surface area). The antecubital areas will be avoided and protected with an
      occlusive, self-adhesive cover when applying the sunscreen due to potential contamination of
      the sites used for PK blood sample collection. The topical applications of study drug will be
      administered with subjects in swim wear to simulate real world settings as well as for easy
      application. In addition to swim wear, subjects may wear scrubs in between applications and
      at other times throughout the day/night. Subjects are required to shower each morning after
      the first PK blood sample collection (and before the first application of the day), but not
      at other times during the day.

      Blood samples (approximately 6 mL per sample) will be collected for the determination of
      plasma concentrations of BEMT.

      Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital sign measurements, and
      physical examinations. All AEs reported by the subject or observed by the investigator or CRU
      staff will be recorded. Any AE reported after the informed consent form is signed and before
      study drug application will be recorded as medical history.
