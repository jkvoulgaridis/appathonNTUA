    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, 12-week study of subjects with dry
      eye disease that is inadequately controlled by cyclosporine (CsA) 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion.
      Subject enrollment will be classified by evidence of dry eye disease (ie, signs, symptoms, or
      both signs and symptoms). Treatment will be one drop of CsA 0.09% ophthalmic solution (Cequa)
      in each eye twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks. The study hypothesis is that CsA 0.09% ophthalmic
      solution will show improved clinical benefit in subjects whose dry eye signs and/or symptoms
      are inadequately controlled while on CsA.
