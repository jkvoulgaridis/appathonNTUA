      The objective : to investigate a correlation between ANI following a standardized nociceptive
      stimulus and hemodynamic or somatic reactions during orotracheal intubation.

      Piloted study. ANI and hemodynamic and somatic parameters response associated tetanus
      stimulation followed by orotracheal intubation were collected.

      Background: The Analgesia Nociception Index reflects the balance between analgesia and
      nociception and allows early detection of a defect in analgesia. Orotracheal intubation is
      responsible for a sometimes deleterious hemodynamic reaction. The Analgesia Nociception Index
      could allow an individual adjustment of the investigator's anesthetic inductions during this
      period.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate if there is a correlation between
      variations in the ANI following a standardized nociceptive stimulus and the occurrence of
      hemodynamic or somatic reactions during orotracheal intubation without muscle relaxation.

      Materials and Methods: Prospective, interventional, analytical, monocentric, piloted study
      carried out in the operating theatre after obtaining patient's informed consent between
      January 2014 and November 2014. Under steady state total intravenous anaesthesia with
      propofol and remifentanil at constant dosage (entropy between 40 and 60) tetanus stimulation
      of the ulnar nerve was performed followed by orotracheal intubation. The variation of ANI and
      hemodynamic parameters as well as the somatic response associated with both maneuvers were
      collected.

    <description>Anesthetic induction : total target-controlled intravenous anesthesia d was used with propofol and remifentanil. The effect site was then gradually increased to obtain a satisfaction depth of anesthesia. Assisted ventilation was then started by facemask ventilation (Sat O2&gt;95% and expired CO2 fraction normal, tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, a respiratory rate of 12 cycles per minute, with an FiO2 100% with no positive end expiratory pressure.
After stabilisation period of 2 minutes and record of the patient's parameters, a standardized nociceptive stimulation was applied at the level of the ulnar nerve (PTC of 50 Hz at 70 mA). The variation of ANI score and hemodynamic parameters were collected during the 2 following minutes.
After stabilization of ANI, orotracheal intubation was attempted. Maximal variation of heart rate (HR), blood pressure and the occurrence of somatic manifestations (intense cough, movement, tears) were recorded.</description>
