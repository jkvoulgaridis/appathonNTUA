  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of polyphenolic compounds of almonds have
      been reported in limited animal studies and may have the potential to improve skin radiance.
      However, the skin related beneficial properties of almonds have not been investigated in
      humans. This study will examine the effects of almond consumption on human skin radiance in
      Asian women as a pilot.

      This study is a randomized, parallel group comparison of almonds vs. isocaloric pretzels
      carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Human Subjects Protection Committee of
      the University of California, Los Angeles. All subjects will give written informed consent
      before the study begins. Subjects will consume 1.5 serving of almonds (~ 1.5 oz/d for
      246kcal) or isocaloric pretzels (~ 2.0 oz/d for 216kcal) daily for 12 weeks and will undergo
      skin assessment at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. The assessments include skin radiance, sebum, and
      hydration/moisture. In addition the study will evaluate the effect of almond consumption on
      skin inflammation and aging by assessing UV-induced changes. Each group will have 20
      subjects.

    <description>Determine the clinical efficacy of almond consumption on skin radiance. The main criteria will be evaluated by clinical scoring using the coloring, luminosity, brightness, and transparency (C.L.B.T.TM)(18) scale and imperfections scale (dark circles, redness/rosacea, spots, and heterogeneity). The C.L.B.T.TM methodology allows assessing different descriptors of the complexion: coloring, luminosity, brightness, and transparency of facial skin.</description>

    <description>Evaluate the effect of almond consumption on skin inflammation and aging by assessing UV-induced changes. This will done using the smallest dose of UV-B radiation capable of inducing erythema (minimal erythema dose [MED]). The minimal erythema dose (MED) is determined for each subject before (week 0) and after (week 12) the intervention. Prior to testing, the skin type will be evaluated based on the Fitzpatrick Skin Type scale. Participants with Fitzpatrick skin type 2-4 were included in the study and assessed for differences in their response to UV-B induced skin changes before and after 12 weeks of study intervention.</description>

    <measure>Skin aging (elasticity, sebum, and hydration/moisture)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the effect of almond consumption on skin biological characteristics of elasticity, sebum, and hydration/moisture content using the CutometerÂ® Skin Elasticity Meter 580 (Courage and Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany). The Cutometer measures the vertical deformation of the skin in millimeters when the skin is pulled by means of a controlled vacuum into the circular aperture, 6 mm in diameter, of the probe. In its standard configuration, the Cutometer is equipped with a measuring probe with a 2 mm aperture because the device is originally designed to measure only the elastic properties of the epidermis. Skin hydration will measured using the moisture/hydration probe that attaches to the Cutometer. The six sites measured include: forehead, under the eye, frontal cheek, crow's foot, lateral cheek, and inner forearm.</description>
