  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the effects of the association of strontium chloride with
      photobiomodulation on the dental bleaching process, testing the hypothesis that they may
      control dental sensitivity post-bleaching teeth.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study was to evaluate the
      effect of 10% strontium chloride associated with photobiomodulation (FBM) on teeth exposed to
      35% hydrogen peroxide during 3 weeks of whitening treatment. Methods: 50 volunteers were
      evaluated by the split mouth model, where the hemiarchy patients were randomized and
      subsequently allocated to one of the experimental groups: PLACEBO (negative control) - group
      with no desensitizing treatment, only bleached; FBM (positive control) - group treated with
      placebo gel and application of the LLLT (Low Level Laser Therapy); ESTRÔNCIO (positive
      control) - group treated with 10% strontium chloride and simulation of LLLT application
      (without light emission); and FBM + ESTRÔNCIO - group treated with LLLT + 10% strontium
      chloride.

    <description>Self-reported pain intensity was assessed daily, during 21 days, through self-perception questionnaire, answered by the patients from the first tooth bleaching session until one week after the last session. The evaluation was performed by each patient, according to a modified visual analog scale, as follows: 0- no pain, 1 mild pain, 2 - moderate pain and 3 -severe pain.</description>

    <description>The dental elements of this group had no desensitizing treatment. After whitening therapy, a water-soluble placebo gel (KY®, Johnson &amp; Johnson, SP, Brazil) was applied to dental oral surfaces, then the laser tip was positioned at two points, apical and cervical, without emitting light (placebo), simulating the application of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT).</description>

    <description>The group received in-office bleaching. A 45-minute application of 35% hydrogen peroxide gel (Whiteness HP, FGM, Joinville, SC) was carried. After whitening therapy, a water-soluble placebo gel (KY®, Johnson &amp; Johnson, SP, Brazil) was applied to the buccal surfaces of incisors, canines and premolars with the help of a Microbrush applicator (Microbrush, 3M ESPE, São Paulo , Brazil) for 10 minutes. Then, a rubber cup (Unid Microdont, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) mounted on a handpiece at low speed (Dabi Atlante, Ribeirão Preto, SO, Brazil) was used to rub the placebo gel for 20 seconds in each tooth surface. After washing the placebo gel, the laser tip was positioned at two points, apical and cervical, without emitting light (placebo), simulating the application of low-level laser therapy (LLLT).
This protocol was performed in 3 sessions, with an interval of seven days between them.</description>
