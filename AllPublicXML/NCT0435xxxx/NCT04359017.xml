    <textblock>
      This study will measure in children how much numbing medicine, lidocaine, is absorbed into
      the bloodstream after it is injected into a blood clot (hematoma) around a forearm fracture
      for pain control when the broken bone is moved back into place (fracture reduction). This is
      called a hematoma block and is commonly used in the Emergency Unit. To help with anxiety and
      to add additional pain control, nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is given while the lidocaine
      hematoma block is placed and continued during the fracture reduction. Advantages of using
      this technique for pain control instead of an intravenous anesthetic such as ketamine include
      faster recovery and discharge home, and longer pain control.

      Of concern, if too much lidocaine is absorbed into the bloodstream, seizures and irregular
      heart beating may occur. Bloodstream concentrations of lidocaine after a hematoma block have
      been measured in only one study of 8 adults and found to be at significant but safe levels.
      No study has been published in children to measure bloodstream lidocaine levels when a
      hematoma block is used. Because children's bones are still growing and more metabolically
      active than adult bones, the investigators believe it is important to determine whether
      lidocaine blood levels in children are also at safe levels when using a standard lidocaine
      hematoma block for reduction of fractures. The investigators also want to determine whether
      bloodstream lidocaine levels correlate with type of fracture, size of the fracture hematoma
      and effectiveness of pain control during fracture reduction.

      The investigators also aim to determine if there is a difference in absorption pattern
      between different types of distal radius fractures, if there is a correlation between
      fracture type and systemic lidocaine absorption, if there this a correlation between fracture
      type and fracture hematoma size, and if there is a correlation between fracture type and
      ability to provide adequate pain and sedation control with lidocaine hematoma block/inhaled
      nitrous combination. The investigators believe blood lidocaine levels after hematoma block in
      children will peak at safe levels, but will be higher than those observed in adults. They
      believe that a more displaced fracture will have a larger hematoma, that a larger hematoma
      will be associated with a higher peak blood lidocaine level, and that a higher peak blood
      lidocaine level will be associated with more successful pain control scores and satisfaction
      with the procedure.

      When a subject with an eligible distal forearm fracture is identified, the subject will be
      approached for enrollment and consent. Fracture hematoma size will then be estimated using
      bedside ultrasound operated by trained pediatric emergency faculty or fellows. Ultrasound
      measurement of the dimensions of the fracture hematomas will be performed at the subject's
      bedside in the Emergency Department by pediatric emergency physicians trained in ultrasound
      use and in the specific methods for fracture hematoma size measurement. Obtaining the
      measurements of hematoma size will be performed by a standard protocol: The fractured bone
      will be scanned longitudinally on the dorsal-lateral surface to obtain the largest
      measurement of the length and depth of the associated fracture hematoma. Transverse scan will
      be obtained on the dorsal-lateral surface to determine width at the largest measurement.
      These measurements will then be used to calculate the total volume of the hematoma. If no
      dorsal hematoma is noted, an attempt at identifying volar hematoma may be made and its
      presence noted.

      50% nitrous oxide/50% oxygen then will be administered to the subject by face mask for a
      minimum of 2 minutes before venous catheter insertion (50% nitrous oxide will continue to be
      administered until fracture reduction is completed). Nitrous oxide currently is administered
      regularly in the St. Louis Children's Emergency Department for painful procedures including
      fracture reduction, abscess incision and drainage, laceration repair and venous catheter
      placement. Nitrous oxide 50% blended with 50% oxygen will be administered for this study by
      credentialed emergency unit staff using a continuous flow delivery system that includes
      scavenging of exhaled nitrous oxide. Standard monitoring for deep sedation will be used as
      described in the clinical protocol.

      A venous catheter then will be inserted into the uninjured arm. A lidocaine hematoma block
      will be injected by an orthopedic surgery resident using 2.5 mg/kg, maximum of 100mg, of 1%
      buffered lidocaine. The recommended lidocaine dose for hematoma block in children is 3-5
      mg/kg. However, in a previous study, in another pediatric trial, and in the single report of
      plasma lidocaine levels in adults, 2.5 mg/kg of 1% lidocaine based upon the patient's weight,
      maximum 100 mg, was found effective and without adverse effects.

      The Pediatric Sedation State Scale will be administered by the sedation provider, and a
      research assistant when available, and used for subsequent analysis to quantify subjects'
      responses to the injection of the hematoma block and fracture reduction. This scale has been
      validated for procedural sedation. Pediatric Sedation State Scale scores will be determined
      before nitrous oxide is begun (baseline), as the hematoma block is placed, at 60 second
      intervals during reduction and moulding, and 15 minutes after moulding is completed. The PSSS
      during each interval will be averaged when multiple time points are available.

      Serial blood samples will be drawn through the indwelling venous catheter by a nurse or medic
      at 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes after injection of the hematoma block. Serial plasma
      lidocaine levels will be measured as follows. 5 mL samples of blood will be obtained via the
      indwelling venous catheter at 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes after injection of the lidocaine
      hematoma block. The samples of blood will be collected in standard red top vacutainer blood
      tubes and processed, frozen and stored in the SLCH/BJC Lab.

      At 5 minutes after the hematoma block injection, the orthopedic surgeon will attempt fracture
      reduction. If the subject has minimal response to squeezing the fracture site prior to 5
      minutes post injection, reduction may begin at that time. Nitrous oxide administration will
      be stopped and administration of 100% oxygen will begin when the orthopedic surgeon indicates
      satisfactory fracture reduction as determined by bedside fluoroscopy (standard procedure), a
      cast or splint has been applied, and, if necessary, the cast has been split. Oxygen
      administration will be stopped when the subject's exhaled nitrous oxide concentration falls
      below 10% or the subject pulls the nitrous oxide mask off the face.

      If the subject resists the fracture reduction or verbally indicates significant pain,
      ketamine sedation will be administered via the indwelling venous catheter and fracture
      reduction completed under deep sedation. Post procedure pain score via the Wong-Baker Faces
      scale, and post procedure surveys will be administered 15 minutes after nitrous
      administration is stopped. After the subject's recovery from sedation, the subject, subject's
      parents/guardians, physician providing sedation (inhaled nitrous) and the orthopedic surgeon
      will be asked to rate their satisfaction with the sedation and analgesia for the fracture
      reduction using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not satisfied at all) to 10 (very satisfied).
      Recovery from sedation satisfactory for discharge home is indicated by a score of 10 on the
      Modified Aldrete Scale below, and the child can sit up unaided along with control of pain and
      vomiting. Family will be contacted via telephone 48 hours after their visit to assess for any
      late adverse effects.

      Adverse events will be documented on a data collection sheet using consensus-based
      definitions that include the event, time and any intervention employed. In addition, the
      subject will be asked about symptoms typically seen with procedural sedation and lidocaine
      toxicity including: vomiting, nausea, tinnitus, circumoral or tongue numbness, metallic taste
      in mouth, nystagmus, vision changes, muscle twitching, tremors, seizure, respiratory
      depression, chest pain, difficulty breathing, palpitations, ECG changes on monitor (type
      noted, ECG strip printed), and any other unpleasant or euphoric symptom.

    <description>The lidocaine will be injected into the fracture hematoma using buffered 1% lidocaine solution at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg (0.25 mL/kg), maximum dose 100 mg (10 mL). Using a 30-gauge needle to minimize pain, a small skin wheal of lidocaine will be injected over the fracture site. A 21-gauge needle will then be attached to the lidocaine filled syringe and passed through the skin wheal used to inject the lidocaine into the fracture hematoma. To confirm the needle is in the fracture hematoma, a small amount of blood from the hematoma will be aspirated into the syringe filled with lidocaine before injecting the lidocaine, as in standard practice.</description>
