  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 clinical trial investigates the effectiveness of cytokine-induced memory-like
      natural killer (CIML NK) cells in combination with FLAG chemotherapy as a treatment for
      refractory or relapsed AML. Previous studies in adults with AML sowed successful induction of
      remission and a previous phase 1 study demonstrated that CIML NK cells can be used safely in
      pediatric patients. This phase 2 study uses FLAG chemotherapy to lower leukemic burden and
      suppress the recipient's immune system to provide an optimal environment for CIML NK cell
      expansion and anti-leukemic activity.

    <description>-The recipient will begin a chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine, cytarabine and GCSF starting on Day -7. The haploidentical donor identified by HLA matching of the immediate family members will undergo non-mobilized large volume (20 L) leukapheresis on Day -1, and the NK cell product will be infused into the recipient on Day 0. CIML NK cells will be infused at maximum cell dose of 10 x 106/kg. Subcutaneous IL-2 will begin approximately 2-4 hours after infusion and will continue every other day through Day 12 for a total of 7 doses.</description>

    <description>-On Day -1 (one day before the planned NK cell infusion), peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected by a single standard apheresis over 4-5 hours (with a target volume of at least 20 L) from the identified haploidentical donor. The apheresis procedure will be done as per standard institutional procedures (which may include placement of a central line if necessary). If the goal minimum NK cell dose will not be met based on the initial assessment of the leukapheresis product, a second collection/procedure may be performed.</description>
