    <textblock>
      The GEHPPI study is a multicentre placebo controlled randomized controlled trial that aims to
      prevent early hypoglycaemia in preterm newborns born at ≤32 week's gestation. To do this we
      will prophylactically administer to these newborns either a small amount of dextrose 40% gel
      early as possible after birth via the buccal route in the delivery room or a placebo. We hope
      this dextrose gel will prevent hypoglycemia occurring during the time period needed for the
      newborns to be transported to the neonatal unit where they will have their venous access
      inserted.

    <textblock>
      Unborn babies receive their essential nutrition and energy from the umbilical cord connected
      to their mother. This allows them to grow and allows their vital organs to develop.
      Approximately 4,500 newborns (6% of all births) are born premature in Ireland each year.
      These babies are prematurely and unexpectedly separated from their mother's umbilical cord
      supply of nutrition and energy.

      Within this premature group are very and extremely premature newborns (less than 32 weeks and
      28 weeks gestation respectively at birth) who often weigh less than 1500g at birth. These
      newborns are admitted to the neonatal unit and their breathing is supported using machines
      and they are kept warm in incubators. They receive essential energy and nutrition as early as
      possible after birth. This is to prevent their blood glucose level from dropping too low
      (hypoglycemia) and to support their vital organs functioning correctly.

      As these newborns cannot suck and their mother's breast milk supply is initially low, we
      provide them with essential early energy by using an intravenous line. This supplies them
      with fluids containing dextrose. We also give these newborns any initial amount of mother's
      breast milk that is obtained as early as possible.

      Our research team in the Coombe Women &amp; Infants University Hospital recently looked at rates
      of hypoglycaemia in 90 very/extremely premature newborns born over 12 months. We found that
      50 newborns (56%) had early hypoglycemia (before they received their initial drip and
      fluids). Importantly 30 newborns (33%) had a blood glucose level that was so low as to
      require immediate rectification by the team (internationally known as the 'operative
      threshold' level).

      Our study aims to tackle this problem of early hypoglycemia in these vulnerable newborns. To
      do this we will give these newborns a small amount of 40% dextrose gel as early as possible
      after birth via the buccal route. They will absorb the gel through the small blood vessels
      located on the inside of their cheeks &amp; gums and it will enter their bloodstream quickly. We
      hope this gel will prevent hypoglycemia occurring during the time period needed for the
      newborns to be transported to the neonatal unit where they will have some form of venous
      access inserted.

      As this research is a trial we want to see if this dextrose gel has this beneficial effect or
      not. To do this we need to compare the dextrose gel to a non-sugar containing gel (called the
      &quot;placebo&quot;). The placebo gel will contain simple starch ingredient but does not contain sugar
      and will have no effect on blood glucose. Both gels used in the trial will look identical in
      appearance and neither the researcher nor the patient (nor parent/s) will know whether they
      received either the dextrose or the placebo gels. Which gel a newborn receives will be
      assigned at random, immediately prior to the birth. All newborns will be cared for in the
      same way according to best standard care.

      Newborns will not undergo any additional tests as part of the study. Blood glucose levels
      will be measured as per standard practice at the time the venous access is inserted. Patient
      data collected as part of the study will be anonymised and stored safely. Consent for
      participation can be withdrawn at any time.

    <description>Dextrose 40% gel will be given immediately following stabilisation (and/or resuscitation) at birth via buccal route. This will be prior to in-house transport from the Delivery Ward/Operating Room to the Neonatal Unit.
A standard total dose of 1ml of dextrose gel will be administered to each participant. Prior to administration, a single brief oral suction will be given (using routine suction catheter) and 1 dry wipe of inside of both cheeks. This will only be performed if the clinician caring for the newborn considers it appropriate to do so.
Half the dose of gel (0.5ml) will be squeezed onto the gloved finger (sterile gloves) of administering team member. This half dose will be given on one side of mouth. The remaining half dose (0.5ml) of gel will be administered to the other side of the mouth using a gloved finger. Administration is by massage into the buccal membrane.</description>
