  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are doing this research study to better understand the mechanism of action of colchicine,
      a drug commonly prescribed for gout. Precisely, we aim to evaluate the effect of colchicine
      on a specific protein (GDF15) blood levels at different timepoints after its administration.

      This research study will compare GDF15 blood levels after the administration of colchicine or
      placebo. The placebo looks exactly like colchicine but contains no active drug. During this
      study, participants may get a placebo instead of colchicine. Placebos are used in research
      studies to see if the results are due to the study drug or due to other reasons.

      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study evaluating the
      effect of a single FDA-approved dose of colchicine in healthy adults on plasma GDF15 levels.
      Randomization will be stratified by sex as this may be a factor influencing GDF15 levels.

      On Day 1, subjects will be admitted on the CCI 9A unit early in the morning, 30 minutes
      before the study drug administration. They will be asked to fast from midnight before the
      dose until 2 hours after. Water is allowed during the fasting period. Baseline blood tests
      will be drawn and a peripheral line will be left in place for further blood draws. A dose of
      either colchicine or placebo will be administered. Blood samples will be drawn at 2, 4, 6, 8,
      10 and 12 hours. The patient will be discharged home after the last blood draw and the
      removal of the peripheral line. Two other blood draws will be performed using standard
      procedures at 24 and 48 hours post study drug administration at the research clinic

          -  Participant able to understand and sign the informed consent of the study

          -  Healthy male or female aged from 18 to 50 years.

          -  Participant considered healthy after evaluation such as medical history and screening
             laboratories.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Use of colchicine within 28 days prior to study drug administration.

          -  Renal insufficiency (GFR &lt; 50 mL/min)

          -  Use of any drug or product known to interact with colchicine including CYP3A4 and/or
             P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors in the 14 days prior study drug administration, such
             as atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone,
             nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem,
             erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, cyclosporine and ranolazine.
             Significant consumption of grapefruit juice can also inhibit CYP3A4. Interactions may
             also be seen with fibrates (e.g., gemfibrozil), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)
             and digoxin.

          -  History of colchicine allergy.
