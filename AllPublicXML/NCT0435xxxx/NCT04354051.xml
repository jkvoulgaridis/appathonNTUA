  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pharmacodynamic proof of concept study investigating the physiological
      effects of systemic infusion of nitrite on coronary blood flow using MRI.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a healthy volunteer, proof of concept study.

      The participant will have blood taken and this will be analysed for baseline levels of
      nitrate, nitrite and nitroso species. They will then have a baseline MRI to assess coronary
      flow in normoxia. Next, hypoxia will be induced using 12% oxygen/88% nitrogen. The
      participant will then have a baseline MRI to assess coronary flow in hypoxia (3 breath-hold
      image captures).

      After all baseline images have been captured, the investigators will commence an intravenous
      nitrite sodium infusion, dose 70μmol, of 5 minute duration (14μmol /min-1). At the 5th
      minute, the participant have a further MRI image to assess coronary flow with the
      intervention in normoxia (3 breath-hold image captures).

      A 10-minute washout will follow (with the half-life of nitrite being documented as 110
      seconds). There will be optional repeat 3 breath-hold image captures at 5 minutes and at 10
      minutes.

      Next hypoxia will be induced using 12% oxygen/88% nitrogen again. The investigators will
      commence a second intravenous nitrite sodium infusion, dose 70μmol, 5 minute duration (14μmol
      /min-1). At the 5th minute, the participant will have a further MRI image to assess coronary
      flow with the intervention in hypoxia (3 breath-hold image captures).

      At the end of the study the participant will have blood taken and this will be analysed for
      repeat levels of nitrate, nitrite and nitroso species.

      All interventions will be performed by fully trained and competent medical staff.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of systemic sodium nitrite on the degree of vasorelaxation (captured by taking 4 sets of MRI images on the same study day, within a 2-hour window) in the coronary vessels in normoxia and hypoxia in healthy participants</measure>
    <time_frame>All data and images collected on study day within a 2-hour time window. All study days are now complete.</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured on the study day through the acquisition of 4 set of separate MRI images (each image set acquisition duration 3-5 minutes). 4 conditions for image acquisition: normoxia without nitrite, hypoxia without nitrite, normoxia with nitrite and hypoxia with nitrite. Images captured using coronary MRI.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in systemic levels of nitrate, nitrite and nitroso species after intravenous sodium nitrite infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Anticipated within 1 year of study completion</time_frame>
    <description>This is anticipated to take place within 1 year of completion of the study via ozone-based chemiluminescence or high performance liquid chromatography. The data will show the change in nitrate, nitrite and nitroso species levels in the study participants plasma before and after the nitrite infusion.</description>
