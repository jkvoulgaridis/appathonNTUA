    <textblock>
      This trial assesses the safety of TEV-48125 when subcutaneously self-administered in Japanese
      migraine patients using an autoinjector (AI) at home. Each subject will subcutaneously
      self-administer TEV 48125 at 225 mg/1.5 mL (150 mg/mL) once monthly for a total of 2 doses.
      The first dose will be self-administered at the trial site under the supervision of the
      investigator and the second dose will be self-administered at home.

0 :All drug solution has been injected
: Approximately 1/4 of the drug solution remaining
: Approximately 1/2 of the drug solution remaining
: Approximately 3/4 of the drug solution remaining

    <description>Leakage of drug solution on the skin are recorded based on the checklist as the execution status.
[Leakage of drug solution on the skin after subcutaneous injection]
0 :No sign of drug solution on the skin
: Slight wetness on the skin (mist)
: Approx. 1/5 (0.3 mL) of the drug solution observed on the skin (most of the drug solution subcutaneously administered)
: Approx. 1/2 (0.75 mL) of the drug solution observed on the skin (ie, approx. 1/2 of drug solution subcutaneously administered)
: Almost all of the drug solution observed on the skin (ie, little or no drug solution subcutaneously administered)</description>

    <description>Subject compliance with the self-administration procedure will be evaluated based on information recorded on a checklist.And frequency distributions will be summerized .Compliance with each of the procedures during IMP preparation, injection administration, and after injection will be verified by checking the &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; responses marked for each item on the checklist. Based on this checklist, the investigator will judge adherence to self-adminstration procedure.</description>
