  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixty girls participated in this study and their main complaints were pain and cramping
      during menstruation. They were divided randomly into two equal groups.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group (A) (30 girls) treated by kinesiotaping during menstruation for 3 successive
      menstruation. Group (B) (30 girls) treated by pilate exercises, 3 sessions per week for 3
      months except the days of menstruation. Visual analogue scale to assess pain intensity,
      Quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire, Menstrual Distress Questionnaire,
      WALIDD score, Spielberger questionnaire and blood sample analysis to estimate plasma
      prostaglandin level were applied for each girl in both groups before and after the treatment
      course.
