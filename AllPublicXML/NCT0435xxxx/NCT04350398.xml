  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common women's cancer and the third leading cause of death.
      Advances in prevention, detection and primary treatment have improved overall survival
      leading to its growing acceptance as a long-term disease. Following the announcement of
      breast cancer, but also after primary treatment, some symptoms appear directly compromising
      psychic and physical spheres. Hippotherapy is an emerging specialized rehabilitation approach
      performed through specially trained horses by accredited health professionals. The proposed
      hippotherapy program offers key elements for physical, psychic and social reinforcement,
      complementing conventional care. The aim is to provide patients with tools to consolidate
      their self-awareness and thus strengthen their ability to cope with the disease.

      Following the announcement and evolution of breast cancer, but also in response to primary
      treatment, some symptoms appear to directly compromise the psychic and/or physical sphere of
      the individual. Current rehabilitation programs are not sufficiently oriented to solve most
      of these symptoms. Hippotherapy is an emerging specialized rehabilitation approach, performed
      on a specially trained horse by accredited health professionals (e.g. medical doctors,
      physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychomotricians, speech-language pathologists,
      clinical psychologists). The horse is an excellent collaborator in situations of physical and
      psychic disability, whether temporary or consolidated. It provides human support for
      impairments (anatomical or physiological), activity limitations, and participation
      restrictions as defined by WHO. Hippotherapy has a direct action on the sensorimotor
      capacities of the individual but also on his cognitive abilities, i.e. attention, memory,
      psychomotricity, emotion, perception, sequencing of complex movements, self-experience,
      psychic temporality. Overall, the strong solicitation of the sensory and motor spheres
      promotes and interacts with the mechanisms related to the execution of tasks in the cognitive
      domain through the interactions of several neural networks. A randomized simple-blinded
      controlled trial on hippotherapy versus conventional care will be carried out. After giving
      their informed consent, patients will be enrolled in the trial. The 6-months program includes
      1-week daily sessions of hippotherapy by the end of the initial cancer treatment followed by
      three short 2-days sessions with an interval of 2 months between each. The study will focus
      on 86 patients. Recruitment will be done over a 48-months' period. A battery of
      self-administered questionnaires will allow to study both the functional and psychological
      outcome. The primary end point will be quality of life, whereas body image, fatigue, anxiety,
      depression and cognitive performances will be the secondary end points.

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized simple-blind controlled trial on efficacy of the hippotherapy treatment against conventional one will be conducted. Patients selected will be randomly divided into 2 groups: hippotherapy treated group versus control group. To ensure that patients in the 2 groups are similar in all respects, except for the planned intervention, the randomization will be stratified by age (18- 44, 45-55, ≥56) representing respectively three stages: 1) Pre-menopause; 2) Peri-menopause; 3) Post-menopause; and by type of treatment: A) Single treatment: surgery or chemotherapy or hormone therapy or radiotherapy; B) Two or more treatments.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Data will be collected on the Montpellier Institut du Sein site by relying on the CRA who will follow up and check the information in due time of the self-questionnaires. The data will be duly anonymized and handled blindly. Data will be centralized on a secure server at the Equiphoria Institute. Their processing and analysis will be carried out blindly by the PI or by a private service provider (Biostatem France)</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of life through EORTC QLQ-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the beginning of the protocol; after the first 1-week session; at the end of the last session at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire was designed to be cancer specific, multidimensional in structure, suitable for self-administration (brief and easy to complete), and applicable in a wide range of cultural contexts. The scores ranges from 0 to 100, a higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Body image representation through Body Image Scale (BIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the beginning of the protocol; after the first 1-week session; at the end of the last session at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire focuses on patients' emotional and behavioral experiences of their body image, resulting from cancer and treatment, including aspects of perceived physical appearance, body integrity, and seduction capacity. The total score ranges from 0 to 30. A higher score means a higher level of body image disturbance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Fatigue sensation through Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the beginning of the protocol; after the first 1-week session; at the end of the last session at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>MFI seems to be one of the best questionnaires to provide a fatigue profile. Its psychometric properties have been studied in different populations and it is easy to administer. Score ranges from 0 to 100. Higher total scores correspond with more acute levels of fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in anxiety and depression through Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the beginning of the protocol; after the first 1-week session; at the end of the last session at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was constructed excluding any item concerning somatic aspects, aspects that could be confused between physical and mental illness. It is a self-questionnaire to be completed according to oneself condition during the past week. Score ranges from 0 to 21 for each item. Higher total scores correspond to presence of the respective state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Cognitive sphere assessment through Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the beginning of the protocol; after the first 1-week session; at the end of the last session at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questions are grouped into six cognitive domains (memory, verbal fluency, concentration, mental sharpness, resistance to interference, multitasking ability) and two sub-criteria (visibility of the disorder by the entourage, impact on the quality of life). 37-item ranging from 0 to 4 consist of four subscales. Higher scores represent better functioning.</description>

    <description>During the initial week of intervention, sessions will be mainly carried on horseback. We will use the movement of the horse: (i) to allow patient re-appropriating her body and find harmony; (ii) to initiate rehabilitation of movements (shoulder, neck, upper extremity, whole body), gesture and femininity. The goal is to reconstruct a harmonic body image both in the private and public sphere, through different techniques. A few walking sessions may be needed to reinforce some landmarks.
During the short stages the work will be mainly done by walking alongside the horse. These reinforcement periods act like a trampoline, necessary to have a new momentum providing the opportunity to take a step back from the everyday, to regenerate somehow. The reaction time is generally optimized considering the imprint done during the initial long stage. One of the main themes that come up during this period is fear (relapse, the future, not achieving the goals, pain, relationship issues, etc.).</description>

    <description>The horse is an excellent collaborator in situations of physical and mental disability, whether temporary or consolidated. It provides support to humans towards an impairment (anatomical or physiological), a disability, or a restriction of participation as defined by the WHO in 2001. Hippotherapy has a direct action on the sensorimotor capacities of the individual but also on their cognitive capacities, such as attention, memory, psychomotricity, emotions, perceptions, the sequencing of complex movements, or the experience of oneself and the functions of time. Overall, the strong demand from the sensitive, sensory and motor spheres promotes and interacts with the mechanisms linked to the execution of tasks in the cognitive domain (memory, attention, executive functions, speed of information processing, etc.) through the interactions of several neural networks.</description>
