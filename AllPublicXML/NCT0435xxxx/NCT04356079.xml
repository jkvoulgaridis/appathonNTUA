  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a chronic neurological disease characterized by recurrent moderate to severe
      headaches often in association with a number of autonomic nervous system symptoms. Migraines
      are believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors. About two-thirds of
      cases run in families. Changing hormone levels may also play a role, as migraines affect
      slightly more boys than girls before puberty, but about two to three times more women than
      men after puberty. The risk of migraines usually decreases during pregnancy. The exact
      mechanisms of migraine are not known. It is, however, believed to be a neurovascular
      disorder. The primary theory is related to increased excitability of the cerebral cortex and
      abnormal control of pain neurons in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem.

      Environmental influences play a role, but family studies suggest that defective genes may be
      primarily involved in disease causation. The mode of transmission of typical migraine in
      families is still unclear, but it is widely believed to be multifactorial although a role for
      a major susceptibility gene cannot be excluded. Aim of study: we aim to study the familial
      risk for developed migraine and its relation to EEG changes.
