  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block performed with the costoclavicular (CC) approach
      and the lateral sagittal (LS) approach will be compared in patients scheduled for forearm and
      hand surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CC approach is a recently introduced infraclavicular approach that targets three cords
      (medial, lateral and posterior) located lateral to the axillary artery in the costoclavicular
      space. Cords in this space are located more superficially than with the classical approach at
      the lateral infraclavicular fossa and are clustered but maintain a consistent anatomical
      relationship with each other. We hypothesized that CC block may provide a successful and
      rapid onset of the blockade with a single injection of the same volume of local anesthetic
      used in the lateral sagittal approach.

      Patients will be divided into two groups:

      Group LS: Ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block - lateral sagittal approach (20 ml 0.5%
      bupivacaine)

      Group CC: Ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block - costoclavicular approach (20 ml 0.5%
      bupivacaine)
