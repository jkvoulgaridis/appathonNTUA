  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to confirm or refute the role of passive immunization
      as a safe and efficacious therapy in preventing the progression from mild to severe/critical
      COVID-19 illness and to understand the immunologic kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
      after passive immunization.The primary objective is to determine the efficacy and safety of a
      single dose of convalescent plasma (CP) for preventing the progression from mild to severe
      COVID-19 illness. The secondary objective is to characterize the immunologic response to CP
      administration.

      This study will adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with mild, symptomatic,
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness, who are at high risk for progression to
      severe/critical illness, but who are clinically stable for outpatient management at
      randomization.

    <description>This scale was developed by a special World Health Organization (WHO) committee for quantifying COVID-19 illness severity.
8 = Death
7 = Hospitalized, intubated, mechanically ventilated and requiring additional organ support (pressors, renal replacement therapy)
6 = Hospitalized, intubated and mechanically ventilated
5 = Hospitalized on non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula
4 = Hospitalized on supplemental oxygen by mask or nasal prongs
3 = Hospitalized not on supplemental oxygen
2 = Not hospitalized with limitation in activity (continued symptoms)
1 = Not hospitalized without limitation in activity (no symptoms)</description>

    <description>Time to disease progression on the COVID Outpatient Ordinal Outcome Scale censored at 15 days after randomization. Scale provides more granular detail for outpatients than the WHO scale (adapted from Harrell and Lindsell, 2020). Worsening of symptoms is defined as any subject admitted to the hospital (level 1), seen in the emergency room (level 2), a patient who reports increased symptoms of 2 levels on the scale over a 24 hour period, or a patient who reports increased symptoms of 1 level observed for a 48 hour period.
COVID Outpatient Ordinal Outcomes Scale
1 = patient requires care in the hospital
2 = patient requires care in the ED or urgent care
3 = patient at home with symptoms rated as moderate (defined as fever, shortness of breath, abdominal pain)
4 = patient at home with symptoms rated as mild (defined as afebrile, constitutional symptoms (flu-like illness) without shortness
5 = patient in their usual state of health</description>
