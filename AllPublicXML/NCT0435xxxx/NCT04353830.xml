    <description>Several dose levels will be evaluated for IBI939 administered as a single agent and in combination with Sintilimab. IBI939 will be given via intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit. Those who discontinue treatment with single-agent IBI939 may receive combination treatment with Sintilimab or IBI939+ Sintilimab. Combination treatment may continue until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit.</description>
