  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are comparing the ease of use and repeatability of the force vs electrical
      activity produced by a muscle after it has undergone nerve stimulation during a surgical
      procedure in which the patients' arm movement is restricted (placed under surgical drapes) in
      laparoscopic or robotic procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; or = 18 years old

          -  Patients willing to participate and provide an informed consent

          -  Patients undergoing an elective laparoscopic or robotic surgical procedure that
             requires use of NMBA agents administered intraoperatively.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with disorders, such as stroke, carpal tunnel syndrome, broken wrist with
             nerve damage, Dupuytren contracture, or any similar wrist injury.

          -  Patients with systemic neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis

          -  Patients with significant organ dysfunction that can significantly affect
             pharmacokinetics of neuromuscular blocking and reversal agents, i.e., severe renal
             impairment or end-stage liver disease.

          -  Patients having surgery that would involve prepping the arm or leg into the sterile
             field
