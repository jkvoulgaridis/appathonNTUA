  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle weakness or atrophy is a common condition following acute and chronic musculoskeletal
      injuries. Strength training is an imperative component in clinical rehabilitation of
      musculoskeletal injuries. Heavy exercise loads (approximately 70% of one repetition maximum)
      is necessary to elicit muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. However, patients with severe
      muscle atrophy are frequently unable to tolerate these loads due to pain. Blood flow
      resistance training with low resistance loads may be used to safely develop muscle strength.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a safe type of low intensity resistance exercise
      that has demonstrated enhanced muscle growth, muscle strength, oxygen delivery and
      utilization (VO2Max). With BFRT, lighter loads can be used to build muscle while sparing the
      joints from heavy loading and without overly fatiguing the central nervous system.

      The objectives of BFRT are 1) to increase the effectiveness of physical therapy, 2) safely
      increase muscle mass, reduce arterial stiffness, increase bone density, increase Vo2Max,
      improve carotid arterial compliance and enhance response of the autonomic nervous system, 3)
      improve muscle endurance in 1/3 the time, improve strength and hypertrophy after surgery,
      improve muscle recruitment and increase anabolic growth signaling.

    <description>Blood flow resistance training will be performed with a standard blood pressure cuff that is placed and inflated by a clinician. The patient will perform 4 exercises with low resistance loads that will produce a muscle burn to enhance promotion of strength. Training will be supervised in the clinic. The cuff is deflated between exercises.</description>
