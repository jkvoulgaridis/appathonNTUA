  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To use novel methods for quantitative analysis of VFSS (videofluoroscopic swallow study, also
      known as modified barium swallow) to study and compare dysphagia in patients treated for head
      and neck carcinoma with concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy (cisplatin) or targeted
      therapy (cetuximab) vs. immunotherapy (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or durvalumab).

      Our hypothesis is that pharyngeal constriction will be greater (lower ratio) with concurrent
      immunotherapy compared to chemotherapy, as measured by the pharyngeal constriction ratio
      (PCR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The QUASAR study will use a prospective, observational, cross sectional design (See Schema).
      HNC patients treated with definitive RT and immunotherapy or chemotherapy (cetuximab or
      cisplatin) will undergo VFSS at 4-6 and 12-24 months post-treatment. Patients enrolled prior
      to 6 months after finishing therapy will undergo a swallow study during the 4-6 month period
      AND the 12-24 month period. Patients enrolled after 6 months after finishing therapy will
      undergo a single swallow study in the 12-24 month period. The primary endpoint of PCR at
      12-24 months will be compared between patients treated with immunotherapy versus
      chemotherapy.

      All patients with HNC treated with definitive RT and systemic therapy at our institution will
      be eligible. In particular, we will recruit patients for this study from participants in two
      ongoing trials investigating the use of concurrent immunotherapy. The KEYCHAIN trial
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03383094) randomizes patients with locally advanced p16+
      HNC undergoing definitive RT to concurrent q3 week cisplatin versus concurrent and adjuvant
      pembrolizumab. NRG-HN004 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03258554) is a cooperative group
      trial that compares HNC patients that are not eligible for cisplatin undergoing definitive
      radiation therapy to concurrent cetuximab versus durvalumab.

    <description>To compare swallowing function between systemic therapies with additional quantitative metrics of swallowing dysfunction from the VFSS including TPT, PRR and PPWT.
The presence of aspiration or strictures on VFSS will be compared as binary variables between groups using Pearson's Chi squared test.</description>

    <measure>Correlation between quantitative swallowing function and patient reported symptoms using the EAT-10 tool</measure>
    <time_frame>12-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>To compare patient reported assessments of swallowing function with the EAT-10 tool between systemic therapies.
To test if there is correlation between the quantitative VFSS metrics and patient reported outcomes on the EAT-10 index, we will calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient and plot the results on a correlation matrix. The Holm step down procedure will be used to adjust for multiple testing to control the family-wise error rate at 0.05 level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between radiation dose and location of swallowing function and quantitative swallowing function</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this aim is to evaluate the effect of radiation dose on swallowing structures, applying a previously developed space-preserving NTCP approach based on principal component analysis (PCA).
Using this approach, dose distributions to the global swallowing apparatus (i.e. pharynx, larynx and esophagus) will be standardized for patients from both arms of Aim 1, using deformable registration to standardize organs and 3-D dose distributions to a common template. Dose distributions will be converted into a dose array and PCA will be applied to the dose array, as previously described. We will then use PC linear regression to identify eigenvectors significantly associated with long term dysphagia (as measured by PCR).</description>
