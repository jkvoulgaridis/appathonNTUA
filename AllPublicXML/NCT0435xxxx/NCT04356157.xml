  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), in 2018 there were 37.9 million
      people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. More than two-thirds of PLWH live in Sub-Saharan
      Africa (SSA), where the HIV prevalence in the adult population (aged 15-49) is 3.9%.
      Furthermore, 1.3 million pregnant women living with HIV of which 82% received Antiretroviral
      Therapy (ART) for Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV.

      In these countries the major critical issue is represented by low level of adherence to
      treatment particularly in HIV positive pregnant women. Among the causes, the lack of male
      partner involvement represents a significant criticality. This critical issue emerge strongly
      in Malawi, one of the countries with the highest prevalence of HIV in the world: 9.2% of the
      adult population living with HIV in 2018.

      Objective: The objective of the study is to assess three different interventions aimed at
      improving adherence and retention to ART therapy among HIV positive women through engagement
      with their life partner in four Malawian healthcare centres.

      Methods: The prospective, controlled before-and-after study is articulated in three phases
      (total 24 months): pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention analyses. The number
      of selected clusters (clinical centres) is limited to four, one for each intervention plus a
      cluster where no intervention will be performed (control arm). The interventions are 1)
      opening the facility on Saturday a month, only for men, defined &quot;special day&quot;; 2) testing
      peer-to-peer counselling among men, &quot;male champions&quot;; 3) providing incentive to all women
      accompanied by their partners at the facility, &quot;nudge&quot;.

      The primary outcome of the study is the evaluation of the variations in retention in care and
      women's adherence to therapeutic protocols; the intermediate outcome is the assessment of the
      variations in Male Involvement (MI).

      The level of MI in the health of female partners (intermediate outcome) will be evaluated
      through a dedicated questionnaire administered at baseline and in the post-intervention
      phase. Data will be collected at the clinical centres and will be stored in two electronic
      databases managed through two different types of software.

      Results: Analysis of data collected in the four centres during the pre-intervention phase is
      on-going as the enrolment is stopped 31st March 2020. Total patients enrolled are 452 (133
      Namandanje: 133, Kapeni: 78, Kapire: 75, Balaka: 166). Meantime, several meetings are
      performed in the centres to organize the intervention phase.

      Conclusions: The study will identified the better intervention to involve male partners in
      women's health according to an approach based on a broad spectrum of behaviours. The results
      of the study will be shared with local and central health institutions in the country, to
      reach the larger spread of possible identification of good practices.

    <intervention_model_description>The three interventions to be implemented and evaluated in the research plan are designed to assess the involvement of MI at individual level, interpersonal/network, community-level, Health System and structural level according to ecological model.
The study is articulated in three phases: pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention analyses. In the pre-intervention analysis, the baseline situation of the three participating centres will be evaluated. The aim of this phase is to set a starting point in order to weigh the relative effect of each intervention to be studied. In each clinical centre baseline data will be collected. In order to evaluate the effect of the interventions, the same indicators will be measured in pre-and in post-intervention phase. The enrollment of participants will be consecutively based on the order of patient appointments.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Retention in care will be measured as the cumulative proportion of dropouts from the treatment program at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years (excluding patients transferred to another centre or those who died). Adherence will be measured through the following indicators: (1) The cumulative proportion of medical appointments missed in a month period in the centre; (2) the cumulative proportion of appointments for drug delivery missed in a month period in the centre; (3) the cumulative proportion of women who suppressed viral load; (4) the cumulative proportion of women with a suppressed viral load that have a re-bound in viremia.</description>

Usually, this role is covered by the female Expert Clients, namely HIV+ patients working in the organization as volunteers after appropriate training. Some men among patients who are on treatment will be identified and trained to cover this role.</description>
