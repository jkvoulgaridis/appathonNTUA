  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate standard of care exercise education alone or in
      combination with a wearable physical activity tracker in people with epilepsy (PWE) to
      determine the most effective way to increase physical activity and measure impact on
      depression, anxiety, quality of life, sleep, and seizure frequency.

    <description>In addition to the standard of care exercise education, participants in the activity tracker group will be provided a Fitbit physical activity tracker at no cost to the participants. They will be asked to download the Fitbit application (app) to their personal smartphone device to allow them to see their own data collected by the Fitbit. They will also be asked to download the Stridekick app for the purpose of sharing their activity tracker data electronically with the study team and having the opportunity to participate in fitness challenges through the app. App accounts will be created by the participants with usernames that do not contain the participant's identifiable personal information. Optional fitness challenges will be created once per month by the study investigators, and participants will also receive a weekly message of encouragement from the study team.</description>
