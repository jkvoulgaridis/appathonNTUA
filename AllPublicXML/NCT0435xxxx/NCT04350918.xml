  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is becoming increasingly common throughout the world with a considerable impact on
      individuals, communities, health-care systems and businesses (Hoy et al, 2011).Neck pain is a
      common problem within our society affecting individual's physical and social functioning
      considerably and interfering with the patient's daily activities. There is lack of evidence
      to allow conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of MET when compared with stretching
      exercises for relieving mechanical neck pain. Therefore, this study is designed to examine
      the effect of MET, static stretching and to compare their effects on pain intensity and
      functional disability in patient with mechanical neck pain.

      This experimental study purposively recruited 24 subjects (male: n=10, female: n = 14) with
      mechanical neck pain from the Outpatient Physiotherapy Department of the Obafemi Awolowo
      University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife. Subjects were randomly allocated into the MET
      and SS groups. Subjects in MET group received 6 treatment sessions of Muscle Energy Technique
      in addition to conventional physiotherapy treatments. Patients in SS group received 6
      treatment sessions of Static Stretching in addition to conventional physiotherapy treatments.
      All subjects were treated twice a week for six weeks. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Neck
      Disability Index (NDI) were used to assess the pain intensity and functional disability at
      baseline, 3rd week and 6th week of treatment sessions respectively. Descriptive and
      Inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Alpha level was set at &lt; 0.05.

    <description>VAS is a one-dimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations, including those with rheumatic diseases (Mc Cormack et al, 1988). pain intensity as none, mild, moderate, or severe, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm) (Aun et al, 1986)</description>

    <time_frame>From March 2019 to November 2019, The treatment for each patient was for 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI can be scored as a raw score or doubled and expressed as a percent (Vernon, 1991). Each session is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No Pain' and 5 means 'Worst Imaginable Pain'. All the points can be summarized as a total score. The test can be interpreted as a raw score with a maximum score of 50 or as a percentage.</description>

    <description>MET Group received 12 treatment sessions of MET (Nagrale et al, 2010) two times a week in addition to conventional physiotherapy. The procedures employ voluntary muscle contractions by the patient in a precisely controlled direction and intensity against a counterforce applied by the Physiotherapist. The technique requires the therapist to provide stabilization to the segment on which the distal aspect of the muscle attaches. A command for anisometric contraction of the muscle is given that causes accessory movement of the joint. Several specific muscle energy techniques are described for the subcranial region of the cervical spine.</description>

    <description>Subjects in SS Group received 12 treatment sessions of static stretching (Dutton et al, 2008) two times a week in addition to conventional physiotherapy.
Stretching involves the application of manual or mechanical force to elongate structures that have adaptively shortened and are hypo-mobile (Sullivan, 2007) Static stretching involves stretching a muscle to a point of discomfort and holding the stretch for a length of time, followed by a return to normal resting muscle length (Andrews et al, 2004). Muscles of the neck were stretched in especially in side flexion, extension, flexion and side rotation for 10 seconds and was repeated 10 times for a session.</description>
