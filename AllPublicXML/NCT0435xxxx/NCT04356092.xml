  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A custom-made, 2D-perfusion digital subtraction angiography (PDSA) algorithm has been
      designed and implemented towards foot perfusion quantification following endovascular
      treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI), in order to assist intra-procedural
      decision-making and enhance clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, study investigating the feasibility of 2D-PDSA using
      newly-developed, non-commercially available, color-coded software for the quantification of
      foot perfusion following infrapopliteal angioplasty for the treatment of CLI. In total, 7
      consecutive patients scheduled to undergo infrapopliteal endovascular treatment of CLI were
      enrolled. Perfusion Blood Volume (PBV), Mean Transit Time (MTT), and Perfusion Blood Flow
      (PBF) maps were extracted by analyzing Time-Intensity Curves and signal intensity on the
      perfused vessel mask. Mean values calculated from user-specified ROIs on perfusion maps were
      employed to evaluate the patient's pre- and post- endovascular treatment condition.

    <description>Consecutive patients scheduled to undergo infrapopliteal angioplasty or stenting, or both, as part of their standard treatment for Rutherford-Becker class 5 and 6 chronic limb-threatening ischemia, were included in the study. All procedures were performed using local anesthesia. An antegrade access was used in all patients followed by the deployment of a 5 or 6 Fr arterial sheaths. A semi-lateral foot projection was preferred and the pre-revascularization DSA of the foot was performed via a 5 Fr angiographic catheter placed at the distal third of the popliteal artery. Following revascularization of one or more tibial arteries, the catheter was placed at the same popliteal segment and post-procedural DSA of the foot was performed following the exact pre-revascularization injection protocol at the same semi-lateral projection. The 2D-perfusion imaging and analysis of the DICOM files was performed after revascularization.</description>
