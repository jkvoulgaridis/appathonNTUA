  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many Muslim patients with diabetes observe dawn to sunset fasting during the month of
      Ramadan. Hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia are possible problems amongst these patients. The
      aim of this study is to investigate glucose profiles in diabetes and non-diabetes patients
      that decided to fast or not to fast during Ramadan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A good knowledge of the profiles of blood glucose with different treatments can help in
      making Ramadan fasting free of unwanted effects for such patients. Previous studies,
      including the EPIDIAR have shown an increased risk of hypo- and hyperglycaemia in patients
      with diabetes who fast during the Holy month of Ramadan.Although self-monitoring of blood
      glucose (SMBG) is useful in fasting diabetes patients when used within a structured testing
      regimen, it requires a lot of effort and compliance from the patient and doesn't provide
      continuous blood glucose data. The amount of data provided using SMBG depends on the
      frequency of finger pricks measurements. Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) sensors provide a
      record of the individual's glucose levels, trends and patterns for up to 14 days. This sensor
      doesn't require calibration using finger pricks. FGM data show how day-to-day decisions and
      behaviours impact the control of blood sugar levels. Availability of FGM makes it possible to
      explore glucose profiles in a continuous fashion during Ramadan period and make comparisons
      with non-fasting times outside Ramadan. The aim of this study is to investigate glucose
      profiles in diabetes and non-diabetes patients that decided to fast or not to fast during
      Ramadan. The study will compare several parameters extracted from the FGM trace such us the
      incident of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, standard deviation, coefficient of variance and
      time in/above/below range. For this purpose the FreeStyle Libre sensor will be used. Patients
      will be asked to use the FreeStyle Libre sensor for a period of 3 months: 1 month before
      Ramadan, during Ramadan and one month after Ramadan.
