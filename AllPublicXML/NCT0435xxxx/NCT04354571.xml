  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip Surgery in pediatric patients is considered an extremely painful procedure. Managing pain
      in this surgery is challenging even with several available options, each with limitations.
      Erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a novel technique that has been used in different types
      of surgery, with promising results. Many case reports for use of ESPB are available in the
      literature but to our knowledge, no cohort studies or randomized controlled trials have been
      performed on ESPB for hip surgery in pediatrics age group against a traditional method as
      caudal block.1,2 AIM OF WORK

      . The Primary outcome of this study is to compare the efficacy of analgesia resulting from
      the Erector spinae plane block versus the caudal block in pediatric patients undergoing hip
      surgery using the FLACC score and the duration of the analgesia of both methods till the
      first rescue analgesic.

      The Secondary outcome is to compare the analgesic rescue frequency and total dose given in
      both groups as well as comparing the complications that might occur from each analgesic
      technique.

    <description>An ultrasound-guided Erector spinae plane block was performed with the patient lying on the his side and the surgical side on the top. After skin disinfection, sterile draping was be placed and the ultrasound probe was sheathed. The level of the block was the transverse process of L2. The block was performed using a 9-12 MHz linear probe (LOGIQe, GE Healthcare, USA), which was placed in a parasagittal plane 1 cm from the posterior midline. The deep plane to the erector spinae muscle (ESM) was identified, and a 22 G, 50 mm insulated needle (Sonoplex Stim, Pajunk, Germany) was inserted cranio-caudally in plane between the transverse process and the fascia of the ESM. After negative aspiration, 0.3 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine was injected to confirm the correct position by visualizing the solution lifting the ESM off the transverse process.</description>
