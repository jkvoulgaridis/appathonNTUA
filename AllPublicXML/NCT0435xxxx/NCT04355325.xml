  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of implant therapy has been presented in the majority of clinical studies by
      focusing only on implant survival without providing detailed information on the
      reconstructions . However, for decision making, it is important to know the survival rates
      and the incidence of biological and technical complications not only for the implants but
      also for the reconstructions. Thus, the selection of restoration materials should be based on
      proper optical characteristics in addition to biocompatibility and sufficient strength of
      materials.

      Monolithic zirconia has been used in posterior region, especially for single crowns, in order
      to eliminate the veneer cracking, But Since monolithic zirconia are relatively new, few
      randomized, controlled clinical studies have evaluated their success. There is only one study
      identified regarding the performance of monolithic ceramic restorations bonded to Ti inserts,
      investigating the clinical outcome of using monolithic or modified monolithic zirconia
      implant-supported single crowns and comparing outcomes and complications of metal-ceramic and
      monolithic or modified monolithic zirconia implant supported single crowns.

      More clinical studies to evaluate the performance of CAD/CAM monolithic implant-supported
      restorations bonded to Ti inserts and bases and compare their survival, success and
      complication rates with other restorative options [with a mean follow-up period of at least 5
      years are required for a meaningful interpretation of the survival and complication rate .

      So this study aims to investigate outcomes and complications of implant supported modified
      monolithic zirconia and metal-ceramic single crowns in the posterior region of the mouth.

      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between modified monolithic zirconia and
      metal-ceramic posterior implant-supported SCs in prosthetic complication rates.

      Background: Dental implants restored with single crowns (SCs) have been reported to have a
      comparable survival rate and fewer technical complications compared to multiple-unit
      implant-supported FDPs. Porcelain-fused to metal restorations were the golden standard option
      for implant supported reconstructions in the past, but nowadays, the application of
      all-ceramic restorations in general and specifically zirconia as a restorative material for
      implant-supported single crowns has increased utilizing the CAD/CAM technology. The
      continuous technological progress in both the computer-based development and the dental
      manufacturing process ensures new opportunities in the clinical workflow. A fully digital
      pathway in a model-free approach or a combination of these workflows is now possible.

      Purpose: The purpose of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to investigate the
      prosthetic outcomes of posterior implant-supported single crowns (SCs) with a modified
      monolithic zirconia or metal-ceramic design utilizing the digital workflow at 1, 3 and 5
      years of loading.

      Materials and methods: This single-blind split mouth study will enroll 60 participants,
      having to receive 120 dental Implants. They will be scheduled for a bilateral posterior
      single-unit prosthetic rehabilitation supported by one implant in the posterior region of the
      maxilla or the mandible (premolars, molars). A fully digital pathway will be followed. A CT
      scan will be performed without any template. An intraoral optical impression using CEREC
      Omnicam scanner will be made. A virtual set-up of the prosthetic reconstruction, as well as a
      surgical template with optimal 3-D implant positioning will be designed then printed using a
      3-D printer without the need of any physical model. Straumann bone level implants with either
      a wide diameter (Ø4.8 mm) or regular diameter (Ø4.1 mm) with a minimum length of 8 mm will be
      inserted. Implants will be loaded after 3 months of submerged healing. A second intraoral
      optical impression will be made using CEREC Omnicam scanner and Straumann scanbody. The
      implant-supported prosthetic suprastructure will be designed. Implants will be randomly
      allocated to either the test group modified monolithic zirconia crowns (MMZ) or the control
      group metal ceramic crowns (MC), using a computer-generated randomization list. A digital
      model with movable dies will be 3-D printed, then used to adjust restoration in terms of
      occlusal and proximal contacts. Prefabricated screw-retained Titanium abutments (Variobase
      Abutment; Straumann) will be used as the metal substructures of the crowns and will be
      secured to lab analogues on the digitally printed casts. Metal/ zirconia substructures with a
      hole for the screw retention will be designed using the CAD software and will be anatomically
      reduced by 1 mm to allow for porcelain veneering then will be laser-printed/ dry milled. Hand
      layering of glass ceramic will be made on the surface. Crowns will be cemented extraorally to
      titanium abutments using dual cure resin cement to make one-piece screw-retained single
      crown. The screw-retained single crowns and titanium abutments will be inserted intraorally
      with 35 Ncm torque and screw-access holes will be restored with Teflon and light-polymerized
      composite resin. The implant-supported SCs will be examined after 1, 3 and 5 years for
      survival and technical complications.

      Clinical significance: to evaluate the survival and prosthetic complication rates of
      zirconia-ceramic and metal-ceramic implant-supported single crowns at 1, 3 and 5 years of
      service. In addition to that, the digital workflow for implant supported single crowns will
      be evaluated for efficiency, accuracy, time and cost compared to conventional workflow.
