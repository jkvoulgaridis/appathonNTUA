  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present proposal is to implement and evaluate a new model for mobile phone
      supported and family-centred rehabilitation intervention (F@ce 2.0) with regard to
      functioning in activities in daily living and participation in everyday life among persons
      with stroke and their families in rural and urban areas in Sweden.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' previous feasibility study suggested beneficial effects on occupational
      performance and satisfaction of a mobile phone supported and person-centred rehabilitation
      intervention (F@ce1.0) after stroke in Stockholm, Sweden. The purpose of the present proposal
      is to implement and evaluate F@ce 2.0 on functioning in activities in daily living (ADL) and
      participation in everyday life among persons with stroke and their significant others
      (someone idetified by the person with stroke as close i.e.partner, friend, son, daughter).

      With recommendations on evaluation of complex interventions both outcomes and processes will
      be studied and hence both quantitative and qualitative methods will be applied. In a
      randomized controlled trial F@ce 2.0 will be evaluated compared to ordinary rehabilitation in
      urban/rural Sweden regarding; self-efficacy, perceived performance and participation in
      everyday activities, independence in ADL, health care utilization and the familiesÂ´ perceived
      participation in everyday activities. Qualitative data will explore experiences of people
      with stroke, significant others and rehabilitation staff of participating in F@ce 2.0. The
      research project has a multidisciplinary perspective for sustainable rehabilitation
      interventions, a prerequisite for better participation in everyday life for people with
      stroke.

    <measure>Self-efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between inclusion, after the 8 weeks of intervention and 6 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are instructed to rate how confident they feel about performing each of 16 everyday activities on a 10-point rating scale ranging from 1) &quot;not confident at all in my ability&quot; to 10) &quot;very confident in my ability&quot;. The average of all responses are calculated</description>

    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between inclusion, after the 8 weeks of intervention and 6 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>COPM measures performance and satisfaction in self-care, productivity and leisure from the individual's perspective using a scale of 1-10. The participant is asked 1) to rate performance of the specified activities using a 1 to 10 scale and 2) to score his or her satisfaction with that performance using the same scale. Weighted scores of the chosen activities are added separately for performance and satisfaction to create two summative scores. The summative scores are then divided by the number of rated activities to provide COPM scores.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver Burden Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between inclusion, after the 8 weeks of intervention and 6 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire that consists of 22 items for different types of subjective caregiver burden, covering areas of the caregiver's health, feelings of psychological well-being, relations, social network, physical workload, and environmental aspects. The items are scored on a scale from 1 to 4 and the higher the score the greater the burden.</description>

    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) 3.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between inclusion, after the 8 weeks of intervention and 6 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses the perceived impact on functioning in everyday life in eight domains: Strength, Memory and thinking, Emotions, Communication, ADL/ Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), Mobility, Hand function and Participation. The SIS includes 59 items within these eight domains. Aggregated scores ranges from 0 to 100, the higher the score, the lower the perceived impact of stroke, i.e. fewer problems in everyday life. The SIS 3.0 also includes a question to assess the participant's global perception of recovery presented in a vertical analogue scale ranging from '0 = no recovery to 100 = full recovery'</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will receive an 8-week mobile phone supported and team based rehabilitation intervention (F@ce 2.0).The participants will be introduced to a problem-solving strategy intended to facilitate the learning and problem-solving process to be used during the intervention. The strategy will provide a structure for healthcare professionals delivering the intervention. Three goals in daily activities will be formulated that the person wants and needs to do within the home environment. Each activity will be practiced together with the healthcare professionals and significant others. The significant others will be informed about the participant's goals and the planned strategies for reaching the goals. The participants will practice the activities in their home environment supported by mobile phone calls and SMS. In addition they will be given information about stroke.</description>
