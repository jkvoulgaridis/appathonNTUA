  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective, observational single centre study of electronic medical records of
      discharged patients who were admitted to from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2018.

      Period of data collection was from 5 August 2019 to 15 September 2019.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were to describe a local cohort of acute SAH survivors during
      inpatient rehabilitation at a single tertiary rehabilitation centre in Singapore and identify
      early predictors impacting discharge rehabilitation outcomes.

    <time_frame>Within 72 hours of discharge from rehabilitation</time_frame>
    <description>The FIM, scored between 18 - 126, comprises of 18 items (motor and cognitive sub scores) which assesses a patient's degree of disability and indicates the degree of assistance required for activities of daily living. FIM scoring is widely used for functional scoring in patients with neurologic pathologies such as stroke or traumatic brain injury. Studies on its utility have shown high reliability, validity, and sensitivity for measuring functional ability and high consistency with other functional scales such as the Barthel Index</description>
