  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Xbox Kinect seems to be a good alternative for the older adults to perform physical
      activities at times that are typically associated with sedentary behaviors. The Xbox Kinect
      active video game has been used in various parts of the world as entertainment. The study of
      metabolic, cardiovascular and psychological responses during these activities may bring
      relevant information regarding the intensity of the exercises and, consequently, about the
      possibility of using these games to maintain and / or improve the cardiorespiratory fitness
      of the older adults. In addition, the present study may clarify the responses of activities
      on Xbox Kinect in elderly people with anxiety and depression symptoms. Will be selected 100
      older adults. All volunteers will initially perform assessments of resting metabolic rate,
      cardiorespiratory fitness, functional tests, as well as subjective assessments of physical
      activity level, anxiety and mood. Subsequently, they will perform activities with body
      movements on the Xbox Kinect, which will be compared with sedentary behavior activity (TV /
      Movie). All activities will be monitored by means of a gas analyzer, which will record
      information about the behavior of energy expenditure, resting heart rate and activity. In
      addition, assessments of perception of effort and fun during activities will be made through
      subjective scales. The effects of Xbox Kinect activity on anxiety symptoms and mood will also
      be assessed.

    <description>Scale: Profile of mood states (POMS) The POMS questionnaire is an instrument to evaluate mood states. It has 65 items and 6 domains: tension-anxiety, depression, anger-hostility, vigour-activity, fatigue, and confusion- bewilderment. The total mood disturbance score is derived by subtracting the vigour-activity score from the the sum of scores from the other subscales</description>

    <description>Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale - SEES is a set of three subscales objectives that add up to 12 adjectives in total. A subscale well-being positive is composed of the following adjectives: great, positive, vigorous and wonderful; an anguish of the subscale psychological is composed by the adjectives lousy, diminished, discouraged and sad; while in the fatigue subscale, adjectives are: exhausted, exhausted, fatigued and tired. Each adjective can be classified into certain intensities create scores that can range from 1 (which means &quot;nothing&quot;) to 7 points (which means &quot;a lot&quot;). Of that Thus, a score on each subscale can be at least 4 and a maximum of 28 points.</description>
