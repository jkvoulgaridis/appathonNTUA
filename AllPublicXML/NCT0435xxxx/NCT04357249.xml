    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of capsular in children with cataract, and
      to explore potential preoperative structural clues for postoperative glaucoma. The
      investigators included children with cataract planning to have cataract surgery in our
      institute. Exclusion criteria were: a history of ocular trauma, a history of intraocular
      surgery, preoperative glaucoma, steroid use before surgery, a history of maternal rubella
      syndrome, chronic anterior uveitis, persistent fetal vasculature, ocular anomalies associated
      with an increased risk of glaucoma, unable to complete examinations. The investigators
      recorded age at surgery, gender and relevant ocular and systemic histories. All patients
      underwent slit lamp biomicroscopy, slit lamp adapted anterior segment photography.All
      patients were examined at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, and two
      years after surgery. Patients were followed for two years or until the development of severe
      VAO requiring Nd: YAG laser capsulotomy, whichever came first. The examinations consisted of
      visual acuity, IOP measurement by a Tonopen tonometer (Reichert, Inc., Seefeld, Germany),
      fundoscopy, an assessment by high-resolution digital retroillumination imaging (detailed
      protocol presented below).The primary outcomes were the areas of the posterior capsular
      opening at different postoperative follow-up visits and during operation.A paired T test was
      used to compare the areas of the PCO between the postoperative visits and baseline.
