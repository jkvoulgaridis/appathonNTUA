      Prospective, non-randomized multi-center clinical investigation. Design includes a main study
      and a separate substudy. Subjects in the main study are to be treated using the full range of
      ablation power settings in the IFU. Subjects in the substudy are to be treated in the upper
      end of the recommended ablation power settings (40-50 Watts).

      This clinical investigation is intended to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the
      TactiFlexTM Ablation Catheter, Sensor EnabledTM (TactiFlex SE) for treating symptomatic
      drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This clinical investigation will be conducted
      under an investigational device exemption (IDE) and is intended to support market approval of
      the TactiFlex SE catheter worldwide. Three hundred fifty-five (355) subjects will be enrolled
      at up to 40 investigational sites worldwide. This clinical investigation is sponsored by
      Abbott.

      The TactiFlex IDE Clinical Study will enroll a total of 355 subjects.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ablation with the TactiFlex SE catheter for the treatment of PAF compared to pre-determined performance goals. The study design includes a substudy to assure that there will be a statistically sufficient number of subjects ablated at the high-end of the ablation power setting recommendations in the investigational Instructions for Use document. Subjects in the HSP (High Standard Power) substudy are to undergo the same study procedures as subjects in the main study, except that ablation power settings of 40-50 Watts are to be used in the left atrium, unless there is a medical reason to use a lower power. Subjects will be enrolled in either the main study or the substudy at the point of consent.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Rate of Device or Procedure-related Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome 1 is the rate of device and/or procedure-related serious adverse events with onset within 7-days of any ablation procedure that uses the TactiFlex SE catheter (initial or repeat procedure performed 31-80 days of initial procedure) that are defined below:
Atrio-esophageal fistula
Cardiac tamponade/perforation
Death
Heart block
Myocardial infarction
Pericarditis
Phrenic nerve injury resulting in diaphragmatic paralysis
Pulmonary edema
Pulmonary vein stenosis
Stroke/cerebrovascular accident
Thromboembolism
Transient ischemic attack
Vagal nerve injury/gastroparesis
Vascular access complications (including major bleeding events)
Atrio-esophageal fistula, cardiac tamponade/perforation and pulmonary vein stenosis will be evaluated through 12 months.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of freedom from atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (AFL) or atrial tachycardia (AT) recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome 2 for this clinical trial is freedom from documented (symptomatic or asymptomatic) AF/AFL/AT episodes of &gt;30 seconds duration that are documented by 12-lead ECG, transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) or Holter monitor after the initial catheter ablation procedure through 12-months of follow-up (9 months after a 90-day blanking period).
AF/AFL/AT recurrence during the 90-day blanking period (≤90 days post-initial procedure) will not be considered a treatment failure. One repeat procedure will be allowed for ablation of AF/AFL/AT recurrence 31-80 days after the initial procedure and will not be considered a treatment failure. Failure to achieve acute procedural success during the last ablation procedure with the TactiFlex SE catheter will constitute failure. After the 90-day blanking period, use of Class I or III AADs will not count as a therapy failure provided that only previously failed Class I or III AADs are taken at doses that do not exceed the previously failed dose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of freedom from atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (AFL) or atrial tachycardia (AT) recurrence, without AADs</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome 3 for this clinical trial is freedom from documented (symptomatic or asymptomatic) AF/AFL/AT episodes of &gt;30 seconds duration that are documented by 12-lead ECG, transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) or Holter monitor after the initial catheter ablation procedure through 12-months of follow-up (9 months after a 90-day blanking period).
AF/AFL/AT recurrence during the 90-day blanking period (≤90 days post-initial procedure) will not be considered a treatment failure. One repeat procedure will be allowed for ablation of AF/AFL/AT recurrence 31-80 days after the initial procedure and will not be considered a treatment failure. Failure to achieve acute procedural success during the last ablation procedure with the TactiFlex SE catheter will constitute failure. After the 90-day blanking period, any use of a Class I or III AAD will count as an effectiveness failure.</description>

    <measure>Rate of freedom from atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (AFL) or atrial tachycardia (AT) recurrence with only 1 ablation procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>

AF/AFL/AT recurrence during the 90-day blanking period (≤90 days post-initial procedure) will not be considered a treatment failure. Any repeat ablation procedure in the left atrium will be considered a treatment failure. Failure to achieve acute procedural success during the ablation procedure with the TactiFlex SE catheter will constitute failure. After the 90-day blanking period, use of Class I or III AADs will not count as a therapy failure provided that only previously failed Class I or III AADs are taken at doses that do not exceed the previously failed dose.</description>
