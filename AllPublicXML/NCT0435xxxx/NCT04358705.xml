      little cigar or cigarillo use.

      The overall goal of this study is to examine and better understand adolescent and young adult
      perceptions, visual attention, use intentions and purchasing behaviors among users and
      non-users of cigarillos.

      Aim 1 of this study is exploratory and will consist of an online survey. Findings from Aim 1
      will inform the questions asked about advertising and product use in Aim 2 and 3. Both Aim 2
      and 3 are randomized sections.

      Participants in Aim 2 are either tobacco users or non-users. Participants will be asked to
      view a series of tobacco related images. The sequence of those images is randomized. In Aim
      3, participants will be randomized in terms of the options they are presented within the
      Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (i.e. which tobacco items they can purchase and at what
      price).

To analyze the level of substitution of alternative tobacco products, the study team will fit linear regressions for each product type. Consistent with previous research slopes that significantly differ from zero will be considered substitutes. To compare substitutability in the four flavors, slopes will be compared across the four ETM conditions using one-way ANOVA</description>

    <description>This survey will evaluate perceptions of flavors on appeal, purchasing and risk perceptions of cigarillo products among young adult and adolescent cigarillo users. This survey will be used to inform survey design for further aims.
As a proxy for biological verification of tobacco use status, data on brand, frequency, and pricing will be collected to confirm user status
Participants will rate the role of flavor and report perceptions of product appeal, health risk, advertising exposure and use intentions. Participants will also complete purchase and substitution tasks.</description>

    <description>The eye tracking activity consists of a single in-person eye tracking activity that will take place in a private office where the participant will be seated in a chair within a typical viewing distance from a computer monitor equipped with an infrared camera on the monitor to capture precise eye movements. Participants will have their gaze monitored continuously by the camera on the computer monitor while a randomized set of stimuli (product advertisements) are viewed (n=30) for 10 seconds per image. Following each advertisement, an on-screen closed response question will re-center the participant's gaze for standardization prior to the next image</description>

    <intervention_name>Online Experimental Marketplace</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will be given an account balance for use during their assigned Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM) based on their average weekly tobacco use calculated from the previous interview. Participants will view the online store under four randomly ordered distinct cigarillo price conditions (market price, and ½, 2X, and 4X market price). Participants will be randomly assigned to view: 1) flavored cigarillos and fruit-flavored electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes available, 2) unflavored cigarillos and fruit-flavored ecigarettes available, 3) flavored cigarillos and tobacco- flavored e-cigarettes available, or 4) unflavored cigarillos and tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes available.
Participants will purchase cigarillos with their account balance. During all ETM conditions, constant- priced alternative tobacco products (smokeless tobacco, nicotine lozenges, nicotine gum, and the nicotine patch) will be available in addition to the cigarillos and e-cigarettes.</description>
