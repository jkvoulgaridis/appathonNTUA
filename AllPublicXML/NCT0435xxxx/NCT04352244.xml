  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brown fat is a type of fat, found in both children and adults, which can produce heat and
      regulate the body's metabolism and energy use. White fat is the more common type of fat which
      is used to store extra calories. Understanding more about differences between brown and white
      fat may allow us to develop new approaches to improve the body's metabolism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study, is to map fat (adipose) tissue differences in humans. The
      investigators will probe multiple aspects of fat cell (adipocyte) identity by integrating
      quantitative chemical imaging, single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sc and
      snRNAseq), and site-specific collection of adipocytes and adipocyte precursors.

      Deidentified data from these studies will be submitted to the Human Cell Atlas. The
      investigators anticipate that these studies will ultimately increase understanding of
      mechanisms by which fat (adipose) tissue regulates systemic metabolism (energy transformation
      in the body), and promotes risk for metabolic disease. Knowledge gained from this research
      may be used to set the stage for disease-specific analyses, and aid in the development of
      personalized medicine for metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes.

    <intervention_name>Fat biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>The fat biopsy is performed during a scheduled procedure at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). Routine preoperative procedures will be followed, including local anesthesia (numbing a particular region of the body) or general anesthesia (being put to sleep).
Adipose tissue will be sampled from different depots depending on the procedure. For example, the surgeon will collect adipose tissue from the neck and supraclavicular depots from cervical spine, thyroid, and parathyroid procedures; perinephric fat from adrenalectomies, omental fat from abdominal procedures, and paraspinal fat from lumbar spine procedures. Up to 5 pieces of fat tissue weighing about three to six grams will be removed. All other aspects of the surgical procedure will proceed as planned. Samples will be prepared for subsequent laboratory analysis.</description>
