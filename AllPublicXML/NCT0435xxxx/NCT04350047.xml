  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of the 30-day mortality and major complications as well as long-term oncological
      outcomes of three patients undergoing radical nephrectomy combined with inferior vena cava
      (IVC) thrombectomy with a novel technique without thoracotomy for renal cell carcinoma with
      IVC level IV thrombus. This is a retrospective case series carried out at Attikon University
      Hospital between January 2018 to March 2020.

    <description>The abdomen was accessed through a Makuuchi incision. After mobilization of the liver and assessment of the inferior vena cava infiltration (IVC), IVC was clamped below the level of the renal veins. In order to get access to the intrapericardial IVC, an incision was made through the tendon of the diaphragm and a clamp was placed first in the hepatoduodenal ligament (Pringle maneuver) and then in the endopericardial portion of the IVC, in that order. A longitudinal 3-4 cm incision was made incorporating the junction of IVC and right renal vein. After tumor removal thrombus was removed and a fine clamp was placed at the IVC just below the hepatocaval junction and immediate release of the clamping of the hepatoduodenal ligament. Total endopericardial clamp time was 4 minutes. Patients then underwent radical nephrectomy in a standard fashion with en bloc resection of the IVC thrombus.</description>
