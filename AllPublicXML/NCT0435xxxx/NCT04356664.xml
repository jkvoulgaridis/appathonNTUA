    <textblock>
      Women suffering from endometriosis and/or adenomyosis may also suffer from infertility. GnRH
      agonist injection could improve implantation and therefore increase the pregnancy rate in
      these patients. This study was designed to evaluate effects of the additional of GnRH agonist
      (single or 2 doses) to the routine oestrogens and progestins use as support before Frozen
      Embryon Transfer as compared to oestrogens and progestins only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis reveals the presence of glands or endometrial stroma outside the uterus,
      responsible for pain and infertility. Adenomyosis illustrates an invagination of endometrial
      islets within the myometrium, leading to a disturbance of its contractile activity, also
      potentiated by local hyperestrogenism.

      These two pathologies are often associated, and express an alteration of the eutopic
      endometrium by pro-inflammatory markers responsible for a lower implantation rate.

      GnRH agonists are known to decrease these pro-inflammatory markers (cytochrome P450 and Cox 2
      aromatase) in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis or adenomyosis.

      Patients will received 1 or 2 injection of GnRH delay agonist (Decapeptyl 3mg) approximately
      1 month before the frozen embryo transfer.
