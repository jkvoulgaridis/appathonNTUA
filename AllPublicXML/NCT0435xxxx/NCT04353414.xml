  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare two different treatment options on their
      effectiveness to reduce post-operative pain, narcotic (opioid pain medication) usage and
      recovery time in patients undergoing primary hip arthroscopy surgery.

      The first treatment option is a Transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum (TQL) block plus hip
      incision site (Pericapsular) Injection. The TQL block is an ultrasound guided injection
      between the quadratus lumborum and the psoas muscles in the back. The anesthesiologist will
      perform the TQL block The second treatment option is only a hip incision site (Pericapsular)
      Injection. In this group, the surgeon will inject local anesthetic into the incision or hip
      portal sites to decrease sensation.

      This is a phase IV, randomized, single-blind, single-center study comparing postoperative
      pain, opioid usage and Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) recovery time for patients who
      receive a Transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum block (TQLB) plus pericapsular injection versus
      pericapsular injection (PCI) undergoing primary hip arthroscopy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of post-operative pain as per the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores and compared between the 2 treatment groups after surgery. The distribution of pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores in post- surgical patients will describe their postoperative pain intensity as none, mild, moderate, or severe, the following cut points on the pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of post-operative pain as per the McGill pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This will be determined by the McGill Pain questionnaire (MPQ) scores and compared between the 2 treatment groups during the post-operative period. The MPQ assesses three separate components of the pain experience: the sensory intensity, the emotional impact and the cognitive evaluation of pain. Each descriptor is ranked on a 0 (&quot;none&quot;) to 3 (&quot;severe&quot;) intensity scale.</description>

    <time_frame>1 Day of surgery</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison in Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) Phase 1 recovery time by treatment group</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This will be an observation of the time it takes the patient in the immediate post op period to transition to Phase II. Factors such as severe pain and post op nausea and vomiting may affect a patient's Phase I recovery time so the study want to compare this parameter between both treatment groups.</description>

    <description>Transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum Block (TQLB) is a relatively new block that targets thoracic and lumbar nerves. The decrease in sensation means a decrease in pain. The TQL block will be preformed in addition to an incision-site injection (on hip), called pericapsular injection. The potential risks associated with the Transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum Block (TQLB) include nerve damage and infection at injection site. In addition, there can be temporary sensory and motor loss, depending on the dosage, site of injection and duration of the nerve block. However, the amount (30mL) used in this study meets FDA dosage-regulations for this medication.</description>

    <description>Pericapsular injection (PCI) of 20 mL of 0.25% Bupivacaine HCL (numbing medication) into the incision-site (hip portal sites) to decrease sensation. The potential risks associated with the pericapsular injection include bleeding, infection at injection site and local anesthetic toxicity however, the likelihood is low due to the expertise of the surgeon preforming the injection and the sterile environment and good clinical practice from clinicians, which reduces the likelihood of infection.</description>
