  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Here we assessed the clinical effectiveness of Gluma, fluoride varnish, and the Tetric N-Bond
      one-step self-etch system in alleviating DH instantly and over 1 month, after a single
      topical application.A randomized, double-blind, clinical trial was conducted on 55 patients
      (25 males, 30 females; age: 20-49 years). Seventy teeth were randomly assigned to three
      groups: Gluma (n = 24); fluoride varnish (n = 23); and Tetric N-Bond adhesive (n = 23).
      Sensitivity to tactile, air blast, and cold stimuli were investigated.. A visual analogue
      scale was used to assess tactile stimuli, and the Schiff Cold Scale to assess air blast and
      cold stimuli. DH was evaluated immediately post-treatment, and at the 2-week and 1-month
      follow-up. Between-group and within-group comparisons were made.

    <description>The tactile stimulus was examined using an explorer (# 17/23), passing at a right angle to the bucco-cervical tooth surface of concern. Contributors evaluated participants' pain score on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS). The stimulus was used to assess dentine hypersensitivity at baseline and immediately after completion of treatment. Subjects were also recalled for re-evaluation at 2 weeks and at 1 month after desensitizing treatment.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Air blast stimulus</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>For air blast stimuli, air was delivered by a three-way syringe from a typical dental unit air syringe at 40 psi (± 10 psi) and 70 °F (± 5 °F). The air flow was aimed at the tooth surface of concern, for 1 second, from a distance of 1 cm. The air blast stimulus scores were assessed by the Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale 18. DH was assessed for air blast stimuli at baseline and immediately after completion of treatment. Subjects were also recalled for re-evaluation at 2 weeks and at 1 month after desensitizing treatment.</description>

    <description>For cold hypersensitivity assessment, the tooth was isolated using cotton rolls; then, a few drops of extremely cold water were delivered to the tooth from a syringe that had previously been cooled. The cold stimulus scores were assessed by the Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale 18. DH was assessed for cold stimulus at baseline and immediately after completion of treatment. Subjects were also recalled for re-evaluation at 2 weeks and at 1 month after desensitizing treatment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Gluma</intervention_name>
    <description>Gluma is desensitizing agent by (Heraeus Kulzer, Armonk, NY, USA) claimed to treat dentine hypersensitivity in exposed cervical teeth surfaces and was applied to participants using a mini brush applicator tip onto the exposed hypersensitive tooth surface requiring treatment and was allowed to dry for 60 seconds. Then Dentine hypersensitivity (DH) was assessed for tactile, cold, and air blast stimuli immediately after completion of treatment. Subjects were also recalled for re-evaluation at 2 weeks and at 1 month after desensitizing treatment.</description>

    <intervention_name>fluoride varnish</intervention_name>
    <description>fluoride varnish is usually applied to patients to prevent caries development but was claimed in some cases to also relief dentine hypersensitivity and was applied as a thin layer to the surface of the tooth using an applicator. The varnish set rapidly, and thereafter moisture contamination was not a concern. Patients were advised to not brush or floss their teeth for a couple of hours and to abstain from hot beverages. DH was assessed for tactile, cold, and air blast stimuli immediately after completion of treatment. Subjects were also recalled for re-evaluation at 2 weeks and at 1 month after desensitizing treatment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Tetric N-Bond self-etch adhesive</intervention_name>
    <description>Tetric N-Bond self-etch adhesive is one step dental adhesive and is also claimed to relief dentine hypersensitivity due to blockage of dentinal tubules. It was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions, in a thick layer, for at least 30 seconds, using a light brushing motion. Then, it was dried with a steady stream of air for 3 seconds and light-cured for 10 seconds. DH was assessed for tactile, cold, and air blast stimuli immediately after completion of treatment. Subjects were also recalled for re-evaluation at 2 weeks and at 1 month after desensitizing treatment.</description>
