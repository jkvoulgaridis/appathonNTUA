  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of Music and Progressive Muscle
      Relaxation as interventions to reduce craving, increase coping, and understand the subjective
      experience of the interventions with patients diagnosed with Mental and Behavioral Disorders
      due to Alcohol, Dependence Syndrome, over a 5 day period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Craving for alcohol produces an aversive, uncomfortable state, with autonomic arousal similar
      to that in anxiety disorders, and is the main factor leading to relapse. Music has been shown
      to reduce anxiety and stress levels. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is the intervention
      of choice for treatment of anxiety and related syndromes. This study aimed to compare
      efficacy of PMR and music in reducing levels of alcohol craving and increasing perceived
      ability to cope with the craving. The intervention was conducted over 5 days with two
      randomised group of 10 patients each. The patients were assigned to either group based on
      randomizer sequencing. Initial motivation was assessed before beginning the study. Measures
      of craving level and coping were collected on Day 1, 3 and 5. Single question exit interview
      was conducted to understand subjective perception of the patients regarding the techniques.
      Significant difference was found in coping levels through use of PMR (p = 0.01), and
      subjective reduction in craving levels was reported by patients in the music group, though
      this was not statistically significant. Thus, PMR may be used as an adjunct to increase
      coping abilities in patients with alcohol dependence, while music may be a useful tool to
      reduce craving but cannot be conclusively commented upon without further research.
