      This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy

      Subjects were initially screened at the Randomization/Baseline Visit (Week 0). Eligible
      subjects were randomized at the same visit into the treatment period and received the
      assigned treatment in a double-blind fashion for 8 weeks. During the 8 weeks treatment
      period, there were three follow-up visits requested (Week 2, Week 4 and Week 8). Efficacy was
      measured by using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and
      the Short Form-36 (SF-36).
