      AIM: The study was undertaken to assess the effect of repeated video-training-session method
      upon adequacy of metered dose inhaler (MDI) among individuals with COPD.

      METHOD: The study was experimentally undertaken with 40 patients in pre-test post-test
      control group design. The population of the study was composed of stable inpatient COPD
      patients treated at thoracic diseases department of a state hospital between the 1st of
      February and the 1st of July, 2017. The sample size was planned to include 30 COPD patients
      -15 patients assigned to the experimental group while 15 patients to the control group- as a
      result of the power analysis done at 95% statistical power and 0.05 of margin of error. The
      data of the study were collected using &quot;Patient Information Request Form&quot; and &quot;MDI Skill
      Evaluation Form&quot; through face to face interview technique. To assess the data; percentages,
      chi-square test, averages, t test, &quot;Student's t&quot; and &quot;Paired Samples Tests&quot; were employed.

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) -one of the most important chronic health
      problems of respiratory system- is irreversible, progresses slowly and is characterized with
      chronic inflammation and airflow obstruction (1,2,3,4). According to the report of World
      Health Organization (WHO) &quot;Non-communicable Diseases Progress Monitor 2017&quot;; mortality rate
      in Turkiye due to non-communicable (chronic) diseases was 88% (78.271.000 population) (5),
      over the world, 65 million people lived with moderate to severe COPD and it is estimated that
      nearly 3 million people died of COPD in 2015 (5% of all deaths) (6). Besides; COPD -one of
      the respiratory system diseases- is ranked 4th among the causes of death over the world (7)
      and it is estimated that in 2020 it will be ranked 3rd (8).

      Drug administration, an important nursing role, is a process that includes many disciplines.
      This process starts with patients' medical examination and physicians' prescription and
      includes phases of registration, observation of correct reactions and realization of the
      medical treatment by nurses, physicians, patient himself or his/her significant others (9).
      Training patients and families about treatment regime, observing patient's response to
      treatment and success of treatment are too among nurses' responsibilities (10).

      According to the studies done in literature; the study of Choi and ChoChung (2001) explored a
      positive rise in adequacy of MDI among 101 asthma patients after the MDI training session
      given, the study of Press et al. (2012) was done with 80 COPD patients about adequacy of MDI
      and 82% of the participants performed steps of MDI use wrongly before the training while 25%
      of the participants performed the same steps wrongly after the training, the study of Işık et
      al. (2014) determined mistakes in using inhaler drugs and reported that patients were unable
      to receive effective and sufficient dose of drugs and the study Özkan and Kaşıkçı (2015)
      identified mistakes in using MDI and emphasized the usefulness of the training about MDI.

      The study was planned to explore the steps where patients made mistakes while using MDI, to
      find out to what extent they used MDI correctly and to assess the effect of
      video-training-session upon adequacy of metered dose inhaler (MDI) among individuals with
      COPD.

    <intervention_model_description>STUDY TYPE and STUDY AIM The study was experimentally undertaken in pre-test post-test control group design in order to assess the effect of video-training-session method upon adequacy of metered dose inhaler (MDI) among individuals with COPD.
STUDY POPULATION and SAMPLING In case of drop outs (wish to withdraw from the study, early hospital discharge, loss of life, etc), 20 patients were assigned to each group. The first 20 COPD patients who met the inclusion criteria were assigned to the control group whereas the second 20 COPD patients were assigned to the experimental group.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>one day</time_frame>
    <description>In order to determine the effect of repeated video-training-session method on the adequacy of metered dose inhaler (MDI) in individuals with COPD, a total of 5 measurements were made. on the 1st day, patients were asked to use the sample of their MDI that did not contain active agent. At the same time, &quot;MDI Skill Evaluation Form&quot; was filled in and &quot;scores of the 1st measurement&quot; were found. Next, MDI use was explained through the video and the researcher had the video watched twice. After each video and explanation, patients were asked to use the sample of their MDI that did not contain active agent and this performance lasted for 10 minutes. Simultaneously, skill-steps were marked by the researcher through observation on &quot;MDI Skill Evaluation Form&quot; and &quot;scores of the 2nd measurement&quot; were found.</description>

    <description>On the 2nd day, patients were visited and were again asked to use MDI. While patients were using MDI, &quot;MDI Skill Evaluation Form&quot; was marked and &quot;scores of the 3rd measurement&quot; were found. Later; video-session was held the same way as on the first day, the video was watched twice and after each repetition, patients were requested to use MDI. While patients were using MDI, skill-steps were simultaneously marked on &quot;MDI Skill Evaluation Form&quot; and &quot;scores of the 4th measurement&quot; were determined.</description>

    <description>This training included verbal explanation of MDI use. In line with ethical principles, the control group patients received training about MDI use and were made to watch the video once after the 5th measurement. After the study, internet links were given to those of the experimental and control group patients who wanted to watch the training-video again.</description>

    <description>The steps were demonstrated with the brochure that illustrated correct inhalation techniques and were prepared by Turkish Respiratory Research Society-Inhalation Treatment Study Group in line with the literature and were described with a video that was designed by Turkish National Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (25). The video is provided with a free access on the webpage of Turkish National Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.The video included images that explained the steps about what to do before MDI use, how to use the device and the issues to which attention should be paid during the use of the device and focused on the skill-steps that should gradually be performed about MDI use.</description>
