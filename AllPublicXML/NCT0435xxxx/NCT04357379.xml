  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel type of non-cigarette tobacco product was recently approved for sale in the US, the
      heated tobacco product (HTP) IQOS. IQOS may be less harmful than cigarettes, and there are
      some reports that it may produce more rewarding subjective effects compared to e-cigarettes.
      The approval of IQOS provides a unique opportunity to gather preliminary data surrounding
      IQOS. The goal of this pilot study is to assess the subjective effects and relative
      reinforcement value of IQOS, including its downstream effects on cigarette smoking. Current
      smokers will complete a one-week baseline period where they smoke as normal before attending
      an in-person lab visit. During the in-person lab visit, participants (n=10) will sample a
      traditional cigarette and a novel IQOS tobacco product. Participants will answer
      questionnaires about each product they sample and then complete a preference assessment in
      which they choose between the IQOS and their own cigarette. Finally, participants will take
      home a tobacco product they sampled to use ad libitum (1-week sampling). During the at-home
      baseline and sampling weeks, participants will complete electronic daily diaries cataloging
      their tobacco use. Biomarkers (i.e., expired carbon monoxide, cotinine) will corroborate
      self-reported indices of use.
