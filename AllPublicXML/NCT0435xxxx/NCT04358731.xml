  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3, randomized, observer blind, multi-centre, controlled study to evaluate
      the safety, immune response and consistency of immune response of three consecutively
      manufactured lots of NmCV-5 in healthy individuals between the ages of 18 to 85 years (both
      inclusive). The immune response of NmCV-5 will also be statistically compared against a
      licensed conjugate vaccine against ACYW (Menactra).

      A total of 1640 subjects 18 to 85 years of age will be accrued contemporaneously across three
      age groups - 18 to 29 years, 30 to 60 years, and 61 to 85 years. Within each age group
      subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either NmCV-5 or Menactra. The
      NmCV-5 subjects in 18-29 year age group will be further randomized 1:1:1 into three different
      lots (Lot A, B &amp; C) of NmCV-5.

      All the randomized subjects will receive a single dose of 0.5 ml of NmCV-5 or Menactra on Day
      1. Post vaccination site visits are planned on Days 8, 29 and 180 and a telephonic call at
      Day 85.

    <description>The NmCV-5 is a fixed-combination available as the lyophilized powder containing meningococcal groups A and X polysaccharides conjugated to tetanus toxoid and meningococcal groups C, W and Y polysaccharides conjugated to CRM197 protein. The vaccine will be reconstituted with normal saline just prior to administration.
The NmCV-5 lyophilized powder component contains sucrose, sodium citrate and trometamol as excipients. This component is presented as a freeze-dried powder in a single dose vial. No preservative or adjuvant is present in the vaccine.
The normal saline diluent is a sterile clear colorless liquid in a single dose glass ampoule.</description>
