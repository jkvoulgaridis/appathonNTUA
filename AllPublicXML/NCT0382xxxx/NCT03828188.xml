    <textblock>
      This study was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2x2 cross-over design
      human trial. 50 subjects which of 25 by group were randomly divided into Red Ginseng
      Concentrated Powder and a placebo group.(A total of 100 subjects completed the 2x2 cross-over
      study.)

    <measure>Changes of Lipid metabolism indices</measure>
    <time_frame>30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Lipid metabolism indices were assessed before and after the intervention. The lipid metabolism index should be measured by collecting blood while keeping fasting for 12 hours or more. The inspection items are as follows.
Total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C, HDL-C, Non HDL-C, VLDL-C, free fatty acid, Apo A1, Apo B, hs-CRP
Non HDL-C and VLDL-C are calculated by the calculation formula, and the first digit of the decimal point is indicated.
Non HDL-C= Total cholesterol - HDL-C VLDL-C= Total cholesterol - (HDL-C + LDL-C)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Arteriosclerosis indices</measure>
    <time_frame>30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is calculated by the calculation formula using the lipid metabolism indicator test item. Round off the third decimal place to the second decimal place. The items are as follows:
* Total cholesterol/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, triglycerid/HDL-C, (Total cholesterol - HDL-C)/HDL-C, Apo B/Apo A1</description>
