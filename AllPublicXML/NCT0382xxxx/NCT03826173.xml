  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for physically inactive adults. Participants will be enrolled in the Positive
      Psychology and Physical Activity intervention designed to help them overcome barriers to
      physical activity, based on the principals of positive psychology.

      This will involve six weekly one-hour group-based sessions at a local YMCA with a trained
      group leader. In addition to the in-person sessions, there will be text messages sent to
      participants about physical activity that include positive psychology content.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a pilot study to test feasibility and proof-of-concept
      for a positive psychology intervention program to promote exercise among low-active
      overweight and obese adults. The program will be (a) a 6-week, group-based intervention, (b)
      delivered at local YMCAs, and (c) supplemented with text messaging. In an additive design,
      participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to PPPA (n = 40) versus a control intervention
      (n = 20) including only the standard PA promotion components of the PPPA intervention (i.e.,
      PA education, self-monitoring, and goal-setting), with equal frequency of staff contact and
      text message delivery. All participants will be followed for 3 months, and will receive a
      3-month YMCA membership to equate access to PA facilities. As a secondary aim the
      investigators will examine effect sizes for PPPA versus the standard PA intervention on
      putative mediators that may underlie the efficacy of PPPA in improving PA outcomes, including
      positive and negative affect, optimism, happiness, life satisfaction, social support for PA,
      and PA enjoyment. The proposed research will set the stage for an RCT to test a novel PA
      promotion intervention that can be readily disseminated.

    <time_frame>Survey will be administered at baseline, week 4, week 7, and week 10.</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Scale measures changes in positive and negative affect. Both positive and negative affect sub-scales will be scored (scores range from 10 to 50 for each individual sub-scale), with higher scores on the positive affect scale and lower scores on the negative affect scale indicating a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Optimism</measure>
    <time_frame>Survey will be administered at baseline, week 4, week 7, and week 10.</time_frame>
    <description>Life Orientation Test- Revised measures trait optimism. Scores range from 10 to 50, with higher scores reflecting greater optimism. Higher scores will reflect better outcomes of the intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Survey will be administered at baseline, week 4, week 7, and week 10.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of subjective happiness. Scores range from 4 to 28, with higher scores reflecting greater subjective happiness. Higher scores will reflect better outcomes of the intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Survey will be administered at baseline, week 4, week 7, and week 10.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures subjective well-being. Scores range from 5 to 35, with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction with life and subjective well-being. Higher scores will reflect better outcomes of the intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Survey will be administered at baseline, week 4, week 7, and week 10.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures perceived social support for regular exercise. Scores range from 13 to 65, with higher scores reflecting greater social support. Will be assessed as a putative mediator.</description>

Participants will be instructed to target 30-60 min/day 5 days/week of MVPA consistent with national guidelines. PA content will be concentrated in sessions 1 and 2, but content on goal-setting, self-monitoring, and overcoming barriers will continue throughout the 6-week period. The intervention includes activities that focus on identifying each individual's strengths, identifying/savoring positive experiences, engaging in constructive conversation, expressing gratitude, and strategies to maintain increased positive affect after the intervention has completed.</description>
