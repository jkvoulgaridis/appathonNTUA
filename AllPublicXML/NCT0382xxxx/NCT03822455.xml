    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomised study of OligoG DPI compared to placebo DPI, both on top of
      standard-of-care, to assess safety, efficacy and tolerability. Adult patients with Cystic
      Fibrosis will be included in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The alginate oligosaccharide OligoG CF-5/20 dry powder for inhalation (OligoG DPI) represents
      a novel therapeutic approach for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). OligoG has been shown to
      release stagnant mucus, modulate sputum rheology and disrupt the biofilm formation often
      typically observed in CF. These properties will in turn facilitate mucus clearance and
      promote effectiveness of antibiotic therapy against the chronic pulmonary infections
      characteristic of CF.

      Patients with CF (age 18 years or older) will be eligible to participate in this study.

      The design will be a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study for proof of concept
      that OligoG DPI can improve lung function in adult CF patients. Study medication will be
      given twice daily for twelve weeks on top of standard of care (SOC). Thirty-three patients
      will be included, out of which twenty-two shall receive OligoG, and eleven shall receive
      placebo.

      After all patients have completed the 12 week double blind treatment period, all patients
      will be offered open-label OligoG twice daily, in addition to standard of care, for 12
      months.

      The primary endpoint will be absolute change i percent predicted FEV1

      Exploratory parameters will include sputum microbiology.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Genotypic confirmation of CFTR mutation or clinical diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF)
             confirmed by a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L by quantitative pilocarpine
             iontophoresis.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Male or female patients with any ethnicity.

          -  FEV1 at screening in the range of ≥40% and 90% of the predicted normal for age, sex,
             and height, according to the GLI equation (Eur Respir J. Dec 2012; 40(6): 1324-1343).

          -  History of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection with at least one positive
             microbiological PA testing during the last 12 months before the Screening Visit.

             during the last 12 months

          -  Concomitant treatment with inhaled tobramycin, colistin, or aztreonam (either cycled
             or continuous) for at least 3 months at screening to treat PA infection. In case of
             cycled antibiotic treatment, the treatment should start with an active cycle at the
             day of randomisation (+/- 2 day) (together with the IMP intake). If taking tobramycin
             cycled with another antibiotic, IMP should start on the active cycle of tobramycin.

          -  Stable CF disease as judged by the investigator.

          -  Willing to remain on a stable CF medication regimen (standard of care; SOC) during the
             study.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the
             Screening and Randomisation Visit.

          -  Male and female patients must use acceptable contraceptive methods for the duration of
             the study. Male and female patients without child-bearing potential (i.e. who are

             requirements. For the purpose of this study acceptable contraception is defined as one
             or a combination of the following:

               -  oral, injected, transdermal or implanted hormonal methods of contraception;
                  placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); barrier
                  methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
                  caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.

          -  Capable of inhaling dry powder.

          -  Willing and able to follow the study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of hypertonic saline more than 2 times a day. If hypertonic saline is used, OligoG
             inhalation should be taken at least 15 minutes after completion of hypertonic saline
             therapy.

          -  Use of CFTR modulator therapies.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal findings of haematology or clinical chemistry;

               -  Bilirubin &gt;2x ULN

               -  Abnormal renal function, with a creatinine clearance calculated &lt;50ml/min

               -  Haemoglobin &lt;10g/dL

          -  History of any comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigator, might distort the
             results of the study or cause an additional risk in administering study drug to the
             patient.

          -  Pulmonary exacerbation within 28 days prior to randomisation.

          -  Change in CF therapy within 28 days before randomisation (first dose of IMP).

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding females.

          -  History of allergic reactions to the ingredients of the IMP according to Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or 4, including lactose and
             milk protein.

          -  Patients unable to perform pulmonary function tests according to the ATS/ERS criteria.

          -  Uncontrolled or unstable chronic diseases (e.g. congestive heart failure, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations) that would limit the compliance
             with study requirements in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Any acute illness in the last 14 days

          -  History of, or planned organ transplantation.

          -  Lung infection with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status
             (including, but not limited to Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, and
             Mycobacterium abscessus). For subjects who have had a history of a positive culture,
             the following criteria will be used to determine whether the subject is free of
             infection with such organisms:-

               -  The subject has not had a respiratory tract culture positive for these organisms
                  within the 12 months before the date of informed consent, and

               -  The subject has had at least 2 respiratory tract cultures negative for such
                  organisms within the 12 months before the date of informed consent, with the
                  first and last of these separated by at least 3 months, and the most recent one
                  within the 6 months before the date of informed consent.

          -  Active allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in the last 12 months prior to
             the Screening Visit, that has received pharmacological treatment for ABPA.

          -  Patients currently receiving any other investigational treatment, or who have
             participated in a clinical study within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to the screening
             visit.

          -  Current malignant disease (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma and cervical
             neoplasia).

          -  Any medical or psychological condition, other than CF, which in the opinion of the
             investigator exposes the patient to an unacceptably high risk.

          -  Patients with documented or suspected, clinically significant, alcohol or drug abuse
             as per Investigator's discretion.
