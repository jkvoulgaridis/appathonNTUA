  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is performed as a randomized in part double-blinded prospective controlled trial. A
      total of 150 adult Acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) -exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD)
      -patients with uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) will be
      recruited. Those negative to ASA-challenge test will not enter the Clinical Trial . All
      patients entering the Clinical Trial, have undergone earlier ethmoidal surgery
      (partial/total) and have not gained disease control. F-helicobacter antigen is tested and
      treatment is given if indicated. The patients are recruited at the Helsinki University
      Hospital (HUH). The study will be monitored by a professional monitor. Electronic CRF and
      paper/electronic patient questionnaires provided by HUS will be used (eCRF and patient
      questionnairea, Granitics).

      Randomization and the treatment arms I-II: The patients are randomized to two treatment arms
      I) ASA- desensitization po tablet daily for 11 months (n=100) II) Placebo po tablet daily for
      11 months (n=50).

      ASA challenge and desensitization (Primaspan) /Placebo: is conducted according to modified
      international protocol. FEV1 should be at least 1.5 L and &gt; 60% of predicted before challenge
      or desensitization. On the first day every patient will receive 25 mg + 25 mg ASA at a
      hospital setting. On the second day every patient will receive 50 mg + 25 mg ASA at a
      hospital setting. On the third day every patient will receive 75 mg + 25 mg ASA at a hospital
      setting. On the fourth day every patient will receive 100 mg + 25 mg ASA at a hospital
      setting.

      During the ASA challenge, patient who is ASA-challenge positive is then randomized and starts
      the trial so that he/she uses blinded ½ tablet of 250 mg ASA or ½ tablet of 250 mg placebo
      daily at home for the next 1 month. After this period of 1 month, the dosing is increased at
      hospital setting, so that the patient receives blindly 125 + 125 mg ASA/placebo. Thereafter
      he/she will continue using blindly 250 mg ASA/placebo daily at home for the next 10 months.
      If the patient does not tolerate the up-dosing of ASA/placebo, he/she will continue using
      blindly ½ tablet of 250 mg ASA/placebo daily at home for the next 10 months. The total
      duration of the ASA/placebo treatment is 11 months. We additionally take nasal, bloon and
      urine samples during the trial.

      Follow-ups. The symptom questionnaire and interview of side-effects are performed during each
      visit. Lung function (eNO, nNO, PEF, spirometry) is monitored and the patient will visit
      doctor and/or nurse at 1, 5, 11, and 12 months post-starting with the treatment. Samples are
      taken before and after challenge and at 11 months post-starting with the treatment. We also
      monitor side-effects, exacerbations, need of medication (po. cortisocteroids; antibiotics)
      and satisfaction to treatment.

      Primary end points are change in nasal endoscopic polyp score and SNOT-22 11 and 12 months
      post-starting with the treatment. Secondary end points include lung function tests
      (spirometry, FEV1%, FEV1/FVC%). The patient will know the treatment arm at 12 months
      post-starting with the treatment and can discuss with the doctor of the need to continue or
      start with ASA-desensitization or another treatment, if needed. Safety (complications,
      adverse effects), costs and loss of productivity between study arms will be compared.

      Trial medication will be discontinued, if surgery is needed before the end of follow-up.
