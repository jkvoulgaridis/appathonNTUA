    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how Xultophy® works in patients with
      type 2 diabetes. The participants will get Xultophy® as prescribed to them by the study
      doctor. The study will last for about 26-34 weeks. The participants will be asked questions
      about their health and their diabetes treatment as part of their normal study doctor's
      appointment.
