    <measure>assessing the effects of PENS therapy in Postoperative period of Lower Segment Caesarean Section pain using VAS score.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours of device activation</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effects of PENS therapy in Post-Operative period of Lower Segment Caesarean Section pain using the Visual Analogue Scale measurement. The level of pain is calculated from the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) before the device is installed and assessed after 2 hours of the device activation. The pain level should be decreased when assessing after 2 hours of device installation. The score should be below 5. where 0 being no pain, 5 being moderate and 10 being maximum pain.</description>

    <description>The test product or device called Primary Relief v 2.0 device will be used for the study. The study will be conducted for a period of two to three months with the treatment period of 3 - 4 days i.e single treatment (installation). The additional time taken will be to define the characteristics of the patient population and to recruit appropriate patients. Finally, there will be a data analysis and report writing period. Overall, the study is expected to 3 months. The device will be placed onto the auricle part of the ear for percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.</description>
