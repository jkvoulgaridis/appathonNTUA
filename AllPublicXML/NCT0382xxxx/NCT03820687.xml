  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop and pilot test a multi-communication approach to improve
      informed decision-making about cancer Clinical Trials (CTs) participation by increasing
      awareness of CTs and Mays Cancer Center (MCC) services (treatment care capacities, reputation
      and resources), positive attitudes towards CTs, self-efficacy and intentions to consider CTs
      as an appropriate treatment option for cancer (intention to participate) among patients
      attending the MCC (clinic-based setting) and the general public in selected Bexar County
      areas (community-based settings).

      The proposed two-year study involves a randomized controlled educational trial featuring a
      2-group cohort design with random assignment of 400 cancer patients from the MCC to the
      intervention or usual care control group. Intervention participants will receive 3
      components: 1) a culturally relevant educational video, 2) a brochure and 3) support from a
      patient navigator to empower new cancer patients to make informed decisions about cancer CTs
      by increasing awareness of clinical trials and MCC services, positive attitudes and
      intentions to consider CTs as an appropriate treatment option for cancer. The usual care
      control group will receive a general CT fact sheet.

      The community education module will have also 3 components: 1) an educational session
      delivered via PowerPoint presentation or flip chart, 2) a brochure, and 3) support from a
      community health educator to raise awareness, positive attitudes and intentions to consider
      CTs as an appropriate treatment for cancer and promote the MCC services among community
      members in Bexar County.
