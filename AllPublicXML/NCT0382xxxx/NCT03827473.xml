    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well docetaxel or abiraterone acetate work when combined with
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in treating patients with hormone sensitive prostate
      cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      docetaxel and abiraterone acetate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Antihormone therapy, such as ADT may lessen the amount of androgen made by the
      body. It is not yet known whether docetaxel or abiraterone acetate work better when combined
      with ADT in treating patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) and docetaxel on total quality
      of life between screening and month 12 of the study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess prostate specific androgen (PSA) response rates across the entire population and
      compared between groups.

      II. To assess impact of abiraterone and docetaxel on additional quality of life measurements
      and quality of life trends throughout the duration of the study.

      III. To assess the potential clinical efficacy between treatment groups.

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life - FACT-P</measure>
    <time_frame>Planned for up to one year, but actual was 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of abiraterone acetate and docetaxel on health related quality of life will be assessed every 3 months from screening to month 12 of treatment or follow-up. The scale used will be the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) scale. The total score ranges from 0 to 156, with higher scores indicating a higher quality of life. The primary endpoint was intended to be quality of life at 12 months, but since no participants completed 12 months of treatment/follow-up, scores at baseline and 3 months are reported instead.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Planned for up to 18 months, but actual was 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSA evaluations will occur every 3 months while on study. PSA response is defined as a reduction in PSA value of greater than or equal to 90% from baseline, reported as a count of participants who had a PSA response on the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life - FACT/GOG-NTX</measure>
    <time_frame>Planned for up to 18 months, but actual was 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life questionnaires will be done every 3 months while participants are on treatment. The scale used will be the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)/Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-Neurotoxicity (NTX) (FACT/GOG-NTX) scale (version 4). FACT/GOG-NTX total score ranges from 0 to 152, with higher scores indicating a higher quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life - PROMIS Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Planned for up to 18 months, but actual was 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life questionnaires will be done every 3 months while participants are on treatment. The scale used will be the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue scale. Total raw scores range from 7 to 35, with higher scores indicating a higher level of fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prostate Specific Antigen Progression Free Survival (PSA-PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Planned up to 18 months, but actual was 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) will be measured every three months while on study. PSA Progression Free Survival (PSA-PSF) will be reported as the number of participants who have not demonstrated PSA progression by the end of the follow-up period. PSA progression is defined by meeting the following criteria: 1) an increase in PSA of greater than or equal to 25% from baseline or nadir, AND 2) an increase in PSA of at least 2 ng/dL, AND 3) the increase is confirmed at least 3 weeks later. This analysis was planned for up to 18 months following study enrollment, but the only participant enrolled on the study was only followed for 3 months.</description>

        <description>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) will be measured every three months while on study. PSA Progression Free Survival (PSA-PSF) will be reported as the number of participants who have not demonstrated PSA progression by the end of the follow-up period. PSA progression is defined by meeting the following criteria: 1) an increase in PSA of greater than or equal to 25% from baseline or nadir, AND 2) an increase in PSA of at least 2 ng/dL, AND 3) the increase is confirmed at least 3 weeks later. This analysis was planned for up to 18 months following study enrollment, but the only participant enrolled on the study was only followed for 3 months.</description>

          <title>Prostate Specific Antigen Progression Free Survival (PSA-PFS)</title>
          <description>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) will be measured every three months while on study. PSA Progression Free Survival (PSA-PSF) will be reported as the number of participants who have not demonstrated PSA progression by the end of the follow-up period. PSA progression is defined by meeting the following criteria: 1) an increase in PSA of greater than or equal to 25% from baseline or nadir, AND 2) an increase in PSA of at least 2 ng/dL, AND 3) the increase is confirmed at least 3 weeks later. This analysis was planned for up to 18 months following study enrollment, but the only participant enrolled on the study was only followed for 3 months.</description>

      <time_frame>Planned for up to 18 months, but due to low enrollment and early participant discontinuation, the actual time frame was 3 months.</time_frame>
      <desc>Information about adverse events, whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by investigator questioning, or detected through physical examination, lab test or other means, were abstracted from clinic notes and recorded in the participant's study chart. The safety profile for the drugs involved in this study have been characterized extensively in previous clinical trials and standard clinical contexts. As such, safety data collection for this study was limited to ≥ Grade 3 adverse events.</desc>
