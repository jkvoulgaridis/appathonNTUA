  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of NBP607QIV to Agrippal which
      are indicated for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to NBP607QIV versus Agrippal S1. To assess the
      safety, solicited adverse events for 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited adverse events
      for 28 days post-vaccination are assessed and reported. To assess the immunogenicity,
      antibody levels are evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition(HI) assay from sera obtained at
      pre-vaccination and 21 days post-vaccination.
