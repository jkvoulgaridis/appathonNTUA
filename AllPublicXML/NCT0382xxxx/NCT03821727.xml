  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes a registry-based, nationwide analysis to describe the clinical outcome of
      adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL)
      who underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after a Tyrosine
      Kinase Inhibitors (TKI)-based treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective nationwide analysis based on registry data collected by GITMO.
      Inclusion criteria were: 1) diagnosis of Ph+ ALL; age ≥18 years at transplant; 2) patients
      receiving first allogeneic HSCT from any donor (HLA-identical sibling donor (MSD), unrelated
      donor (UD) or alternative donor (haploidentical or cord blood) between 2005 and 2016 in a
      GITMO center; 3) TKI-based treatment prior to HSCT; 4) patients with available pre-transplant
      MRD status, as well as complete clinical data and outcome. Data were extracted from the GITMO
      Registry (PROMISE Registry).

      The endpoints of the study were: OS, progression-free survival (PFS), cumulative incidence of
      relapse (CIR), non-relapse mortality (NRM), cumulative incidence of extensive chronic graft
      versus host disease (cGVHD), rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity and the rate
      of complete cytologic remission (CR) before and after transplant.
