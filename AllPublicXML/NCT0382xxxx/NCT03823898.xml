    <textblock>
      The Exercise and Obesity Health Promotion (PESO) program is a randomized controlled trial
      designed to analyze the effects of a lifestyle intervention in weight management and
      health-related parameters of overweight and obese premenopausal women

      The PESO (Exercise and Obesity Health Promotion Program) is a program of weight control and
      exercise promotion for overweight and obese premenopausal women, developed by specialists in
      exercise, nutrition, and psychology, under medical supervision. It is a program that promotes
      the autonomy of the participants and the permanent modification of their habits and
      lifestyles, without the use of drugs or any other products, devices, or techniques of
      &quot;slimming&quot;.

      Participants in the PESO Program were able to enjoy a regular and multifaceted group program,
      aiming to increase knowledge about permanent body weight control, increased motivation and
      practice of physical activity and exercise, and improved habits food and nutrition. Increases
      in functional mobility, metabolic health, quality of life and the physical and mental
      well-being of the participants are central priorities of this Program.

      The PESO Program was conducted in a university context and was led by teachers and
      researchers from the Faculty of Human Motors and other national and foreign institutions. The
      program is not for commercial purposes, it does not entail financial costs for the
      participants and it is involved in a wide range of scientific research projects, which have
      been recognized by individuals and external entities as relevant and of interest to the
      general population and the community in particular.

    <description>A self-reported measure of physical activity was used, specifically the short-form of the International physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). The IPAQ-SF records the last 7 day recall for four intensity levels of physical activity which is vigorous-intensity activity, moderate-intensity activity, walking, and sitting. From IPAQ data were converted to Metabolic Equivalent minutes per week (MET-min/week) using the published formulation the Compendium average MET score. Physical activity of low intensity was characterized by activities inducing less than 3 metabolic equivalents (MET), moderate intensity between 3 and 5.9 MET and for vigorous intensity higher than 6 MET. The higher the number of MET, the higher the intensity. The duration of the activities in each intensity were calculated based on the reported time per week. The higher the duration in activities of moderate to vigorous physical activity the highest the physical activity level</description>

    <description>Participants in this group received a lifestyle intervention from baseline to 4 months. From 4 to 16 months participants were involved in two supervised exercise sessions per week plus healthy lifestyle interactive sessions.
The experimental intervention consisted of: a) monthly behavioral sessions consisted of lifestyle interactive sessions took place monthly and covered and followed contents that were addressed during the first 4 months of the study; b) The supervised exercise sessions were prescribed using an aerobic mode performed at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity during 45 minutes, twice a week, preferably during the weekends.</description>
