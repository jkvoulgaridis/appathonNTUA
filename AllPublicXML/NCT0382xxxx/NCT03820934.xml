      The purpose of this study is to validate FibroScan and FibroSURE™ as equal or superior
      alternatives to liver biopsy for the monitoring and detection of methotrexate-induced hepatic
      fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

      The goals of this study are to validate FibroScan and FibroSURE™ as equal or superior
      alternatives to liver biopsy. The goal is to evaluate the monitoring and detection of
      methotrexate-induced hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with moderate-to-severe
      psoriasis.

    <description>The correlation between the clinical fibrosis scores generated by the FibroScan® and FibroSURE™ alone and in combination to the METAVIR fibrosis score generated from the histologic review of a liver biopsy performed for the assessment of liver fibrosis in a psoriasis patient who reaches a cumulative methotrexate dose of 1g.</description>

    <description>Determine if the clinical fibrosis scores generated by the FibroScan® and FibroSURE™ alone and in combination can be safely used as alternatives to performing a liver biopsy when screening for liver fibrosis in psoriasis patients who have reached a cumulative methotrexate dose of 1 gram</description>

    <intervention_name>Fibroscan and Fibrosure</intervention_name>
    <description>Patient's will undergo fibroscan and fibrosure to test their liver for the level of liver fibrosis as measured by these tests. Fibroscan uses vibrations sent through the liver to measure its stiffness and the fibrosure uses laboratory and demographic parameters to create a score associated with a certain level of fibrosis. The scores from these tests will then be compared to the amount of fibrosis noted on a standard of care liver biopsy.</description>
