  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with face melasma will receive 4 Melanostop peel treatments containing 20%
      azelaic acid, 10% resorcinol and 6% phytic acid. Peels will be performed at 2-week interval.
      They will also receive a facial tonic and cream for at home use, containing brightening
      ingredients: vitamin C, niacinamide, alpha arbutin, kojic acid. They will also receive
      sunscreen protection cream with SPF 50, protecting against UVA, UVB, HEV and IR. Products for
      at home use will be used twice a day, every day. Measurements will be made at baseline, on
      the day of the forth peel treatment and 4 weeks after the last peel. Measured parameters will
      be: mMASI score, VisioFace photography analysis, melasma area measurements, and melanin
      index, ΔE, CIELab colour measurements with Cortex SkinLab Combo (Cortex Technology Asp,
      Denmark).

    <measure>Modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1, week 7, week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Melasma severity will be evaluated according to Modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI). Significant change of the mMASI score from baseline is expected bfore 4th and one month after 4th Melanostop peel treatments.
mMASI score is calculated by first assesing the hyperpigmented area of the face. Four areas are evaluated: forehead (F), right malar region (RM), left malar region(LM), and chin (C), corresponding to 30%, 30%, 30% and 10% of the total face. The melasma in each of the four areas is given a numerical value by rating darkness (D) and area of involvement (A).
Scoring system: Area of involvement (A), rated 0 to 6: 0= absent; 1 = &lt;10%; 2 = 10% to 29%; 3 = 30% to 49%; 4= 50% to 69%; 5= 70% to 89%; 6= 90% to 100%. Darkness (D), rated 0 to 4: 0= absent; 1= slight; 2= mild; 3= marked; 4= severe.
mMASI total score = (0,3 x A(F) x D(F) ) + (0,3 x A(LM) x D(LM)) + (0,3 x A(RM) x D(RM)) + (0,1 x A(C) x D(C))
Total mMASI score range: 0 - 24</description>

    <measure>Colour difference</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1, week 7, week 11</time_frame>
    <description>CIE Lab colour will be measured within the lesion and on the control area outside of the lesion using Cortex Dermalab Combo and colour difference (delta E) will be calculated between the areas and in comparison to baseline values.
Significant change of the melasma colour from baseline and in comparison to control area is expected after 4 Melanostop peel treatments.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Melanin index change</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1, week 7, week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Melanin index will be measured within the lesion and on the control area outside of the lesion using Cortex Dermalab Combo Skin colour probe. Melanin index is given on a scale 0.0-99.9.
Significant change of the melanin index from baseline and in comparison to control area is expected before 4th Melanostop peel treatments and 4 weeks after last treatment.</description>
