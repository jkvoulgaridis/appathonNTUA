  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign ovarian cysts are frequent during women's life. They are diagnosed with pelvic pain or
      fortuitously during an ultra-sonographic exam. In case of persistence,a surgery will be
      necessary to identify the nature of the cyst and assess its benignity. In some case, cysts
      are recurrent and multiple surgeries are needed leading to a significant risk of ovarian
      damage by follicular depletion. Oocyte cryopreservation is no longer considered as an
      experimental technique of Fertility Preservation since 2013 as it has been recognized to be
      efficient and safe. According to reproductive medicine scientific committees and the French
      ethic law, fertility preservation has to be proposed in every situation of infertility risk.
      To date, there is no cohort study dedicated to fertility preservation by oocyte freezing in
      this specific subgroup of patients. The purpose of the study is to prospectively evaluate the
      oocyte number and quality after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in patients with
      recurrent ovarian cysts.
