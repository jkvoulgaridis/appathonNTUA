  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is a disorder of movement and posture resulted from a non-progressive lesion
      or injury of the immature brain. It is a leading cause of childhood onset disability.

      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that umbilical cord blood is useful to repair
      neurological injury in brain.

      On the basis of many experimental studies, umbilical cord blood is suggested as a potential
      therapy for cerebral palsy.

    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditions with abnormal movement and
      posture resulted from a non-progressive cerebral disturbance. It is the most common cause of
      motor disability in childhood. Most therapies are palliative rather than restorative.
      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) may be used as restorative approach for children with CP.

      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that UCB is beneficial to improve and repair
      neurological injuries, this effect achieved due to immune regulation and angiogenesis as well
      as the neuroprotective effect.

      Based on animal studies and some clinical trials, UCB is suggested as a potential therapy for
      children with CP.

      This study is prospective, non randomized (open label) with control group.

    <measure>Changes in Standardized Gross Motor Function 66 (GMFM-66) Score for all child.</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>GMFM (Gross Motor Function Measure) as a standardized measurement tool for assessing Gross Motor Function consisting of sub-scales; lying &amp; rolling, sitting, crawling &amp; kneeling, standing, walking, running &amp; jumping (range: 0~100 , Higher value means better gross motor function). We reported changes of GMFM between each assessment time points. Categories of outcome table are baseline and values of just subtracting the latter raw scores from the former ones. This test will be acquired for all child.</description>

    <description>ITQOL - the 47-item short-form (ITQOL-SF47) developed for use in infants and toddlers from 2-months-to-5 years of age. Form scores physical, mental and social well being/ For each concept, item responses are scored, summed, and transformed on a scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health). Changes in completed questionnaire will be assessed. This test will be acquired for child above 3yrs.</description>

    <time_frame>1, 3, 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Ashworth scale (AS) measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity scoring, where:
0 No increase in tone;
Slight increase in tone giving catch when the limb is moved in flexion and extension;
More marked increase in tone, but limb is easily flexed;
Considerable increases in tone, passive movement difficult;
Limb rigid in flexion or extension. This test will be acquired for child above 3yrs.</description>
