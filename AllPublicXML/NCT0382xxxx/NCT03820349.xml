    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence suggests that hyperglycemia in type 1 and type 2 diabetes is
      associated with alterations in brain structure and cognitive impairment. People with cystic
      fibrosis related diabetes (CRFD) are exposed to hyperglycemia as seen in other forms of
      diabetes, and cystic fibrosis is also associated with chronic systemic inflammation. Both
      hyperglycemia and chronic inflammation have been postulated to affect brain structure and
      function. Cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR). protein is widely
      expressed in the neurons of the brain including in the hippocampus The hippocampus plays an
      essential role in learning and memory processing and is thought to be particularly vulnerable
      to effects of metabolic stressors. The expression of CFTR in neurons has several potential
      implications for central nervous system function, including cognition.

      The long-term goal of this project is to examine the effects of cystic fibrosis (CF) and
      cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) on brain structure and function.
