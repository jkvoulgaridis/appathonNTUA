  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      integrating PrEP into antenatal and postnatal care, to describe the cascade in women
      initiating PrEP in this setting, and to evaluate the reasons for attrition along the PrEP
      cascade in a cohort of pregnant and breastfeeding women. The specific aims are to: (1)
      Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of integrating PrEP into antenatal and
      postnatal/well-baby services; (2) Describe the PrEP cascade of initiation, retention, and
      adherence in a cohort of 220 HIV-uninfected pregnant and breastfeeding women, (3) Evaluate
      attrition and associated factors across the PrEP cascade.

    <description>We will investigate the feasibility and acceptability of integrating PrEP into antenatal and postnatal/well-baby services. Upon enrollment in the cascade, all women will be offered PrEP counseling and information, and patients will be followed regardless of their choice to initiate PrEP or not. Participants who initiate PrEP will receive TDF-FTC during the study. At each study visit (every 3-months), women will receive counseling on PrEP adherence or on the risks and benefits of PrEP for women not yet initiated. We will evaluate PrEP initiation and adherence in pregnant and breastfeeding women (N=220) from first antenatal care visit through 12 months post-partum.</description>

    <description>Information about PrEP will be integrated into regular group education in ANC by existing health care providers during discussion about HIV testing and treatment. During every study visit, PrEP counseling (including adherence counseling for women already on PrEP) will be provided. For women not on PrEP, counselling will be provided on PrEP and HIV prevention.</description>
