  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that targets
      motor neurons. Prognosis is invariably fatal within 3-5 years since manifestation of the
      disease. Despite improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying ALS, the treatment
      remains essentially only supportive and focused on symptoms relief. Over the past few years,
      stem cell research has expanded greatly as a tool for developing new therapies to treat
      incurable diseases. Stem cell therapy has been shown as promising in several animal ALS
      models and human clinical trials.

      Subjects will be assigned to autologous mesenchymal stromal cell (AMSC) treatment according
      to inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below) screened four times prior to administration.
      Then the subjects will be observed for three consecutive yearsAfter a half year of screening
      period, the autologous multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow will be
      isolated. The cells will be cultivated for 3 passages (3 - 4 weeks) in order to get
      sufficient amount for therapy, cell suspension for intrathecal application will be prepared
      and introduced intrathecally through lumbar puncture. Subsequently, all the subjects will be
      observed at the range of standard medical care used at these types of interventions.

    <measure>Safety: Complications related to the medicinal product application - new neurological deficit and occurrence of other adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Complications at the site of intrathecal infusion of the medicinal product and no new neurological deficit (meningism, paraplegia, urinary incontinence) not attributed to the natural progression of the ALS disease will be recorded at Visits I, III, IV, V, VI, and IX. Occurrence of other potential adverse events, including headache, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, cervical spine stenosis, cystitis and hyperhydrosis will be evaluated on the severity scale (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe).
Brain and spinal cord MRI will be performed at Visits I and IX to exclude treatment-related tumor formation, pathological contrast enhancement or other structural pathology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy: Inhibition of the disease progression - ALS functional rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Inhibition of the disease progression will be recorded by ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS) at Visits I, III, and VI through X.
Measures (all 4-0):
speech
salivation
swallowing
handwriting
cutting food and handling utensils (with or without gastrostomy)
dressing and hygiene
turning in bed and adjusting bed clothes
walking
climbing stairs
breathing
ALSFRS = SUM (points for all 10 measures)
Interpretation:
minimum score: 0 maximum score: 40 The higher the score the more function is retained.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy: Inhibition of the disease progression - Norris scale</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Inhibition of the disease progression will be recorded by Norris scale at Visits I, III, and VI through X.
Norris scal has has 22 items examining bulbar, respiratory, trunk, arm, leg, and general domains involving reflexes, fasciculation, and muscle atrophy. The scale also measures emotional lability, fatigability and leg rigidity. The Norris scale has a linear decline during the course of ALS.</description>
