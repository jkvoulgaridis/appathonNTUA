  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with pre-diabetes or diabetes would benefit from low impact methods that would
      improve their insulin sensitivity and aid in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Physical
      activity helps the body decrease its insulin resistance and burn excess sugar. Many diabetics
      also suffer from obesity and specific forms or durations of physical exercise may not be
      viable options for these individuals. Determining whether short bursts of moderate exercise
      improve blood glucose levels in healthy humans may identify a further method for diabetics to
      improve their glucose homeostasis.

      The aim of this study is to determine the most effective moderate exercise that can be
      completed in 3 minutes and its effectiveness on improving glucose handling, in response to a
      single day of standardized high-fat and high-carbohydrate feeding in comparison to periods of
      prolonged sitting.
