  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of STAR01 is to evaluate the performance and safety of the medical
      device (class IIb) SiPore15™ after a 12-week long treatment in the target population of obese
      and overweight subjects with prediabetes or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The expected
      performance and safety of the device is based on the safety and efficacy results seen in an
      earlier First-in-Man (FIM) study. The safety and tolerability of SiPore15™ is based on the
      well-established and extensive use of food grade silicon dioxide and favorable data from the
      FIM study. Data on side-effects will be collected for verification of device safety. The
      study duration is 24 weeks in total, 12 weeks from baseline on investigational medicinal
      device (IMD) treatment, with additional 12 weeks off treatment. The study population is
      planned for forty (40) subjects to be enrolled, male and females, age &gt;18 years and
      fulfilling all inclusion criteria but none of the exclusion criteria.

    <intervention_model_description>The single-arm study is designed to collect data on changes over time, i.e. comparing the pre-treatment/baseline value with the value achieved after full treatment (12 weeks). Thus, each individual act as his/her own control. The study design has been discussed with notified bodies, and deemed appropriate as there is no state-of-the-art pharmacotherapy for treatment of prediabetes to compare with.</intervention_model_description>
