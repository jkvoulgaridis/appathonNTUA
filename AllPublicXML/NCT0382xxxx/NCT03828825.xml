  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patent Foramen Ovale, is an embryonic remnant, formed by apposition of the septum primum and
      septum secondum composing the interatrial septum. This foramen ovale is permeable during
      intra-uterine life and allows inter-auricular communication. It tends to close at birth, due
      to increased pressure from the left atrium. However, it remains permeable in almost 25% of
      the general population. Several studies have shown that this cardiac &quot;anomaly&quot; associated
      with the atrial septum aneurysm (ASA), easily diagnosed by ultrasound, is more common in
      patients with cryptogenic stroke. The diagnosis of patent foramen ovale is performed by a
      cardiac ultrasound with a &quot;bubble&quot; test: a volume of micro-bubbles obtained by emulsion of
      saline (9 ml) and air (1 ml) is injected intravenously. The path of these microbubbles is
      observed by trans-thoracic ultrasound and can detect a shunt right / left. This test can be
      sensitized by Valsalva maneuver and / or cough. The shunt is quantified by the number of
      microbubbles flowing through the right / left shunt: positive diagnosis: more than 3 bubbles
      passing; minimal shunt &lt;10 bubbles, moderate shunt between 10 and 30 bubbles, massive shunt
      if&gt; 30 bubbles.

      Patent Foramen Ovale Closure is an interventional cardiac catheterization procedure by venous
      femoral approach. Several clinical trials show that Patent Foramen Ovale closure prevents
      stroke recurrence in young people and that this procedure is more effective than antiplatelet
      therapy. Nevertheless, an increase in the incidence of peri-procedural atrial fibrillation
      has been observed. For some researchers, this would be explained by irritation of the atrial
      muscle due to the establishment of the device.

      To date, only percutaneous closures made in clinical trials have been evaluated. In fact,
      there are no specific recommendations. The use in clinical practice of this percutaneous
      treatment therefore requires an evaluation of the indications but also the profile of the
      patients to optimize these procedures and reduce the complication rate.

      The closure technique and the choice of the size of the prosthesis are not standardized. The
      closure is done under trans-esophageal echocardiography (invasive method) or trans-thoracic
      echocardiography (non-invasive method) depending on the choice of the practitioner. In CLOSE
      study, this rate is not specified. The procedure rate under general anesthesia is 54%. This
      category of patients can be assumed to use a trans-esophageal echocardiography.

      The absence of specific recommendations concerning the technical modalities of this procedure
      lead us to study the closure of Patent Foramen Ovale standardized under trans-thoracic
      echocardiography and to evaluate its possible reliefs by avoiding the general anesthesia and
      the use of trans-esophageal echocardiography. The objective of the study is to bring elements
      of standardization of the technique. As part of a &quot;real life&quot; study, we will evaluate the
      success rate of procedure under local anesthesia and under trans-thoracic echocardiography
      control. This evaluation will be done by trans-thoracic echocardiography at 3 months, the
      re-endothelisation time of the medical device being between 1 and 3 months.

    <description>The Patent Foramen Ovale closure is realized under trans-thoracic echocardiography control. If necessary, the operator will use trans-esophageal echocardiography to implant the prosthesis. One day after the procedure, a clinical assessment and an electrocardiogram are performed. At 3 months the consultation corresponds to a trans-thoracic echocardiography validation of the closure accompanied by a &quot;bubble test&quot; (Valsalva maneuver) and a clinical assessment. At 12 months, the visit corresponds to a consultation with a clinical assessment and an electrocardiogram. At 36-months and 60-months, the visits will be done following the on-site visits provided for in the usual care or during a telephone call from the attending cardiologist to retrieve the results of the clinical examination, electrocardiogram and MACCE (major cardiac and cerebral vascular events). A consultation dedicated to the study may be proposed to patients according to what is provided in the usual care.</description>
