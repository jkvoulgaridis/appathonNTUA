      This is a phase I/II Study of Nivolumab in Combination with 5-azacytidine in pediatric
      patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study will be the first to test nivolumab in combination with AZA in pediatric
      patients with hematologic malignancies. Patients will receive the first dose of nivolumab on
      day 1 along with AZA. After &quot;chemotherapy priming&quot;, a second dose of nivolumab will be given
      at day 15 which will enhance the effect of nivolumab on the regenerating CD4+ and CD8+ memory
      T cells.

      To establish a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D)of nivolumab in combination with 5-azacytidine
      in children with relapsed or refractory AML. To assess the clinical activity of Nivolumab in
      combination with 5-azacytidine in AML patients with M2/M3 disease at study entry.

        Diagnosis

          1. Relapsed or refractory AML with ≥5% blasts (by morphology) in the bone marrow.

               -  1st or greater relapse, OR

               -  Failed to go into remission (i.e. refractory) after first or greater relapse, OR
