    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess biomechanical alignment of lower limb as a predictor
      for the stress urinary incontinence in the postmenopausal women. 300 postmenopausual women
      will be selected suffering from stress unrinary incontinence . Their age ranges from 60 to 70
      years old. Their BMI is not exceeding 30 kg/m2.

    <textblock>
      in this study 300 postmenopausual women will be selected suffering from stress unrinary
      incontinence. Their age ranges from 60 to 70 years old. Their BMI is not exceeding 30 kg/m2.
      different methods of assessment will be used as : Data recording sheet, Weight-Height scale,
      Goniometer ,x ray radiography ,Transabdominal ultrasound and Perineal ultrasound. Data
      recording sheet: It will be used to record data of each woman before starting this study.
      Weight-Height scale: It will be used to measure weight and height of each woman before
      starting this study. Goniometer: it will be used to document the initial and the subsequent
      range of motion for ankle joint for each woman. Transabdominal ultrasound: it will be used
      for measurement of Post-void residual volume PVR for each woman which is the volume of urine
      left in the bladder after micturition . Perineal ultrasound: it will be used to assess the
      posterior urethrovesical angle for each woman . X-ray radiography: lateral pelvic radiographs
      will be taken for each woman in order to objectify the individual pelvic tilt. Inclusion
      criteria include : Subjects will be postmenopausal women complaining from stress urinary
      incontinence Participants age will range from 60-70 years.Their BMI will not exceed 30 kg/m2.
      Exclusion criteria: previous history of cancer and radiotherapy, any disease that could
      interfere with the participation, lower urinary tract infections( Manshadi F. etal )
      musculoskeletal problems; previous major abdominal or pelvic surgery; severe diseases;
      diabetes mellitus, a body mass index &gt;30 kg/m2; intraureterine device implantation, pelvic
      organ prolapse and menopause (Cerruto M etal.)
