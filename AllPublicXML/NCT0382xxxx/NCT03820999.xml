      This study evaluates the effect of written and oral information in a primary health care
      setting on 1) patients referred to specialised examination for Lyme neuroborreliosis, 2)
      delay from patient symptom debut to treatment for Lyme neuroborreliosis, and 3) number of
      Borrelia serology tests from primary health care.

    <textblock>
      Lyme neuroborreliosis is among the most common neuroinfections in northern Europe. Residual
      symptoms after treatment are a frequent problem in Lyme neuroborreliosis, and an association
      between the delay from symptom debut to antibiotic treatment has been established. In a
      previous study on Funen Island, Denmark, the delay from day of symptom debut to treatment for
      Lyme neuroborreliosis patients was 24 days. This considerable treatment delay did not change
      in the 20 years study period.

      In the Danish health system, the general practitioners are the first medical professionals to
      see the majority of patients. They can refer patients to the hospital for further examination
      if indicated. Many general practitioners use Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies (igM/IgG) as a
      screening tool when they suspect Lyme disease or see patients with uncharacteristic symptoms.
      This is unfortunate, as the rash Erythema Migrans, the most common Borreliosis manifestation
      in Europe, is a clinical diagnosis. Only around 50% of patients have positive antibodies at
      time of Erythema Migrans diagnosis. Lyme neuroborreliosis is diagnosed based on symptoms and
      the results from the cerebrospinal fluid, and cannot be diagnosed based on serology, which
      only delays the time to diagnoses and treatment. The Danish guidelines on Lyme borreliosis
      therefore discourage general practitioners from using Borrelia serology.

      In the before mentioned study from Funen Island, several patients described multiple contacts
      to their general practitioners, where the symptoms of Lyme neuroborreliosis were not
      recognized. The cardinal symptom of radicular pain was associated with a longer delay than
      many of the less common symptoms of Lyme neuroborreliosis.
