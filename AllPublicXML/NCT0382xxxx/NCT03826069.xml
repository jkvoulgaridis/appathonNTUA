  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simulation-based training (SBT) is a safe and effective strategy for improving skills
      development in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The use of curricula based on progressive
      learning, as well as comprehensive structured curricula, have been demonstrated to be
      effective in enhancing simulation-based training. With current advancements in technologies,
      another possible enhancement to SBT is the use of augmented reality (AR). To date, no other
      studies have examined the benefits of AR technology in endoscopy training. This study aims to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a simulation-based AR curriculum in developing technical
      skills, self-assessment accuracy, and clinical performance; as compared to a conventional
      simulation curriculum.

      Thirty six novice endoscopists will be recruited from the gastroenterology and general
      surgery programs at the University of Toronto. Participants will be randomized and assigned
      to two groups. The Conventional Simulation Training Curriculum group will receive 6 hours of
      simulated training, with expert feedback, and four 1-hour didactic teaching sessions. The AR
      Training Curriculum group will receive the same number of training hours and didactic
      sessions as the control group. The main difference is the use of superimposed videos to guide
      the intervention group through simulated polypectomy cases. During the didactic teaching
      sessions, the intervention group will also receive a brief introduction to principles of AR
      and its uses for endoscopy simulation. Participants will be trained to perform colonoscopies
      on two validated simulator models: (1) a bench-top colonoscopy simulator; and (2) the EndoVRÂ®
      virtual reality simulator. Performance will be assessed before training (pre-test),
      immediately after training (acquisition post-test) and 4-6 weeks after training (retention
      test). On the same day as the retention test, the participants will perform two live
      colonoscopies and use a mechanical polypectomy simulation test (transfer tests), assessed by
      two blinded expert endoscopists.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that novices trained under the AR-enhanced curriculum
      will have better technical skill performance during simulated polypectomies and live
      colonoscopies.

      Simulation-based training (SBT) provides a safe and effective means to enhance skills
      development. Simulation-based curricula have been developed for a number of minimally
      invasive procedures, and more recently in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Previous studies have
      demonstrated the effectiveness of comprehensive structured curricula and curricula based on
      progressive learning in endoscopic simulation. However, as digital technologies evolve, other
      educational strategies using the latest innovations may aid to further enhance procedural
      skills training during simulation. One such strategy may lie in augmented reality (AR).

      The use of AR involves the superimposition of a computer-generated image on a user's view of
      the real world, which enhances the user's perception of reality. There has been a recent,
      growing interest for the integration of AR in medical education, such as in the visualization
      of anatomical structures, training for various medical procedures and telemedicine guidance
      for remote procedural training. The real time interactive nature of AR provides immersion,
      immediate learner support, and has the ability to lower the complexity of learning new tasks
      by showing the content of the tasks using different perspectives, which is beneficial for
      both engagement and the learning process.

      To date, there are only a few studies which have investigated the application of AR for
      medical education and procedural learning specifically. Some of the benefits demonstrated by
      these studies include decreased amount of practice needed, reduced failure rate, improved
      performance accuracy, accelerated learning, shortened learning curve and better understanding
      of spatial relationships. However, the majority of studies on the application of AR have been
      on training for laparoscopy, neurosurgical procedures, and echocardiography. There are
      currently no studies showing the benefits of AR in endoscopy training.

      Furthermore, several studies have shown the importance of self-assessment for suitable
      lifelong learning of new techniques in minimally invasive surgery and gastrointestinal
      endoscopy. A study by our group showed that experienced endoscopists had better
      self-assessment accuracy compared to novice endoscopists, therefore, a targeted intervention
      to help novice endoscopists is needed so that they may seek appropriate preceptorship during
      their training. One such targeted intervention to improve self-assessment accuracy may be AR,
      as it provides immediate and repeated visual support of the perfect approach to perform a
      specific task, therefore, allowing the trainee to reflect on their performance.

      In order to bridge the gap related to AR in endoscopy training, the investigators aim to
      determine the impact of a simulation-based AR curriculum on areas such as knowledge
      acquisition, technical performance during simulated polypectomies, non-technical skills
      during integrated scenarios, and self-assessment accuracy. The investigators hypothesize that
      AR is an instructional strategy with the potential to offer a highly realistic and meaningful
      learning experience for novice endoscopists with transferable skills to clinical practice.

    <description>Four, one-hour small-group sessions on the theory of colonoscopy including pathology, anatomy, and therapeutic technique. Following each session, a multiple choice test on topics covered will be administered. In addition, this group will be given a total of six hours of expert-assisted instruction on both the low-fidelity simulator (1 hour) and the high-fidelity VR simulator (5 hours). During the high-fidelity simulation, endoscopic procedures will be performed with instructor support. The difficulty of the therapeutic intervention (polypectomy) will rise after each successfully completed module. The last two hours of training on the high-fidelity simulator will consist of two integrated scenarios.</description>

    <description>This group will receive the same 4 hours of small group teaching and 6-hours of hands-on simulator training. The intervention is the augmented reality-based curriculum: (1) a brief explanation of the principles of AR and how it will be used during the VR simulations and (2) performance of the therapeutic procedure (polypectomy) as demonstrated by the real-time AR platform. Specific videos corresponding to the therapeutic intervention and pathology (e.g pedunculated vs non-pedunculated polyp) will be available every time a polypectomy is required. Each new module will come with increased technical challenges and will require adjustment to previously used technique by the learner. The last two hours of training on the high-fidelity simulator will consist of two integrated scenarios.</description>
