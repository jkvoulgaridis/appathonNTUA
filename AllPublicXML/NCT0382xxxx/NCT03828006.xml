  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial seeks to verify the efficacy of a red rice yeast dietary supplement in
      the decrease of cardiovascular risk, by assessing variables related with cardiovascular risk
      as levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and transaminases among other, in two groups of
      participants that will be taking either the dietary supplement or a placebo during a six
      months period.

    <measure>Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in the score from the baseline, at 3 and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale estimates the 10 year risk of fatal CVD.
The risk is estimated with a High &amp; Low cardiovascular Risk Charts based on gender, age, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and smoking status, with relative risk chart, qualifiers and instructions. High risk or low risk table depends on whether the person lives in a high or low risk country.
There possible scores goes from 0 to 47 in the high risk table, and 0 to 26 in the low risk table. Where lower values represent lower risk and higher values higher risk.</description>

    <description>The scale measures the probability of having cardiovascular disease in 10 years.
The probability is estimated with age, sex, smoking status, diabetic or not, total Cholesterol (mg/dl), HDL cholesterol (mg/dl), systolic blood pressure (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg).
Possible risk values are divided in 5 categories: low &lt;5%, moderate 6-9%, medium 10-19%, high 20-38%, very high &gt;39%</description>
