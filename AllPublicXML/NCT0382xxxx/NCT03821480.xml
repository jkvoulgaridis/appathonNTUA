  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the bioequivalence between fluconazole 50mg capsules from two
      different manufacturers. This is a open-label, randomized, single dose, 2-treatment, 2-period
      crossover study in healthy Korean male and female subjects aged 19-55, to assess the
      bioequivalence after taking study drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-eight (28) healthy subjects will be enrolled into the study. Screening evaluation will
      occur within 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication.

      Subjects will be randomized to the following treatments:

        -  Treatment A: Fluconazole capsule, 1 x 50 mg, Diflucan, West Ryde (REFERENCE)

        -  Treatment B: Fluconazole capsule, 1 x 50 mg, Diflucan, Amboise (TEST)
