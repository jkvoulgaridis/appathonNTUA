  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to know, there is no clear diagnostic and therapeutic pathway for patients with embolic
      stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). This prospective registry study, which follows up adult
      ESUS patients for 36 months, is intended to provide important data for the detection of an
      individual approach in ESUS patients based on a structured diagnostic and therapeutic
      pathway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The open-label, academic, prospective, monocentric, observational registry-study
      (Catch-up-ESUS registry study) started in 01/2018. All ESUS-patients (≥18 years) treated in
      our hospital are included and will be followed up for three years. Depending on age (&lt; 60
      years or ≥ 60 years), the patients are processed according to a standardized treatment
      algorithm designed interdisciplinary by neurologists and cardiologists. An insertable cardiac
      monitor (ICM) is implanted in all of them by default. Patients &lt; 60 years without evidence of
      atrial fibrillation and co-existing PFO are planned for PFO closure within 6 months after
      stroke.

        All patients (≥18 years) treated in our hospital and diagnosed with an ESUS will be
        collected.

        An extension to additional centres is planned in the course of the project, if good
        feasibility can be demonstrated.
