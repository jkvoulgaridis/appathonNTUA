      Thirty-two (32) eligible healthy subjects between ages of 18-50 years old will be enrolled
      and randomized to either Sequence 1 (fed to fasted state) versus Sequence 2 (fasted to fed
      state) at a 1:1 ratio.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Capable of giving informed consent and complying with trial procedures;

          2. Male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 50 years, inclusive;

          3. Considered healthy by the Investigator based on a detailed medical history, full
             physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG, and vital signs;

          4. Nonsmoker, defined as not having smoked or used any form of tobacco for at least 6
             months before Screening based on subject report;

          5. Body mass index (BMI) of 19 to 30 kg/m2 inclusive and body weight &gt;/= 50 kg;

          6. Willing and able to adhere to trial procedures and to be confined at the clinical
             research unit (CRU).

          7. All female subjects (childbearing potential and non-childbearing potential) must have
             a negative serum pregnancy test result at Screening. In addition, female subjects must
             meet 1 of the following 3 conditions: (a) postmenopausal for at least 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause, (ii) surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal occlusion) based on subject
             report, or (iii) if of childbearing potential and heterosexually active, practicing or
             agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception. Highly effective methods
             of birth control include an intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing
             system (IUS), and contraceptives (oral, skin patches, or implanted or injectable
             products) using combined or progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation. A vasectomized male partner is an acceptable birth control
             method if the vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the female subject
             and the vasectomized partner has received medical confirmation of surgical success.
             Highly effective methods of birth control must be used for at least 14 days prior to
             study drug dosing, through the end of study (EOS) visit or early termination, and for
             a minimum of 1 month after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of
             pregnancy. Sexually active, fertile, male subjects must be willing to use acceptable
             contraception methods (such as double-barrier methods of a combination of male condom
             with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide) from the first dose of study
             drug through the EOS visit or early termination, and for a minimum of 1 month after
             the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant past medical history of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
             musculoskeletal, endocrine, hematologic, psychiatric (including life-long history of
             depression and/or anxiety), renal, hepatic, bronchopulmonary, neurologic, immunologic,
             ophthalmological, or lipid metabolism disorders; or drug hypersensitivity; or any
             condition that in the judgement of the Investigator will affect the trial results or
             the subject's safety;

          2. History of suicide attempt in the past 12 months and/or seen by the Investigator as
             having a significant history of risk of suicide or homicide;

          3. History or presence of malignancy other than adequately treated and cured basal cell
             skin cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, or in-situ cervical cancer, within 5 years
             prior to screening;

          4. Clinically relevant illness within 1 month prior to Screening or at Screening that may
             interfere with the conduct of this trial;

          5. Medically uncontrolled high blood pressure with mean systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg
             or mean diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg at Screening after 3 measurements (after at
             least 5 minutes of rest in a seated position);

          6. History of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) or a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc
             interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms);

          7. Positive blood screen for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C
             antibody;

          8. History of seizure (history of febrile seizure allowed);

          9. Hospital admission or major surgery within 30 days prior to Screening;

         10. Participation in any other investigational drug trial within 30 days prior to
             Screening;

         11. History of prescription drug abuse or illicit drug use within 6 months prior to
             Screening;

         12. History of alcohol abuse according to medical history within 6 months prior to
             Screening;

         13. Positive screen for alcohol and/or drugs of abuse;

         14. Tobacco use within 6 months prior to Screening based on subject report or positive
             nicotine screen;

         15. History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to ODV or medicines containing ODV or its
             precursor venlafaxine;

         16. Participation in a previous clinical trial of either LY03005 or ODV or medicines
             containing ODV or its precursor, venlafaxine, within 30 days prior to Screening;

         17. Unwillingness or inability to comply with food and beverage restrictions during trial
             participation;

         18. Donation of blood of more than 1 unit (approximate 450 mL) or blood products or acute
             loss of blood during the 90 days prior to Screening;

         19. Use of prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications and herbals (including St
             John's Wort, herbal teas, garlic extracts) within 14 days prior to dosing (Note: Use
             of acetaminophen at &lt;3g/day is permitted until 24 hours prior to dosing).
