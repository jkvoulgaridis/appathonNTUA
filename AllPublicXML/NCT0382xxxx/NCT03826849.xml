  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and potential
      effectiveness of a mobile phone application (app) developed by the VA National Center for
      PTSD (VA NCPTSD) for use by Veterans with insomnia. The primary objective is to assess
      whether Veterans find the Insomnia Coach app to be satisfactory and feasible to use.
      Secondary objectives are to determine if use of the app improves subjective sleep quality and
      sleep parameters (e.g., sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time), as well
      as other important outcomes (e.g., daily functioning).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are high rates of insomnia among Veterans, particularly those who have been exposed to
      potentially traumatic situations (i.e., combat exposure) and few receive cognitive-behavioral
      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), a first-line treatment for insomnia. Insomnia Coach is a mobile
      app for individuals with insomnia symptoms. This app provides:

        -  education about sleep, the development of insomnia, and evidence based behavioral and
           cognitive strategies

        -  self-assessment tools measuring insomnia severity and sleep need

        -  self-monitoring with a daily sleep diary

        -  self-management tools for relaxation and changing thinking about sleep

        -  individualized recommendations for a preferable sleep window (i.e., bed and rise times)

        -  daily reminders for behavioral changes In this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT),
           50 Veterans with significant insomnia symptoms will be recruited using flyers and social
           media (i.e., Facebook ads) and randomized in equal numbers to receive one of two
           conditions: 1) the Insomnia Coach mobile app (which is based on cognitive-behavioral
           therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)) and, 2) a waitlist control.

      Objective use of the Insomnia Coach mobile app will be tracked to assess feasibility (i.e.,
      will participants use the app as intended). Participants will complete measures (using
      Qualtrics) of sleep, insomnia severity, depression and anxiety, and functional well-being at
      baseline, 6 weeks (posttreatment), and 12 weeks (follow-up). At post-treatment, participants
      in the Insomnia Coach app condition will also be asked to report their level of satisfaction
      with the app and to complete a brief qualitative evaluation of their experience using the
      app. Waitlist control condition participants will be informed about the Insomnia Coach app
      and provided with information on how to download it after completion of the follow-up
      assessment (i.e., at 12 weeks).

      The aim of this research is to learn whether individuals, particularly Veterans, with
      insomnia, find Insomnia Coach to be satisfactory and feasible to use. It also aims to assess
      if use of the app potentially improves subjective sleep quality and sleep parameters (e.g.,
      sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time), as well as other important
      outcomes (e.g., daily functioning). If this research demonstrates that Insomnia Coach is a
      promising tool for individuals experiencing sleep difficulties, it has the potential to
      address a need using a very cost-effective, widely accessible, scalable solution that would
      warrant more rigorous evaluation (e.g., a full-scale RCT).

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Composite of app usage data comprised of button taps, sections visited, self-entered data, number of visits and days used, and time spent on the app per visit. Various combinations and aggregations of these behaviors will be explored as best indicators to optimally summarize app use.</description>

    <measure>Mobile Apps Rating Scale (MARS; Stoyanov et al., 2015)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item multidimensional, objective measure of app usability. It includes four subscales that measure an app's engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. All items are rated on a 5-point scale from &quot;1. Inadequate&quot; to &quot;5. Excellent&quot;. The scores are tallied up and a mean score out of 5 is given to each of the categories scored.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS; Brooke, 1986)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item questionnaire of usability of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices, websites and applications. Items are on a 5-point scale numbered 1 to 5. Half of the items are worded negatively and half are worded positively. SUS yields a single number representing a composite measure of the overall usability of the system. To calculate the SUS score, the score contributions from each item are summed. Each item's score contribution will range from 0 to 4. For items 1,3,5,7,and 9 the score contribution is the scale position minus 1. For items 2,4,6,8 and 10, the contribution is 5 minus the scale position. Then the sum of the scores is multiplied by 2.5 to obtain the overall value of SU. SUS scores have a range of 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 19-item self-report measure assessing qualities and problems associated with sleep in the past month. It generates seven component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. A global sleep quality score is obtained by summing the seven component scores. Higher scores reflect poorer sleep quality. The global score ranges from 0 to 21, with a cut-off score of 5 as distinguishing &quot;good&quot; sleepers from &quot;poor&quot; sleepers.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS-Sleep-Related Impairment (PROMIS-SRI; Buysse et al., 2010)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 16-item self-report form assesses sleep-related impairment over the past seven days. Each question has five response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. To find the total raw score the values of the response to each question are summed. The raw scores are converted to a standardized T-score using conversion tables published on the PROMIS website (nihpromis.org), with higher scores indicating greater sleep/wake disturbances.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 Item (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 7-item measure assesses anxiety symptom severity. Items are scored from zero to three. The whole scale score can range from 0 to 21 and cut-off scores for mild, moderate and severe anxiety symptoms are 5, 10 and 15 respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., 2009)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An 8-item self-report instrument used to assess depression severity. Since the scale is self-administered in our studies and further probing about positive responses is not feasible, the question about suicide from the PHQ-9 was removed. Items are scored 0 to 3, with the total score being the sum of the 8 items. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity, with a score of 10 or greater considered major depression, and scores of 20 or more is severe major depression.</description>
