      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of paclitaxel-eluting coronary artery balloon
      dilation catheter (DIOR) in revascularization of coronary bifurcation lesions compared with
      paclitaxel-eluting balloon (Bingo), and to provide the clinical data for the formal
      application in China and for the approvement of China marketing.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomize, control and non-inferior study. 220 patients
      with bifurcation lesions will be randomized 1:1 to each group. after the main branch has been
      treated successfully, and if the side branch's stenosis is more than 70% and can be
      pre-dilated by POBA (plain old balloon angioplasty) successfully, then randomizing. the
      patients in the study group will be treated with paclitaxel-eluting coronary artery balloon
      dilatation catheter (DIOR), while those in the control group will be treated with
      paclitaxel-eluting balloon (Bingo). Clinical follow-up will be conducted at baseline,
      operation, hospital discharge, 1 month, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after operation, and
      angiographic follow-up will be conducted at 9 months. The primary endpoint is late lumen loss
      (LLL) in the balloon dilatation coverage area of side branch of at 9 month after operation.
      The secondary endpoints include device success, clinical success, target lesion failure
      (TLF), target lesion revascularization (TLR), clinical composite endpoints and imaging
      endpoints. The information of adverse events, serious adverse events and device defects will
      be collected during the study.
