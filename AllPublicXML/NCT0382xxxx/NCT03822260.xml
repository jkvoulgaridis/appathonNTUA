  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are planning that can these markers be used a predictive marker at SAH and
      for this aim we will study both patiens' blood sample and their CT image.

  <detailed_description>

      An ideal marker which could be used clinically should meet numerous criteria, such as high
      sensitivity or the possibility of easy and quick assessment of its concentration in blood or
      blood plasma.The Fisher's scale presents an alternative for evaluating patients with
      subarachnoid hemorrhage . The investigator are going to evaluate both plasma markers and
      fishers scale at SAH.
