  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children recovered in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) suffer from severe conditions,
      sometimes life-threatening. Thus, priority is given to urgent somatic care, children
      medicalization is strong, invasive technics have to be used, and medical monitoring is close.

      A stay in PICU often leaves a painful memory to the child and family, and can lead to
      psychological morbidity such as post-traumatic stress disease.

      This study aims to assess parents' experience during their child hospitalization in PICU, and
      the impact of this stay on the entire family in the following month.
