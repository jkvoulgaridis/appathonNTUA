    <textblock>
      Accurate diagnosis of stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) is an essential step in
      providing acute stroke care to a community. The gold-standard for diagnosis LVO is brain
      imaging, which is impractical in the pre-hospital setting. A non-invasive method to detect
      LVO is needed. Using highly sensitive accelerometers, one can measure the &quot;HeadPulse&quot;- tiny
      forces exerted on the skull from the cardiac contraction. This study tests the hypothesis
      that LVO alters the HeadPulse characteristically. Analysis of these data along with the
      subjects vascular status (LVO vs. non-LVO as measured by CT angiography) will be used to
      create a model that can predict LVO status in suspect stroke subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large vessel occlusion (LVO) ischemic stroke is a treatable disease at specialized centers.
      Clinical outcomes of patients with LVO is time-dependent. To maximize clinical benefit of
      thrombectomy, stroke systems of care need accurate methods to triage patients with LVO to
      comprehensive stroke centers or thrombectomy ready centers rather than closer primary stroke
      centers.

      EPISODE will evaluate whether measurements of the HeadPulse can predict the presence or
      absence of LVO based on recordings from a consecutive series of patients undergoing CTA for
      suspected stroke. Recordings from patients pre- and post-thrombectomy will also be compared
      to investigate whether a systematic change in cranial forces exists during LVO.
