  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It will be investigated whether it is possible to predict the effect or lack of effect of
      first-line treatment by analysing cancer cells from the individual patient receiving standard
      first line treatment. Also, the feasibility of selecting second-line therapy based on
      pre-treatment biopsies will be investigated.

      Cells from pancreatic cancer will be grown in the laboratory to form small, circulating
      tumors and adjacent tissue, so called tumoroids. The tumoroids will then be exposed to
      different pre-specified anticancer drugs to hopefully reveal sensitivity or lack of
      sensitivity in the specific patient.
