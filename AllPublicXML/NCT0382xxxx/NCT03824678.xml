  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to assess the PK of a single 1-mg oral dose of CC-220
      in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, and in matched healthy
      control subjects with normal hepatic function.

      Degree of hepatic impairment will be determined during the Screening period by the subject's
      score according to Child-Pugh Classification Criteria

      Subjects will be enrolled in Groups 1 through 5 as follows:

        -  Group 1: Approximately 8 male or female subjects with mild hepatic impairment (with a
           Child Pugh score of ≥ 5 to ≤ 6) will be enrolled in Group 1.

        -  Group 2: Approximately 8 male or female subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (with
           a Child Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9) will be enrolled in Group 2.

        -  Group 3: Approximately 8 male or female subjects with severe hepatic impairment (with a
           Child Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13) will be enrolled in Group 3.

        -  Group 4: Approximately 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic function
           will be enrolled in Group 4. Subjects in Group 4 will be matched to subjects in Group 2
           with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 13.6 kg [30 pounds]).

        -  Group 5: Approximately 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic function
           will be enrolled in Group 5. Subjects in Group 5 will be matched to subjects in Group 3
           with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 13.6 kg [30 pounds]).

      Subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic
      function may start the study in parallel.

             study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study treatment and at least 28
             days after the end of study treatment with CC-220. The 2 methods of reliable
             contraception must include 1 highly effective method and 1 additional effective
             (barrier) method; options are described below:

             Examples of highly effective methods: intrauterine device; hormonal (birth control
             pills, injections, implants, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system,
             medroxyprogesterone acetate depot injections, ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only
             pills [eg, desogestrel]); tubal ligation; or partner's vasectomy.

             AND Examples of additional effective methods: Male condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap.

          8. Male subjects must:

             a. Practice true abstinence2 (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis, as
             applicable, and source documented) or agree to use a barrier method of birth control
             (condoms not made out of natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms are recommended])
             during sexual contact with a pregnant female or FCBP while participating in the study,
             and for at least 90 days after the dose of IP, even if he has undergone a successful
             vasectomy.

          9. Subject has clinical laboratory safety test results that are within normal limits or
             acceptable to the Investigator.

         10. Subject is afebrile (febrile is defined as ≥ 38°C or 100.4°F), with sitting systolic
             blood pressure ≥ 90 and ≤ 160 mm Hg, sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥ 50 and ≤ 100
             mm Hg, and pulse rate ≥ 40 and ≤ 100 beats per minute at Screening.

             Each subject with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment must also meet all of
             the criteria listed below for entry:

         11. Subject has mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment or cirrhosis due to chronic
             hepatic disease and/or prior alcohol abuse.

         12. Subject has creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.

         13. Subject has mild (Group 1), moderate (Group 2), or severe (Group 3) hepatic impairment
             as defined by Child-Pugh score.

               -  Group 1 subjects (mild hepatic impairment) are required to have documentary
                  confirmation of the diagnosis of liver impairment made by biopsy, laparoscopy, or
                  ultrasound with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 5 to ≤ 6 at Screening.

               -  Group 2 subjects (moderate hepatic impairment) are required to have documentary
                  confirmation of the diagnosis of liver impairment made by biopsy, laparoscopy, or
                  ultrasound with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9 at Screening.

               -  Group 3 subjects (severe hepatic impairment): if biopsy, laparoscopy, or
                  ultrasound is not performed prior to Screening, subjects can be included only if
                  they have chronic liver disease and objective evidence of portal hypertension
                  (ascites diagnosed by imaging or varices), with a Child-Pugh score ≥ 10 and ≤ 13
                  at Screening.

             Subjects should be enrolled into the group corresponding to the Child-Pugh
             classification score that most accurately reflects the most severe hepatic disease
             classification within the past 6 months (based on past medical history or PE
             observation).

             Note: If a Child-Pugh score was previously calculated and documented in the last 6
             months, and it is more severe than the one calculated at Screening, then that previous
             value may be used for study entry purposes. If the Screening Child-Pugh score is more
             severe, then it will be used. If no score was calculated in the 6 months prior to
             Screening, then the score obtained at Screening will be used. Adequate documentation
             should be provided to substantiate the Child-Pugh score assigned to each subject.

         14. Subject must be medically stable for at least 1 month before Screening with clinically
             acceptable medical history, PEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and 12-lead
             ECGs consistent with the underlying hepatic impairment condition, as judged by the
             Investigator.

         15. Subject is stable on a concomitant medication regimen (defined as not starting a new
             medication[s] or a change in the dosage or frequency of the concomitant medication[s]
             within 7 days or 5 half-lives [whichever is longer] before dosing with CC-220).

         16. Subject may be treated with diuretics for ascites; however, subjects with severe
             ascites at time of enrollment may only be included at the discretion of the
             Investigator with agreement of Celgene.

         17. Subject may have a history of encephalopathy; however, they must be on stable
             treatment for at least 1 month prior to Screening and must not have had an acute
             severe encephalopathic episode in the 1 month prior to Screening.

         18. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG at Screening (QT interval
             corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula [QTcF] ≤ 480 msec).

             Each matched healthy subject must also meet all the criteria listed below for entry:

         19. Subject is free of any CS disease that would interfere with the study evaluations and
             has not had any unstable CS illness within 3 months prior to Screening.

         20. Subject has liver-related laboratory test results within the respective reference
             ranges or with clinically insignificant excursions therefrom as agreed by the
             Investigator and Celgene's Medical Monitor.

         21. Subject must match a subject in Group 2 or 3, as needed, primarily with respect to
             sex, age (± 10 years) and weight (± 13.6 kg [30 pounds]). Group 4 subjects will be
             matched with subjects from Group 2, and Group 5 subjects will be matched with Group 3
             subjects.

         22. Subject is in good health as determined by past medical history, PEs, vital signs,
             ECG, and clinical laboratory results. Clinical laboratory results (ie, hematology,
             chemistry, and urinalysis) and 12-lead ECGs must be within normal limits or clinically
             acceptable as judged by the Investigator. In addition:

               1. If male, subject has a QTcF value ≤ 440 msec at Screening.

               2. If female, subject has a QTcF value ≤ 460 msec at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has any significant and relevant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or
             psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which
