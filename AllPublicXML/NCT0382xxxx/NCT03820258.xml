      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      confirm the age-appropriate dose of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX)
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) in pediatric participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection.
