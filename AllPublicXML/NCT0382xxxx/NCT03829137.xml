  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome causes urgency, with or without urgent incontinence,
      daytime frequency and nocturia. Urgency incontinence is more common in older women and may be
      associated with comorbid conditions that occur with age. The standard OAB medical treatments
      may induced several intolerable side effects including dry mouth, constipation, and so on,
      therefore alternative therapies are often considered. Acupuncture had been proved effective
      to OAB treatment, however, this invasive procedure also cause pain and hematoma. Laser
      acupuncture has minimal side effects comparing to conventional acupuncture, but its effects
      against OAB had never been examined. Experiments with laser acupuncture are expected to be
      another way to relieve OAB symptoms.

      The subjects are treated with 7 acupoints which are localized according to WHO standardized
      acupressure point location guideline. The patients lay in the supine position before
      treatment and the gallium aluminum arsenide LaserPan (RJ-Laser, Reimers &amp; Janssen GmbH,
      Waldkirch, Germany) will be applied to each selected acupoints mentioned above. The
      experimental group (verum laser acupuncture) and control group (sham laser acupuncture) will
      receive laser acupuncture 3 times per week for 3 weeks, total of 9 sessions, based on
      clinical experience (Treatment could be extended if necessary). The basic patient data will
      be recorded at baseline and adverse effect will also be recorded during the clinical trial.
