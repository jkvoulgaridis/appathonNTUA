      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of metformin and nelfinavir in
      treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back or does not respond to treatment.
      Metformin may stop the growth of tumor cells by disrupting the energy source within multiple
      myeloma cells. Nelfinavir may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving metformin and nelfinavir may work better in treating patients
      with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of administering metformin hydrochloride
      (metformin) in combination with nelfinavir mesylate (nelfinavir) in patients with
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety and tolerability of metformin in combination with nelfinavir in
      patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To assess the best hematological response of the combination of metformin and nelfinavir
      within 6 cycles of initiating therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety and tolerability of adding bortezomib to the combination of
      metformin and nelfinavir.

      II. To describe any depth of hematological response obtained after adding bortezomib to the
      combination of metformin and nelfinavir.

      III. Assess clinical biomarkers predictive of response to the combination of metformin and
      nelfinavir with or without the addition of bortezomib such as bioenergetic profiles of the
      myeloma cells, GLUT4 expression on myeloma cells, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways
      and metabolomics-based profiling.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 1-21 of cycle 1 and days 1-14 of
      cycles 2-6. Patients also receive nelfinavir mesylate PO on days 1-14. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with progressive disease (PD) at any time within 5 cycles or no minimal
      response (unconfirmed [u]MR or MR) after 2 cycles or no partial response (uPR or PR) after 4
      cycles also receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) once weekly every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
