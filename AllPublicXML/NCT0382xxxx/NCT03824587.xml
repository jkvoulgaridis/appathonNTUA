  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of
      tenapanor on change in s-P levels when tenapanor is administered orally, twice daily for 28
      days as adjunctive therapy to ESRD subjects with hyperphosphatemia on stable phosphate binder
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a Screening visit; a Run-in Period of at least 2 weeks and up to 4
      weeks, where existing phosphate binder treatment is maintained; and a 4-week Double-Blind
      Treatment Period.

      At Screening, a subject must be on thrice daily phosphate binder therapy and have a serum
      phosphate (s-P) level ≥5.5 and ≤10.0 mg/dL to qualify for entering the study. s-P will be
      measured at each visit during the run-in period to enable the evaluation of the s-P
      randomization criteria.

      Subjects who qualify to enroll in the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      tenapanor or placebo while continuing their existing phosphate binder treatment.

      During the Double-Blind Treatment Period, subjects will receive tenapanor or placebo starting
      at a dose of 30 mg bid

          -  Chronic maintenance hemodialysis (HD) 3x/week for at least 3 months or chronic
             maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD) for a minimum of 6 months.

             for the last 4 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Kt/V ≥1.2 at most recent measurement prior to Screening.

          -  Prescribed and taking phosphate binder medication at least 3 times per day, and the
             prescribed dose should have been unchanged during the last 4 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Serum phosphorus levels must be ≥5.5 and ≤10.0 mg/dL at Screening and the end of the
             run-in period, analyzed at the central laboratory used in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe hyperphosphatemia defined as having an s-P level &gt;10.0 mg/dL on
             phosphate-binders at any time point during routine clinical monitoring for the 3
             preceding months before Screening.

          -  Serum/plasma parathyroid hormone &gt;1200 pg/mL.

          -  Clinical signs of hypovolemia at Screening as judged by the Investigator.

          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea
             (IBS-D).
