      Intraoral Neuromuscular Training for Treatment of Snoring

      Objective

      Studies show that improving pharyngeal muscle tone can ameliorate obstructive sleep apnoea
      (OSA) and snoring. The study uses an intra-oral stimulation device (SnooZeal) aimed at a
      population of snorers. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of intra-oral
      neuromuscular stimulation training during wakefulness on snoring.

      Methods

      This is a prospective study, recruiting up to 200 patients from the sleep clinics.

      In this study, subjects will use the intra-oral stimulation device once a day for 20 minutes
      each time for a period of 6 weeks. During these 6 weeks, subjects will complete a daily diary
      of the device use and any side effects or adverse events. Partners also complete a daily
      snoring score.

      Subjects will be followed-up for a further 2 weeks after treatment. They will complete
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and subjective sleep quality questionnaires for a
      further 2 weeks. Partners will also complete the post treatment snoring scores. Sleep study
      will be repeated.

      Outcome measures

      The objective evaluation will be based on pre- and post-treatment sleep studies, visual
      analogue scale (VAS) snoring scores, PSQI and subjective sleep quality questionnaire. All
      side effects and adverse events will be reported and acted upon according to the risk
      management structure.

      Aim/ Objective

      The aim of this study will be to assess the efficacy of transoral neuromuscular stimulation
      training during wakefulness on snoring.

      Patients and Methods

      This is a prospective observational study, recruiting patients from the sleep clinics at the
      Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery in Queen's Hospital, Barking,
      Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Trust

      Sample size planned is up to 200 participants.

      Study Protocol

      A. Screening Participants will be identified from Queen's Hospital, Barking, Havering and
      Redbridge NHS Trust. There will be a screening phone call to ensure suitability based on an
      inclusion criterion and offer first line information about the trial. If suitable,
      participants will be given a written information sheet and invited to undertake a 2 day home
      sleep study (using WatchPAT). If the average apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from these 2 days is
      below 15/h, the participants will be invited for a clinical examination.

      B. Recruitment visit

        -  Clinical airway examination by Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) consultant

        -  Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria

        -  Informed consent

        -  Inclusion into trial

      C. Pre-therapy period (day -14 to -1):

        -  Bed partner daily subjective assessment of snoring (Visual Analogue Scale -
           participant's bed partner will be required to complete daily visual analogue scoring of
           the participant's snoring, with 1 being &quot;no snoring&quot; and 10 being &quot;intolerable snoring&quot;)

        -  Oral examination (detailed examination by dentist to document pre-therapy oral state

        -  Participant and bed partner to complete sleep quality questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep
           Quality Index, Epsworth sleepiness score (ESS) and subjective sleep quality
           questionnaire) on Day -1

      D. Therapy phase (day 1-42)

        -  Face-to-face meeting, instruction on use of the intraoral device

        -  Participant to use the Snoozeal device for 20 minutes once daily

        -  Bed partner daily subjective assessment of snoring (VAS)

        -  Participant daily assessment of side effects/adverse events and time of use

        -  Participant and bed partner to complete Sleep quality Questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep
           Quality Index, Epsworth sleepiness score and subjective sleep quality questionnaire) at
           day 42

        -  Weekly follow up phone call from research team to confirm compliance. Compliance will
           also be cross checked using the total time of use recorded by the device.

      E. End of Therapy Review (day 43 - 49)

        -  Review of device integrity by visual inspection

        -  Oral examination (detailed examination by dentist to document post therapy oral state)

        -  Repeat Sleep Study - 2 night sleep study with WatchPAT

      F. Follow Up phase (day 43-56)

        -  Participant advised to stop using device

        -  Bed partner daily subjective assessment of snoring (VAS)

        -  Subject and bed partner to complete Sleep quality Questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep
           Quality Index, Epworth sleepiness score and subjective sleep quality questionnaire) at
           day 56

      G. Post Therapy Review (day 57)

        -  Face-to-face meeting and feedback

        -  Collection of participant data sheets

        -  Participant subjective overall assessment

      Data Analysis

      The pre and post sleep studies will be performed using WatchPAT. Parameters recorded:
      saturation, AHI, snoring sound parameters.

      AHI will be identified and analyzed by WatchPAT data and software. The WatchPat is an
      approved FDA sleep study device. Snoring will be quantified subjectively by both the bed
      partner using a visual analog score, and objectively during the home sleep study as frequency
      of snores (number of snores / hours of sleep) and % total sleep time spent snoring. Sleep
      quality will be quantified subjectively by PSQI score. Sleepiness will be quantified
      subjectively by ESS score.

    <description>AHI is an index to measure the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea and is obtained from a sleep study.

    <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS) of snoring is a subjective assessment of the participant's severity of scoring by their partner on a scale of 1 - 10 (1 being no snoring, 10 being intolerable snoring). This assessment will be done on a daily basis for the 2 weeks prior to intervention, 6 weeks of intervention and 2 weeks post intervention.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between pre-therapy (day -1) and post therapy (day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-report questionnaire that is completed by the participants at day -1 (pre-therapy), day 42 (end of therapy) and day 56 (post therapy). The questions are multiple choice questions with the answers based on participants' usual sleep habits during the last four weeks. The outcome is assessed based on the evaluation of the change in responses before and after therapy. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective sleep quality questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between pre-therapy (day -1) and post therapy (day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a subjective questionnaire to be completed by the participants regarding their sleep quality at day -1 (pre-therapy), day 42 (end of therapy) and day 56 (post therapy). The questions relate to participants' sleep quality over the last two weeks using visual analogue scales and numerical rating scale as answers (range 0 to 10, 0 being best, 10 being worst). The outcome is assessed based on the movement on the scale after therapy.</description>
