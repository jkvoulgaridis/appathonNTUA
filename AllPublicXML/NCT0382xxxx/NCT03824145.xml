  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized trial in 40 women
      with clinically stable MBC to participate in a cognitive behavioral lifestyle intervention
      based on the American Cancer Society's (ACS) cancer survivorship guidelines for nutrition and
      physical activity. The Investigator will use dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry or DXA to
      document intervention effects on body composition; and the Investigator will also examine
      patient reported outcomes, mitochondrial function and biomarkers of prognosis/survival.

      Aims/Objectives

      Aim 1. To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 12 week cognitive-behavioral
      lifestyle intervention, assessing rates of study eligibility, accrual, adherence, and
      attrition.

      Aim 2. To examine the impact of a 12-week lifestyle intervention on body composition, the
      associations with serum biomarkers of prognosis and survival, and patient reported outcomes.

      Hypothesis 1: Increases in LST with or without decreases in adipose tissue [measured by dual
      energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)] will be associated with improvements in the serum
      biomarkers of BC prognosis and survival [inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein
      (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), interleukin-6 (IL-6)]; cytokines (e.g., leptin,
      adiponectin); insulin resistance (e.g., insulin, glucose)].

      Hypothesis 2: Increases in LST with or without decreases in adipose tissue will be associated
      with improvements in symptom burden and quality of life.

      Exploratory Aim

      Aim 3. To explore the effect of a 12-week lifestyle intervention on mitochondrial function
      and its association with symptom burden.
