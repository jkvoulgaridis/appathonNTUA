  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholic liver disease has become one of the foremost causes of chronic liver disease across
      the world, and a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality. Alcoholic steatohepatitis is
      an entity in this broad spectrum, with severe alcoholic hepatitis transitioning to acute on
      chronic liver failure carrying a one month mortality of as high as 20 to 50%.

      The current management guidelines for severe alcoholic hepatitis show benefit with prolonged
      alcohol abstinence, nutritional support, the use of corticosteroids, pentoxifylline or
      N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and early liver transplantation. However, major studies and
      meta-analyses have demonstrated that these interventions, with the exception of early liver
      transplantation, do not improve mortality rates to the level of statistical significance.
      Owing to the high short term mortality associated with severe alcoholic hepatitis, the
      inadequacy of a treatment that could significantly impact this short term mortality, and the
      limited applicability of early liver transplantation, a study on newer modalities of
      treatment is warranted.

      The role that human gut microbiota plays in health and disease is receiving considerable
      attention. Targeting intestinal dysbiosis, a phenomenon found to be intricately linked with
      the causation of alcoholic hepatitis, could provide insights into novel therapeutic
      strategies.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation is a novel approach that has gained widespread acceptance in
      in the management of recurrent severe Clostridium difficile infection. It's role is also
      being studied in other diseases where an association with gut dysbiosis has been found, such
      as in inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. The role of FMT has also been
      studied in liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver cirrhosis
      and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In this process, a diseased recipient is transferred
      fecal material containing the microflora of a healthy individual. It limits the colonization
      of pathogens, inducing colonization resistance, affects microbiota composition in the gut, as
      well as metabolism in the microbial pathogens. FMT helps alleviate gut dysbiosis and restores
      gut microbial diversity.

      Our aim is to evaluate the role of FMT on short term survival and improvement in scores of
      prognostic significance (CTP, MELD, MELDNa, mDF) in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis.
