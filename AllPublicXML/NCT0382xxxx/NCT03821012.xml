      The China ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) Care Project (CSCAP) aims to improve the
      reperfusion treatment rate and shorten the total duration of myocardial ischemia by
      establishing a regional STEMI treatment network covering the whole-city region, whole-city
      population, and whole-disease process step by step. The CSCAP is a prospective, multicenter
      registry involving three phases. A total of 18 provinces, 4 municipalities, and 2 autonomous
      regions in China were included. Patients with STEMI who met with the third acute myocardial
      infarction definition and the Chinese STEMI diagnosis and treatment guidelines were enrolled
      and the estimated number is over 50,000. Phase 1 (CSCAP-1) focused on the in-hospital process
      optimization of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) hospitals. Phase 2
      (CSCAP-2) focused on the PPCI hospital-based regional STEMI transfer network, including
      emergency medical services and non-PPCI hospitals. Phase 3 (CSCAP-3) focused on the
      whole-city STEMI care network construction by promoting chest pain center accreditation.
      Systematic data collection, assessment of quality of care, and subsequent improvement were
      implemented throughout the project to continuously improve the quality of care for patients
      with STEMI.

      CSCAP is the first project that focused on establishing a regional STEMI emergency care
      network in China to help understand the condition of STEMI care in China extensively.
      Moreover, its objective was to optimize the quality of STEMI care through in-hospital process
      optimization (2012-2013), PPCI hospital-based regional STEMI transfer network construction
      (2015-2018), and construction of the whole-city STEMI care network step by step (2018-2021).
      However, hospitals were not randomly selected in CSCAP, which might be because of the lack of
      representatives to some degree. Alternatively, it focused on providing a tailored
      quality-of-care improvement plan based on the conditions of different regions.

        In CSCAP-1, a total of 4191 patients admitted to hospitals, with symptom onset within 12 h,
        regardless of whether receiving reperfusion or symptom onset within 12-24 h of needing
        PPCI, were enrolled consecutively in 53 tertiary hospitals qualified for PPCI in 14
        provinces/municipalities/autonomous regions of China in 2012.

        In CSCAP-2, a total of 20,799 patients with STEMI occurrence within 30 days, regardless of
        reperfusion, were enrolled consecutively from PPCI hospitals 3 times at a 6-month interval
        in 244 PCI hospitals with hundreds of adjunct non-PCI hospitals from 24
        provinces/municipalities/autonomous regions from 2015 to 2018.

        In CSCAP-3, a total of 30 hospitalized patients with symptom onset within 30 days were
        enrolled consecutively from each hospital every 3 months. Patients with STEMI were enrolled
        consecutively from the whole network units, including both PCI and non-PCI hospitals in 7
        cities in China.
