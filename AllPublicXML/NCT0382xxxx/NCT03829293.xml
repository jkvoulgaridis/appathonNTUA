  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO)
      versus standard oxygen therapy (nasal prongs, nasopharyngeal catheter or standard face mask)
      during gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy with sedation to reduce the incidence of hypoxia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxemia is the most common complication during a gastrointestinal endoscopy with sedation.
      Oxygenation is usually applied during the procedure to prevent the occurrence of
      desaturation. Conventional oxygen is typically administered by conventional nasal cannula, by
      nasopharyngeal catheter or by a facemask with mild flow of oxygen. The flow of standard
      oxygen is limited to 15L/min.

      High-flow nasal cannula oxygenation is a new method of humidified and heated oxygenation with
      a higher flow rates (up to 70L/min).

      The primary outcome will be the incidence of hypoxia defined by pulsed saturation with oxygen
      (SpO2) ≤92%. The investigator's hypothesis is that high-flow nasal oxygen therapy will
      decrease the frequency of hypoxemia during gastrointestinal endoscopy under sedation.
