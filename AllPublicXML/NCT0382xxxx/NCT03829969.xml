  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled phase III study. The
      objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of JS001 combined with
      paclitaxel and cisplatin(TP regimen )with placebo combined with TP regimen in patients with
      advanced or metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma(ESCC )who have not received
      systemic chemotherapy previously.

      About 500 patients with advanced or metastatic ESCC who have not received chemotherapy
      previously will be enrolled in this study and 1:1 randomized into JS001 combined with TP
      group and placebo combined with TP group (i.e., 250 patients each in group A and B).. About
      55% of all the subjects enrolled, i.e., 275 subjects, are expected not to be the carriers of
      11q13 region amplification.

      Two combined primary efficacy endpoints are set for all the population randomized and
      subgroup population who are randomized and do not carry 11q13 region amplification in this
      study: progression-free survival PFS and overall survival OS evaluated by blind independent
      central review (BICR).Two combined primary efficacy endpoints are set for ITT population and
      the subgroup population who do not carry 11q13 region amplification in this study: PFS
      (evaluated by blind independent central review BICR in accordance with RECIST 1.1) and OS.
      Weighted Bonferroni method will be used to control type Ⅰ error in the primary efficacy
      analysis in ITT population and the subgroup population who do not carry 11q13 region
      amplification (two-sided α 0.04 for ITT and 0.01 for the subgroup population who do not carry
      11q13 region amplification), and hierarchical testing method will be used for analysis of PFS
      and OS in each population.

              15. Any other disease, metabolic disorder, physical examination finding or abnormal
                  laboratory examination, with the reason to suspect that it can lead to
