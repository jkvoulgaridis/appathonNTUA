  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to recommendations for treatment of chronic constipation in pediatric population is
      often poor. This study is attempting to improve adherence, and outcomes, by implementing a
      trial of a constipation action plan plus standard of care, compared to standard of care
      alone, in an outpatient pediatric population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional Constipation is a common childhood problem. The goal of this study is to evaluate
      if a constipation action plan had any impact on improved adherence in management. Children
      are eligible to participate in the study if they are otherwise healthy children whose primary
      language is English with no conditions that would predispose them to develop constipation,
      between the ages of 3 and 8 years of age and if they meet the ROME IV criteria for functional
      constipation. The primary objective is to assess compliance in pediatric patients with
      functional constipation that have been provided a constipation action plan plus educational
      information. The secondary objectives are to assess improvement of constipation symptoms in
      pediatric patients with functional constipation that have been provided a constipation action
      plan and educational information and to assess the perceived effectiveness of the
      constipation action plan from the viewpoint of the family. The proposed study hypothesizes
      that patients diagnosed with functional constipation will have improved adherence to
      medication treatment plan, to fiber intake, and to toilet sit time and have improved
      constipation symptoms overall when provided with both a constipation action plan and
      educational information regarding dietary changes, toilet sit time, and medications as
      compared to education information alone.

There is no better or worse outcome, just stratification of literacy (medical) is determined.</description>

    <description>Each family will receive a randomized packet containing educational information, rewards charts and an adult literacy test. The treatment plan will be determined based on recommendations from the clinical guidelines for the Evaluation and Treatment of Functional Constipation Infants and Children as published by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition. At the first visit, the parent(s) will complete an adult literacy test and an initial paper questionnaire regarding symptoms, adherence to the treatment plan and demographics. At 1 month, the primary investigator will call each family and administer a phone survey regarding symptoms and adherence to the treatment plan in the past month. At 3 months, the families will return for a follow up visit with their 3 month reward charts and complete a final paper survey regarding the child's symptoms and adherence to the treatment plan.</description>
