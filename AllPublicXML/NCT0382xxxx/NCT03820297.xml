    <textblock>
      Approximately 50 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve 45 eligible patients
      with mood/anxiety disorders to complete a 10 weekly anti-stigma group intervention (ASGI) in
      addition to several self-report internalized stigma and psychiatric measures.This study will
      examine changes in internalized stigma and psychiatric symptoms pre- and post-ASGI with 3
      months post-intervention follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self stigma of mental illness scale</measure>
    <time_frame>23 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 40-item self-report scale assesses the extent of patient self-stigma. Items are rated on a 9-point Likert-type scale (1= Strongly Disagree; 9= Strongly Agree).
Total score from 1 to 9 (average score) Higher score means worse outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery assessment scale</measure>
    <time_frame>23 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Empowerment will be assessed using the 15-item scale from the Recovery Assessment Scale. This scale measures domains of recovery including 1) personal confidence and hope 2) willingness to ask for help 3) goal and success orientation 4) reliance on others 5) symptom coping. Patients are asked to describe themselves using a 5-point agreement scale (1= strongly disagree, 5= strongly agree) regarding their recovery.
Total score from15 to 75 (summed score) Higher score means better outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-protective Withdrawal and Secrecy scale</measure>
    <time_frame>23 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in use of self-protective withdrawal and secrecy as a strategy for coping with public stigma will be evaluated using two scales to assess patients' responses to their stigmatized status.
Secrecy subscale: a 5-item Likert-type scale (1=strongly agree, 6=strongly disagree) assessing use of concealment of mental illness.
Total score: 5 to 30 (summed score)
Withdrawal subscale consists of 7 items (1=strongly agree, 6=strongly disagree) assessing &quot;limiting social interaction to those who know about and tend to accept one's stigmatized condition&quot;.
Total score: 6 to 42 (average score).
For the overall scale, summed score will be used. Higher score means better outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in social support</measure>
    <time_frame>23 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective support and social interaction subscales from the Abbreviated Duke Social Support Scale (ADSSS) will be used to measure changes in social support. It is an 11-item Likert-type scalewhich has been shown to correlate well with mental and physical health outcomes.
Social interaction sub-scale: patients are asked 4 items to describe their telephone and face-to-face interaction patterns during the past week (1=none, 2=1-2 people, 3=more than 2 people).
Total score: 4 to 12 (summed score ).
Satisfaction with social support sub-scale: they are asked to respond to 7 questions such as &quot;Does it seem that your family and friends understand you most of the time, some of the time, or hardly ever?&quot; (1=hardly ever, 2=some of the time, 3=most of the time).
Total score: 7 to 21 (summed score)
For the overall scale, total score from 11 to 33 (summed score of two subscales). A higher score means better outcome</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in patient depressive symptoms measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>23 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a 9-item interview assessing depressive symptoms which is a reliable and valid measure of depression severity (0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, 3=nearly everyday).
Total score: 27 (summed score). A higher score means worse outcome</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in patient anxiety symptoms associated with stigma reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>23 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7) is a 7-item interview assessing anxiety symptoms (0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, 3=nearly everyday).
Total score: 21 (summed score will be used). A higher score means worse outcome</description>
