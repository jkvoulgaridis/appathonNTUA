      Background and Purposes: Administering activities of daily living (ADL) and recovery of ADL
      functions are the primary efficacy indicators in long-term care and the main treatment goals
      in rehabilitation for patients with stroke. Residential rehabilitation is a direct way to
      observe patients' living environment and provides feasible ADL treatment plans for patients
      with stroke living at home or in the community. However, there are three limitations in
      previous studies on ADL training in residential rehabilitation. First, few studies provide
      clear programs or principles on ADL training in home environment. Second, the domains of ADL
      that are assessed are too limited. Previous studies only assess patients' ADL actual
      performance, not assess ADL capability and ADL perceived difficulty. Three, effects of ADL
      training on other function (e.g., motor, cognition, perception) are not investigated. These
      limitations reduce clinicians and researchers to provide effective ADL training in home
      environment. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, the investigators will develop a
      program of Domiciliary care- Activities of Daily Living (DO-ADL) and evaluate the effects of
      the DO-ADL program on ADL and other functions (i.e., motor, cognition, perception, sensory,
      quality of life, and depression).

      Methods: The 3-year research project consists of 2 stages. In the first stage, the
      investigators will conduct a pilot study. A six-week home program on basic ADL (BADL) will be
      designed. Thirty patients with stroke will be recruited and assigned into two groups (i.e.,
      BADL home program and control group who receives traditional rehabilitation in hospital) for
      evaluating the feasibility of the BADL home program. In the second stage, the investigators
      will hold expert meetings to establish the principles of administrating the DO-ADL program
      and design the 12-week DO-ADL program according to the results from the first stage. The
      DO-ADL program contains the training on BADL and instrumental ADL (IADL). The investigators
      will recruit 60 patients with stroke and divide them into two groups (i.e., DO-ADL group and
      traditional rehabilitation group). The primary outcome measures are the Canadian Occupational
      Performance Measure, the Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales, the Frenchay Activities
      Index, and ADL domain of the Stroke Impact Scale. The secondary outcome measures are the
      Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Test of Visual Perceptual
      Skills-Third Edition, and the Center of Epidemiological Study-Depression
