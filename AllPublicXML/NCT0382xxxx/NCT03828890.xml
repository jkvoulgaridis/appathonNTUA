  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal for this study is to improve compliance of screening for diabetic
      retinopathy among subjects with diabetes. Researchers are also doing this research to
      determine the ability of appropriately trained family physicians to screen for and identify
      Diabetic Retinopathy using a retinal camera in addition to determining an overall patient
      perspective of the convenience and cost-effectiveness of retinal imaging within a primary
      care setting.

    <measure>Family Physicians Screening for Diabetic Retinopathy - Number of photographs that are interpreted accurately by the family physicians when compared to the retinal specialist</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of photographs that are interpreted accurately by the family physicians when compared to the retinal specialist. These photographs are obtained using retinal imaging and after the initial read by the family physicians trained to interpret the images, the images will be reviewed by the retinal specialist to determine if the interpreted results are accurate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Screening Impact - Percentage increase in the screening rates for Diabetic Retinopathy using retinal imaging.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage increase in the screening rates for Diabetic Retinopathy using retinal imaging using OPTOS when compared with the traditional dilated eye exam.The current screening rate is around 55%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage change in patient satisfaction and how much are patients willing to pay out of pocket to screen for Diabetic Retinopathy using retinal imaging. Each patient will be surveyed and these questions will help determine patient satisfaction and their willingness to pay for this versus usual care. We will ask the following questions:
Did you find the Retinal Imaging an easy/efficient way of screening for eye disease as a result of having diabetes? Yes/No
If you had to pay for this out-of-pocket what is the maximum amount you would be willing to pay?
$25
$50
$75
$100
&gt;$100 This will help us determine the patient's level of satisfaction and their willingness to pay out of pocket for the service.</description>
