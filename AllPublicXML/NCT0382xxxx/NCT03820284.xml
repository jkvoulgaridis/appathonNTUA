      Introduction:

      Helicobacter pylori has been linked to a variety of gastric and extra gastric diseases.
      Chronic infection with H. pylori causes histologically evident gastritis in all colonized
      individuals and is the predominant risk factor for gastric and duodenal ulcers as well as
      gastric adenocarcinoma. However, increasingly robust experimental and epidemiological
      evidence suggests that H. pylori may at the same time be beneficial to its carriers, as it
      efficiently prevents allergic disorders and chronic inflammatory conditions .

      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic, nonspecific intestinal
      inflammation with an unexplained pathology and an alternating relapsing and remitting
      clinical progression. IBD is divided into two subtypes: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). Most studies in the IBD field attribute its etiology to the complex
      interactions among immune dysfunction, genetic susceptibility of the host, and environmental
      risk factors.

      Since the twenty-first century, improving hygienic conditions and socioeconomic status have
      reduced the H. pylori infection rate and this trend has concurrently been accompanied by an
      increased IBD incidence in most countries Numerous studies have reported a lower H. pylori
      infection rate in patients with CD and/or UC than in non-IBD control individuals. although a
      small number of studies showed no significant association .Recently, emerging epidemiologic
      studies and animal experiments revealed an inverse correlation between H. pylori infection
      and IBD onset, suggesting that H. pylori colonization exerts a special protective effect on
      autoimmune diseases

      observation Cross sectional study will be conducted at assuit university hospitals on all
      patients with inflammatory disease to detect the prevalence of helicobacter pylori among them
      .Then the examined patients will be divided in to two group receiving the same medication
      group A : inflammatory bowel disease patient with H.PYLORI group B: inflammatory bowel
      disease Patient without H.PYLORI longitudinal study will be conducted to both group to study
      the clinical outcomes in both group .

      PATIENT AND METHOD :

      observation Cross sectional study will be conducted at assuit university hospitals on all
      patients with inflammatory disease to detect the prevalence of helicobacter pylori among them
      .Then the examined patients will be divided in to two group receiving the same medication
      group A : inflammatory bowel disease patient with H.PYLORI group B: inflammatory bowel
      disease Patient without H.PYLORI longitudinal study will be conducted to both group to study
      the clinical outcomes in both group .

        1. Thorough medical history and full clinical examination will be taken from all patient
           including

           -Personal history focus on special habit especially smoking

           -documented previous history for H.pylori eradication

             -  Onset and duration of inflammatory bowel disease

             -  current medication

             -  presence of any extra intestinal manifestation of Inflammatory bowel disease

             -  presence of any complications from Inflammatory bowel disease

        2. Investigation :

           -All patients with inflammatory bowel disease will be tested for presence or absence of
           H.PYLORI by histological examination of endoscopically biopsied gastric mucosa

           -his to logical examination of colonic mucosal every 3 months

           -complete blood count

           -serum albumin

           -c reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

           -fecal calprotectin if possible

             -  assess the severity of among both group (A,B) every 3 month for 2years. ulcerative
                by Mayo Score/Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index and Crohn's disease by
                Montreal classifications for Crohn's Disease .

           Mayo Score/Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Stool frequency 0 = Normal 1 = 1-2
           stools/day more than normal 2 = 3-4 stools/day more than normal 3 = 4 stools/day more
           than normal Rectal bleeding 0 = None 1 = Visible blood with stool less than half the
           time 2 = Visible blood with stool half of the time or more 3 = Passing blood alone
           Mucosal appearance at endoscopy 0 = Normal or inactive disease 1 = Mild disease
           (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability) 2 = Moderate disease (marked
           erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions) 3 = Severe disease (spontaneous
           bleeding, ulceration) Physician rating of disease activity 0 = Normal 1 = Mild 2 =
           Moderate 3 = Severe
