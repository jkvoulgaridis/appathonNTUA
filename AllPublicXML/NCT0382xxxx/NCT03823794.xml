  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis, commonly called eczema, is one of the most frequently occurring skin
      conditions. It is estimated to affect around one fifth of children in developed countries and
      is also becoming increasingly common in less developed countries. Exact estimates of how
      common eczema is, vary considerably and there has not been an in-depth analysis of the number
      of people with eczema in the UK. It is also unclear which groups of people are most affected
      and which treatment options are being used.

      Most people with eczema are managed by their general practitioner (GP) with only a few people
      requiring specialist care. GP records therefore provide an excellent opportunity to explore
      how common eczema is and which treatments are being used currently. This study aims to
      provide accurate estimates of the number of people with current eczema (prevalence), number
      developing new onset eczema (incidence), and the pattern of common comorbidities in people
      with eczema. It also aims describe current treatment patterns by age groups and other
      factors. It also will look back over the last decade to identify how the number of people
      with eczema and treatments changing over time. The study will also explore patterns in the
      people most commonly affected and in the treatments used.

      Objective

      This study aims to calculate current and accurate prevalence and incidence estimates for
      atopic dermatitis (AD) by age group and sociodemographic factors. It also aims to describe
      the burden of comorbidity in AD with a focus on atopic and mental health conditions. The
      study also aims to describe the health care resource utilisation of this cohort in terms of
      prescription use, primary care appointments, and specialist referrals.

      Method This study will define AD cases using a previously validated algorithm for case
      identification use clinical codes form primary care in the UK (Read codes). The study will
      analyse the population prevalence and incidence of AD using this definition over a 10-year
      period (2008-2018). Within this population the prevalence of autoimmune conditions
      (rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, type 1 diabetes, and
      multiple sclerosis) will be reported and compared with a cohort of individuals without a
      diagnosis of AD, matched by age and sex at GP practice level. In the same cohort, the annual
      use of topical and oral medications used for the treatment of AD, primary care appointments,
      and specialist referrals, overall and stratified by sociodemographic factors will also be
      reported.
