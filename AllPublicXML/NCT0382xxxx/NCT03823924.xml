  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is not much body composition and bone mineral density data available for patients with
      psoriatic arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis) compared to control subjects.

      The evaluation of the total fat mass and in particular of its abdominal distribution
      (visceral adiposity) is important because an excessive adiposity generates adverse effects on
      the health (hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular risk and resistance to the insulin).

      In addition, data on changes in body composition and bone mineral density were not available
      under a new psA treatment, namely ustekinumab (anti-IL12 / 23 antibody).

      It is proposed to conduct a pilot study to evaluate body composition, distribution (visceral
      adiposity) and bone mineral density in patients with psoriatic arthritis (versus control
      subjects) and their changes after 6 months of treatment with ustekinumab
