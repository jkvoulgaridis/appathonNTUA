  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, proof-of concept investigator-initiated trial planned for 22 patients with
      the diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). The study will compare efficacy of treatment
      using subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy (SCIg) compared to intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IVIg) therapy. The majority of IVIg na誰ve subjects (those not already receiving IVIg) are
      typically managed with non-immunotherapy mostly Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) -enhancing
      drugs such as Baclofen or Diazepam.

      Study Design:This is a proof of concept observational prospective, open label, study on the
      safety, efficacy and convenience of treatment with SCIg study of 22 patients at Thomas
      Jefferson University Hospital. Two cohorts of patients within the total of 22 will be
      included; half of them (11 patients) currently receiving and responding to IVIg and the other
      half starting de novo on SCIg. Patients diagnosed with SPS according to defined sets of
      symptoms will be eligible to enroll.

      The primary clinical outcome will be based on clinical efficacy measures, as used before for
      the IVIg trial, based on changes in the Stiffness Index and Heightened Sensitivity scores,
      using the validated scales that the investigators have had previously utilized and validated
      (Dalakas et al 2001; see attached at the end of the protocol). These same measurements will
      be applied while on IVIg (weeks 0, 4, 8, 12) and will be compared to the measurements
      obtained during SCIg (weeks 16, 20, 24, 28). The secondary outcome will be Quality of Life
      (QoL) responses and patient preference for each treatment.

    <description>Patients are currently receiving IVIg regularly for at least every 6 weeks and exhibit a favorable response will be recruited into the study (11 patients). They will be observed for 12 weeks under their existing IVIg regimen and will undergo measurements of their impairment using the previously validated Stiffness and Sensitivity scales and quality of life questionnaire (QoL) at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12. At week 12, prior to the first SCIg infusion, blood will be drawn for humoral (immunological) studies. One week following the last dose of IVIg (at week 13), the participants will be started on SCIg at a total dose equivalent to the monthly dose of IVIg they have been receiving.</description>

These patients after a 12-week observation period will start directly on SCIg drug (HYQVIA), following the same schedule as described above for the previous group.</description>
