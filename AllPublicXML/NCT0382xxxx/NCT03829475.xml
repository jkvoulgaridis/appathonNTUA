  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to assess the clinical and microbiological impacts of
      FMT in combination with Bezlotoxumab (bezlo) compared to FMT in combination with placebo in
      patients with both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) a and clostridium difficile infection
      (CDI). The investigators will prospectively enroll up to 150 IBD-CDI patients from 4 tertiary
      care FMT referral centers. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either receive FMT in
      combination with Bezlo of FMT and a placebo infusion. Donor stool from healthy donors will be
      obtained from OpenBiome. OpenBiome is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that provides
      hospitals with screened, filtered, and frozen material ready for clinical use. Patients will
      be enrolled and followed prospectively for 3 months post therapy. Stool and blood samples as
      well as clinical data will be collected at baseline, week 1, 8 and 12.

             Bristol 6 or 7 for 48 hours and a confirmatory test for CDI). Preferred testing will
             be a two-step method using GDH/EIA toxin, though PCR will be accepted based on
             hospital availability with confirmation of the most recent episode occurring within
             the prior 3 months

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of IBD (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or indeterminate
             colitis)

          -  Undergoing FMT via colonoscopy for CDI as part of standard medical care

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable or unwilling to undergo a colonoscopy

          -  Inpatient status, though patients can be screened while inpatients, the must be

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 6 months

          -  Unable to adhere to protocol requirements

          -  Patient who have received an FMT in the past year

          -  Any condition that the physician investigators deems unsafe, including other
             conditions or medications that the investigator determines that it will put the
             subject at greater risk from FMT

          -  Patient who is diagnosed with NYHA class 3 or 4 Heart Failure

          -  Lab value of WBC &lt;3.0 x 103/mm3 , Platelets &lt;100 x 103/mm3 , ALT or AST &gt; 1.5 x
             institutional ULN

          -  EBV or CMV negative if a patient is severely immunosuppressed ( defined as 3 or more
             immunosuppressing agents)
