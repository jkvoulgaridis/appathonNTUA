  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's objective is to confirm that an oral probiotic treatment reduces the signs and
      symptoms of moderate atopic dermatitis determined by SCORAD, in patients aged 4 to 17 years,
      as compared to placebo. It will also be examined if the probiotic treatment, as compared to
      placebo, reduces the quantity of topical steroids used to treat disease flares, and increases
      the time till the first disease flare after the end of treatment.
