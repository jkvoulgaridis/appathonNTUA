  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial was to compare the clinical performances of a glass ionomer
      restorative system with a micro hybrid resin based composite in class I and class II
      cavities. A total of 140 (80 class I and 60 class II) lesions in 59 patients were restored
      with a glass ionomer restorative system (Equia) or a micro hybrid composite(Gradia Direct).
      Restorations were evaluated at baseline and yearly during 9 years according to the
      modified-USPHS criteria. Data were analyzed with Cohcran's Q and McNemar's tests (p&lt;0.05).

    <textblock>
      Since the introduction of glass ionomers many modifications of these materials have been
      performed over the years. Compared to other permanent filling materials like resin-based
      composites, glass ionomers show several advantages, such as the ability to adhere to moist
      enamel and dentin and anti- cariogenic properties such as the long-term fluoride release. So,
      it was doubtful that glass ionomers represent a capable counterpart of amalgam or resin-based
      composites in posterior teeth.

    <description>Observers evaluated the restorations was performed using the modified United State Public Health Service criteria regarding marginal adaptation. Marginal adaptation was evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C and D score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha 1: Harmonious outline Alpha 2: Marginal gap (max 100Î¼) with discoloration (removable)</description>

    <description>Observers evaluated the restorations was performed using the modified United State Public Health Service criteria regarding marginal discoloration. Marginal discolouration was evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha: No discoloration anywhere along the margin between the restoration and the adjacent tooth. Bravo: Slight discoloration along the margin between the restoration and the adjacent tooth. Charlie: The discoloration penetrated along the margin of the restorative material in a pulpal direction</description>

A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C and D score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha 1:Clinically excellent Alpha 2: Clinically good with slight deviations from ideal performance, correction possible without damage of tooth or restoration Bravo: Clinically sufficient with few defects, corrections or repair of the restoration possible Charlie: Restoration is partially missed Delta: Restoration is totally missed</description>

A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha 1: Continuous with existing anatomical form Alpha 2: Slightly discontinuous due to some chipping on the proximal ridge Bravo: Discontinuous with existing anatomical form due to material loss but proximal contact still present Charlie: Proximal contact is lost with ridge fracture.</description>

    <description>Observers evaluated the restorations was performed using the modified United State Public Health Service criteria regarding color change. Colour changes was evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha: The restoration matches the adjacent tooth structure in color and translucency.
Bravo: Light mismatch in color, shade or translucency between the restoration and the adjacent tooth. Charlie: The mismatch in color and translucency is outside the acceptable range of tooth color and translucency</description>

    <description>EQUIA Placing glass ionomer restorations, the dentin and enamel of cavities were conditioned with 20% polyacrylic acid for 20 seconds, washed, and briefly dried. Equia Fil was injected into the cavity. Isolation was maintained using cotton rolls and a saliva ejector. After the setting time of 2.5 minutes, the restoration was polished wet using high-speed fine diamonds. When the restoration was briefly dried, Equia Coat was applied and photocured for 20 seconds using a photo-curing light.</description>
