  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dunn Sensory Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a norm-referenced, parent-report questionnaire. The parent rates frequency of each item on a 5-point Likert scale from 1= always to 5= never. It reports the frequency of behavioural occurrences that are used to measure the patterns of performance indicative of difficulties experienced in sensory processing</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BAMBİ</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BAMBI is rated based on a parent proxy report, with a 5-point grading type scale (1 = Never/Very Rarely -5 = At Almost All Mealtimes). It was designed to capture mealtime behaviors specific to children with ASD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>STEP</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is used for to identify the feeding problems of persons with ID in terms of (a) risk of aspiration, (b) food selectivity, (c) feeding skills deficits, (d) food refusal and associated behavior problems, and (e) nutrition-related behavior problems</description>
