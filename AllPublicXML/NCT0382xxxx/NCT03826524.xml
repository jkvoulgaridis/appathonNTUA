  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a low
      cumulative dose of epinephrine compared to a standard cumulative dose of epinephrine during
      resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) in adult
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, single-blinded randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) where eligible OHCA patients are randomized to receive a low cumulative dose of
      epinephrine (low dose epinephrine, up to 2mg total) or a standard cumulative dose of
      epinephrine (standard dose epinephrine, up to 8mg total) in a 1:1 fashion.

      Eligible OHCA patients will be treated by emergency medical service (EMS) providers who will
      initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the delivery of defibrillation shocks per
      EMS treatment protocols. After one defibrillation and when feasible, EMS providers will
      establish peripheral intravenous (IV) access, and patients will be randomly allocated to 1 of
      the 2 study arms. Subsequent study drug doses will be administered every 3-5 minutes, based
      on current guidelines and paramedic protocols, during resuscitation until the first return of
      spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved or if resuscitation has been terminated by the
      base hospital physician. Other medications (e.g. antiarrhythmics, magnesium, beta blockers)
      and interventions (e.g. intubation) may be interposed as required. Follow-up will take place
      using a combination of administrative databases (e.g. the Discharge Abstract Database and the
      National Ambulatory Care Reporting System) and telephone interviews.

      This RCT will evaluate a fundamental change in the treatment of OHCA. The investigators
      hypothesize that a low cumulative dose of epinephrine will improve patient survival to
      hospital discharge compared to a standard cumulative dose of epinephrine.
