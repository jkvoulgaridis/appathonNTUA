  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the incidence of second surgery for adjacent segment disease (ASD) after anterior
      cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been reported, its risk factors remain elusive. Few
      studies have had a sufficiently large number of patients, long follow-up time, and high
      follow-up rate for investigation. To identify non-surgical risk factors of second surgery for
      ASD following ACDF, the study used a national cohort with comprehensive follow-up.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All second ACDF surgery after one year from the first ACDF were identified as a consequence
      of ASD that required another surgery. A multivariate competing risk survival model,
      Kaplan-Meier survivorship, and average time to events were calculated.

      2.1. Data source and ethical concerns The study used the National Health Insurance Research
      Database (NHIRD), a national database containing 26 million administered insurants
      accumulated from January 1997 to December 2013, provided by the National Health Research
      Institutes of Taiwan. Due to the unique social-welfare health insurance system operated by
      the government, it is mandatory for every resident in Taiwan to be enrolled. Thus, the NHIRD
      has covered 99% of the population since its launch in 1996. The monopolistic national health
      insurance also offers unrestricted access to any healthcare provider of the patients'
      choices. The statistics, therefore, gathered by the NHIRD represent a sound cohort for
      investigation of the natural course and subsequent management of diseases. It is particularly
      good for studies that need longitudinal observation for repeat treatment (i.e. surgery for
      ASD) because it allows for the capture of events, even though they may occur in multiple or
      different institutes and hospitals. The universal coverage and comprehensive follow-up
      provided a valuable chance to study ASD.

      All the personal information had already undergone a de-identification and encryption
      process. Individual and hospital identifiers are unique to the research database and
      researchers therefore cannot trace individual patients or health service providers.

    <description>Patients were followed-up for the subsequent surgery (second ACDF) after their index operation (first ACDF). We used the hospitalization date of each admission record as the date of outcome (second ACDF). Each patient was followed-up from his index surgery (first ACDF) to re-operation (second ACDF), death, or end of follow-up (2013/12/31) which comes first.</description>

    <description>The observational study included all patients who had been admitted for their first ACDF surgery during the 16-year span, began on January 1st, 1998 till the end of 2013, recorded in the NHIRD. The admission for cervical disc herniation and spondylosis were identified using the ICD9-CM diagnostic codes of 722.0, 722.4 and 722.71, while the surgery of ACDF was confirmed with the procedure codes of 80.51, 81.00 and 81.02 during the same hospitalization.</description>
