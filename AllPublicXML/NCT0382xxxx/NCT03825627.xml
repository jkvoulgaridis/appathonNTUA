    <textblock>
      This project will investigate if transcranial direct current stimulation can be used as
      treatment for Pedophilia. Treatment efficacy will be evaluated with behavioral tasks and the
      recording of eye-movement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pedophilia is an important motivation for sexual offenses involving children, including child
      pornography and sexual contacts with children (henceforth, pedosexual behavior). Indeed,
      approximately half of individuals convicted for sexual offenses against children have a
      Pedophilic disorder and offenders with a Pedophilic disorder are much more likely to sexually
      reoffend.

      A promising line of research has examined the neurocognitive basis of pedophilia. Pedophilic
      individuals display altered activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) when
      attending to child-related stimuli. This brain area is involved in the cognitive control of
      sexual arousal. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been examined as a
      non-invasive method to increase activity in the dlPCF, ultimately increasing inhibitory
      control over impulses. Accumulating evidence also shows that individuals have an attentional
      bias towards sexually preferred stimuli. These attentional processes can be investigated by
      recording eye movements. Early automatic eye movements are particularly relevant in
      discriminating individuals with pedophilia from those without pedophilia.

      The proposed study will examine the effects of tDCS over the dlPFC of pedophilic individuals
      and healthy controls, while they complete a task requiring controlled attention to virtual
      (computer-generated) images of children and adults. In two separate sessions, participants
      will be randomly assigned to an active and a placebo (sham) tDCS condition. Eye movements
      will be recorded during the task.

      The investigators expect to observe a conflict between automatic and controlled attention
      when participants are presented with their sexually preferred stimuli. Specifically, the
      investigators expect pedophiles to show an attentional bias towards virtual child stimuli.
      The investigators predict that the attentional conflict will be reduced when tDCS is applied,
      compared to the sham condition. If the attentional bias is a key cognitive feature of sexual
      interest, the investigators expect to measure changes in reported or indirectly assessed
      sexual preferences.

    <description>In the Antisaccade task entry time will be recorded with an eye-tracker in both active and sham tDCS conditions. Time to first fixation (entry time) is defined as the time from stimulus onset to the first fixation directed to the target stimulus. This index can be treated as reaction time (RT) and will provide a measure of controlled attention. The location of the first fixation indicates which stimulus captures subject's automatic attention. The proportion of correct/incorrect fixations (%) will inform us about automatic attentional processes. Thus entry time is a single performance index measured with a unit of time, in this case Milliseconds (ms). Every participant's performance in the Antisaccade task will be measured with entry time (ms) as well as the percentage (%) of correct responses. Since the task is not difficult, the percentage values only serve to check for compliance with task instructions. The real focus of the study lies in the RT as recorded with entry time in ms.</description>

    <description>In the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) the differential AAT index (∆RT) will be recorded in both active and sham tDCS condition using the response on the joystick. The proportion of correct/incorrect responses (%) will inform us about automatic attentional processes. Thus the ∆RT is a single performance index for speed tests measured with a unit of time, in this case Milliseconds (ms). It gives information on how fast participants responded using the joystick. In addition, the percentage (%) of correct responses with the joystick will be recorded. Since the task is not difficult, the percentage values only serve to check for compliance and if task instructions were understood. The real focus of the study lies in the RT as recorded with ∆RT in ms.</description>

    <description>During the antisaccade task, the investigators will show participants computer-generated images depicting clothed and sexually relevant (nude) children, young adults and adults of both genders. Images will be drawn from the Virtual People Set and the Not-Real-People Set (Pacific Psychological Assessment Corporation, 2004). Pedophilic participants are expected to show a sexual preference towards a prepubescent body scheme whereas stimuli displaying adolescence and adulthood (sexual maturity) are expected to be sexually preferred by the teleiophilic control participants. In this arm active Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation will be used to influence performance.</description>

    <description>During the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT), participants will look at a series of images depicting children and adults wearing swimsuits. The images were sampled from internet advertisements and do not constitute legally objectionable material. When sourcing the images, rigorous attention was paid to meet the criteria for fair use indicated by the American Psychological Association. There are 160 images in total. Half of the images will be used in the active and the other half in the sham condition (i.e., 20 female adults, 20 female children, 20 male adults, and 20 male children per condition). In this arm active Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation will be used to influence performance.</description>

    <description>Conductive saline-soaked rubber electrodes super-imposed on sponge plates will be placed on the scalp at F3 (active electrode, 4.4×4.4cm) and on the contralateral supraorbital area (reference electrode, 5.1×10.2cm).
Stimulation will be applied using a battery-driven constant-current regulator (Oasis Pro, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). For each stimulation, the direct current is initially increased in a ramp-like fashion over 10 s until reaching 2 milliampere (mA) and will be similarly decreased at the end of stimulation.
In the active tDCS condition, stimulation will be maintained for 20 min; in the sham condition, it will be turned off after 15 s of stimulation, with a ramp-up/down of 10 s (i.e., 35 s total).</description>
