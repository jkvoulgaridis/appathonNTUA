      This is an open-label, randomized, single-dose per period, four-period, crossover study to
      evaluate relative bioavailability of decitabine in three newly formulated THU and decitabine
      combination capsules in comparison to 3 capsules of THU followed 1 hour later by 3 capsules
      of decitabine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must understand and voluntarily sign a written ICF prior to any study related
             procedures being performed and be able to adhere to restrictions and examination
             schedules.

          -  Must be able to communicate with the investigator, and to understand and comply with
             the requirements of the study.

          -  Healthy male volunteers from any race between 18 to 50 years of age (inclusive), and
             in good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital
             signs, ECG, and laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) and a weight
             between 60 and 100 kg (132 to 220 lb), inclusive, at screening.

          -  Subject's clinical laboratory test results have no clinically significant findings, in
             the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) will be assessed in
             the supine position after the subject has rested for at least 5 minutes. At screening,
             the potential subject must be afebrile, with a systolic blood pressure between 90 and
             140 mmHg (inclusive), diastolic blood pressure between 60 and 90 mmHg (inclusive), and
             pulse rate between 50 and 100 bpm (inclusive). Vital signs criteria at each check-in
             and the pre-dose measurements will be at the Investigator's discretion.

          -  Subjects must be free of any clinically significant disease that would interfere with
             the study evaluations.

          -  Subjects (including those who have had a documented vasectomy) must be using a
             double-barrier local contraception (i.e., spermicidal gel plus condom) when engaging
             in sexual activity with women of childbearing potential while on study medication and
             for 28 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Subjects must refrain from sperm donations while on study drug, for the entire
             duration of the study, and for 28 days after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic,
             renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic,
             neurologic, oncologic, or psychiatric disease or any other condition, including the
             presence of laboratory abnormalities, that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             jeopardize the safety of the subject or the validity of the study results.

          -  Any serious medical condition, clinically significant laboratory abnormality, or
             psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the ICF.

          -  Recent history within 3 years of any clinically significant neurological,
             gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychological, pulmonary, metabolic,
             endocrine, hematological or other major disorders.

          -  Used any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 30 days of the first dose
             administration.

          -  Used any non-prescribed systemic (including herbal medicines, e.g. St. John's Wort) or
             topical medication within 7 days of the first dose administration (with the exception
             of vitamin/mineral supplements)

          -  Subjects who have any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug
             absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME).

          -  Exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 90 days preceding the
             first dose administration or currently enrolled in any investigational trials.

          -  Donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks preceding the first dose administration.

          -  History of multiple drug allergies.

          -  Any clinically significant allergic disease (excluding nonactive hay fever).

          -  History of drug abuse of at least 2 years prior to dosing, or positive drug screening
             test due to illicit drugs.

          -  History of alcohol abuse of at least 2 years prior to dosing, or positive alcohol
             screen.

          -  Smokers or users of other tobacco products (e.g., chewing tobacco, or those using
             nicotine-containing products (i.e., patches, gum) in the 3 months prior to screening,
             or positive urine cotinine test.

          -  Known to have serum hepatitis or known to be a carrier of the hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody, or tests positive for HIV (human
             immunodeficiency virus) antibodies at screening.
