  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, Phase I, dose-escalation study of NUC-7738 administered by intravenous
      infusion across two administration schedules.

      Part 1 is a dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumours to assess the
      safety and tolerability of NUC-7738, in addition to establishing the recommended phase II
      dose (RP2D) and dose administration schedule of NUC-7738 for further exploration in Part 2 of
      the study.

      Part 2 will further evaluate the selected RP2D and designated dosing schedule in an expansion
      cohort of up to 20 additional patients with advanced solid tumours and an additional 12
      patients with lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      Part 1:

      The study will commence with weekly administration, the starting dose for the first cohort
      will be 14 mg/m2. Dose escalation will begin with a modified 1+1 accelerated titration cohort
      design. A single patient will be treated in each sequential dosing cohort, with dose
      escalation allowed if ≤1 moderate safety observation (MSO) is reported during the 14-day
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period. A MSO is defined as an adverse event (AE)
      meeting Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of Grade 2 criteria or higher,
      is clinically significant, probably or definitely related to NUC-7738, and unrelated to
      underlying disease or fatigue. If two or more MSOs are documented in the first patient in the
      cohort, a second patient will be enrolled. If ≤1 MSOs are reported in the second patient,
      dose escalation will continue using the 1+1 design. If two or more MSOs are noted in the
      second patient, or upon evidence of a DLT in any patient, the study will revert to the
      classical 3+3 design. Upon expansion to the 3+3 design in any dosing cohort, all subsequent
      dosing cohorts will be conducted using the 3+3 design. Following treatment of the first
      patient in an expanded 3+3 cohort, the second and third patient will be treated no earlier
      than 7 days following Cycle 1 Day 1 for the prior patient (i.e., there will be a gap of 7
      days between treatment of the first patient and treatment of the second and third patient in
      an expanded cohort).

      Upon expansion to the classical 3+3 design in the weekly cohort, if deemed appropriate by the
      Trial Management Group (based on a review of safety data, clinical activity, and available
      pharmacokinetic [PK] and pharmacodynamic [PD] data), the fortnightly schedule of
      administration will be triggered. The fortnightly schedule of administration will be explored
      only in the 3+3 cohort design and will be closed to enrolment of patients until the RP2D has
      been determined in the weekly dose administration cohort.

      It is anticipated that approximately 17 patients will be required to complete the weekly dose
      escalation stage of Part 1, with a further 12 patients required to explore the fortnightly
      schedule.

      Part 2:

      This part of the study will further characterise the safety of NUC-7738 and assess
      preliminary efficacy signals at the RP2D and dose administration schedule (determined in Part
      1) in an expansion cohort.

      In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients from Part 1 and 2 can remain on study and
      continue to receive NUC-7738 until disease progression.
