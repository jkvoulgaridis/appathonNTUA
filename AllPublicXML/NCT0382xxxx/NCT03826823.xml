    <textblock>
      Hysterosalpingography is usually painful and the use of thin catheters of IUI could be an
      attractive alternative . we conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare the standard
      metal cannula to the thin catheter originally manufactured for intrauterine insemination.
      Pain assessment was done using visual analogue scale

    <textblock>
      HSG is widely practiced in our country, however, for cost effective reasons, the standard
      metal cannula is the only method used at our hospital. It is painful procedure because it
      requires grasping the cervix with a tenaculum and inducing some cervical dilatation during
      introduction of the cannula. The aim of this pilot study was to modify the technique of HSG
      using a thinner than normal catheter, and without grasping the cervix with a tenaculum.
      Leakage of the dye through the cervix was prevented by pressing on the portiovaginalis of the
      cervix using the vaginal speculum.

    <description>a thin catheter originally designed for IUI was introduced through the cervical canal into the lower part of the uterine cavity. After introducing the catheter, the screw of the vaginal speculum was loosened to allow the two valves of the speculum to press on the portiovaginalis of the cervix to prevent leakage of the dye. Then the dye was injected slowly and the procedure was watched on the screen and x-ray films were taken.</description>
