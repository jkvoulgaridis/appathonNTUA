  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral aneurysm surgery has significant mortality and morbidity rate. Inflammation plays a
      key role in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms, their rupture, subarachnoid
      haemorrhage and neurologic complications. Brain injury activates immune cells and triggers
      cytokine release. Cytokine level in blood and cerebrospinal fluid is an indicator of
      inflammatory response. Cytokines contribute to secondary brain injury and can worsen the
      outcome of the treatment. Preventing secondary brain injury by modulating inflammatory
      response represents a therapeutic target. Lidocaine is local anesthetic that can be used in
      neurosurgery for regional anesthesia of the scalp and for topical anesthesia of the throat
      prior to direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. Except analgetic, lidocaine has
      systemic anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect. It acts through several mechanisms on
      various types of immune cells producing immunosuppressing effect. Lidocaine can act on
      activated microglia within central nervous system causing attenuation of immune response.

      Primary aim of this prospective randomized trial is to determine influence of lidocaine
      administration on inflammatory cytokine levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during and
      following cerebral aneurysm surgery. Secondary aim is to determine possible correlation
      between levels of cytokines and incidence of neurologic and infectious postoperative
      complications. For that purpose, postoperative neurological clinical status will be recorded.
      Signs of vasospasm and pathological postoperative brain CT scan findings will be recorded.
      Incidence of meningitis, pneumonia and sepsis in postoperative period will also be analyzed.

      Hypothesis of this trial is that lidocaine administration during cerebral aneurysm surgery
      would significantly change levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid and
      serum. Lower concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines can possibly contribute to better
      outcome and significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications.
      Enzyme-immunochemical analysis will be used to measure levels of interleukin-1β,
      interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Investigation
      group will have, during cerebrovascular surgery under general anesthesia, regional anesthesia
      of the scalp and topical anesthesia of the throat prior to laryngoscopy, all done with
      lidocaine. Control group will have general anesthesia without lidocaine administration.
