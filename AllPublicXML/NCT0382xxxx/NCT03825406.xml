  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Those with abnormal vital signs after TAVR need to be willing to obtain a bone scan to
      evaluate for wildtype amyloidosis. Positive bone scan findings will require evaluation for
      primary amyloidosis with blood and urine monoclonal immunoglobulin testing. Primary
      amyloidosis is a different type of disease which requires different treatment.

      This research is interested in determining how common wildtype amyloidosis is after
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Amyloidosis is a condition characterized by
      abnormal protein which can accumulate and impair various organs, including the heart.
      Research suggests that amyloidosis might be common among TAVR patients, but it is a condition
      that is not routinely evaluated for. We suspect that wildtype amyloidosis may be especially
      common among patients with abnormal vital signs after their TAVR procedure.
