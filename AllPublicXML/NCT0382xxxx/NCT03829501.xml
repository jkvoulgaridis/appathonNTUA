  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1/2, open label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability
      of KY1044 as single agent and in combination with anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab) in adult patients
      with selected advanced malignancies, who are ineligible for or there are no available
      therapies known to confer a clinical benefit for their disease, or they have exhausted all
      such available options in each indication and therefore will be patients for whom a clinical
      trial is appropriate.

             eligible if, according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines,
             there are no available therapies known to confer a clinical benefit for their disease,
             or they have exhausted all such available options. Additionally, the following
             specific tumor indications will be enrolled:

               1. Phase 1: Participants with advanced/metastatic malignancies, and preferred

               2. Phase 2 KY1044 single agent: Participants with advanced/metastatic malignancies
                  in indications in which signs of anti-tumor activity (Complete Response (CR),
                  Partial Response (PR) or durable stable disease (SD) with tumor shrinkage that
                  does not qualify for PR) were seen during the dose escalation of KY1044 as single
                  agent

               3. Phase 2 KY1044 in combination with atezolizumab: Participants with
                  advanced/metastatic malignancies in the selected indications below, and/or

          -  Participants previously exposed to anti-PD-(L)1 treatment who are not adequately

          -  Pre-treatment with anti-CTLA4 antibodies in combination with any other antibody or
             drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathway

          -  Presence of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAE v5) ≥Grade
             2 toxicity (except alopecia, peripheral neuropathy and ototoxicity, which are excluded
             if CTCAE v5 ≥Grade 3) due to prior cancer therapy

          -  Radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment, except for
             palliative radiotherapy to a limited field, such as for the treatment of bone pain or
             a focally painful tumor mass. To allow evaluation for response to treatment,
             participants enrolled in the Phase 2 part must have remaining measurable disease that
             has not been irradiated
