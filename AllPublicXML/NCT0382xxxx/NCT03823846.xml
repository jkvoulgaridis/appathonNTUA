      1. To establish doctor-nurse-patient cooperative analgesic linkage program.

        2. Evaluate the effect of doctor-nurse-patient cooperative analgesic linkage program on
           movement evoked pain after laparotomy for patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic
           disease through quasi-experimental study.

      Part I The establishment of doctor-nurse-patient cooperative analgesic linkage program

        1. Based on literature review and clinical investigation results, initially make a
           doctor-nurse-patient cooperative analgesic linkage program through discussion in experts
           consensus meeting.

        2. Using Delphi method, determine the doctor-nurse-patient cooperative analgesic linkage
           program after two rounds consultation.

      Part II Clinical application study of doctor-nurse-patient cooperative analgesic linkage
      program.

      Conduct non-randomized control study in corresponding period. 80 patients from two wards
      which managed by the same medical and nursing team were divided into experimental and control
      group. Patients in the control group were received routine post-operative analgesia pump and
      analgesics, and functional rehabilitation, while ones in the experimental group were received
      doctor-nurse-patient cooperative analgesic linkage program. Evaluate the effect of pain
      control during rehabilitation, adverse events during rehabilitation, patients' satisfaction
      of pain control.
