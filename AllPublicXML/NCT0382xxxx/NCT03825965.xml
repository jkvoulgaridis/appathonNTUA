  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 67,000 Canadians undergo knee replacement surgery, and up to 20%
      develop persistent post-surgical pain. Persistent post-surgical pain is associated with
      depression, anxiety, unemployment, and reduced quality of life. Chronic pain after surgery is
      often managed with opioid therapy, which typically provides only modest benefits and is
      associated with rare but serious adverse events, such as overdose and death. A number of
      studies have found that greater pain just before and after knee replacement surgery is
      associated with the development of chronic pain, suggesting that reducing peri-operative pain
      may help prevent persistent post-surgical pain.

      Medicinal cannabis has begun to emerge as a potential therapy for pain reduction, and
      produces effects largely due to 2 active components: (1) cannabidiol (CBD), and (2)
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Studies of CBD have shown analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and
      anti-anxiety properties, but without the psychoactive effects (feeling 'high') that THC
      produces. This study will assess the feasibility of a definitive trial to explore whether
      adding CBD vs. placebo to usual care before and after surgery can reduce the rate of
      persistent post-surgical pain after total knee replacement. This study will randomize 40
      patients to receive either CBD or placebo, and follow them for six months to confirm our
      ability to recruit patients, adhere to protocol, and capture full outcome data for at least
      90% of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20% of patients develop persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) after undergoing
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and higher pre-surgery and acute post-operative pain are
      associated with this outcome. Medicinal cannabis has anti-inflammatory and analgesic
      properties and may reduce peri-operative pain and the rate of PPSP following TKA. Cannabidiol
      (CBD) is the active ingredient of interest because of its anti-inflammatory effects and lack
      of psychoactive effects seen with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The primary objective of this
      pilot trial is to assess the feasibility of a definitive trial to determine the effect of
      medicinal cannabis, versus placebo, on the proportion of patients experiencing PPSP following
      TKA. The primary objective of the definitive trial is to determine if medicinal cannabis
      add-on therapy, versus placebo, reduces the proportion of patients experiencing PPSP at 6
      months following TKA. The secondary objectives of the definitive trial are to determine if
      medicinal cannabis, versus placebo, reduces opioid use, reduces peri-operative pain
      interference, improves physical functioning, mental functioning, return to function, anxiety
      and depression, and sleep. The effect of medicinal cannabis, versus placebo, on the incidence
      of adverse events at 6 months post-surgery will also be examined. In this blinded
      multi-centre pilot trial, 40 patients will be randomized to receive either oral capsules of
      CBD oil or visually identical placebo in addition to standard of care pain medications.
      Participants will be followed for 6 months.
