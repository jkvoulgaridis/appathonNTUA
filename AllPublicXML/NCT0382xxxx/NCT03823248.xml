  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study had adopted the multi-center, randomized and controlled experiment design based on
      standardized mucosal biopsy and pathohistological operation, as well as therapeutic
      evaluation methodology. Meanwhile, patients diagnosed with chronic atrophic gastritis
      accompanying with low grade intraepithelial neoplasia and indefinite dysphasia (grade C2/C3
      of Vienna classification) confirmed by gastroscopic histopathology were enrolled as the
      objects of study, while folic acid was used as the control. The therapeutic effect and safety
      of Jianpi Huoxue Recipe (Moluodan + Sanchi powder) in intervening the gastric Premalignant
      lesion were evaluated from the points of view of pathology, gastroscopy and symptoms. The
      elimination rate of intraepithelial neoplasia of gastric mucosa was expected to be improved
      by 9-12%. Moreover, high quality evidence-based medical evidence regarding traditional
      Chinese medicine (TCM) in intervening gastric Premalignant lesion would be obtained, which
      could form the mature, propagable and effective scheme.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraepithelial neoplasia of gastric mucosa is a well-recognized gastric Premalignant lesion,
      which is the key of secondary prevention for gastric cancer. However, no universally
      acknowledged effective therapeutic scheme is available at present. Previously, the
      investigator's research group has carried out clinical trial study based on solving the key
      problems such as diagnostic criteria, mucosal biopsy consistency and therapeutic evaluation
      methodology, and has attained certain achievements. This study had adopted the multi-center,
      randomized and controlled experiment design based on standardized mucosal biopsy and
      pathohistological operation, as well as therapeutic evaluation methodology. Meanwhile,
      patients diagnosed with chronic atrophic gastritis accompanying with low grade
      intraepithelial neoplasia and indefinite dysphasia (grade C2/C3 of Vienna classification)
      confirmed by gastroscopic histopathology were enrolled as the objects of study, while folic
      acid was used as the control. The therapeutic effect and safety of Jianpi Huoxue Recipe
      (Moluodan + Sanchi powder) in intervening the gastric Premalignant lesion were evaluated from
      the points of view of pathology, gastroscopy and symptoms. The elimination rate of
      intraepithelial neoplasia of gastric mucosa was expected to be improved by 9-12%. Moreover,
      high quality evidence-based medical evidence regarding traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in
      intervening gastric Premalignant lesion would be obtained, which could form the mature,
      propagable and effective scheme. At the same time, molecular and biological indicators,
      including CDX2, SOX2, MUC2, MUC6, MUC5AC and CD10, were detected using the pathological
      tissues, so as to explore the therapeutic mechanism of Jianpi Huoxue Recipe in intervening
      gastric Premalignant lesion, and to construct the model platform for special disease research
      on gastric Premalignant lesion.

    <description>The all patients' histopathology will be evaluated two times, the first time is when the patients' are included into the clinical trials, the second time is after 24 weeks treatment in each group, patients' histopathology should be evaluated for comparison between two groups,at the same time patients' histopathology should be evaluated for comparison in each group.The change in histological score (mean score of all biopsie after treatment in each group and between groups was calculated. The response rate of each pathological lesion was calculated as a percentage of those improved or disappeared at the 6th month to all subjects. The disappearance rate of dysplasia between groups were compared, which was defined as the absence of dysplasia (score 0) in all biopsy specimens after treatment.</description>
