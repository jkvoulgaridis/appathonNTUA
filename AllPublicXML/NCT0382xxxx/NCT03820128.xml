    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of the early oral refeeding and fat content in
      the diet on the length of stay, clinical course (included pain severity) in pediatric
      patients with mild and moderate AP. Patients will be randomized to groups: refeeding within
      24 hours or after 24 hours from the hospital admission. Biochemical tests and pain severity
      will be evaluated.

      Prospective, randomized study. Research in the adult population shows that early enteral
      feeding in acute pancreatitis (AP) both oral and via the feeding tube is safe, shortens the
      length of hospital stay, prevents the multi organ failure (MoF) and reduces mortality. The
      pediatric population lacks prospective data concerning refeeding modes in AP. The aim of the
      study is to assess the effect of the early oral refeeding and fat content in the diet on the
      length of stay, clinical course (included pain severity) in pediatric patients with mild and
      moderate AP. Patients will be randomized to groups: refeeding within 24 hours or after 24
      hours from the hospital admission. Biochemical tests including CRP, amylase, lipase and
      proinflammatory cytokines levels and zonulin level as well as severity of pain will be
      assessed again in the second, the third and the fifth hospital day.

    <description>Very early diet intervention: refeeding within 24 hours from the hospital admission.
Participants will be encouraged to start eating immediately after the time of admission. They will be able to choose the meal from the list with no amount or calories restriction.They will be asked to conduct the daily diet diary - time of feeding, quality and quantity of the foods ingested. Laboratory tests will be performed at the study entry, on the day of 3 and 5 of hospitalization and on the day of discharge.</description>

During the first 24 hours after admission participants will be on fluid only (orally and/or intravenously). Later on they will be encouraged to start eating. They will be able to choose the meal from the list with no amount or calories restriction.They will be asked to conduct the daily diet diary - time of feeding, quality and quantity of the foods ingested.
