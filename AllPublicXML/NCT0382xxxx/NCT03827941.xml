      In this study, investigators will examine the treatment effects of transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation with different stimulation frequencies on individuals with autism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will examine the treatment effect of transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation at auricular area with vagus nerve distribution on high-functioning
      individuals with autism. Specifically, investigators will choose two ear acupoints: heart and
      shenmen. Participants will be randomized to either 1 Hz or 20 Hz tVNS group (up to 5 times
      per week) for three weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Quality Assessment (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>ATEC will be reported by investigator in a total and for each of the 4 subscales as follows: (1) speech/language/communication subscale; (2) social subscale; (3) sensory and cognitive awareness subscale; and (4) health / physical / behavior problem subscale. The total score ranges from 0 to 179; a higher score indicated worsening while a lower score indicated improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The factors of the ABC have been labeled as follows: (I) Irritability, Agitation, Crying; (II) Lethargy, Social Withdrawal; (III) Stereotypic Behavior; (IV) Hyperactivity, Noncompliance; and (V) Inappropriate Speech.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Overall improvement in autism will be assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, a 7-point scale from 1 = very much improved to 7 = very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is used to assess the pure domain of sleep disturbance in adults.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Penn State Worry Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is the standard assessment of worry and consists of 16 questions rated from 1 to 5 from &quot;Not typical of me&quot; to &quot;Very typical of me&quot;.</description>
