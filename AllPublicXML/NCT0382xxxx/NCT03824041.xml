  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) largely due to vascular
      endothelial dysfunction, a major initial step in the development of atherosclerosis.
      Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by impaired endothelium-dependent dilation and is
      primarily caused by reduced nitric oxide bioavailability secondary to oxidative stress and
      inflammation. Interventions that improve endothelial dysfunction are important for improving
      endothelial function and reducing CVD risk in this high-risk population. Aronia melanocarpa,
      commonly known as aronia berries or chokeberries, are rich in polyphenols such as
      anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids. These compounds, and derivatives
      resulting from gut microbial and phase II metabolism, have been shown to attenuate oxidative
      stress and inflammation, and to improve endothelial function. Aronia berries and other
      berries have been shown in numerous studies to have diverse cardiometabolic health effects
      including modulation of endothelial function, arterial stiffness, blood pressure, oxidative
      stress, and inflammation. In addition, berries, dietary fiber, polyphenols have been shown to
      exert positive effects on the gut microbiota, which may mediate improvements in
      cardiovascular health. Recently, we have demonstrated that modulation of the gut microbiota
      is associated with improvements in vascular dysfunction. The primary goal of the currently
      proposed research is to assess the efficacy and dose-dependent response of an aronia full
      spectrum dietary supplement to improve endothelial function in middle-aged/older men and
      postmenopausal women. A secondary goal is to determine whether aronia full spectrum
      modulation of the gut microbiota is associated with improvements in endothelial function.
      Other functional and biochemical measures of cardiovascular health, oxidative stress,
      inflammation, and polyphenol metabolism will be assessed.
