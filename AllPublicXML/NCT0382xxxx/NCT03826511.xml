      In this double-blind, randomized, follow-up study investigators evaluated and compared the
      effects of Tiszasüly and Kolop mud-pack therapy on pain, function and quality of life in
      patients with knee osteoarthritis. 30 patients were treated with Tiszasüly hot mud-pack
      (Group 1), 30 patients with Kolop hot mud-pack (Group 2) for 10 working days. Knee pain,
      function a nd qualitiy of life were measured at baseline, at the end of treatment and 3
      months later.

      The aim of this non-inferiority study was to evaluate and compare the effects of Tiszasüly
      and Kolop mud-pack therapy on pain, function and quality of life in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis.

      Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, follow-up study 60 patients with knee
      osteoarthritis were treated with either Tiszasüly hot mud-pack (Group 1), or with Kolop hot
      mud-pack (Group 2) on 10 occasions for 2 weeks (10 working days). 100 mm Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) for knee pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC),
      Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lequesne Index for physical function and
      EuroQoL-5D for quality-of-life measure were recorded at baseline, at the end of treatment
      (Week 2) and 3 months later (Week 12).

    <description>change from baseline physical function measured by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) at week 2. It is comprised of 24 items divided into three subscales: Pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). All the items are scored on a 100mm visual analogue scale. Values are summed up for a combined WOMAC score. The lower score represents better outcome.</description>

    <description>change from baselilne physical function measured by Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). It is an extension of the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index with the purpose of evaluating short-term and long-term symptoms and function in knee osteoarthritis. It has five separately scored subscales: pain, other symptoms, function in daily living (ADL), function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related quality of life (QOL). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems.</description>

It has five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), where patients are asked to rate their health problems at five levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). It also includes a self-rating of health status on a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 (where 0 means the worst and 100 means the best health status).</description>
