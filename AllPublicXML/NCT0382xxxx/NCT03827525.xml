  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome are eight times more likely to suffer from anxiety
      compared to the general population. Few therapeutic solutions are proposed to these patients.
      The objective of this research is to validate a cognitive and behavioral therapy anxiety
      protocol for patients with this syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most studies agree that anxiety disorders are more frequent in people with intellectual
      disabilities that in the general population. Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare disease,
      associated with an anxiety rate 8 times higher than in the general population. The
      therapeutic solutions proposed in this population remain limited, in particular concerning
      approaches without the use of medication. The objective of the study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a program of Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies (CBT) in Williams Syndrome
      (WS). For this, an ABA-type protocol will be used. It consists of evaluating the
      effectiveness of an interventional program longitudinally, using a single case type study.
      Adults patients with WS and suffering from anxiety will be recruited. They will be enrolled
      in a program consisting in nine sessions of a psychotherapy program targeting anxiety. There
      will be a pretherapy visit (day 0), nine sessions of psychotherapy (month 0 to month 5) and a
      visit 3 month after the end of the therapy (at month 8) : the visit of the end of the
      research (V10). The expected results will be to validate a psychotherapeutic program for
      patients with WS suffering of anxiety. This program might be extended to other patients with
      intellectual disability.

    <description>Hamilton anxiety scale will be realised with the patient by a clinical psychologist. It is an evaluation of the anxiety based on 14 questions and observations of the patient. The questions are rated according to the severity of the symptoms: anxious mood, depressed mood, somatic symptoms...Symptoms are evaluated using 5 degrees of severity, from absence of severity to disabling intensity. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

    <description>this scale evaluates the quality of life with 26 questions. For each question, the quality of life is evaluated from very low to very high (5 levels). It will be completed by the person of trust.</description>
