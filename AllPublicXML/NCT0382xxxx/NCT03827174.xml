  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether a vocational behaviour change ability programme has any
      additional effect on return to work compared with return to work coordination only in persons
      with chronic pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New vocational rehabilitation models including the workplace are urgently needed for persons
      with chronic pain.

      Return to work coordination means external and internal coordination regarding sick leave by
      help of a rehabilitation coordinator from health care. The goal is to establish a common
      return to work plan between employer and employee as dictated by Swedish law. The hypothesis
      is that return to work coordination is not sufficient. Additional effects on return to work
      and work ability from a behaviour change ability programme aiming to enhance work ability by
      targeting context at the workplace, physical and psychological functioning, and behavioral
      skills at work are expected.

      The hypothesis is tested in a randomised controlled trial. Before the start of the trial a
      series of 3-6 experimental single case studies will be performed to study the implementation
      of the interventions more thoroughly.

    <description>Self-report. Psychological inflexibility in pain (PIPS) is a 12-item scale used to assess psychological inflexibility (i.e. avoidance, acceptance, fusion, values orientation, dirty discomfort) in people with chronic pain. Two main components are measured: 1) Avoidance of pain (items: 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11), 2) Fusion with pain thoughts (items: 3,6,9,12) Scoring: Respondents are asked to rate items on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1= 'never true' to 7 = 'always true'. Scores are summed to a total score and to two subscale scores. Higher scores indicate greater levels of psychological inflexibility.</description>
