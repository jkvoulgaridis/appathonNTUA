  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many complications may occur after ileal conduit, with the incidence increasing with time
      after surgery. Nearly half of the complications are related to stoma and ureteroileal
      anastomosis. The investigators believe that the surgical technique is responsible for these
      complications, and therefore have devised a modified technique for creating the ileal conduit
      that should help prevent these complications after surgery. The investigators' retrospective
      study shows that modified surgical technique for ileal conduit urinary diversion appears to
      be effective for reducing early and late complications related to the stoma. Thus the
      investigators would like to perform a prospective multicenter randomized controlled clinical
      study to prove the investigators' results.

      The investigators plan to enroll 104 patients, and randomizedly divide the participants into
      two groups, with one group 52 patients undergoing conventional ileal conduit, another group
      52 patients undergoing modified ileal conduit.

      The ileal conduit (Bricker) has been used for urinary diversion for more than half a century.
      Widely accepted to be a simple and safe form of urinary diversion, it remains one of the most
      commonly used techniques for urinary diversion after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.
      However, many complications may occur after ileal conduit, with the incidence increasing with
      time after surgery. Interestingly, nearly half of the complications are related to stoma and
      ureteroileal anastomosis. Among the complications, parastomal hernia is the most common.
      Female gender, low preoperative serum albumin level, high BMI or severe obesity, and prior
      laparotomy have been shown to be risk factors for parastomal hernia. But the mechanisms by
      which these variables lead to stoma related complications have not yet been fully elucidated.
      The investigators believe that the surgical technique is responsible for these complications,
      and therefore have devised a modified technique for creating the ileal conduit that should
      help prevent these complications after surgery. The investigators' retrospective study shows
      that modified surgical technique for ileal conduit urinary diversion appears to be effective
      for reducing early and late complications related to the stoma. Thus the investigators would
      like to perform a prospective multicenter randomized controlled clinical study to prove the
      investigators' results.

      The investigators plan to enroll 104 patients, and randomizedly divide the participants into
      two groups, with one group 52 patients undergoing conventional ileal conduit, another group
      52 patients undergoing modified ileal conduit.
