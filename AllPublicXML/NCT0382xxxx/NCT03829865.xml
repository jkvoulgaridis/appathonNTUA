  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High resolution esophageal manometry normative values are still need to be studied in
      different populations and with the use of solid-state and water-perfused systems. There has
      been no study on the subject in healthy Russian population yet.

      High-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) is the current modality used to evaluate
      esophageal motility. There are 2 types of system: water-perfused system that is cheaper to
      maintain and a solid-state system that is considered to be more sensitive. According to the
      data obtained in the study of 400 patients and 75 controls by J Pandolfino et al it was
      proposed to use a common algorithm of HREM data interpretation and the normative values of
      the parameters used to interpret the color plots of HREM. This formed the basis for the first
      version of the currently used HREM reporting algorithm and classification of esophageal
      motility disorders called Chicago Classification (CC). To date, this classification has been
      updated several times by the International Working Group based on the recently published
      data. The Working group stated that the proposed normative values still need to be widely
      studied for each HREM system and in different populations. Some studies has been published
      recently on the normative values of HREM in different countries (predominantly in the US, in
      some European countries, Korea, India and China. But there has been no study on the subject
      in Russia still.

          -  Absence of esophageal diseases, confirmed by the results of clinical and instrumental
             examination
