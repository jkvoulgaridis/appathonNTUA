  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to evaluate adult subjects currently taking
      phytocannabinoid Hemp-derived botanical supplements (HDS) during recovery from traumatic
      brain injury. This study seeks to answer whether subjects taking HDS formulations experience
      relief from self-reported symptoms or improved subjective well-being, sleep quality,
      cognitive benefits, side effects and/or quantifiable changes in brain state neuronal activity
      or stress biomarkers. We seek to answer whether regular users (once/week to multiple
      uses/day) of HDS experience signs of dependence, addiction or physiological withdrawal. To
      accomplish this we will use survey questions, quantitative EEG, cognitive testing and
      salivary biomarkers to determine the effectiveness of self-initiated HDS administration. In
      addition, we are interested in whether our objective measures allow us to understand why some
      people are responders to HDS health benefits while others are not.

        Inclusion Criteria: Adult male or female volunteers between the ages of 18-55 who have
        experience a head trauma/ concussion resulting in the diagnosis of mild to moderate TBI
        (Glasgow Coma scale score between 9-14) with less than 30 minutes of unconsciousness and
        post-traumatic amnesia lasting less than 24 hours more than 1 month ago will be considered
        for participation in the study. Volunteers must be able to move about the community of the
        Denver metro area and speak fluent English. They must be able to leisurely ride a
        stationary recumbent bicycle without assistance for 10 minutes and sit stationary for 15
        minutes without discomfort. They must be familiar with the brand and dosing of HDS and been
        regular users, defined as once /week up to multiple uses per day for at least 1 month in
        the past year. They must be able to hear a 25 decibels in at least one ear and respond
        verbally to questions while remaining still.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Medications. Most subjects may continue to take medications for other conditions. However,
        subjects should be on stable doses of these medications for a specified period prior to
        beginning the study. A stable dose means that there have been no changes in the drug dosage
        during the past 2 months.

        Subjects may not be current users of illegal drugs (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine)
        Subjects may not have an immune-relevant disease (e.g. HIV, MS, Lyme Disease) Females may
        be pregnant or lactating and taking HDS supplementation. In the consent form we will
        include a warning that taking cannabis related products during pregnancy or while nursing
        could pose a danger to the development of the infant.
