  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and apalutamide work in
      treating patients with hormone-naive prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the
      body. Androgen can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as
      abiraterone acetate and apalutamide may lessen the amount of androgen made by the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if a baseline molecular-pathologic androgen receptor response (AR-response)
      signature predicts efficacy to abiraterone plus apalutamide in patients with hormone-naive
      metastatic prostate cancer (HNMPCa).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of abiraterone acetate plus apalutamide in patients with HNMPCa.

      II. Evaluate the safety of abiraterone acetate plus apalutamide in patients with HNMPCa.

      III. Explore the relationship between molecular markers and clinical efficacy outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patient receive abiraterone acetate orally (PO) daily, prednisone PO twice daily (BID), and
      apalutamide PO daily. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then for up to 6
      months.

          -  Baseline moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class B &amp; C)

          -  Seizure or known condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (e.g. prior stroke within 1
             year to randomization, brain arteriovenous malformation, Schwannoma, meningioma, or
             other benign central nervous system [CNS] or meningeal disease which may require
             treatment with surgery or radiation therapy)

          -  Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption

          -  Untreated symptomatic spinal cord compression

          -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
