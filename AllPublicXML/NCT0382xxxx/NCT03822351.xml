  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical activity of durvalumab alone vs
      durvalumab in combination with novel agents. The overall study goal is early identification
      of novel durvalumab combinations that are more active than durvalumab alone in the treatment
      of patients with unresectable, Stage III NSCLC who have not progressed after cCRT.

      Study D9108C00001 (COAST) is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, randomized multidrug
      platform study assessing the efficacy and safety of durvalumab alone vs durvalumab in
      combination with novel agents in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable, Stage III
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
