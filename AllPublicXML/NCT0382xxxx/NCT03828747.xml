  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study will evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of
      semorinemab in patients with moderate AD. The study consists of a screening period, a
      double-blind treatment period, an optional open-label extension (OLE) period, and a safety
      follow-up period. There may be up to three study cohorts.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 49 for Cohort 1, Baseline to Week 61 for Cohort 2, and baseline to Week 73 for Cohort 3</time_frame>
    <description>A scale used to quantify the severity of symptoms of dementia. The CDR-SB is obtained through interviews of patients and informants, and disease severity is rated in 6 domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a 5-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal care is scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available). The CDR-SOB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18, with the higher values representing more severe impairment.</description>

          -  Typical antipsychotic or neuroleptic medication within 6 months of screening

          -  Daily treatment with any of the following classes of medication (except for
             intermittent short-term use): opiates or opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates,
             hypnotics, or any medication with clinically significant centrally-acting
             antihistamine or anticholinergic activity

          -  Stimulant medications, unless the dose has been stable within the 6 months prior to
             screening and is expected to be stable throughout the study
