  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic disease deriving from an abnormal proliferation of
      monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. The survival of MM patients varies from less than
      6 months to more than 10 years depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis and prognostic
      factors. Three current standard treatments are approved for elderly or younger patients with
      significant comorbidities not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT):
      bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP), melphalan-prednisone- thalidomide (MPT) and
      lenalidomide with low-dose dexamethasone (Rd).

      The consistent fraction of elderly patients with cancer and co-morbidities are at increased
      risk of developing frailty (the emergent geriatric syndrome), as well as physical and
      cognitive decline, with negative effect on nutrition and lifestyle, and eventually on
      responsiveness to and efficacy of treatments.

      A frailty scale was recently described that categorized patients with MM as fit, intermediate
      or frail based on age, comorbidities, and physical and cognitive functioning. The frailty
      score was a predictor of death, progression of the disease, toxicity and drug
      discontinuation.

      In this project, the investigators will compare available first line standard treatments, the
      triplet VMP versus the doublet Rd, in an unselected population of patients ≥ 65 years
      affected by MM in every day clinical practice. In the last decade, many novel and expensive
      drugs have been approved for this disease, yet the general older population is not adequately
      represented in validating trials. Nevertheless, the results and treatments derived from those
      trials have often been applied to the older population, with a high risk to produce a
      negative impact on patient functional capacity and ability to carry out daily tasks,
      cognitive function, depression status, nutritional condition, social situation/capability to
      stay at home and finally affecting their quality of life (QoL) and OS. The main aim of the
      project is to evaluate the best initial treatment for elderly MM patients and to compare
      benefits, risks, QoL and costs of currently available, standard treatments according to the
      frailty profile.
