  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical response and mortality rate by an
      opportunistic disease in HIV-infected individuals who start immediate versus conventional
      antiretroviral therapy.

      Immediate ART (iART) is defined as starting antiretroviral therapy in the first 48 hours
      after the hospitalization.

      Conventional ART (cART) is defined as starting antiretroviral therapy once the opportunistic
      infection is under control at the discretion of infectious disease specialist.

      Sample size was calculated using formula, of difference in proportions formula using a beta
      of 0.1, alpha of 0.05 and an expected difference in mortality of 20%, The sample size is 225
      subjects in each group. Informed consent will be obtained. Patients will be allocated to each
      group (iART or cART) after randomization stratified by the CD4+ T cell count (less or more
      than 50 cells/mm3).

      Plasma viral load and CD4+ T cell count will be measured at study entry and at weeks 2, 4,
      12, 24 and 48 after ART initiation. Clinical outcomes will be: mortality at 4, 12, 24, and 48
      weeks, length of hospitalization (measured in days), clinical and microbiological cure of the
      opportunistic disease, incidence and severity of immune reconstitution of inflammatory
      syndrome (IRIS), and adverse drug reactions and interactions.

      Once 50% of the sample size has completed 30 days of follow-up, a preliminary analysis will
      be conducted to assess safety and efficacy of iART; if differences in the mortality are
      observed, the study will be terminated.
