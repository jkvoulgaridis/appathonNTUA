  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the sides effects and best dose of hydroxychloroquine when given
      together with trametinib in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to
      nearby tissue, lymph nodes or other places in the body and cannot be removed by surgery.
      Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as hydroxychloroquine, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving trametinib together with hydroxychloroquine may
      work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer.
