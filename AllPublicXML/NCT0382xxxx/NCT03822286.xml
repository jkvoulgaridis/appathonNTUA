  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home care staff often have insufficient knowledge and skills of caring people with dementia
      at home. Many training courses for home care staff are not developed according to their
      educational background and workplace needs.

      An innovative evidence-based online training with peer support program in dementia care was
      developed and consists of online cloud platform with various training courses and resources,
      on-the-job mentoring support by senior peers, and social networking in dementia care.

      They can access to the online cloud platform by computers or smart phones anytime for
      immediate access to information in dementia care. They can also consult with senior peers for
      care problems by social network platform and attend monthly dementia care forum.

      The interventional group attendance staff will accept 3-month e-training care online course,
      which was supervised by the supervisor and participated in the monthly counseling mentoring
      support group. The control group will accept the traditional dementedness care traditional
      classroom teaching course and will not accept any e-training .

      The curriculum and counseling support group will collect information on the knowledge,
      attitudes, care abilities, work stress and burnout of the two groups in the pre-test, 3rd and
      6th months and learn about their effectiveness.
