    <measure>Retention in treatment on MAT for 6 months after enrolling in the study</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>ReSET is a mobile app designed to provide extended cognitive behavioral therapy for patients initiating medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD). This pilot trial is evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of the app, reSET. The first outcome being measure is treatment retention. We want to examine if participants enrolled in the study will maintain on MAT for 6 months after enrollment. This will be evaluated based on the number of appointments attended by the research participants. Data mining through our systems electronic medical record (EMR) will be conducted in order to count the number of attended appointments for study participants to gauge their treatment retention.</description>

    <measure>Cravings to use drugs as assessed by the reSET app</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Part of this study is looking at the effect of reSET on 6 month adherence and mediation of improvements in quality of life outcomes such as cravings to use drugs. This is captured in the reSET app as part of the programmed surveys that participants are asked to complete once pinged by the app. These surveys utilize a likert scale to ask the participant if they have experienced any cravings and the severity of said cravings (1 = mild cravings; 4=severe cravings). These ratings will assess total number of cravings and severity of cravings for the duration of the study (24 weeks) or up until the participant stops using the app; whichever comes first.</description>

    <measure>Overall mental health symptoms related to depression and anxiety as assessed by the K-10</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Part of this study is looking at the effect of reSET on 6 month adherence and mediation of improvements in quality of life outcomes such as overall mental health symptoms as measured by participant self-report on the Kessler 10 (K-10). The K-10 is a 10 item questionnaire that yields a global measure of distress based on questions about anxiety and depressive symptoms that an individual has experience within the most recent four week period. The questionnaire uses a likert scale for each prompt; a score of one indicates that an individual experiences symptoms or issues &quot;None of the time,&quot; whereas a score of five indicates that an individual experiences symptoms or issues &quot;All of time.&quot; The scores are summed and total amounts will fall in one of four categories: Score under 20 = likely to be well; Score 20-24 = likely to have a mild mental disorder; Score 25-29 = likely to have a moderate mental disorder; and Score 30 or more = likely to have a severe mental disorder.</description>

    <description>Part of this study is looking at the effect of reSET on 6 month adherence and mediation of improvements in quality of life outcomes such as mental health specific to depression as measured by the participant self-report on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a 9 item questionnaire that assesses depressive symptoms or issues using a likert scale from &quot;0 to 3;&quot; 0 indicating no symptoms or issues and 3 indicating symptoms or issues occurring nearly every day. Scores are summed to calculate a total score. Scores 1-4 indicated minimal depression; scores 5-9 indicate mild depression; scores 10-14 indicate moderate depression; scores 15-19 indicated moderately severe depression; and scores 20-27 indicate severe depression.</description>
