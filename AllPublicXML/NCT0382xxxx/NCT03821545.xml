  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies have shown that IV administration of anesthetics, lidocaine and ketamine
      with their anti-inflammatory properties, modulates the acute immune response associated with
      surgical tissue injury, and in this manner they are able to reduce postoperative pain.
      Lidocaine has anti-inflammatory effects on polymorphonuclear granulocytes, IL-6 and IL-8
      cytokines, complement component C3a and IL-1ra in serum. Ketamine produces its
      anti-inflammatory effects by reducing CRP and IL-6 in serum and by inhibiting NF-kB, which
      regulates gene transcription responsible for the production of proinflammatory factors.

      Perioperative combinend IV administration of lidocaine and ketamine could have a more
      favorable anti-inflammatory effect compared to anesthetic given alone or with placebo.

      To investigate the effects of lidocaine and ketamine in patients undergoing abdominal surgery
      on: acute immune response following the level of proinflammatory factors in serum (CRP, IL-6,
      IL-8); postoperative pain management; recovery of bowel function; LOS in the ICU and LOHS;
      reduced administration of opioids; reduction of total treatment costs; recovery time between
      participants undergoing conventional and laparoscopic resection of the colon.

      A double-blind, placebo-controlled study will include 120 patients: 60 undergoing
      conventional and 60 undergoing laparoscopic resection of the colon. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to one of four groups: lidocaine, ketamine, lidocaine-ketamine, and placebo.
      Lidocaine will be administered at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg prior to surgical incision followed by
      an infusion at a rate of 1.5-2 mg/kg/hr until the end of surgery. Ketamine will be
      administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg in a bolus prior to surgical incision followed by an
      infusion at a rate of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/hr until the end of surgery. Bolus and continuous placebo
      infusion (0.9% NaCl) will be equally administered at the same dose as the aforementioned
      anesthetics until the end of the surgery.

      The intensity of pain will be measured using the VAS score 2 hours and 4 hours following
      surgery and every 12 hours the following days. The invetigators will measure the consumption
      of opioids during and after surgery, the length of stay in the ICU, where pain control and
      analgesics use will be measured, as well as recovery of bowel function. Proinflammatory
      markers in serum (CRP, IL-6, IL-8) will be measured before induction of anesthesia, then 12
      hours and 36 hours following the completion of surgery.
