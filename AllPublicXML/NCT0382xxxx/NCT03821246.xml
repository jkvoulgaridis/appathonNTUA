    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab works alone or in combination with
      tocilizumab in treating men with localized prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. IL-6 is expressed by
      prostate cancer and within the tumor microenvironment and shown to enhance prostate cancer
      and disease progression. Treatment with an anti-IL-6 antibody such as tocilizumab may inhibit
      cancer progression. Giving atezolizumab in combination with tocilizumab may work better in
      treating prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the composition and
      function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab-based combination therapy in
      localized prostate cancer (PC).

      II. To determine the clinical efficacy of atezolizumab-based combination therapy in localized
      PC.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize changes in the frequency and number of circulating immune cells following
      atezolizumab-based combination therapy in localized PC.

      II. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the composition and
      phenotype of the tumor microenvironment.

      III. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the circulating and
      intratumoral T cell repertoire.

      IV. To explore the role of novel imaging modalities to understand the immunologic and
      clinical impact to immunotherapeutic approaches in localized PC.

      V. To characterize changes in the gut microbiome associated with each therapeutic
      combination.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned sequentially to 1 of 2 groups.

      COHORT A: Patients receive one cycle of atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on
      day 1 of a 14 day cycle prior to radical prostatectomy (RP).

      COHORT B: Patients will receive 1 cycle of neoadjuvant atezolizumab and tocilizumab prior to
      RP; atezolizumab will be administered in an identical fashion as Cohort A. Tocilizumab will
      be administered at a dose of 6 mg/kg.

      Two more groups consisting of treatment with atezolizumab in combination with other drugs may
      be added in the future.

      RP will occur 21 days (+/- 7 days) following treatments on Cycle 1 Day 1. No further study
      therapy will be administered following RP

      Following RP, subjects will be followed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (from
      date of RP), or until disease progression, whichever occurs sooner
