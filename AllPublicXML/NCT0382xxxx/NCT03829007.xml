      Non-invasive imaging of tumor PD-L1 expression with 89Zr-labeled durvalumab PET/CT predicts
      response to durvalumab.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The programmed death 1 (PD1)/ programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway plays an important
      role in regulating the T-cell anti tumor response. Blocking this interaction with the anti
      PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab has proven to be effective resulting in durable disease
      control rates. Currently, PD-L1 expression as determined by immune histochemistry (IH) is the
      best available biomarker for treatment response, but standardized scoring criteria are
      lacking and the risk for sampling errors exists. Molecular imaging using 89Zr-labeled
      antibodies may overcome these limitations, enabling the visualization of PD-L1 expression in
      primary and metastatic tumor lesions and providing information on the in vivo accessibility
      of the PD-L1 target following intravenous administration. Besides, a baseline FDG-PET scan
      will be performed.

             Female patient of child-bearing potential

               -  Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non sterilized
                  male partner must use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception (Table
                  1) from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such precautions
                  for 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy
                  or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy (based on 5x the
                  half-life of durvalumab or tremelimumab). Non-sterilized male partners of a
                  female patient must use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period.
                  Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a
                  responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of
                  the drug treatment and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice;
                  however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are
                  not acceptable methods of birth control. Female patients should also refrain from
                  breastfeeding throughout this period.

               -  Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential. Non-sterilized
                  males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential
                  must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after
                  receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90
                  days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy. Not engaging in
                  sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the
                  rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception. Male patients should refrain from sperm donation throughout this
                  period.

         21. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results

         22. Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases requiring concurrent treatment, inclusive
             of but not limited to surgery, radiation and/or corticosteroids.
