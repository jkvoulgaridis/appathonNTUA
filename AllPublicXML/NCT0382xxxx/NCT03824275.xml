  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PyL, also known as [18F]DCFPyL, is a second-generation fluorinated prostate-specific membrane
      antigen (PSMA) targeted PET imaging agent. In preliminary studies it demonstrates a higher
      detection of metastatic prostate lesions compared to standard imaging. Its ability to image
      metastatic prostate cancer sites was comparable to 68Ga-PSMA with high tumor-to-background
      ratios.Additionally, [18F] PyL demonstrated higher mean tumor-to-background ratios when using
      kidney, spleen, or parotid as reference organs. However, the role of [18F] PyL in tumor
      response to therapy has not been evaluated, specifically the potential to serve as a
      predictive biomarker of response. Given the high cost of current therapeutic agents in mCRPC,
      there is a need for an early response biomarker to stratify which patients will benefit from
      therapy and which will not. This will also allow for earlier change in management of patients
      who will not response to these therapies, potentially improving patient outcomes.

      The investigators will conduct a prospective phase II/III study of 300 men diagnosed with
      prostate cancer with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Upon enrollment, subjects will
      undergo standard of care imaging (defined as a CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis,
      and 99mTc bone scans) if not obtained within 45 days of enrollment. Subjects will have
      standard of care laboratory evaluations and undergo 18F- DCFPyL PET/CT.

      [18F]DCFPyL will be used for study imaging.

Subjects will have standard of care laboratory evaluations including complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistries, hepatic panel, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and PSA. Liquid biopsies for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and exosome analysis will occur at the same time. Subjects will then undergo 18F- DCFPyL PET/CT.</description>
