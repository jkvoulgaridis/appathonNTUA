  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of arthroplasties is expected to grow in the next few years. Staphylococcus aureus
      (SA) is a primary cause of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) with serious consequences. This
      microorganism is frequently associated with treatment failure, hospitalizations and need of
      prosthesis removal, leading to an important morbidity and an increase in healthcare costs.

      ARTHR-IS is a retrospective multi-center study which aims to estimate the burden of SA-PJI
      after a hip or knee arthroplasty and their risk factors. Other objectives are to quantify the
      costs, the number of hospitalizations and the surgical procedures needed to treat and control
      the infection and finally the factors influencing therapeutic failure.

      Through a case-control design, ARTHR-IS will group 20 hospitals across 5 European countries
      in order to include 150 cases and 450 controls.

      The results of this study will provide critical information to develop strategies to prevent
      and treat SA-PJI and reduce treatment failures. Also, the results from ARTH-IS study will
      help in the design of future clinical trials in prosthesis infections by providing reliable
      estimates on the incidence of SA-PJI and the subsequent burden on health care services.

    <description>Clinical failure will be considered to be present if the patient died due to complications related to SA-PJI or if any of the following will be present by the end of the 18 months follow up period after the diagnosis of the first SA-PJI: joint pain or swelling causing an impaired functionality; persistent sinus tract; need for antibiotic treatment for PJI, arthrodesis or amputation. Microbiological failure is defined as any isolation of SA from the joint, periarticular tissues or the blood that was not resolved by the end of the 18th month after the diagnosis of the first SA-PJI.</description>

        Recruitment of cases: the cases will be detected by chart review of all patients who
        underwent a primary arthroplasty and matching the list with microbiological records for
        SA-PJI infections or discharged records of patients admitted for PJI or any joint
        procedure.

        Recruitment of controls: for each case, the list of patients who underwent a primary
        arthroplasty in the following week and in the same joint as the case will be reviewed, the
        first three patients without evidence of PJI during one year will be selected.
