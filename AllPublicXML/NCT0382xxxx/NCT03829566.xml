  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to treat your disease with an autologous stem cell transplant using a
      regimen of immune suppressant drugs and chemotherapy to reset your immune system and to
      determine if your disease will go into long-term remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The autologous stem cell transplant used in this research study is an investigational
      procedure that uses cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy), rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) (a
      protein that kills the immune cells that are thought to be causing your disease), rituximab
      (a biologic drug that targets B cells of your immune system), and intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IVIg) (pooled IgG antibodies from plasma donors with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory
      effects), followed by return of your own previously collected blood stem cells (autologous
      stem cell transplant). One day of plasmapheresis will also be performed the day prior to
      admission for stem cell transplant to remove disease-causing antibodies. The ability of this
      experimental treatment to stop relapses and progression (worsening) of your NMOSD will be
      assessed.
