  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is rising and more than 30 million of Americans or
      9.4% of the US population has DM. Several large scale randomized clinical trials have found
      that improved glycemic control reduces the development of complications in patients with DM.
      However intensive glucose management carries an increased risk of hypoglycemia, a condition
      that may lead to neurological damage and is associated with increased incidence of
      cardiovascular events and mortality.

      Reducing uncontrolled hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia represents therefore an important
      objective, as may decrease the direct and indirect impact that diabetes has in our health
      care system. Achieving optimal glycemic control requires frequent blood glucose monitoring by
      the patients and recurrent clinic visits,which is often difficult to achieve, as access to
      typical DM clinic is at least sub optimal.

      m-Health and telemedicine health solutions represent alternative ways to manage patients in
      the outpatient setting and have been applied in different medical areas, among them in
      diabetes. However, almost all the telemedicine studies that have been previously performed
      and recruited DM patients used telemedicine solutions which were based on point of care (POC)
      finger-stick glucose testing, which are checked infrequently , usually 4-6 times/day.

      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices offer additional ways to monitor blood glucose
      values and can provide numerous glucose measurements (as frequent as every 5 min). By using
      software applications, such as the Clarity (Dexcom), which highlights glucose patterns,
      trends and statistics in standardized reports, providers can make safe recommendations of
      adjusting DM medications, especially insulin titration. In this randomized clinical trial
      investigators propose to use CGM devices and Clarity software as a telemedicine platform in
      order to improve glycemic control and improve health outcomes.

             or clinically important hypoglycemia (any reported glucose values less than 54 mg/dl)
             or severe hypoglycemia (low glucose value that led to a severe event characterized by
