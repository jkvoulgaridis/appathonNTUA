      The investigators are going to explore the diagnostic and prognostic value of circulating
      tumor cells and exosomes extracted from the portal venous blood obtained with endoscopic
      ultrasound in pancreatic cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the prognosis of pancreatic cancer, a kind of malignant tumor, remains poor due to the low
      diagnostic rate at the early stage, there is still a significant clinical need to determine
      individualized tumor molecular profiles and personalized risk for recurrence. Circulating
      tumor cells (CTCs) and exosomes from patients with primary tumors may hold promise in serving
      as an informative biomarker to address this clinical need. Here in this study, the
      investigators are going to explore the feasibility and safety of sampling portal venous blood
      via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and detect portal venous CTCs and analyze mRNA markers of
      exosomes by RNA-seq. The investigators aim to explore the potential molecular mechanisms in
      tumor microenvironment and mechanisms of drug resistance.
