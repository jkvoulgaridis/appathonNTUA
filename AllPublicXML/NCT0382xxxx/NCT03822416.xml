    <textblock>
      This is a smoking cessation study that will enroll smokers who have been diagnosed with a
      severe mental illness. The study will use a combination of intensive tobacco treatment
      counseling and nicotine replacement therapy to assist smokers in cutting back on and quitting
      smoking over the course of six months.

      At the baseline measurement visit, participants will be asked to complete a survey and an
      interview. They will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Both
      groups will receive a smoking cessation manual and list of resources. The intervention group
      will also receive smoking cessation counseling and nicotine replacement therapy. Both groups
      will be seen for in-person assessments again at 8 weeks and 6 months post baseline.
