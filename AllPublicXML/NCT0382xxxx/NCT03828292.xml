  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2857916 is a first in class, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) enhanced,
      humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) which binds specifically to
      B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) expressed on tumor cells of all subjects with multiple
      myeloma (MM). This is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalation study to investigate safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and clinical activity of
      GSK2857916 given on a once every 21 days schedule. The starting dose is 2.5 milligrams per
      kilogram (mg/kg) and dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design. A maximum of 12 subjects will
      be enrolled, 6 each for 2.5 mg/kg cohort and 3.4 mg/kg cohort based on 3+3 design. Subjects
      will be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             has been pretreated with at least 2 regimens including at least the 3 following
             classes of anti-myeloma drugs: alkylators, proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulators;
             has demonstrated progression on, or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.

          -  Has measurable disease with at least one of the following: serum M-protein &gt;=0.5 grams
             per deciliter (g/dL) (&gt;=5 grams per liter [g/L]); Urine M-protein &gt;=200 milligrams
             (mg)/24 hours; Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: Involved FLC level &gt;=10 mg/dL
             (&gt;=100 mg/L) and an abnormal serum free light chain ratio (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65).

          -  Subjects with a history of autologous stem cell transplant are eligible for study
             participation provided the following eligibility criteria are met:

          -  Transplant was &gt;100 days prior to study enrolment

          -  No active infection.

          -  Female subjects: Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local
             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical
             studies. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breast
             feeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Is not a woman of
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) or Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is
             highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year), preferably with low user
             dependency, during the treatment period and for at least 80 days after the last dose
             of study treatment and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of
             reproduction during this period. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of
             the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study treatment. A WOCBP
             must have a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test (as required by local
             regulations) within 72 hours before the first dose of study treatment. The
             investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and

             undetected pregnancy.

          -  Male subjects: Contraceptive use by men should be consistent with local regulations
             regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.
             Male subjects are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the
             treatment period and for at least 140 days after last dose of study treatment: Refrain
             from donating sperm plus either: Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their
             preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and
             agree to remain abstinent; or must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed:
             Agree to use a male condom and female partner to use an additional highly effective
             contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year as when having sexual
             intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential who is not currently pregnant.

             Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.03, must be &lt;=Grade 1 at
             the time of enrolment except for alopecia and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Adequate organ system function.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Systemic anti-tumor-therapy within 14 days, or plasmapheresis within 7 days prior to
             the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Malignancies other than disease under study are excluded, except for any other
             malignancy from which the subject has been disease-free for more than 2 years and, in
             the opinion of the investigators and Medical Monitor, will not affect the evaluation
             of the effects of this clinical trial treatment on the currently targeted malignancy
             (MM).

          -  Evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following:

               1. QTcF interval &gt;=470 milliseconds (msecs) (the QT interval values must be
                  corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula [QTcF])

               2. Evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, including
                  clinically significant ECG abnormalities such as 2nd degree (Type II) or 3rd
                  degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

               3. History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable

                  Screening.

               4. Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association
                  functional classification system

               5. Uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to GSK2857916 or any of the components of the study treatment.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female or female who are interrupting lactation.

          -  Known human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb)
             or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb at Screening or within 3 months prior to first
             dose of study treatment).

          -  Positive hepatitis C antibody test result or positive hepatitis C ribonucleic acid
             (RNA) test result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study
             treatment. Subjects with positive hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease
             can only be enrolled, if a confirmatory negative hepatitis C RNA test is obtained.
             Hepatitis RNA testing is optional and subjects with negative hepatitis C antibody test
             are not required to also undergo hepatitis C RNA testing.

          -  Current unstable liver or biliary disease per investigator assessment defined by the
             presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or
             gastric varices, persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis. Stable chronic liver disease
             (including Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or hepatobiliary involvement
             of malignancy is acceptable if subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Previously diagnosed with interstitial lung disease or current complication of
             interstitial lung disease.
