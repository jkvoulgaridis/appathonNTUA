    <textblock>
      This study aim to clarify the participants's mental state with Demoralization Scale- Mandarin
      Version(DS-MV). Based on clinical observations and literature review, investigators assume
      participants's DS-MV score high correlation with PHQ-9 score.

    <textblock>
      The Chinese version of Demoralization Scale-Mandarin Version (DS-MV) was used to assess the
      mental state of patients with stroke after debridement. The statistical analysis test of
      correlation is carried out, and the reliability and validity test and the norm establishment
      of the Chinese version are further tested. Convenient sampling will be performed at a single
      medical facility. The planned implementation period is 2019/01/01 ~ 2019/12/31, and the
      location of the case is the rehabilitation ward and outpatient clinic of Taoyuan Hospital.
      The diagnosis must be: intensive stroke or hemorrhagic brain within three years. In the case
      of a 20- to 100-year-old clinical patient with stroke, the subject should explain the content
      of the case, and the subject will complete the test consent form after informed consent, and
      then begin the evaluation process of the self-assessment questionnaire. The assessment
      procedure is preceded by a clinical psychologist conducting with MMSE test to determine the
      cognitive function. When the patient's consciousness is blurred, the simple intelligent state
      test (MMSE) score less than 24 points, aphasia can not be effectively communicated, the
      diagnosis of mental illness or mental disorder has been recorded on the medical record, or
      the patient or family member is unwilling to sign the informed consent form. If the above
      situation is met, subjects will be excluded. The self-assessment questionnaire will obtain
      the scores of the subjects in the Chinese version of the Demoralization Scale-Mandarin
      Version (DS-MV) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Statistical analysis, as well
      as the Chinese version of the loss of the scale of the reliability and validity of the test
      and the establishment of clinical norm scores.
