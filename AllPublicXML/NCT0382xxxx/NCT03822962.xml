    <textblock>
      This Study evaluates the effect of adding Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) to the
      post-operative pain management of sinus surgery patients and wether or not this addition
      reduces or eliminates the need for narcotic pain medications.

      Patients will be instructed to take an NSAID regimen after surgery and will be instructed to
      take narcotics only for breakthrough pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      National attention has been given to the concerning rise of opioid abuse in this country,
      with prescriptions for this medications more than quadrupaling in the last 17 years.

      Little is known as to the appropriate use of opioid analgesics in the post-operative recovery
      of patients undergoing sinus surgery. Furthermore, most pain protocols include only Tylenol
      based opioid analgesics. No study has prospectively evaluated the volume of use of Tylenol
      based opioid analgesics and whether the addition of NSAIDS decreased the need for opioid
      analgesics.

      This study will compare opioid use with and without the addition of NSAIDS following sinus
      surgery.

      Post-operative opioid use is a great public health concern, relatively unstudied, and an area
      with an opportunity for potential intervention to significantly reduce risks, morbidity, and
      mortality to our postoperative patients by better formulating a postoperative pain management
      plan using evidence-based practices. Appropriate opioid prescribing practices can reduce the
      risk of addiction, drug overdose, death, and undertreated pain. By optimizing post-operative
      pain management protocols, the need for opioids following sinus surgery should be minimized.

    <description>Patients will be given a Visual Analogue scale to help document their level of pain from Post-operative days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5 and the first post-operative visit with the surgeon. The patient will measure their pain score each time they take medication.
The pain scale called the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale is a 0-10 pain scale. 0 = no hurt, 2 = hurts little bit, 4 = hurts little more, 6 = hurts even more, 8 = hurts whole lot, 10 = hurts worst. The numbers are added up to a sum and put into their perspective category known by the Otolaryngologist.</description>
