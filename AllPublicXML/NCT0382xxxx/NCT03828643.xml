  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective, observational study. The objective of the study is investigate the
      efficacy and safety of secukinumab without the initial weekly loading dose in patients with
      chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients were stratified in two groups, those receiving secukinumab
      at the dose 300 mg every 4 weeks from the beginning (cases) and those who received the
      initial label, weekly loading dose (controls). Efficacy was evaluated by comparing the
      proportion of patients achieving PASI75 responses at week 16, 32 and 48 between cases and
      controls. Safety was evaluated by reporting every adverse events up to week 48.
