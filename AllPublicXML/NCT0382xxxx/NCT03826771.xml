  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study the effects of a 12 week strength training program on
      individuals who have had a stroke and are depressed to see if this type of exercise training
      helps treat depression and improves walking function. Our goal is to use the information
      collected in this study to help design treatments for people who have had a stroke that will
      help with many of the common consequences of stroke, including depression, muscle weakness
      and slow walking. Progress toward overcoming some of these issues would be incredibly
      valuable to any person who has had a stroke and their families.

    <textblock>
      Depression is the most common neuropsychiatric manifestation following stroke and current
      treatments are largely ineffective. Depression has both direct and indirect effects on
      response to rehabilitation, thus subjects with post-stroke depression (PSD) are routinely
      excluded from clinical trials and treatment options are extremely limited. The investigators
      propose to determine the impact of a novel, high-intensity resistance training program,
      Post-stroke Optimization of Walking using Explosive Resistance (POWER) training, on
      post-stroke depressive symptoms. Further, the investiators will determine if depression
      limits training-induced improvements in muscular and locomotor function. This project is
      based on the premise that depression negatively affects the potential for neuroplastic
      changes to occur in response to treatment such that rehabilitation may not produce the same
      adaptations that it does in non-depressed individuals. The investigators propose that
      effective treatment for PSD would result in a virtuous cycle where reducing depression
      enhances neuroplastic changes, thereby facilitating functional gains. That is, effectively
      treating depression will make the individual better able to recover from stroke. Furthermore,
      in addition to its beneficial effects on depression, POWER training is known to improve
      post-stroke walking, thus providing an attractive option for treating depression as well as
      an established vehicle to study the effects of PSD on response to rehabilitation. The
      experiments proposed as part of this project are designed to address critical questions
      related to 1) the effects of POWER training on depressive symptoms; 2) the potential for PSD
      to limit improvements following training; and 3) the interaction between improvements in
      depression and increases in walking function. Successful completion of this project will
      provide a foundation for larger scale trials to determine dosing parameters as well as
      establish therapeutic effectiveness of POWER training on post-stroke depression as well as
      identify the mechanisms that may be responsible for the changes that occur in response to
      treatment.

    <measure>Change in Mean Score of Depression as Assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 through visit 24 (up to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, abbreviated HAM-D, is a multiple item questionnaire used to provide an indication of depression, and as a guide to evaluate recovery. A score of 0-7 is considered to be normal while a score of 20 or higher (indicating at least moderate severity) is usually required for entry into a clinical trial.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self Selected Walking Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 through visit 24 (up to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will walk on a 14-ft. long gait mat (GaitRite) to measure self-selected and fastest comfortable walking speed and other spatiotemporal parameters of walking. Subjects will be permitted a practice trial, and then be asked to complete three trials at each speed. For all trials, subjects will wear their own shoes and be asked to walk without an assistive device or ankle-foot orthosis.</description>
