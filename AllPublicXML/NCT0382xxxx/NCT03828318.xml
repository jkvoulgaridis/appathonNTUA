  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After undergoing restorative proctectomy for rectal cancer, many patients are left with
      significant bowel dysfunction, known as Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS). Increased
      LARS severity correlates with worse perceived global health status and quality of life (QoL).
      Among patients undergoing rectal resection with a permanent ostomy, there is evidence that
      supportive and educational interventions improve QoL, ostomy proficiency, self-efficacy and
      knowledge. However, evidence regarding the impact of such interventions in patients who
      undergo restorative proctectomy is lacking, despite the latter operation being far more
      frequently performed.

      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the extent to which a LARS Patient-Centered
      Program impacts on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) after restorative proctectomy
      for rectal cancer.

      This is a randomized-controlled muticenter trial that will include patients who have
      undergone restorative proctectomy for neoplastic disease (benign or malignant) located in the
      rectum (0-15cm from the anal verge) with a diverting ostomy and who are scheduled for ostomy
      closure.
