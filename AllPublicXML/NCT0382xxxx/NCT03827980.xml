    <textblock>
      Multi-centre clinical follow-up study on patients with a history of acute haematogenous
      osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis. The aim is to describe the frequency of sequelae in
      these former patients with osteoarticular infections. Patients will be invited to participate
      in a single follow-up visit including a standardised interview and a clinical examination.
      The collected data will be analyzed together with data from the patient's hospital stay.

    <textblock>
      Clinical follow-up study on patients with a history of acute haematogenous osteomyelitis
      and/or septic arthritis and were admitted to one of the participating centres between 2005
      and 2014.

      Former patients will be invited to participate in a single-follow-up visit which comprises a
      standardised interview (pain, disabilities in daily life and regarding sports) and a
      standardized clinical examination of the previously affected body part. This includes
      assessment of range of motion in affected and adjacent joints and in case of previously
      affected lower extremity leg axis, gait and body height (percentile).

      The data collected during the follow-up visit will be analyzed in a descriptive manner
      together with data of the patient's hospital stay including baseline data, laboratory works,
      microbiological results and both antibiotic and surgical treatment.
