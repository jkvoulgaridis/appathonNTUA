  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized infants undergo multiple painful procedures daily. Despite generation of a
      significant amount of evidence, procedural pain assessment and management in infants
      continues to be suboptimal. Untreated pain at this vital developmental juncture is associated
      with negative behavioural and neurodevelopmental consequences. To address this knowledge to
      practice gap, the investigators developed the Implementation of Infant Pain Practice Change
      (ImPaC) Resource (Resource) to guide change in health care professionals' pain practice
      behaviour.

      The aim of this study is (i) to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the Resource
      (primary), (ii) to evaluate the implementation effectiveness of the Resource (secondary), and
      (iii) to explore how organizational context influences clinical and implementation outcomes
      (other).

      Eighteen Level 2 or Level 3 Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) with a minimum of 15 beds
      across Canada will be included in a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). The NICUs will
      be randomized following baseline data collection using a computer-generated random allocation
      sequence (randomize.net) to either the intervention (INT) or standard practice (SP) arms.
      Those in INT arm will receive the Resource for a 6-month period. NICUs in the SP arm will
      continue as usual with their unit or institutional pain practices. They will be offered the
      Resource following outcomes assessment. Clinical outcomes will be assessed six months after
      randomization. Primary clinical outcomes include (1) the proportion of infants in the NICU
      who have procedural pain assessed with a valid pain measure, (2) the proportion of infants in
      the NICU who have procedural pain managed with an evidence-based pharmacological or physical
      intervention, and (3) the total number of painful procedures per infant in the NICU.
      Implementation outcomes will include feasibility, fidelity, cost, and reach. Organizational
      context will be assessed by using the Alberta Context Tool.

    <description>Feasibility and fidelity will be measured using Resource metrics that address (a) if all 7 steps of the Resource are completed (feasibility) and (b) if all the 7 steps are completed as intended in order (fidelity). Feasibility and fidelity metrics (data captured from the backend of the Resource website) will be electronically collected at the end of the 6-month implementation of the intervention. There is no specific measure to assess feasibility or fidelity.</description>

    <measure>Implementation costs</measure>

    <description>Implementation costs will be assessed in terms of (a) incidental costs (Canadian dollars) associated with knowledge translation and implementation activity (e.g., printing posters, refreshments for education sessions) documented in the Resource; and (b) time (hours/minutes) spent by each member of the Change Team in completing each step of the Resource. Time will be converted to actual costs by multiplying hours spent by the hourly wage of the Change Team members. Data will be captured from Resource metrics (data captured from the backend of the website) at the end of the 6-month implementation of the intervention. There is no specific measure to assess reach.</description>

    <description>The INT arm will receive the 7-step web-based ImPaC intervention to use over 6 months. The intervention is divided into the Plan Stage and the Change Stage. The Plan Stage (steps 1-4) is expected to be completed in 1 month. The Change Stage (steps 5-7) is expected to be completed in 1-2 months. We anticipate that Change Teams will be able to complete 2 cycles of change over the 6-month intervention period.</description>

Step 1: Complete a checklist to ensure its members can commit to responsibilities.
Step 2: Reflect on the unit's readiness for change.
Step 3: Perform an audit on 10 to 15 medical charts.
Step 4: Identify a practice change based on audit results (pain assessment or pain treatment). Develop an aim statement for the practice change.
Step 5: Select the KT strategies and plan the implementation.
Step 6: Perform an audit on 10 to 15 medical charts.
Step 7: Examine the effectiveness of the implementation and decide on the aim and KT strategies for the next cycle of change.</description>
