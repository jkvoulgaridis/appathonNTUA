  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate dentate gyrus (DG) and hippocampal CA3 sub field function, using
      the pattern separation paradigm, as reflected by the difference in brain activation in
      response to same-as-previously- seen (OLD) vs. similar-to-previously-seen (SIM) objects in
      first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects before and after anti psychotic treatment and in
      matched healthy controls (HC). The current study uses three novel high-resolution task-based
      and post-encoding resting fMRI measures to probe hippocampal circuitry in delusions. It will
      also study CA1 function, using a sequential associative mismatch paradigm, as reflected by
      activation of CA1 in response to mismatching information compared to memory of that stimulus
      in FEP subjects before and after antipsychotic treatment and in matched HC. Finally, this
      study will evaluate plasticity of hippocampal intrinsic functional connectivity (IFC) in
      response to memory consolidation, using an encoding-plasticity paradigm, in FEP subjects
      before and after anti psychotic treatment and in matched HC. For each of the three imaging
      projects, a total of 50 FEP subjects and 50 matched healthy controls (HC) will be studied;
      hence, 300 subjects will be studied over 5 years. Within each paradigm, medication-naive FEP
      subjects will be studied at baseline and 8 weeks after starting anti psychotic medication. HC
      participants will be studied at baseline and 8 weeks later but will not receive any
      treatment.
