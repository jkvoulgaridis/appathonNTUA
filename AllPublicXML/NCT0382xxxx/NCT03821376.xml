  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with renal lesions suspicious for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have a variety of
      different treatment pathways available to them. Imaging surveillance is being used frequently
      on smaller renal masses, and radiologists are being asked to biopsy more renal lesions to
      better guide decision making by urology. This is in large part due to the pathologic grade of
      renal masses having been shown to correlate with patient outcomes. The WHO or Fuhrman grade
      is the standard grading scale used by pathologists for RCC. The goal of this study will be to
      correlate contrast enhanced ultrasound findings with the pathologic grade of RCC.
      Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that tumors with different pathologic grades will
      show different patterns of qualitative enhancement, as well as different perfusion kinetics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal malignancies are relatively common, with lifetime risk ranging from 1 in 48 in men to 1
      in 83 in women, of which RCC is the most common. RCC comes in a variety of subtypes, and
      pathologic grade has been shown to be one factor that correlates with patient prognosis
      [Novara et al]. The most commonly used pathologic grading systems are the WHO or Fuhrman
      scale, which rely on histologic features of the tumor such as nuclear size, irregularity, and
      nucleolar prominence.

      Care of patients with RCC depends on a number of factors, including size and pathologic
      grade. As such, radiologic surveillance with CT and MRI is common, and percutaneous biopsy of
      renal masses for the purpose of pathologic grading is also relatively common. While
      percutaneous biopsy of renal masses is the least invasive way to obtain tissue, these still
      carry risks, especially of hemorrhage give the vascular nature of the kidneys and RCC.

      Contrast enhanced ultrasound has been shown to have the ability to differentiate renal masses
      from normal background renal parenchyma [Barr et al]. It has the unique ability to be used in
      patients with renal dysfunction as it is excreted by the liver and lungs. As such, it is well
      suited for use in patients with underlying renal pathology. This study will aim to use
      contrast enhanced ultrasound to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative features of renal
      masses prior to surgical removal, and then evaluate for correlation of these features with
      pathologic grading following surgery.

    <description>Ultrasound images will be reviewed for qualitative imaging features as well as quantitative post contrast features (time to peak, area under the curve, mean transit time etc). These findings will then be correlated with the pathologic grade of surgically removed renal masses, to evaluate for differences in imaging features among the different pathologic grades.</description>
