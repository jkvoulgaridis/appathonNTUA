  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a common disease, causing significant pain (dysmenorrhea, dysuria, dyspnea,
      dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain) and infertility, drastically reducing patients' quality
      of life.

      Endometriosis surgery is often a stressful event for the patient. For that reason,
      psychological support can improve patients' general health state.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with clinical and trans-vaginal / abdominal ultrasound diagnosis of endometriosis,
      undergoing surgery for the removal of endometriotic lesions are included in the study.

      Psychological support is offered to all women one month before and one month after surgery. A
      group of patients will receive intensive psychological support during hospitalization.

      Patients are divided into 2 groups:

      Group A: patients receiving intensive psychological support during hospitalization

      Group B: patients not receiving intensive psychological support during hospitalization

      After surgery, patients will be included in the post-operative follow-up, as usual in the
      investigator's clinical practice.
