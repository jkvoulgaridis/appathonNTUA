  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the use of cognitive behavioral therapies has become quite common in the clinical
      care. Different non-pharmacological techniques, including hypnosis and virtual reality are
      currently used as complementary tools in the treatment of acute and chronic pain (Pourmand et
      al., 2017; Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2009). A new technique called 'virtual reality hypnosis'
      (VRH) (Patterson et al., 2004), which encompasses a combination of both tools, is regularly
      used although its actual function remains unknown to this date. With the goal to improve our
      understanding of VRH combination effects, it is necessary to elaborate randomized and
      controlled research studies in order to understand their actual function in individual's
      perception.

      100 patients who are undergoing a cardiovascular surgery at the Liège University Hospital
      will be randomly assigned to four conditions (control, hypnosis, VR and VRH). Each
      participant will receive two sessions of one of the techniques: one the day before the
      surgery and one other session the day after, in intensive care units.

      Physiological parameters will be taken and participants will fill in a questionnaire which
      evaluates their level of perceived immersion, their level of anxiety, fatigue, pain and
      relaxation. A short interview will also be conducted to give participants the opportunity to
      openly describe their experience.

      This study will help to expand the knowledge regarding the influence of these techniques on
      patient's cognition, perception and sensation .

      Primary outcome (anxiety) and secondary outcomes (pain, fatigue, relaxation and physiological
      parameters) will be investigated at four measurement times: the day before the surgery (Day
      -1) before the intervention (T0: baseline) and after the intervention (T1); the day after the
      surgery (Day+1) before the intervention (T2) and after (T3).

VAS is from 0 to 10. 0 is not absorbed and 10 is really absorbed.

    <description>The hypnosis session will consist of a 20-minute hypnosis recording created by Marie-Elisabeth Faymonville and recorded by Anne-Sophie Nyssen, both professionals in hypnosis from University of Liège. The recording includes suggestions about relaxation, corporal sensations, respiratory techniques and visual imaginative stimuli about a beautiful landscape. With this tool, the hypnosis session is standardized for all patients and there is no need of a psychotherapist to deliver hypnosis.</description>
