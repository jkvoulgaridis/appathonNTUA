  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Candida can cause infections. The most common kind of Candida at clinics is C albicans. But
      other kinds have increased at clinics too. Researchers want to review the records of people
      who were in previous NIH studies who had Candida. They want to find out what risk factors are
      associaated with this infection.

      Objective:

      To study the factors that are associated with Candida fungemia to develop. The factors are
      clinical features, diagnoses, and previous antifungal therapy.

      Eligibility:

      People who were in prior NIH studies and had Candida

      Design:

      Researchers will review the records of 62 NIH participants. The records are from 2004 to
      2017. They will look at data such as blood test results, diagnosis, and treatments.

      Researchers will only reach out to participants if they get approval from a review board.

      This research will probably not reveal data that would be important to participants health.
      But if it does, researchers will try to contact those participants.

      Data will be stored in secure computers. They will be stored with a code that only the study
      team can link to a participant.

      This protocol is a chart review of patients who had Candida species grown from blood cultures
      drawn at the National Institutes of Health. The study will involve only review of patient
      records and will not require new specimens or participant contact. The patients whose records
      will be reviewed in this protocol are/were enrolled on a number of different protocols
      related to their underlying disease(s). Principal investigators of each protocol have been
      contacted to request permission to conduct this study, and to verify that none of the
      original protocols or informed consent documents precludes such a review of clinical data.
