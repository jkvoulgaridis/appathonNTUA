  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nursing plays an important role in the medication process in intensive care units. The
      application of active methodologies guided by the simulation strategy can help in the
      formation of qualified professionals and in the safer promotion of health care. The
      objectives to evaluate the effectiveness of the high fidelity simulation applied to nursing
      students in the process of administering drugs to critical patients in the intensive care
      setting; evaluate knowledge acquisition, satisfaction and self-confidence after the
      simulation. This is a prospective, single-blinded, controled clinical trial, with a
      quantitative approach. The sample will be composed of nursing students who are attending or
      have completed the discipline of critical care. The students will be randomized
      electronically to the experimental group, whose intervention will be guided by the high
      fidelity simulation method and, to the control group, the handling of static dummies /
      traditional teaching will be adopted as teaching strategy. Both strategies will emphasize the
      safety process during medication administration to critical patients hospitalized in the
      intensive care unit and will have an expository class dialogued prior to the intervention.
      Pre and post-tests will be applied at different times to evaluate the evolution of the level
      of knowledge and its retention and also, scales of satisfaction and self-confidence in
      learning. Descriptive and inferential statistics will be performed, as appropriate. It is
      believed that students submitted to simulation will have the opportunity to better
      consolidate knowledge during the training process, improve clinical and critical thinking,
      and decision-making, which will positively influence the safety of critically ill patients of
      the intensive care unit.

      Objective

      To evaluate the effectiveness of the high fidelity simulation for learning related to the
      drug preparation and administration process in the scenario of critical patient care in the
      cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains for undergraduate students of the nursing
      course.

      Hypothesis of the study

      Null hypothesis

      There will be no difference between learning through high fidelity simulation and traditional
      teaching / low fidelity simulation.

      Alternative hypothesis

      The high fidelity simulation strategy improves the performance of nursing students in drug
      administration more significantly when compared to traditional teaching / low fidelity
      simulation.

    <description>Students will be exposed to the intensive care setting where they will have to solve issues related to general nursing care, including the stages of the medication process that involve the nurses' performance and their complexity.
During the experience of the scenario will be provoked external factors, such as telephone ringing, visit of the professional of the infection commission, to evaluate the reactions of the student and the strategies adopted to minimize the occurrence of adverse events against such external factors.
Subsequently, they will participate in the debriefing, where they will be reflected on the positives and those that should be adjusted to promote safer nursing care related to drug administration.</description>
