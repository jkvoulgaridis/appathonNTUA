  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      preliminary efficacy of recombinant humanized anti- PD-1 monoclonal antibody（SCT-I10A）in
      patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma treated after failure of standard therapy.

      This open label, multicenter phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy in advanced solid tumors or lymphoma treated with
      anti- PD-1 monoclonal antibody SCT-I10A. The trial will be divided into two parts:
      dose-exploration and indication expansion.
