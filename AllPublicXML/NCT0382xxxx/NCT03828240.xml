  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility of a HIP fracture REhabilitation Programme
      (HIP-REP).This study will investigate adherence, satisfaction, technical and practical
      circumstances regarding implementation and taking this into account when evaluating the
      feasibility of the HIP-REP program.

      Hypothesis: By testing the feasibility of a HIP-REP for the participants and the usefulness
      of the selected measurement tools, the investigators will be able to evaluate and adjust the
      HIP-REP before evaluating this in a larger Randomized controlled trial (RCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the feasibility and effect of an intersectoral rehabilitation
      intervention aiming at reducing the decrease in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) ability for
      elderly with hip fractures. Despite positive surgical outcomes, one-quarter dies within a
      year after surgery, around eight percent are readmitted to hospital, and just one-third
      regain their pre-fracture level of physical functioning and ADL ability. After hip fracture,
      the loss of independence, and further decrease in ADL ability often persists beyond three
      months after surgery. This increases the risk of social isolation, depression and thus a
      decrease in Quality of Life (QoL). Therefore, the investigators want to evaluate whether an
      activity-based rehabilitation intervention across sectors is feasible and influences this
      fragile group of patients. The investigators hope to increase the ability to safely and
      independently perform ADL in elderly with hip fractures, and thereby enhance their
      health-related QoL.

    <measure>Assessment of Motor and Process Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at motor and process skills 3 months after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment measures the quality of a person's activity of daily living task performance. An observational assessment that allows for evaluation of change in motor and process skills and their effect on the ability of an individual to perform complex or instrumental and personal activities of daily living. The instrument consists of 16 motor and 20 process skill abilities that are rated on a 4-point scale, In all, 36 discrete ratings of motor and process skills are made during observation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>European Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 3 months after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>A survey collecting information about health related quality of life comprising five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 3 months after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment measuring the intensity of pain. The patient chooses one of those: none, mild, moderate or severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occupational Balance Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 3 months after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment that measures the patients satisfaction with the amount and variation of occupations; . It consists of 13 items measured on six-step ordinal scales. The patient chooses one of those: Disagree, partly disagree, partly agree or agree.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with daily occupations</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 3 months after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>An instrument measuring satisfaction with everyday occupations addressing four areas of everyday occupations: work and work-related occupations, leisure occupations, domestic occupations and self-care. The patient chooses on a scale from 1 to 7. 1 = Not satisfied to 7 = Very satisfied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulated Ambulation Score</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Cumulated Ambulation Score is evaluating patients' basic mobility (getting in and out of bed, sit-to-stand from a chair and walking). Each of the three activities is scored from 0-2, resulting in a daily score of 0-6.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>New Mobility Score</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 3 months after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>The New Mobility Score is a composite score of the patient's ability to perform: indoor walking, outdoor walking and shopping, providing a score between zero and three (0: not at all, 1: with help from another person, 2: with an aid, 3: no difficulty) for each function, resulting in a total score from 0 to 9, with nine indicating a high prefracture functional level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Recovery Score</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 3 months after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Recovery Score assess the level of function with eleven-items comprised of three main components: basic activities of daily living assessed by four items, instrumental activities of daily living assessed by six items, and mobility assessed by one item. Basic activities of daily living comprise 44 percent of the score; instrumental activities of daily living comprise 23 percent, and mobility comprises 33 percent. Complete independence in basic and instrumental activities of daily living and mobility results in a score of 100 percent.</description>
