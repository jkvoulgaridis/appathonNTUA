  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate effect on QT/QTc Interval after multiple dose of
      celecoxib among healthy adult volunteers. It is randomized, open-label, negative and postive
      control, and crossover study. Volunteers will be mainly checked up through ECG to find out
      changes of QT/QTc interval during the study.
