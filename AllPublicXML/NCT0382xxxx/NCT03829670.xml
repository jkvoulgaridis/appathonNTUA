      Objectives:

        1. To examine whether patients with delirium have higher prevalence of cytochrome-P450
           abnormalities compared to patients without delirium.

        2. To examine whether the severity of delirium is related to a specific cytochrome P450
           genotype.

        3. To examine the persistence of delirium at 6-8 weeks stratified by presence of cytochrome
           p450 abnormalities

        4. To examine whether delirium persistence is impacted by types of medications administered
           during their hospital stay.

      Delirium is a costly and devastating illness affecting older patients in the hospital. Its
      prevalence increases as patients get older and sicker. There is scientific evidence that
      delirium affects cognitive function for a prolonged period of time and in many cases
      irreversibly. The economic burden on health care and emotional burden on the caregivers of
      patients with delirium is tremendous. We think that our study may contribute to developing
      prevention strategies for delirium in the hospital. We propose genetic testing of older
      patients to determine their ability to metabolize commonly used medications in the hospital.
      This will give medical professionals and pharmacists an ability to adjust dosages of
      medications based on the patient's genetic profile.

    <description>Statistical Analysis Plan: Descriptive statistics will be presented as mean ± SD for continuous variables and percentage/count for dichotomous/categorical variables. Chi-square test and t-test will be used to compare distribution of variables of interest between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis will be performed to estimate the risk of PEP while adjusting for all potential confounding factors.</description>

    <description>UBACC: University of California, San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent.
The participant may decline participation after this UBACC (University of California, San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent) assessment and will be removed from the study.
The Short IQCODE (Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly) is administered to the legally authorized representative or caregiver by Dr. Schmidt. If the potential participant scores 3.3 or lower, the participant will continue in the delirium group. If higher, patient likely with pre-existing dementia. These patients are not eligible for study participation.
Delirium Rating Scale 98 will be performed on the ALGH (Advocate Lutheran General Hospital) rehabilitation unit

        Patients admitted to the Rehabilitation Unit at Lutheran General Hospital will be
        approached to participate in this case-control study. Patients will be assigned to the case
        group once identified with delirium by the Psychology staff. Control group will consist of
        patients without delirium upon assessment by the Psychology staff. The Delirious patients
        will then be matched to a control patient hospitalized in the Rehabilitation Lutheran
        General Unit.
