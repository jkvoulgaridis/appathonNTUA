  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm multicenter, phase II study. The primary objective is to
      assess the efficacy of bemcentinib (BGB324) a highly selective inhibitor of the AXL receptor
      tyrosine kinase for the treatment of AML and MDS patients failing or being refractory to
      first line hypomethylating agent (HMA) treatment. Furthermore, safety, disease progression,
      treatment failure will be assessed. A total of 43 patients will be included in the trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel treatment options in patients with MDS or AML are urgently needed; treatment has not
      changed significantly over the past decades and survival is still dismal, especially in
      elderly patients not capable for an allogeneic stem cell transplantation and failing first
      line treatment with hypomethylating agents. Axl, a member of the Tyro3, Axl, Mer (TAM)
      receptor family, mediates proliferation and survival of leukemic cells and is upregulated
      upon cytostatic treatment. In addition, leukemic cells induce expression of the Axl ligand
      growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) in bone marrow stroma cells, which further amplifies
      their growth and therapy resistance. selective inhibition of Axl signaling by the small
      molecule Axl inhibitor bemcentinib blocked leukemic proliferation in vitro and in mouse
      models. It was shown that a blockade of the Gas6/Axl signaling axis by R428 (bemcentinib)
      significantly impaired MDS growth in an ex-vivo stroma-dependent co-culture setting using
      patient-derived primary material. These effects were especially observed in the CD34+ MDS
      stem cell compartment. A persistence of this stem cell compartment is expected to underlie
      drug resistance and/or drive disease progression in MDS. Thus, Axl represents a potential
      novel target in higher risk MDS and AML.
