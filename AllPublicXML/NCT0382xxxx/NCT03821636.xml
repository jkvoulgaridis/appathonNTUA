  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with type 2 diabetes, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), which excludes a portion
      of the stomach and the proximal intestine from the alimentary circuit, improves glucose
      metabolism more rapidly and more extensively than is expected from weight loss. The
      mechanisms of this unique effect of gastrointestinal exclusion appear to be complex and have
      not yet been clarified. A recent study unveil that intestinal uptake of ingested glucose is
      diminished by RYGB and restricted to the common limb, where food meets bile and other
      digestive fluids, resulting in an overall decrease of post prandial blood glucose excursion.
      the hypothesize that reducing the length of the common limb, which is rarely measured and
      highly variable in clinical practice, may significantly affect the metabolic outcome of
      gastrointestinal surgical procedures. The aim of the present study is to compare the impact
      of two variants of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a short common limb, the long alimentary
      limb or the long biliary limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, on type 2 diabetes remission in
      severely obese patients.
