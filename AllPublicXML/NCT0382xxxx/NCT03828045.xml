  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational, prospective and multicenter study in approximately 25 sites nationwide. The
      investigators participating in this study will be rheumatologists specializing in this
      pathology.

      The study will include patients diagnosed with PsA (according to the CASPAR diagnosis
      criteria), naïve to biological treatments, who have - following the routine practice in their
      centers - initiated treatment with apremilast 6 months (±1 months) before their inclusion in
      the study, irrespective of treatment duration.

      Recruitment will be consecutive and the reason for not including a potential candidate
      patient will be registered. The decision to prescribe apremilast treatment should be clearly
      dissociated from the inclusion of the patient in the study, which will not occur earlier than
      6 months (± 4 weeks after treatment start). Therefore, the choice of the therapeutic strategy
      will be made independently by the physician.

      Before entering the study, all patients shall sign an informed consent to participate in the
      study, including permission to retrieve data from their medical records and to complete
      questionnaires regarding their quality of life.

      To avoid recruitment biases and obtain a homogeneous cohort regarding treatment duration, all
      consecutive patients who attend to a routine follow-up visit and have been prescribed
      apremilast 6 months (+/- 4 weeks) before the baseline visit, will be offered to enter the
      study. All consecutive patients who can be contacted 6 months (+/- 4 weeks) following
      initiation of treatment with apremilast will be approached for entry to minimize bias in
      patient selection
