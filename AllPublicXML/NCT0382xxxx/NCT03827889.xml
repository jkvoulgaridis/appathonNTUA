  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence that the data flow analysis tests, there are still no studies that show the clarity
      of the protocols of its application, including the interval and execution factors of
      applications, concentration of fluoridation and previous prophylaxis. That is, there are
      still large gaps regarding fluoride varnish applications. Thus, the objective of the present
      project is the selection of two protocols for application of fluid applications in active
      drugs in primary tooth enamel. The longitudinal follow-up will be performed in a period of 3,
      6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the procedure. The progression of a subject will be evaluated
      clinically through the transition of ICDAS scores and assessment of the lesions (sound
      examination with superficial measurements) by visual examination, and the physician evaluates
      the efficacy and the ability to evaluate the therapeutic techniques and evaluation.

    <time_frame>Every 6 months up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caries progression will be evaluated radiographically by three previously trained evaluators (through theoretical classes and evaluation of 13 clinical photographs) and calibrated. These examiners will not know the chronological order and compare the images two to two first by two evaluators and when there is disagreement between the two, the third examiner shall be called for tie-breaker. The possible progression of the treated caries lesion will be codified as:
Present progression: Change in radiolucidity area of the Lesion
Absent progression: No change in the area of radiolucidity of the lesion.</description>

    <measure>Number of surfaces with NEW CARIES LESIONS</measure>

    <description>Detection of the presence of new lesions in deciduous and permanent teeth through visual inspection after dental cleaning. New lesions will be recorded using ICDAS scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children self-reported discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (Immediately after procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>The child's discomfort will be assessed immediately after the sequence of treatments performed in each session by the Wong-Baker face scale. Each face corresponds to a number in a numeric scale from 0 to 5, being 0 no discomfort and 5 maximum of discomfort. At the end, the averages of each score will be compared between the experimental groups.The patient will be asked to choose the face that is more similar to how he/she felt during the treatment. The answer should be given solely by the child, which means no parental or professional interferences.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>COST-EFFICACY of each protocol</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the cost-efficacy of different protocols by total value in dollar of treatment in relation to efficacy.The quantities of all consumables used in each procedure will be annotated, as well as the time spent in each procedure, money and time will be combined to report the cost of procedures, measured by $/hour. In addition, we will verify the efficacy through the need for new surgical treatments or new caries lesions. In this way, we will compare the experimental groups according to the cost ($/hour) x the efficacy (need for new interventions). The costs of each treatment procedure will be calculated and compared with thresholds values for intervention by region, determined by World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/choice/costs/CER_levels/ en/).</description>
