  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Low back pain is a frequent and universally distributed symptom that affects
      people of any age and both sexes. Approximately 80% of the population will present it at some
      point in their life. Acute low back pain lasts less than 4 weeks, subacute 4 to 12 weeks and
      chronic more than 12 weeks.

      Hypothesis: Treatment with an exercise program combined with the usual treatment decreases
      the recurrence of acute low back pain, as well as improvements in pain, functionality, and
      quality of life of patients.

      Principal Objective To evaluate the decrease of recurrence of low back pain in the
      medium-long term of the patients who perform an exercise program compared to those who do
      not, with both groups receiving the same pharmacological treatment and information of the
      postural hygiene guidelines endorsed by the current scientific societies.

      Methods: Patients between 18 and 65 years of age who come to the emergency room with acute
      low back pain and who meet the eligibility criteria proposed for this study. At the first
      visit, patients in a control group and intervention group will be randomized. Pharmacological
      treatment and postural hygiene guidelines will be indicated for both groups, adding the
      exercise table to the intervention group. The variables chosen are the questionnaires
      Oswestry for functionality, Goldberg, EuroQol-5D for the quality of life, and VAS for pain;
      which will be measured in the first consultation, at one month, at three and at six months.
