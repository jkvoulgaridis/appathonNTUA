  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is 1 per 200
      cancer patients, about 5 times higher than in the general population.

      These events are of crucial importance, since nearly 10% of cancer patients died from
      thromboembolic events (EVT), making them the second leading cause of death in this
      population.

      In hospitalized patients, the rate seems to have increase between 1979 and 1990 from 0.6% -
      2% before 1990 to 4% since 1990.

      Thrombotic risk in cancer patients is known and identified. Thrombotic complications affect
      the survival and quality of life of cancer patients.

      Chemotherapy is a regular generator of cytopenia, the most prominent of which is
      thrombocytopenia. In addition, a prospective study of 107 cancer patients in our institution
      shows that almost 40% of patients over 65 years of age take anticoagulant or antiplatelet
      therapy.

      In this specific population (i.e., with cancer and hypocoagulability), the occurrence of
      thrombosis poses particular problems. The prevalence and incidence of venous thrombosis in
      this situation is unknown and the behavior to be poorly specified.

      Based on these considerations, The investigator propose a two-year prospective cohort study
      to explore the biological parameters of hypocoagulability and to assess the incidence and
      prevalence of DVT in thrombocytopenic patients on vitamin K antagonists. (AVK), anti-platelet
      aggregation (AGP) and / or direct oral anticoagulant (AOD).

      In this study, the investigator means by hypocoagulability any situation modifying the normal
      coagulation system.

      Some studies report an increase in the hospitalization cost of 38%, correlated in part with
      the increase in hospitalization duration related to venous thromboembolism.

      Thrombotic risk in cancer patients is known and identified. Thrombotic complications affect
      the survival and quality of life of cancer patients. Scores were established and validated to
      establish this risk and to propose prophylaxis in these patients. Guidelines exist for
      prophylaxis and for the treatment of these patients.
