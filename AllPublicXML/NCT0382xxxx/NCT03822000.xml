      This study aimed to identify the risk factors and complications associated with mortality in
      elderly patients with femoral fracture after a fall from the ground level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study reviewed data pertaining to elderly patients aged ≥ 65 years who
      were admitted into a Level I trauma center, between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2017.
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent effects of
      univariate predictive variables on the occurrence of mortality.

        This retrospective study reviewed data from 27,462 trauma patients registered between
        January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2016. The inclusion criteria were age ≥65 years and
        hospitalization for the treatment of femoral fracture following a fall from standing height
        level (&lt;1 m). This study excluded those patients with a fall from ≥1 m as well as those for
        whom incomplete data were available.
