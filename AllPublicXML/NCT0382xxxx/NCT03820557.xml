    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well the Decision Counseling Program works in increasing
      patient-physician shared decision making and participation in clinical trials for lung cancer
      patients. Decision aids help provide patients with information that may help them select a
      course of action related to their cancer care when more than one alternative is available. It
      also encourages shared decision making allowing patients and their providers to make health
      decisions together. Determining how patients make decisions about participating in a clinical
      trial may help doctors facilitate patient decision making and improve participation in lung
      cancer clinical trials.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Facilitate patient deliberation about participation in a lung cancer clinical trial using
      the Decision Counseling Program (DCP).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Document the extent to which patient values and preferences are incorporated into
      physician-patient shared decision making (SDM) about cancer clinical trials.

      II. Assess changes in patient knowledge, anxiety, and decisional conflict related to clinical
      trial participation.

      III. Characterize patient and physician experience with intervention exposure.
