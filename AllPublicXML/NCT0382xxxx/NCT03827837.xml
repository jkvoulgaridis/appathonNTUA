      Phase II multi-chort, adaptive two-stage, open label, nonrandomized study. The aim of our
      study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210(Camrelizumab) in
      combination with a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor Famitinib in subjects with advanced
      RCC/UC/CC/EC and recurrent OC.

      chort1: Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) chort2: Urothelial Carcinoma(UC) chort3: Ovarian Cancer
      (OC) chort4: Cervical Cancer (CC) chort5: Endometrial Cancer (EC)

      2: Approximately 55 participants will be recruited, 11 participants per chort, if more than
      7（including 7） patients reached ORR in every chort ; Approximately 155 participants will be
      recruited, 21 participants per chort, if 3 ≤ patients ＜7 patients reached ORR in every chort.
