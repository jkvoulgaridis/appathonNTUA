  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery remains the backbone of modern management of benign gynecologic conditions. Some
      common surgical procedures include hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma or adenomyosis,
      adnexectomy for ovarian and tubal pathology, and other conservative surgeries. These
      procedures can be accomplished by different surgical approaches comprising abdominal,
      vaginal, and laparoscopic routes. Although the use of vaginal and laparoscopic approach has
      increased in recent years, the open abdominal route is still the most commonly employed
      approach. This is especially the case in developing countries where resources to support the
      more expensive approach such as laparoscopy are quite limited. However, the procedure can be
      associated with significant morbidity. Delayed functional recovery influenced by pain and
      immobilization are important contributing factors for increased morbidity. Elastic abdominal
      binder, a wide elastic belt that is wore around the patient's abdomen to support surgical
      incision after surgery, has been employed by clinicians for pain relief, wound complications
      prevention, improved pulmonary function, and stabilization. Benefits of the abdominal binder
      use in this patient population have not been properly examined.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of postoperative elastic abdominal binder use
      on recovery by comparing pain scores and mobility function (through the 6-minute walk test
      [6MWT]) in postoperative gynecologic patients who use versus do not use the elastic abdominal
      binder to support incisional site.

    <description>Each woman in the intervention group is fitted with an elastic abdominal binder at the time of procedure completion just before leaving the operating room. The binder is placed snuggly tight (keeping in mind patient's comfort) on top of the hospital gown with the incision positioned at the middle part of the binder. The patients are encouraged to wear binders at all time. However, periods of break from wearing the binder are allowed at their convenience.</description>
