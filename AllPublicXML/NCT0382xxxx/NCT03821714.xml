      This study aimed to investigate the effect of Glucocorticoid combined with vitamin C and
      vitamin B1 on microcirculation in severe septic shock.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial. The investigators enroll
      patients aged 18-80 years with severe septic shock. Severe septic shock was defined as septic
      shock with norepinephrine &gt;15ug/min. The investigators randomly divided the patients into two
      groups: the glucocorticoid treatment group (control group), the glucocorticoid combined with
      vitamin C and vitamin B1 treatment group (experimental group). The microcirculation was
      monitored at 0-6 h, 24 h, and 72 h after patients enrollment. The investigators monitored the
      sublingual microcirculatory alterations by Hand-held vital microscopes and scored the
      collected images according to the recommendations of the consensus on microcirculation
      monitoring in 2018. During the experiment, researchers, Microcirculation Image analysts, and
      patients were blinded to the treatment group.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Case screeners screen patients who meet the inclusion criteria. A researcher sign informed consent with family members or patients. Patients were divided into groups according to a random number table by screeners. Researchers collected sublingual microcirculation images and numbered in the order of grouping. Finally, the microcirculation images were analyzed by two other researchers, and the results were averaged. All researchers are not involved in clinical treatment.</masking_description>
