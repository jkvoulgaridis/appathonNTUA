    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to study how using acceptance and value based group intervention
      helps the wellbeing of teenagers with type in diabetes.

      The investigators created an ACT-group intervention consisting of five sessions, based on
      earlier research. 12-16 years- old diabetics who are treated at KSSHP pediatric policlinic
      are invited to join the groups. The participants are randomized to research and control
      groups. The HbA1c-level is monitored for both groups as well as the psychological
      flexibility, diabetes related acceptance, depression and quality of life.

    <measure>Quality of life assessed by KINDL-r Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the quality of life the Revised Children's Quality of Life Questionnaire is used. The KINDLr is a generic instrument for assessing Health-Related Quality of Life in children and adolescents aged 3-17 years (Ravens-Sieberer &amp; Bullinger, 1998). In this study, we use the generic, youth-specific, mode of the questionnaire consisting of 24 questions and the diabetes specific module consisting of 17 questions. The answers are given on the Likers Scale from 1-5. The generic mode consists of 6 sub-scales: physical well-being, emotional well-being, self-esteem, social contacts and school. The six sub-scales are combined to form a total score of maximum 120. The maximum score in diabetes specific module is 85. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Diabetes Related Psychological flexibility assessed by DAAS</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure diabetes related acceptance skills the DAAS-questionnaire (The Diabetes Acceptance and Action Scale for Children and Adolescents) is used. A questionnaire is developed to measure the diabetes related psychological flexibility (Greco &amp; Hart, 2005). Questionnaire consists of 42 questions and responses are given on Likert scale from 0-4. The maximum score in the questionnaire is 168. The higher sum in the questionnaire refers to higher psychological flexibility, better acceptance of diabetes and action.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms assessed by RBDI</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the depressive symptoms and anxiety the RBDI-questionnaire (Revised Beck Depression Inventory) is used. RBDI is a Finnish version of The Beck Depression Inventory (Beck &amp; Beck, 1972). It consists of 13 questions measuring depressive symptoms and one question measuring anxiety. In each question there are five possible answers to choose and scores are given from 0 to 3. The maximum score for measuring depressive symptoms is 39 and the maximum score for the question measuring anxiety is 3. Higher scores means more symptoms of depression or anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Psychological flexibility assessed by CAMM</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>To asses psychological flexibility CAMM (The Child and Adolescent Mindfulness measure) is used. CAMM-questionnaire was developed to measure the mindfulness and acceptance skills and it assesses the degree to which children and adolescents observe internal experiences, act with awareness, and accept internal experiences without judging them (Greco, Baer, &amp; Smith, 2011). The 10-question version is used. The answers are given on Likert scale 0-4, from never true to always true. Maximum score is 40. Higher scores indicate higher levels of mindfulness and acceptance.</description>
