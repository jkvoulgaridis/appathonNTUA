  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will estimate the impact of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) on the
      pharmacokinetics of an investigational product (PF-06651600) in healthy adult participants.

      This is an open-label, fixed sequence two period study with healthy participants that will
      receive a single dose of PF-06651600 alone and co-administered with multiple doses of
      itraconazole at a single center.

      Participants will be screened within 28 days of the first dose of the investigational
      products and if entry criteria are met, the participant will report to the clinic on the day
      before the Day 1 visit. On Day 1 of Period 1, each participant will receive a 30 mg dose of
      PF-06651600 and PK samples will be collected for 48 hours. In Period 2, participants will
      receive itraconazole solution from Day 1-5. On Day 4 of Period 2 the participant will receive
      30 mg of PF-06651600 with the itraconazole. PK samples will be collected up to 48 hours after
      the PF-06651600 dose. Participants will be confined for a total of 9 days in the clinic. The
      participant will be followed up by phone contact.
