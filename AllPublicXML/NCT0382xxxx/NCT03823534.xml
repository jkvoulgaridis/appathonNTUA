  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nationally, the opioid crisis has become a major epidemic with increasing mortality rates
      each year. Orthopedic surgeons routinely prescribe narcotics instead of NSAIDs for post-op
      pain control because of risk of delayed healing and nonunion due to NSAID use. Orthopedic
      oncology, however, has a unique subset of patients that undergo prophylactic placement of
      intramedullary femoral nails. Because no fracture is present, these patients do not rely on
      inflammatory healing factors, allowing for post-op NSAID use. This study sets out to
      determine the effect of post-op toradol use in addition to opioids compared to solely opioids
      in patients undergoing prophylactic nailing of the femur.

      Nationally, the opioid crisis has become a major epidemic with increasing mortality rates
      each year. Orthopedic surgeons routinely prescribe narcotics instead of NSAIDs for post-op
      pain control because of risk of delayed healing and nonunion due to NSAID use. Orthopedic
      oncology, however, has a unique subset of patients that undergo prophylactic placement of
      intramedullary femoral nails, often due to bone metastases that increase risk for future
      fractures. Because no fracture is present, these patients do not rely on inflammatory healing
      factors, allowing for post-op NSAID use.

      Recent literature has demonstrated the efficacy of multi-modal pain management in treating
      post-op pain [1]. Currently, patients that undergo prophylactic intramedullary femur nail
      placement at SLU are often treated with both narcotics and toradol, as long as they can
      tolerate NSAIDs. However, the effect of toradol in addition to narcotics has not been
      determined. This study sets out to determine the effect of post-op toradol use in addition to
      opioids compared to solely opioids in patients undergoing prophylactic nailing of the femur.

Total scores are computed by summing the scores of the 3 individual questions. Possible scores range from 3-15 with higher values representing increasing pain over the previous 7 days.</description>

The score ranges from 0-100, with 100 representing the best possible perceived function of the limb and 0 the worst possible perceived function. There are no sub-scales.</description>

    <description>For the first 24 hours following surgery, patients younger than 65 years old will be administered a maximum of 120 mg/day bolus IV ketorolac (30 mg every 6 hours). Patients older than 65 years old or with history of advanced renal impairment will receive a maximum of 60 mg/day bolus IV ketorolac (15 mg every 6 hours). All patients may also be given acetaminophen 500 mg PO Q4 hours PRN for mild pain, oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325 mg PO Q4 hours PRN for moderate- severe pain, and morphine IV PRN (or other opioid) for severe breakthrough pain while hospitalized. At discharge, they will be prescribed 1-2 hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5-325 mg Q4 hours, quantity 50. Those with preexisting liver disease will be prescribed the equivalent in oxycodone and will not receive acetaminophen for mild pain.</description>
