  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the feasibility of a 6-week yoga and meditation
      intervention for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). The study will evaluate the impact of
      the program on fatigue, anxiety, depression, positive affect, and other measures. A sub-study
      will collect brain images using MRI on 2 subjects before and after the intervention to
      identify potential biological markers of MS related-fatigue.

      This study will recruit 20 subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) to participate in a 6-week
      yoga/meditation program. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first
      group will complete the yoga/meditation classes, followed by a waiting period. The second
      group will go through a waiting period, followed by yoga/meditation classes. Two subjects
      assigned to classes during the first session will be selected to participate in an MRI
      sub-study to look for biomarkers of MS-associated fatigue. All subjects will complete
      questionnaires and assessments during 3 clinic visits - at baseline, in between the class
      sessions, and at the end of the study. Questionnaires will also be mailed to subjects 6 weeks
      after the last study visit.

          2. MS symptom exacerbation in the 8 weeks before baseline or other serious medical
             conditions that would impair ability to participate in the study.

          3. Any other reason that, in the investigator's opinion, would exclude the subject from
             participation in the study.

          4. Contraindication to scanning, including but not limited to ferromagnetic metal in the
