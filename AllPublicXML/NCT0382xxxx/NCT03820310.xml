  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prime purpose of this trial is to evaluate the Progression Free survival and two-year
      survival of combining autologous Tcm cellular immunotherapy and traditional therapy in
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients after radical resection. A secondary objective
      of the trial is to assess the long-term survival and safety of Tcm cellular immunotherapy and
      traditional therapy in ICC patients after radical resection. Patients will be randomized 1:1
      either to the experimental group to receive autologous Tcm cellular immunotherapy and
      chemotherapy or to the control group (traditional therapy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) accounts for 2%~3% of gastrointestinal tumors, and the
      incidence has been on the rise globally. The pathogenesis of ICC remains unclearly. Compared
      with palliative resection, the postoperative survival rate of patients undergoing radical
      resection is significantly improved. However, most patients after radical resection will
      recurrence or metastasis, and the five-year overall survival rate is about 10-40%.

      Autologous cellular immunotherapy is to collect patient's own immune cells and infuse into
      the patient's body after culture in vitro that can activate the anti-tumor immune response
      and then achieve the purpose of cancer treatment. Central memory T cells (Tcm) is the most
      effective anti-tumor immune cell with long-term in vivo survival and self-renewal capacity.
      Combination of autologous cellular immunotherapy with traditional therapies, such as
      radiotherapy or chemotherapy, can effectively prolong the survival period of patients, and
      improve the quality of life for patients.

      This study will recruit subjects with pathologically confirmed intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma after radical resection. Patients must have adequate hematologic and end
      organ function, performance status and no contraindications to receive autologous cellular
      immunotherapy.

      The observation period of patients is 24 months. The prime purpose of this trial is to
      evaluate the Progression Free Survival (PFS) and two-year survival of combining autologous
      Tcm cellular immunotherapy and traditional therapy in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
      patients after radical resection. A secondary objective of the trial is to assess the
      long-term survival and safety of Tcm cellular immunotherapy and traditional therapy in ICC
      patients after radical resection.
