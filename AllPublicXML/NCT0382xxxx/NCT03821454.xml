  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capecitabine is recommended for adjuvant treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      and is particularly effective in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      CREATE-X clinical studies have demonstrated that Capecitabine can further improve prognosis
      and demonstrate good tolerance in patients who have not achieved pathologic complete response
      (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Previous studies have confirmed that the pathological features of the low- hormone receptor
      (HR)positive population in breast cancer are similar to those in the TNBC population, with a
      poor prognosis and are not sensitive to adjuvant endocrine therapy.

      We hypothesize that the use of Capecitabine in breast cancer patients with residual invasive
      carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve prognosis.

      The investigators will recruit patients who had low- hormone receptor (HR)positive breast
      cancer of stage I - IIIC and pathologically assessed residual cancer cells (no pathological
      complete response, non-pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anthracycline, taxane, or
      both. Participants who have residual components of ductal carcinoma in situ are assessed as
      having a pathological complete response. Participants with tumor-positive lymph nodes
      excluded.

      Other key eligibility criteria are low- hormone receptor (HR)positive, including low-ER and
      low-PR, low-ER and PR-negative, low-PR and ER-negative. The definition of low hormone
      receptor (HR) positive is nuclear staining of 1%-10% of the epithelial component of the
      tumor.

      Eligible participants are centrally enrolled after pathological assessment and are randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either capecitabine plus standard therapy or standard
      therapy alone (control).

      The trial treatments are standard postsurgical treatments, which included endocrine therapy
      in participants with estrogen-receptor-positive (nuclear staining ≥ 1%) disease, targeted
      therapy in participants with HER-2 overexpression and radiotherapy (if indicated), with or
      without capecitabine.

      After surgery, the capecitabine group receive oral capecitabine (at a dose of 1250 mg per
      square meter of body-surface area, twice per day, on days 1 to 14) every 3 weeks for eight
      cycles. The concomitant administration of postsurgical endocrine therapy is allowed.
      Postsurgical radiotherapy could be given before or after randomization and could be
      concomitant with postsurgical endocrine therapy.
