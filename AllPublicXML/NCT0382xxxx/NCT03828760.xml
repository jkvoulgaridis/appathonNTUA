  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although intrauterine devices (IUDs) are a highly effective contraceptive method, fear of
      pain during insertion is one barrier to use. A review of literature reveals little
      investigation of interventions for anxiety management during the procedure. Furthermore,
      evidence of non-pharmacological interventions for both anxiety and pain management is
      limited. Music has been shown to be effective at reducing anxiety and pain in a variety of
      contexts, however to the investigators' knowledge, its effectiveness for anxiety and pain
      relief during the IUD insertion procedure has not been formally examined. This study will
      therefore examine the effectiveness of listening to music on anxiety and pain during IUD
      insertion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial of patients at least 16 years of age undergoing an
      IUD insertion. The experimental group will receive music, self-selected, with a music-playing
      device prior and during the procedure and the control group will receive standard care. Data
      for pain and anxiety will be collected prior to the procedure, and during, and after IUD
      insertion. In addition, a post-procedure questionnaire will be given to patients and
      providers to ask about satisfaction and acceptability of the intervention.

    <description>The trait anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al.,1983) will be used to measure trait anxiety. It contains 20 items, each item is rated on a 4-point scale (not at all, somewhat, moderately so, very much so), with higher values representing higher anxiety. Scores range from 20-80 (higher scores represent higher trait anxiety).</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to either use their personal phones to listen to preferred music which is already on their device, or if they do not have a phone or other personal device capable of playing music of their choice, we will use a device (e.g. iPod) to load music of their choice. While in the waiting room, participants will listen to music through headphones/earphones, however they will need to remove their headphones/earphones during the initial consultation with the family physician (explaining risks, etc.), and resume listening to music through the phone speakers once in the examination room as patients will need to be able to hear instructions from the physician during the procedure.</description>
