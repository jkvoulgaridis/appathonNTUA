      This case-control study will evaluates the association between the definitive sleep bruxism
      diagnosis by gold-standard polysomnography examination obtained at Pelotas Sleep Institute
      and the sociodemographic, occupational, clinical conditions, sleep quality, sleep structure
      and Epworth sleepiness scale variables.

      Currently, as sleep and awake bruxism are generally considered as different behaviours
      observed during sleep and wakefulness, respectively, the single definition for bruxism is
      recommended be &quot;retired&quot; in favour of 2 separate definitions. In this sense, the sleep
      bruxism is a masticatory muscle activity during sleep that is characterised as rhythmic
      (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic) and is not a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in
      otherwise healthy individuals .The diagnosis of sleep bruxism often is challenging and
      despite the use of questionnaires, clinical exams and portable devices, based on current
      knowledge, the polysomnography with audio-video recordings emerges as the gold-standard
      criteria for a definite sleep bruxism diagnosis.

      Included on the questionnaire there is a registration form, which contains: Sociodemographic:
      self-reported ethnicity, marital status, education level; Occupational: individuals were
      asked about work outside home, working hours; Clinical condition: body mass index, smoking;
      alcohol consumption; use of sleeping pills.

      Sleep Quality, was evaluated with the following questions: Sleep behavioral, how long does it
      take to sleep; restless sleep; nightmares; heartburn, obstructive sleep apnea by
      polysomnography. Bedtime, sleep time. Waking during the night, insomnia. Morning wake up,
      headache on waking; Lastly, Sleep structure data: sleep onset latency, rapid eye movement,
      sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, non-rapid eye
      movement, sleep time in stages N1, N2, and N3, REM sleep time, arousal, arousal per hour,
      respiratory disturbance index, apnea-hypopnea index; and Epworth Sleepiness Scale.

    <description>Patients included in the study received diagnosis of SB by polysomnography exams. The data were obtained from polysomnography records in which masseter electromyography (EMG) burst was detected based on a predefined EMG threshold (20% of maximal voluntary tooth clenching task). Right masseter EMG bursts exceeding 0.25 second in duration were selected for oromotor activity scoring according to published criteria. Oromotor episodes separated by 3-second intervals were recognized as rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) if they corresponded to 1 of the 3 following patterns: phasic (3 or more EMG bursts, each lasting 0.25 to 2 seconds), tonic (1 EMG burst lasting more than 2 seconds), or mixed (both burst types) episodes. EMG bursts were considered within the same RMMA episode if the interval between them was shorter than 2 seconds. Participants had SB diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) if the RMMA index was greater than 2 episodes per hour of sleep.</description>

    <description>The polysomnography (referred to as type I) allows assessing several sleep physiologic parameters (eg, EEG, electrooculogram, electromyogram, electrocardiogram, airflow, respiratory effort, oxygen saturation), whereas audio-video recording enables documenting tooth-grinding sounds and distinguishing between rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) and orofacial (eg, swallowing) and other muscular activity (eg, head movements) during sleep. Based on the RMMA index (number of episodes per hour of sleep), sleep bruxism is diagnosed when RMMA episodes are greater than or equal to 2 (low-frequency SB, mild bruxism) or RMMA episodes are greater than or equal to 4 (high-frequency SB, severe bruxism)</description>
