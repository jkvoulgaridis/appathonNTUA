  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop and evaluate in-home assistive technology that is designed to
      alleviate anxiety, burden, and loneliness in spousal and familial caregivers of individuals
      with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, refine, and evaluate a hardware/software system designed to
      integrate in-home sensors and devices, social connection, and Internet-of-Things (i.e.,
      devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create
      a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and people with dementia. The
      system monitors troublesome behaviors in people with dementia (e.g., wandering), and targets
      mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in people with
      dementia with adverse caregiver outcomes (declines in health and well-being). The system is
      designed to minimize demands on caregivers' limited time and energy and to provide a platform
      for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Caregivers in the full operation condition will have fewer negative effects of
           caregiving (lower burden, higher mental and physical health, higher well-being) than
           those in the limited home safety condition.

        2. Greater use of the social networking features of the system will be associated with
           fewer caregiver depressive symptoms.

        3. Greater utilization of the home safety features of the system will be associated with
           fewer caregiver anxiety symptoms.

    <masking_description>Identical system is installed in all homes regardless of treatment arm. The member of research team who does the installation will now know which treatment arm has been assigned. Initiating the features of the system appropriate to the assigned treatment arm is done remotely by a member of the People Power staff (who has no contact with the participants) following the installation.</masking_description>

    <measure>Zarit Burden Interview-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times over 9-month period (at time of installation and then every 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to measure caregiver burden (Zarit, Reever, &amp; Bach-Peterson, 1980). 12 items are rated on 0-4 scale. Range: 0-48. No subscales. Higher scores represent worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times over 9-month period (at time of installation and then every 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to measure depression (Radloff, 1977). 20 items are rated on a 0-3 scale and summed (range = 0-60). There are no subscales. Higher scores represent worse outcomes. The clinical cut-off is usually set at a score of 16.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times over 9-month period (at time of installation and then every 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to measure anxiety (Beck, Epstein, Brown, &amp; Steer, 1988). 20 items are rated on a 0-3 scale and summed (range= 0-60). Higher scores indicate worse outcomes. There are no subscales. A score greater than 36 is considered to be clinically significant.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times over 9-month period (at time of installation and then every 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring overall life satisfaction and well-being (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985). 5 items scored on a 1-7 scale and summed (Range = 5-35). Lower scores indicate worse outcomes. A score of 20 is considered neutral with higher scores considered increasingly more satisfied and lower scores considered increasingly more dissatisfied.</description>

    <measure>Revised Functional Limitations Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times over 9-month period (at time of installation and then every 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to measure functional health (Brim, Ryff, &amp; Kessler, 2004). 13 items asking about limitations in two parts (yes/no and if they have the limitation rating its duration on a 1-3 score). Items are summed (range 0-39). Higher scores indicate worse outcomes</description>

    <description>The full system (sensors for entry, activity, temperature, water leak; voice control; digital display; local router) will be installed in the homes of caregivers by a member of the research team (blind as to arm of the study). Monitoring of sensors, provision of warnings, messaging, and social networking features will be activated remotely for those participants who have been randomly assigned to this arm. Participation will extend over a nine month period with questionnaires (e.g., health and well-being) administered 4 times (at the time of installation and every 3 months thereafter).</description>
