  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores whether a facilitated peer support group called Buried in Treasures (BIT)
      and a virtual reality decluttering practice can help individuals with clutter challenges.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with clutter challenges participate in Buried in Treasures Workshop (BIT) that
      has been shown to improve symptoms of hoarding disorder. The investigators hypothesize that
      adding virtual reality decluttering practice to the BIT workshop will decrease hoarding
      symptoms and level of clutter over time.

    <description>The Saving Inventory-Revised scale (SI-R) is a 23-item questionnaire with 3 factor-analytically defined sub-scales for difficulty discarding, excessive clutter, and compulsive acquisition.
The total score (sum of 23 items) ranges from 0 to 92. Total score higher than 41 shows significant difficulty with clutter.
For the acquisition subscale we sum items 2 (reverse score), 9, 11, 14, 16, 18 and 21. The subscale ranges from 0 to 28 and score greater than 13 indicates difficulty with excessive acquisition.
For the difficulty discarding subscale we sum items 4(reverse score), 6, 7, 13, 17, 19, 23. The subscale ranges from 0 to 28 and score greater than 13 indicates difficulty with discarding.
For the clutter subscale we sum items 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22. The subscale ranges from 0 to 36 and score greater than 15 indicates difficulty with accumulated clutter.</description>

    <measure>Clutter Image Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 8 weeks and 16 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Three sets of photographs, each containing nine photos of a single room with varying levels of clutter. A selection is made as to which photograph best resembles their own home.
This scale assesses the clutter levels in the bedroom, living room and kitchen. The scale for each room ranges from 1 to 9. Clutter that reaches the level 4 indicates significant difficulty with clutter that affects the person's life.</description>
