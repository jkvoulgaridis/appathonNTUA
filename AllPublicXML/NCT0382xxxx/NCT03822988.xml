  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The law about advance directives is evolving but, in France, few people write it.

      Te main endpoint of this research is to estimate the proportion of patients who have written
      their advance directives or considering doing so in onco-dermatologic population. If this
      rate remains low, some insights on the reasons will be able to be advanced looking at the
      point of view and opinion of patients about this topic.

      Seconds endpoints are :

      For patients against or not planning to write it, understand their reasons

      Estimate the proportion of patients requesting information and understand how they would like
      to receive it.

      Investigate a possible association between the stage of the oncological disease and the
      positioning of the patient concerning advance directives.
