      To undertake normative data collection of existing clinical algorithms using existing
      oximetry technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paediatric patients who are undergoing routine diagnostic pulse oximetry, will be approached
      to also wear an additional oximeter at the same time so that comparisons between two
      oximeters and their clinical algorithms can be compared.
