    <textblock>
      The study is a pediatric non-randomized open-label Phase I clinical trial. This will include
      a safety evaluation and preliminary assessment of the efficacy of hematopoietic gene therapy
      consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a lentiviral vector carrying
      the ITGB2 gene in subjects with severe Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-I (LAD-I). Subjects will
      undergo mobilization and collection of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor or bone marrow harvest in select
      circumstances.

      HSCs will then be transduced with the therapeutic vector (Chim.hCD18-LV), with the intent of
      enabling stable integration of the provirus in the genome of stem and progenitor cells.

      If the number of CD34+ cells that are cryopreserved is at least 4×10E6 total CD34+ cells/kg,
      subjects will receive myeloablative conditioning with intravenous busulfan. The gene-modified
      CD34+ cells will be then transplanted back into the subject.

      Once engrafted, it is anticipated that the gene-modified stem and progenitor cells will
      enable hematopoiesis, generating blood cells in which the integrated therapeutic gene (ITGB2)
      will be transcribed and translated to produce the therapeutic CD18 protein with a
      preferential high expression in mature myeloid cells. Leukocytes expressing a functional CD18
      will have the capability to arrest on endothelial surfaces and extravasate to infectious
      sites, enabling a competent antimicrobial response and reversing the clinical disorder.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A confirmed diagnosis of severe LAD-I as demonstrated by flow cytometry indicating
             CD18 expression on &lt;2% neutrophils (polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMNs]). (Patients
             in which CD18+ PMNs are &gt;2% will be considered eligible with &lt;2% CD11a or CD11b
             expressing PMNs and if there is a documented ITGB2 mutation and clinical history
             consistent with LAD-I (or known family history).

          -  At least one (1) prior significant bacterial or fungal infection (US National Cancer
             Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], v5.0, Grade
             ≥2). This criteria is not required for patients with documented family history who
             meet the above inclusion criteria.

          -  Age ≥3 months.

          -  Considered to be an appropriate candidate for autologous transplantation of HSCs.

          -  A competent custodial parent with legal capacity to execute an Ethics Committee
             (EC)-approved consent form must be available to participate in the consent process.
             (Informed assent will be sought from capable patients, in accordance with the
             directive of the EC and with local requirements.)

          -  Ability to comply with trial procedures including investigational therapy and
             follow-up evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Availability of a medically-eligible human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling
             donor transplant. Patients may not be included in this trial as an alternative to a
             clinically-indicated and feasible HLA-matched sibling donor HSC transplant. If an
             HLA-identical sibling is identified, but mobilized peripheral blood or bone marrow HSC
             collection is not feasible (for example: donor is in utero, is a newborn from whom
             cord blood was not collected, or is unable to undergo donation procedure because of
             medical impairments), then inclusion may be permitted per the Principal Investigator
             discretion.

          -  Hepatic dysfunction as defined by either:

               -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) or

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2.5×ULN

          -  Pulmonary dysfunction as defined by either:

               -  Need for supplemental oxygen during the prior 2 weeks (in absence of acute
                  infection).

               -  Oxygen saturation (by pulse oximetry) &lt;90%.

          -  Evidence of active metastatic or locoregionally advanced malignancy (including
             hematologic malignancy) for which survival is anticipated to be less than 3 years.

          -  Serious infections with persistent bloodstream pathogens at time of trial entry.
             (Patients with active infections [e.g., unresolved ulcerative lesions, skin or oral
             infections] are permitted as long as appropriate antibiotic therapy has been [or is
             being] administered).

          -  Any medical or other contraindication for both leukopheresis and bone marrow harvest
             procedure, as determined by the treating investigator.

          -  Any medical or other contraindication for the administration of conditioning therapy,
             as determined by the treating investigator.

          -  Significant medical conditions, including documented human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) infection, poorly-controlled diabetes, poorly-controlled hypertension,
             poorly-controlled cardiac arrhythmia or congestive heart failure; or arterial
             thromboembolic events (including stroke or myocardial infarction) within the 6 prior
             months.

          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator
             renders the patient unfit for trial participation or at higher than acceptable risk
             for participation.

        Patients who are evaluated for the trial and determined ineligible may be subsequently
        evaluated and declared eligible if the criteria by which they were considered ineligible is
        reversible (for example: bloodstream infection, transient increase in liver enzymes) and
        there is documented and plausible evidence of its resolution in the opinion of the
        Principal Investigator.
