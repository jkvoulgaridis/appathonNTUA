      To give expanded access to intrathecal autologous MSC-NP treatment to patients with
      progressive MS who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria of our Phase II stem cell
      trial.

    <description>Between 5 to 10 million MSC-NPs will be administered intrathecally in each dose.
10 million cells is the maximum dose. Treatment will consist of 3-5 doses spaced 3 months apart.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of MS as defined by the McDonald criteria

          -  Diagnosis of primary progressive or secondary progressive MS

          -  Patients will be 18 years or older

          -  Significant disability shown by an Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS, [5]) â‰¥4.5
             that was not acquired within the last 12 months *(Patients with moderate to severe
             cerebellar dysfunction who have an EDSS of &lt;6.5 who are not eligible for our Ph II
             Version Date: 11/21/18 Version #4 9 study will be included. This is because EDSS
             scores are heavily related to muscle strength and not balance or coordination and most
             accurately reflect paraparesis. Also there are patients with MS who have disabling
             upper limb coordination dysfunction but EDSS scores of better than 6.5 who are not
             suitable for the Phase II study but may benefit from this therapy).

          -  Stable disease state as evidenced by a lack of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on an MRI
             and by a stable MRI disease burden (number of T2 lesions and size of lesions) in the
             last six months and no significant change in EDSS (1 point or more) in the last 12
             months

          -  Does not qualify for the inclusion/exclusion criteria of our Phase II stem cell trial.
             For example, patients with EDSS &gt;6.5 or MS symptom onset and/or duration of disease
             &gt;15 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients who have had any prior stem cell treatments, including HSCT

          -  Pregnant or nursing mothers or any woman intending to become pregnant in the next
             three years

          -  Use of systemic chemotherapeutic or anti-mitotic medications within three months of
             study start date due to the possibility of interference with bone marrow procedure

          -  History of central nervous system infection or immunodeficiency syndromes due to
             increased risk of CNS infection

          -  Patients who are anticipated to have difficultly accessing the intrathecal space
             related to scoliosis, obesity, or any other relevant factors determined by the PI.

          -  Patients who have not tried available therapies for their progressive MS
