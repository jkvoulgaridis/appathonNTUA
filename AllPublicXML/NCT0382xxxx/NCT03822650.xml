  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CLN7 and CLN5 are forms of Batten Disease, and neurodegenerative disorders in children
      causing psychomotor regression, seizures, blindness, loss of ambulation and premature death,
      and have no available treatments.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and natural clinical
      progression of symptoms in individuals with CLN7 and CLN5. This natural history study is
      important to better understand disease course to be able to determine clinically relevant
      outcome measures for use in future clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) are comprised of a group of fatal neurodegenerative
      diseases caused by mutations in an enzyme or protein which results in the accumulation of
      toxic deposits in the eye, brain, skin, muscle and other cells.

      CLN7 is a type of NCL caused by homozygous or bi-allelic heterozygous variants in CLN7/MFSD8
      gene, whose function is poorly characterized. CLN7 presents with neurological signs,
      including blindness, seizures, progressive deterioration in intellectual and motor
      capabilities, culminating in premature death in the first or second decade of life.

      CLN5 is another type of NCL, caused by homozygous or bi-allelic heterozygous variants in the
      CLN5 gene. Lack of CLN5 protein impairs the breakdown of certain proteins, leads to defective
      lysosomal trafficking, resulting in accumulation of toxic material and subsequent cell
      damage. CLN5 disease presents in childhood with neurological findings including motor
      clumsiness and attention disturbances, followed by progressive visual failure, psychomotor
      depression, epilepsy, and premature death.

      No investigational product will be provided in the study.

    <measure>Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-specific clinical assessment used to assess physical, seizure, behavioral and functional capabilities. For physical assessments scores range from 0 to 4 with the score of 4 being most severe.</description>

    <measure>Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Rating Scale (Hamburg Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease specific tool used to capture 4 domains including motor function, seizures, visual function and language. Each sub-scale can be scored from 0-3 points in which 0 represents loss of function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electroencephalography (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>EEG records electrical brain activity and Interictal discharges (location, focal/generalized, etc) will be compared to baseline and characterized over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, 2rd or 3rd Edition (Vineland-II, Vineland-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Standard assessment measuring communication, socializing, and daily living skills to assess their overall adaptive functioning for individuals up to 90 years of age. A higher score generally corresponds with higher adaptive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>NEPSY, 2nd Edition (NEPSY-2) *</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychological assessment to evaluate language skills for individuals 3-16 years of age.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Woodcock-Johnson-IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ-IV)*</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluates strengths and weaknesses among cognitive abilities in subjects 2-90 years of age. A higher score generally corresponds with higher function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Test, 3rd edition (Bayley-3) *</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Developmental test that measures cognitive, language, motor, and social-emotional domains of infants and young children between 1 and 42 months of age. A higher score generally corresponds with higher function.</description>
