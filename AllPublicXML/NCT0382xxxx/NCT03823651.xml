    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of a research pre- and
      peri-transplant optimization program (R-PPOP) to improve multiple domains of health including
      physical function, cognitive function, mental health, and diet and nutrition for patients
      planning to undergo or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).

    <description>Patients will be asked to complete up to 3 x 30-minute structured high intensity interval training aerobic exercise sessions/week. For the first session, patients will come to the Duke Center for Living for in person evaluation and training. After the initial training session in person, a subsequent training session will take place at the patient's home via iPad/iPhone videoconference using a device provided to the patient to provide additional support and the opportunity to answer questions. Subsequent sessions will be done independently by patients, but study staff will be available via iPad/iPhone if questions arise.</description>
