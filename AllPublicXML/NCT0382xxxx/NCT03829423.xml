    <textblock>
      Interpretation of breast MR images is a very time-consuming process and places a great burden
      on breast radiologists. This project aims to develop a technical solution that addresses this
      healthcare challenge by developing a system that is able to automatically interpret breast MR
      images in order to aid the radiologist in their diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women worldwide, with nearly 1.7 million
      new cases diagnosed in 2015. In the UK, one in five cases of breast cancer results in a
      fatality. The IntelliScan project aims to develop a technological solution that addresses a
      significant healthcare challenge. IntelliScan will develop a software system that will be
      able to interpret breast MR images automatically in order to identify potential breast
      cancers.

      Regular MRI screening of the breast is offered to women from the age of 20, who are at higher
      risk of developing breast cancer. MR image sequences provide a large amount of information to
      the radiologist and the interpretation of images is a manual process, which is very time
      consuming. The high number of women eligible for MRI screening combined with the amount of
      data provided by MRI scans places a great burden on healthcare systems. Therefore,
      automatisation of this process would greatly relieve this burden and also has the potential
      to provide more accurate diagnoses.

      In this first study, the system's user interface as well as the algorithm will be developed
      using existing MRI scans. Existing MRI scans with known breast anomalies will be used to
      develop the decision-making basis for the algorithm. The system will then be tested using
      existing MRI scans without information about possible anomalies and results will be compared
      to results from the software system currently in use. In addition, the user-friendliness of
      the system's user interface will also be evaluated.
