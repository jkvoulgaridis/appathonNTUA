  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral infarction is a major health problem. The two most common causes are atherosclerosis
      (30 to 35%) and cardio-embolic origin (35 to 40%). However, in 25% of cases the cause is
      undetermined, known as cryptogenic stroke or stroke of undetermined origin. Paroxysmal Atrial
      Fibrillation appears to cause a significant proportion of these cryptogenic cerebral
      infarctions. One of the major challenges in the management of cerebral infarctions is the
      prevention of recurrence. If the cause is atheromatous, treatment is based on platelet
      antiaggregants and the correction of cardiovascular risk factors. If the cause is atrial
      fibrillation, the treatment of choice is anticoagulation therapy. Cryptogenic strokes are
      managed with antiplatelet therapy. In past studies, the thrombi responsible for cerebral
      infarctions have been analyzed anatomopathologically to see if the composition of the thrombi
      could help identify the cause of the cerebral infarction. These studies have proved to be
      contradictory. The composition of the bacterial flora of cerebral infarct thrombi has not yet
      been studied, apart from some limited data on septic emboli. In myocardial infarction, the
      cause of which is almost exclusively atheromatous, bacteria of the periodontal flora have
      been detected in thrombi of ST-segment elevation infarctions. The causes of cerebral
      infarction are multiple. The hypotheses explored in this study are that there are differences
      in the composition of the bacterial flora of the thrombus depending on whether the cause is
      atheromatous or cardio-embolic and that the study of the composition of the thrombus could be
      used to identify the cardio-embolic cause in patients with cryptogenic cerebral infarction.
