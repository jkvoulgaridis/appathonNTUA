      The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of minimum residual disease (MRD) negative
      response (i.e. the rate of no evidence of disease) of the study drugs, zanubrutinib,
      obinutuzumab, and venetoclax, given in combination as a treatment for CLL and/or SLL.

        A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not
        reached a postmenopausal state (&gt;/= 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified
        cause other than menopause), and it not permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal
        of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the

        tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation,

        the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
        abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and
        withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

             agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom
             during the treatment period and to continue its use for 90 days after the last dose of
             zanubrutinib, or venetoclax AND for 18 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab
             (whichever date is later)

        The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation duration of the
        clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence
        (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
        acceptable methods of contraception

          -  Willingness to not donate sperm or oocytes during the entire study treatment period
             and after treatment discontinuation for 90 days after the last dose of zanubrutinib
             AND 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax AND for 18 months after the last dose of
             obinutuzumab (whichever date is later)
