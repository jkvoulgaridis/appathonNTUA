  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic diseases like asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis and dermatitis are very frequent in
      athletes, even if those complaining allergic symptoms do not always receive a medical
      diagnosis. Many athletes already start competitive sport activities in pediatric age, but
      allergy screening tests are usually not performed when assessing eligibility to sport
      practice. Therefore, the objective of the present study is assessing the predictive ability
      of the Allergy Questionnaire for Athletes (AQUA©), pediatric version, to predict the atopic
      status in young athletes.

    <description>Percentage score from the WHO-5 questionnaire for measuring psychological well-being.
The questionnaire is composed of 5 questions scored on a scale ranging from 0 (worse outcome) to 5 (best outcome). The total (raw) score is obtaining by summing all the individual score items, therefore it ranges from 0 (worse outcome) to 25 (best outcome). To obtain a percentage score ranging from 0 to 100, the raw score is multiplied by 4. A percentage score of 0 represents worst possible outcome, whereas a score of 100 represents best possible outcome.</description>

    <description>A version of AQUA© recently adapted and pretested in young athletes. It is a self-administered questionnaire composed of 25 items includes items about type, duration and intensity of training sessions, allergic status, habits of children (supplements and drugs intake) and their parents (smoking), presence and burden of infections.</description>
