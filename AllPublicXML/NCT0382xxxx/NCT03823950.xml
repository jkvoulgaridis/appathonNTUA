  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy places patients at an increased risk of infection. A medication called
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is given as a daily injection in order to help decrease
      the risk of infection. The purpose of this study is to determine the best time to begin
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor while maintaining the same clinical benefits. The
      current study aims to fill these research gaps and address the general question: Can G-CSF
      safely be given 72 hours following the last day of chemotherapy without increasing the
      incidence of febrile neutropenia, the duration of neutropenia, or causing increased delays in
      the next course of chemotherapy.

    <description>Distress Rating Tool: The DRS version for 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds has three faces with different facial expressions for children to point to the one that best matches how they feel. The version for 5- and 6-year-olds has a visual analog scale presented as a thermometer with a happy face drawn next to the 0 and a sad face drawn next to the 10. The DRT version for youth 7 to 18 years defines distress as 'worry, anxiety, sadness, or fear,' on a scale from 0 (no distress) to 5 (moderate distress) to 10 (high distress). The adult DRS will be used for youth 19 to 21 years. Caregivers will rate their perception of their child's distress</description>

    <description>Children will be enrolled during the first four rounds of chemotherapy. Upon enrollment, children will receive G-CSF at 24 hours following chemotherapy. G-CSF will be discontinued when absolute neutrophil count (ANC) has increased post nadir in accord with G-CSF administration guidelines. Parents and children will then complete questionnaires to determine rates of side effects and needle distress at the end of G-CSF during their next regular outpatient oncology clinic visit.
Following children's next course of chemotherapy, G-CSF will be started 72 hours after completion of chemotherapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric oncology patients will be eligible to participate in this study if they meet
             the following inclusion criteria:

               1. are between the ages of birth and 21 years old

               2. is diagnosed with an oncologic disease

               3. is being treated at UMMC Children's Cancer Clinic

               4. will receive G-CSF as part of their standard or experimental oncology treatment
                  protocol between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. Oncology treatment
                  protocols are typically derived from the Children's Oncology Group standard of
                  care or patients can be enrolled on a Children's Oncology Group treatment study.

               5. is within first four courses of chemotherapy treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the current study if:

               1. G-CSF was added to their oncology treatment protocol due to previous
                  complications but for whom G-CSF was not part of their original treatment
                  protocol.

               2. are being treated for relapsed disease

               3. has clinical evidence of bone marrow involvement
