      Pilot study where 10 alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) patients will undergo a
      30-minutes-long cognitive assessment session using the Validation Gate task to evaluate
      usability of this tool in Alcohol Use Disorder patients. Resting-state EEG of ARBD patients
      will also be recorded and compared to the ones of age-matched healthy people in order to
      preliminary explore the existence of possible EEG biomarkers of ARBD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Much of the burden of disease related to harmful alcohol use is due to the persistent effects
      of alcohol on central nervous system. The concept of alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) is
      important in the Addiction Psychiatry field. ARBD is a spectrum of disorders. Besides most
      severe forms, 50-70% of patients with alcohol use disorder suffer some kind of cognitive
      impairment, being mild to moderate cognitive impairment the most frequent disorders, and
      often the most difficult to detect. In alcoholic patients, greater cognitive impairment has
      been associated with less treatment compliance and fewer days of abstinence. Considering its
      impact, cognitive screening should be enhanced.

      Recently, standard assessments have been augmented with new interactive technology. The work
      group of the Laboratory of Synthetic, Perceptive, Emotive and Cognitive Systems (SPECS), part
      of Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), developed a virtual assessment of
      cognitive function, called the Validation Gate task, which evaluates sustained attention,
      working memory and executive functioning. This tool has been used so far in chronic stroke
      patients, showing that, in this group, depression symptoms affect performance in this task.

      Similarly to chronic stroke patients, a diffuse harm of several cognitive domains in ARBD is
      observed. In the addiction psychiatry field, the gold standard to evaluate changes in
      cognitive function are still thorough neuropsychological test batteries. But performing
      thorough neuropsychological evaluations on all patients in daily clinical practice is highly
      resource consuming (need of expert neuropsychologists, time consuming). These last years
      scientific community has also been trying to find biomarkers of ARBD in electrophysiological
      tests, with no conclusive results.

      In this pilot study a small number of ARBD patients and healthy people will undergo a single
      30-minutes-long cognitive assessment session using the Validation Gate task to evaluate
      usability of this tool in Alcohol Use Disorder patients. Resting-state EEG of ARBD patients
      will also be recorded and compared to the ones of age-matched healthy controls in order to
      preliminary explore the existence of possible EEG biomarkers of ARBD.

    <description>The Validation Gate task, a visual attention task where the patient must detect discontinuities in the moving trajectory of circles on the screen. In this task the following variables will be registered: fast and slow eye saccades as well as conscious detections.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation tool of depression. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine are scored from 0-2. The summed score indicates severity (0-7 no depression, &gt; 23 very severe depression)</description>

    <measure>Resting State and task-dependent EEG</measure>
    <time_frame>40 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>6 minutes of EEG data during resting state and 30 minutes of EEG during the Validation Gate taks, will be acquired through the wireless sensor system ENOBIO32 of Starlab. From these recordings the mean spectral energy in the common frequency bands will be obtained as variables to identify signatures of TCD and the theta activity in the different groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The alcohol, smoking and substance involvement screening test (ASSIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The ASSIST scale is used to detect substance use and classify risk and severity for each substance. Each question (8 questions) on the ASSIST has a set of responses to choose from, and each response has a numerical score (for instance they can range from 0 for &quot;never&quot; to up to 8 for &quot;daily&quot;). The interviewer simply circles the numerical score that corresponds to the patient's response for each question/substance. At the end of the interview the scores for each substance are added together to produce an ASSIST score for that substance. Low numbers mean low risk, high numbers mean high risk. We are testing only for &quot;Alcohol-Risk&quot;, which can have a risk-score from 0 to 31.</description>

    <intervention_name>Validation Gate task</intervention_name>
    <description>The task is to observe several moving unfilled white circles on a dark background. The circles move in straight paths. Every so often, a randomly selected circle will displace to a point inconsistent with its trajectory, which will look like a &quot;jump&quot;. The subjects' task is to press the space bar every time they detect a displacement (e.g. jump). A session consists of 30 minutes, it starts with 2 training blocks which are followed by 2 no-cognitive load blocks and 6 blocks with increasing cognitive load conditions. During the assessment the eye movement as well as the key presses are registered in order to calculate early and late saccades as well as conscious reporting. Resting-state EEG will also be recorded and compared to the ones of age-matched healthy controls. Task-dependent EEG data will be recorded during the Validation Gate task.</description>
