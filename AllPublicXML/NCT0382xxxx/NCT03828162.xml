      This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of oral anticoagulants in elderly
      patients (&gt;=75 years) with atrial fibrillation. All patients discharged from one large
      hospital in Stockholm, Danderyds Hospital, between november 1st 2010 and december 31st 2017
      with atrial fibrillation as main diagnosis have been included (n=2943). Adverse events
      (cardiovascular death, fatal/non fatal ischemic stroke, peripheral thromboembolism, fatal/non
      fatal intracerebral hemorrhage and extracranial bleeding) are recorded through linkage to
      mandatory and qualitative national registries and review of the medical records until
      december 31 2018.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators established a prospective cohort of 2943 of elderly (&gt;=75 years old)
      discharged with atrial fibrillation as main diagnosis from November 1st 2010 to December 31st
      2017 from a large hospital in the Northern part of Stockholm in Sweden, Danderyds Hospital.
      Atrial fibrillation diagnosis is defined by the (ICD-10) codes: I48.0-I48.9 (atrial
      fibrillation and atrial flutter) according to the International Classification of Diseases,
      10th revision. The first admission to the hospital during the study period is recorded as the
      index admission.

      Clinical and anamnestic data, anthropometric measures, biochemical data, treatment at
      admission and at discharge have been recorded for each patient through the screening of
      medical journals.
