      This retrospective study will evaluate the patient collective of the Division of Oral Surgery
      and Orthodontics, Department of Dental Medicine and Oral Health and of the Division of
      Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery at the Medical University Graz concerning the frequency of
      epulis/giant cell lesion or underlying differential diagnoses and immunophenotypes as well as
      the resulting treatment methods and their success and compare these with international
      results

      Different histopathological differential diagnoses can underlay the clinical presentation of
      an epulis. Often the immunophenotype of these lesions is of particular importance. This also
      holds for the the central giant cell lesion.

      This study will evaluate the patient collective of the Division of Oral Surgery and
      Orthodontics, Department of Dental Medicine and Oral Health and of the Division of
      Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery at the Medical University Graz concerning the frequency of
      epulis/giant cell lesion or underlying differential diagnoses and immunophenotypes as well as
      the resulting treatment methods and their success and compare these with international
      results.

      This is a retrospective study using electronic patient records, written records, operative
      reports of the Division of Oral Surgery and Orthodontics, Department of Dental Medicine and
      Oral Health and of the Division of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery at the Medical University
      Graz in the period from 1986 to March 2018. It is intended to gather the data within 12
      months and analyze statistically subsequently.
