      Primary Objective

        1. Define the pharmacokinetics of liquid-formulated HU in infants (9 months to &lt;2 years)

        2. Assess the relative bioavailability of HU &quot;sprinkles&quot; compared to capsules in children
           and adolescents (≥2 to 18 years).

      Secondary Objective:

      Compare PK parameters in infants versus older children on this study and those from our
      previous &quot;Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability of a Liquid Formulation of Hydroxyurea in
      Pediatric Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia&quot; (NCT01506544) trial.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      Capture information regarding the taste of HU sprinkles using palatability questionnaire.

      This trial is an open label, single center assessment of the pharmacokinetics of two
      formulations of hydroxyurea (HU) designed to (1) determine the pharmacokinetic profile of a
      liquid formulation in infants and to (2) determine the bioavailability of &quot;sprinkles&quot;, a
      novel method of administration for older children. The study aims to generate data to
      facilitate FDA approval for HU in children and potentially validate a new mode of
      administration (&quot;sprinkles&quot;) that will optimize access and adherence for children in the US
      and globally.

      HOPE18 will be an open label, 2-arm study of HU disposition in 48 children with SCD. In Arm
      1, n=18 infants ages 9 months to 2 years will be administered an extemporaneous oral liquid
      formulation of HU on a single occasion followed by PK sampling. The dose administered will be
      ~20 mg/kg/day or the infant's usual daily dose. In Arm 2, n=30 children who range in age from
      2 to 18 years will be administered HU, both a sprinkle formulation and capsules (Droxia® 200
      mg), on two separate occasions separated by at least 1 day but no more than 30 days in a
      randomized, crossover fashion. The doses of HU on each occasion will be rounded to the
      nearest 200 mg and will not exceed 35 mg/kg or 2000 mg. We hypothesize that the PK profile of
      the sprinkle formulation will not differ significantly from the PK profile of Droxia®
      capsules in children and adolescents ages ≥2 - 18 years of age. Participants in both arms
      will be followed up to 30 days from receiving last HU dose.

             will interfere with the study procedures or affect the interpretation of the results
             of the study for 3 days prior to the first dose of study.

          -  Participants taking antiretroviral drugs (including didanosine and stavudine) due to
