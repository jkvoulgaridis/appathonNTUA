  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/1b open label, multicenter dose escalation and dose expansion study to
      investigate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of TPST-1120, a small molecule
      selective antagonist of PPARα (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) as
      monotherapy and in combination with a systemic anticancer agent, nivolumab, an anti-PD1
      antibody, in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      This is a phase 1/1b open label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity
      of TPST-1120, a small molecule selective antagonist of PPARα (peroxisome proliferator
      activated receptor alpha) in adult subjects with selected advanced solid tumors. TPST-1120
      will be administered as monotherapy and in combination with a systemic anticancer agent,
      nivolumab, an anti-PD1 antibody, in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This trial is
      composed of dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts.
