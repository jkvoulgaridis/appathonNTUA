    <textblock>
      This mechanistic study will be the first study to assess the efficacy of [18F]GE-226 to
      target HER2 expression in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The study will establish
      the pharmacokinetics of [18F]GE-226 and the optimum time-point for performing static scans in
      this patient population.

      Objectives

      Primary:

        -  To determine the uptake in tumour lesions and normal tissue of [18F]GE‐226 and compare
           the difference between patients with HER2 positive and HER2 negative lesions. Uptake
           will be quantified by semi‐quantitative (SUV, AUC) and fully quantitative parameters (Ki
           in the case of irreversible uptake, and binding potential in the case of reversible
           uptake)

        -  To determine the optimal imaging time point for [18F]GE‐226

      Secondary:

        -  To determine the safety and toxicity of [18F]GE‐226 PET in humans

        -  To determine if [18F]GE‐226 can distinguish between HER2 amplified and HER2
           non‐amplified breast tumours

        -  To determine the metabolism of [18F]GE‐226 in human subjects

      Exploratory:

      • To explore circulating biomarkers that may be related to [18F]GE‐226 uptake and to
      investigate if treatment modulates [18F]GE‐226

      Endpoints

      Secondary:

        -  Safety and toxicity of [18F]GE‐226 measured by adverse events from administration of
           [18F]GE‐226 injection throughout the study period, and clinically significant changes
           from baseline measurements in serum biochemistry, haematology, coagulation, immunology,
           urinalysis, vital signs, ECG, injection site and physical examination findings.

        -  The association between [18F]GE‐226 tumour uptake and standard HER2 pathological testing
           (HER2 amplified and HER2 non‐amplified breast tumours)

        -  Proportion of metabolised [18F]GE‐226 at scheduled time‐points compared to baseline

        -  Normal tissue uptake of [18F]GE‐226 will be quantified in the appropriate regions
           depending on the field of view.

      Exploratory:

      • To perform preliminary biodistribution analysis, to compare [18F]GE‐ 226 uptake to [18F]FDG
      uptake in tumour lesion

    <description>8 HER2 positive patients (determined using the most recent biopsy) will be recruited. Dynamic [18F]GE-226 PET imaging over 90 minutes, radial artery sampling will be performed to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of [18F]GE-226 and hence determine the optimal imaging time point for [18F]GE-226 PET scans. Tumour uptake in individual metastases (and the target lesion) will be reported. Uptake will be compared between HER2 positive and negative tumours.</description>

    <description>[18F]GE-226 is a radiolabelled Affibody® tracer which binds to the HER2 receptor with high affinity at a different epitope than trastuzumab. The active molecule is a 61 amino acid peptide that is modified site-specifically with one fluorobenzaldehyde molecule at the C-terminal.</description>
