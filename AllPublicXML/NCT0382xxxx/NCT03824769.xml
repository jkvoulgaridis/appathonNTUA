  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test two strategies for weight loss maintenance. It involves two phases, a
      weight loss phase and a maintenance phase. During Phase I (the weight loss phase),
      participants will receive a 16-week, Web-based behavioral weight loss program that involves
      access to weekly weight loss information and weekly personalized feedback on diet, activity,
      and weight loss goals. Individuals who lose at least 5% of their initial body weight during
      this program, will be invited to participate in Phase II. During Phase II, two 4-month
      treatments for weight loss maintenance will be tested. At the beginning of Phase II,
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two maintenance programs: (1) a
      behavioral maintenance program that involves in-person group meetings plus daily exercises in
      which information about a healthy lifestyle is reviewed or (2) a behavioral maintenance
      program that involves in-person group meetings plus daily exercises in which descriptions of
      positive future events are reviewed. Throughout the study, participants will complete
      assessments that examine the effects of the interventions on delay discounting, physical
      activity, weight, and other important health and psychosocial outcomes.
