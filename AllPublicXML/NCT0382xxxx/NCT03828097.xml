  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are examining how the daily consumption of a multi-vitamin/mineral
      supplement affects the following variables in 21-40 year old women:

        1. blood levels of various micronutrients (assessed from blood draws using mass
           spectrometry-based assays)

        2. blood cell gene expression patterns (assessed from blood draws and real-time PCR assays)

        3. mood (assessed via questionnaires) Blood and questionnaires will be collected prior to
           supplementation, and 12 weeks into supplementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the efficacy of a multi-vitamin/mineral/omega-3 complex on
      psychological and physiological measures in pre-menopausal women (21-40 years old) over a
      12-week period.

      This study will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled intervention. Briefly, subjects will
      be screened for inclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will then undergo a pre-testing battery
      (i.e., T1) and will then be randomly assigned to one of two groups including:

        1. Experimental group (anticipated n=50)

        2. Control group (anticipated n=50) Subjects will then consume 2 capsules per day for 12
           weeks and perform a post-testing battery (i.e., T2) that includes tests performed during
           the pre-testing battery.

      Main outcome (dependent) variables between treatments will include:

        1. blood levels of various micronutrients (assessed from blood draws using mass
           spectrometry-based assays)

        2. blood cell gene expression patterns (assessed from blood draws and real-time PCR assays)

        3. mood (assessed via questionnaires) Blood and questionnaires will be collected prior to
           supplementation, and 12 weeks into supplementation.

      Statistics used to assess differences between conditions over time will include two-way
      repeated measures ANOVAs. When significant group*time interactions are observed, the
      statistical model will be decomposed using LSD post hoc tests.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum concentrations of micronutrients</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood serum will be collected at PRE and POST-intervention and assessed for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25OHD), and folate as well as 6 associated metabolites [folic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MeTHF), 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-FoTHF), homocysteine (Hcy), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)]. Overall changes in these metabolites will be compared to pre-intervention values to determine if the experimental intervention was more effective at increasing one or multiple micronutrient levels in serum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Red blood cell omega-3 and omega-6 concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Red blood cells will be collected at PRE and POST-intervention and assayed for red blood cell omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content. Overall changes in these metabolites will be compared to pre-intervention values to determine if the experimental intervention was more effective at altering these fatty acid levels in red blood cells.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood red blood cell concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Whole blood will be collected at PRE and POST-intervention and assessed using a CBC test. The CBC test provides red concentration. Results from these tests will be compared to reference range values for apparently healthy female individuals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>White blood cell concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Whole blood will be collected at PRE and POST-intervention and assessed using a CBC test. The CBC test also provides white blood cell concentration. Results from these tests will be compared to reference range values for apparently healthy female individuals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum cholesterol concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Whole blood will be collected at PRE and POST-intervention, and serum will be extracted and assessed using a chem-20 test. The chem-20 test provides serum lipid concentrations (i.e., LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol). Results from these tests will be compared to reference range values for apparently healthy female individuals.</description>
