  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, long-term, single-arm, multicenter cohort study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of the Calistar S pelvic Floor repair system in women undergoing
      transvaginal POP repair.

    <textblock>
      Calistar S Single Incision Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) Repair System is a treatment kit for
      the surgical repair of anterior or combined anterior and apical prolapses in women. Calistar
      S is a transvaginal mesh for implantation between the anterior vaginal wall and the bladder
      wall to support the vesico-vaginal fascia. The treatment kit consists of the lightweight
      mesh, two single-use introducers and 3 tissue anchoring system (TAS) anchors for fixation to
      the sacrospinous ligament. The product is approved in accordance with the CE Directive
      93/42/EEC.

      The utilization of synthetic implants in POP repair became increasingly popular in the last
      decade. The cumulative success rate of synthetic implants in anterior compartment repair is
      as high as up to 93%.However, meshes have been recently scrutinized due to high adverse event
      reporting after unreflected utilization of meshes which raised concerns of patients safety;
      furthermore taking into account the complexity of adverse event mesh management. This led to
      a vanishing of various meshes in transvaginal POP repair. Nevertheless, the further
      development of light weight meshes, the experience of the surgeon and the assessment and
      patients selection are well known factors reducing the rate of adverse events significantly.

      Therefore, in the current trial the efficacy and safety of calistar S in a highly selected
      patient population will be evaluated.
