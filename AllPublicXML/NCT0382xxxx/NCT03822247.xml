  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the recovery protocol is to reduce surgical trauma, postoperative pain, and
      complications, shorten hospital treatment and improve postoperative recovery. Orthopedic and
      traumatology surgeries are often followed by a long-lasting recovery with difficulties of
      everyday functioning. Up to this time, only a few publications of multidisciplinary protocol
      in orthopedics and traumatology have been published, mostly to improve the care of patients
      after elective surgical procedures. The goal of multidisciplinary after surgery recovery
      program in orthopedics and traumatology is to improve the care of both urgent and elective
      patients using standardized, multi-professional care programs. It focuses on patient
      education, preoperative respiratory training, adequate nutritive and hemodynamic support,
      modified anesthesia protocol, prevention of postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and
      early postoperative delirium detection. The implementation of the program will reduce the
      rate of postoperative complications and the rate of rehospitalization, enhance the recovery
      after surgery and increase the satisfaction with the treatment.

      The protocol combines scientifically proven interventions to standardize medical care,
      improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The aim is to reduce surgical trauma
      and postoperative pain, reduce complications, shorten hospital treatment and improve
      postoperative recovery. Moreover, it has been shown that using standardized, patient oriented
      recovery protocol significantly improves the outcomes and quality of care, but also brings
      financial benefit for the hospital as well as for the health system in general. Studies about
      implementing multidisciplinary recovery protocol in orthopedic and traumatology are scarce.
      Orthopedic and traumatology surgeries are often followed by a long-lasting and demanding
      recovery characterized by the difficulties of everyday functioning. Recovery is therefore
      multidisciplinary: for example, it is necessary to monitor the nutritional status of a
      patient, decrease postoperative pain, monitor cognitive status, etc. Until now only a few
      publications of recovery protocols in orthopedics and traumatology have been published,
      mostly to improve the care of patients after elective surgical procedures. The goal of this
      protocol in orthopedics and traumatology is to improve the care of both urgent and elective
      patients using standardized, multi-professional care programs. It was created based on
      evidence-based practice and modified by multidisciplinary team of orthopedic and traumatology
      surgeons, anesthesiologists, physiatrist, physiotherapists, specialized medical nurses,
      nutritionists, and psychiatrists. It focuses on patient preoperative education, preoperative
      respiratory training, adequate nutritive and hemodynamic support, modified local and regional
      anesthesia protocol, prevention of postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and early
      postoperative delirium detection. The investigators postulate that the implementation of this
      program will reduce the rate of postoperative complications and the rate of
      rehospitalization, enhance the recovery after surgery and increase the satisfaction with the
      treatment.

    <measure>Patient-reported outcome after orthopedic surgery using The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days, 60 days after surgery, 90 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales (pain, stiffness and physical function). The questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4). The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. A sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a total WOMAC score; higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <measure>Pain assessment using Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day, 2 days, 60 days after surgery, 90 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity. It is a straight horizontal line of fixed length of 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of pain orientated from the left (worst) to the right (best). The score represents the distance measured (mm) between the worst and best mark, providing a range of scores between 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of health related quality of life using Euro Quality of Life Index (Euro QoL 5-D 5-L)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 days, 60 days after surgery, 90 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument Euro Quality of Life Index (Euro QoL 5-D 5-L) measures five dimensions, Mobility, Self-care, Daily activities, Pain/Discomfort, Anxiety/ Depression. Each dimension can be rated at five levels: from no problems to major problems. The five dimensions can be summed into a descriptive health state with 11111 representing no problems in any of the five health dimensions and 55555 indicating major problems in any of the five health dimensions. Second part of the instrument is the Visual Analogue Scale to assess health status at baseline, where 0 signifies worst imaginable health state, and 100 signifies best imaginable health state.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of patients' satisfaction with the care provided using The Short-form patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ-18)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Short-form patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ-18) contains 18 items tapping each of the seven dimension of satisfaction with medical care: general satisfaction, technical quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial aspects, time spent with the doctor and accessibility and convenience. All items are scored so that high scores reflect satisfaction with medical care and after item scoring, items within the same subscale should be averaged together to create the seven subscale scores.</description>
