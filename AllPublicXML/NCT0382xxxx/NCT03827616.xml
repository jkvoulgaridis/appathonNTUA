  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is one of the standard treatments for men with prostate cancer. Moderately
      hypofractionated radiotherapy has been established to be equivalent to standard fractionated
      radiotherapy in several large randomized clinical trials, however different hypofractionated
      regimens have been used in these studies. The two most common hypofractionated regimens are
      70 Gy in 28 fractions and 60 Gy in 20 fractions, both are considered standard of care,
      however it is not unknown which regimen is better in terms of effectiveness and toxicity. The
      aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to compare the two hypofractionated
      radiotherapy regimens using Helical Tomotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      Compare the biochemical relapse free survival (DFS) of patients with prostate cancer treated
      with hypofractionated regimens 70 Gy in 28 fractions and 60 Gy in 20 fractions
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using helical Tomotherapy.

      Secondary

      Compare time to local progression, freedom from biochemical recurrence, and disease-specific
      and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      Determine the incidence of gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxic effects in patients
      treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to TNM ( T1-3N0M0),
      Gleason score (6,7 (3+4), 7(4+3), 8). Before radiotherapy patients receive hormone therapy
      from 3 months to 6 months. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm 1 hypofractionated dosing 28 fractions x 2,5 Gy over 38 days (prostate 28 x 2,5Gy - 70Gy,
      seminal vesicles 28 x 2Gy - 56 Gy, node lympaticus ( if Rouch formula&gt; 15% or N1) 28 x 1,8 Gy
      - 50,4 Gy).

      Arm II hypofractionated dosing 20 fractions x 3 Gy over 26day (prostate 20 x 3Gy - 60Gy,
      seminal vesicles 20 x 2,5Gy - 50 Gy, node lympaticus ( if if Rouch formula&gt; 15% or N1 ) 20 x
      2,2 Gy - 44 Gy).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <description>Clinical criteria for local recurrence are progression (increase in palpable abnormality) at any time, failure of regression of the palpable tumor by 2 years, and redevelopment of a palpable abnormality after complete disappearance of previous abnormalities. Histologic criteria for local recurrence are presence of prostatic carcinoma upon biopsy and positive biopsy of the palpably normal prostate more than 2 years after the start of treatment. The arms were not statistically compared because of an insufficient number of events.</description>

    <description>The frequency of GU and GI adverse events as defined and graded according to the National Cancer Institute СTCAE v4 were compared between treatment arms. Acute toxicity was defined as any toxicity beginning within 90 days of completion of RT, and late toxicity was defined as any toxicity beginning more than 90 days after the completion of RT. Acute and late GU and GI toxicity rates were tabulated and reported in two ways: dichotomized as &lt; grade 2 vs ≥ grade 2, and dichotomized as &lt; grade 3 vs ≥ grade 3. Higher grade indicates more severity.</description>
