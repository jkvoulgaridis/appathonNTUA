      HER2-positive breast cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      This exploratory project is a prospective and multicenter study designed to evaluate the
      mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to Kadcyla in a cohort of 50
      progressive/recurrent HER2+ BC patients planned to be treated with Kadcyla within the
      approved indication in Spain.

      This study will collect high quality molecular data derived from the analysis of serial
      biological samples (primary tumor and/or metastatic tissue, plasma, serum and whole blood
      samples), together with annotated clinical follow up, to reach a better understanding of the
      biological events that drive breast cancer progression and response/resistance to Kadcyla in
      ABC patients.

             including tumor and blood sample collection and undergoing the standard medical
             practice visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria
             and according to the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC):

                  absence of brain metastases is not required. Patients with brain metastases may
                  be eligible for the study only if more than 4 weeks elapsed from treatment
                  completion for these metastases (including radiation and/or surgery) and are

                  injury within 28 days prior to study entry or anticipation of the need for major
                  surgery during the period of Kadcyla administration.

                  abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
                  Kadcyla administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
                  and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate
                  for entry into this study.
