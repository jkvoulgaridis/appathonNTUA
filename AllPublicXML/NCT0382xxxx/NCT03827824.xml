      Randomized intervention trial with a calculated sample size of 150 women aged between 18 and
      75 years and medical criteria for performing a diagnostic hysteroscopy according to the
      Gynecology and Obstetrics Spanish Society (SEGO).

      Nowadays the investigators known that acute pain requires cognitive attention for its
      perception, a patient's state of anxiety depends on the subjective capacity to cope with the
      process and that environments created with virtual reality can cause a cognitive distraction
      that diminishes the perception of pain as well as a subjective psychological illusion that
      diminishes the anxiety that motivates the procedure.

      For all the above, the investigators will study as a main objective the differences between
      the use of virtual reality through the use of virtual reality glasses &quot;Oculus go model&quot;, to
      reduce the perception of pain and anxiety motivated by the performance of a outpatient
      hysteroscopy versus clinical practice. It is usual not to use analgesia, using the VAS pain
      scale and the STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) questionnaire to assess the state of
      anxiety before and after the test. In addition, as secondary objectives, the investigators
      will compare different aspects such as surgical time used, determination of vital signs,
      satisfaction studies ...

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Cochrane review (included 32 clinical trials and 3304 patients) concluded that there was no
      effective and safe treatment for pain relief in patients undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy.
      In the same way, The Gynecology and Obstetrics Spanish Society (SEGO) discourages the routine
      use of analgesics prior to the test or the use of local anesthesia or sedation, since neither
      improves the pain nor the satisfaction of the patients in this type of test.

      Nowadays, is knowed that acute pain requires cognitive attention for its perception, a
      patient's state of anxiety depends on the subjective capacity to cope with the process and
      that environments created with virtual reality can cause a cognitive distraction that
      diminishes the perception of pain as well as a subjective psychological illusion that
      diminishes the anxiety that motivates the procedure.

      With all this, the investigators intend to assess through this study if patients with medical
      indication for diagnostic hysteroscopy can benefit from the use of Virtual Reality for the
      decrease in their perception of pain, anxiety or increase in the degree of satisfaction with
      their performance.

        1. - Design: Randomized intervention clinical trial

        2. - Sample: by contrast of hypothesis, a sample size of 150 women with an established
           medical indication for outpatient hysteroscopy was determined. They were randomized
           using excel software. As criteria of inclusion, those of SEGO with ages between 18 and
           75 years were used. Criteria of exclusion those of the test, presenting some type of
           illness or disability that contraindicate the use of Virtual Reality (blindness,
           deafness, epilepsy, etc), voluntary wish of no inclusion or inability to understand the
           study.

        3. - Methodology:

             -  parameters to analyze:

                  -  the average decrease in the perception of pain in both groups using the Visual
                     Analogue Scale (VAS) with determinations at the end, at 15 and 30 minutes.

                  -  the average decrease in the perception of the state of anxiety using the
                     State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire prior to the performance of
                     the test and after it.

                  -  Modifications in the degree of satisfaction with the test by means of a STAI
                     questionnaire included in the protocol of the Gynecology Service of El
                     Escorial University Hospital.

                  -  Changes in parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation
                     before, during and after hysteroscopy.

                  -  The influence of different circumstances such as age, parity, on the painful
                     perception, state of anxiety or degree of satisfaction in both arms of the
                     study.

             -  A 5 mm Bettocchi hysteroscope model will be used as a physiological serum
                distension medium and initial irrigation pressures of 75 mm Hg.

             -  Semi-rigid 5 Charr instruments (scissors, grasping forceps and biopsy).

             -  Oculus Go virtual reality glasses.

             -  The recruitment time will be that necessary to obtain the sample size.

             -  The patients will be given the STAI anxiety scale that will be completed prior to
                accessing the room. Once sitting on the examination table, a pulse oximeter will be
                placed on the left index finger, a cuff for measuring blood pressure on the right
                arm, and in the selected group virtual reality glasses, the first determination of
                blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation is made at this time and will be
                repeated when accessing the endometrial cavity and immediately after removing the
                hysteroscope. After completing the test, still sitting and removed the virtual
                reality components will be given VAS for pain determination during the test. After
                dressing, the pain will be assessed using VAS at 15 and 30 minutes after the end of
                the test. Before leaving, a new STAI anxiety state will be delivered that will
                complete as well as respond to the two questions of the satisfaction protocol.

    <description>Visual Analogue Scale: A measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured.This scale is between the values 0 to 10, being 0 the greatest pain possible and 10 the least pain. It is categorized into several sections, being intense pain 0-3, moderate pain 4-7 and low pain 8-10.</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline STAI scale at 30 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): A psychological inventory based on a 4-point Likert scale and consists of 40 questions on a self-report basis. The STAI measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic. Scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores correlating with greater anxiety. Each measure has a different rating scale. The 4-point scale for S-anxiety is as follows: 1.) not at all, 2.) somewhat, 3.) moderately so, 4.) very much so. The 4-point scale for T-anxiety is as follows: 1.) almost never, 2.) sometimes, 3.) often, 4.) almost always.</description>
