    <textblock>
      Our proposed study will focus on addressing the feasibility, safety and benefits of a 3-month
      exercise intervention among individuals diagnosed with melanoma.

      The study will be conducted at University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Eligible
      participants (n=24) will be randomized into 3 months of wellness education (n=12) or
      structured exercise (n=12).

      Our proposed study will focus on addressing the feasibility, safety and benefits of a 3-month
      exercise intervention among individuals diagnosed with melanoma.

      The study will be conducted at University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. The eligible
      participants will meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Inclusion criteria: (a) men and women (≥ 18 years of age) with melanoma cancer within one
      year from diagnosis, (b) not meeting the guidelines for physical activity (less than 150
      minutes of moderate intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity a week
      for 6 weeks prior the enrollment) (c) a commitment to two weekly supervised exercise sessions
      or bi-monthly educational sessions for three months at University of Miami Miller School of
      Medicine and (d) able to understand, read and write English.

      Exclusion criteria: (a) participants for whom physical activity is contraindicated because of
      comorbid conditions, (b) participants with dementia, altered mental status or psychiatric
      condition and (c) participants who are unwilling or unable to provide informed consent.

      The participants (n=24) will be randomized into 3 months of: 1) wellness education (n=12) or
      2) structured exercise (n=12). All participants will receive standard treatment as directed
      by their oncologists. Individuals in the wellness education group will attend bi-monthly
      sessions where they will receive general wellness information pertaining to physical
      activity, nutrition, sleep, weight management and mindfulness. Individuals in the structured
      exercise group will attend supervised exercise sessions twice per week and receive a tailored
      daily walking plan using physical activity trackers. A comprehensive assessment will be
      conducted at baseline and 3-months, which will include demographics, medical and treatment
      history, anthropometrics, quality of life, physical fitness, past and current sun exposure,
      fatigue, and nutritional status. We plan the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: To assess feasibility, adherence, and safety of a 3-month supervised exercise program
      in melanoma patients.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of a 3-month supervised exercise program on quality of life in
      melanoma patients.

      Aim 3: To evaluate the effect of a 3-month supervised exercise program on cardiorespiratory
      fitness and muscular strength in melanoma patients.

    <description>Subjects in the exercise group will participate in a 3-month exercise program at the University of Miami UHealth Fitness and Wellness Center. Participants will complete two exercise sessions a week, each 45-60 minutes long and on a one-on-one basis.
In addition to two site visits, the participants will receive a tailored daily home-based walking plan. The participants will use physical activity trackers (Fitbit®), with an ultimate goal of achieving 10,000 steps by the end of the intervention.
Participants in the exercise intervention will complete 24 sessions.</description>

    <description>For 3 months, the wellness education group will not be offered any form of supervised exercise program or receive any specific instructions on physical activity as part of the study. The participants in this group will attend educational sessions about different wellness topics, such as nutrition, sleep, weight management, mindfulness, and the overall benefits of increased physical activity. The wellness visits will be held two times per month, and similar to the exercise sessions of the intervention arm, they will be 45-60 minutes long and on a one-on-one basis. Participants in the wellness education group will complete 6 sessions.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Exercise Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Training sessions will include a split routine based on the day of the week.
Session 1 (e.g. Tuesday) - aerobic exercise (20-30 min) followed by resistance training (10 stacked-weight machines: leg press, leg extension, leg curl, chest press, latissimus pull, shoulder press, seated row, triceps press, biceps curl, and chest fly) for 1-2 sets of 8-12 repetitions.
Session 2 (e.g. Thursday) - resistance bands and body weight exercises (4-6 exercises, 2 sets of 10-20 repetitions) followed by core exercises (2-3 sets of 10-20 repetitions) and aerobic training (20-30 min) at the end.
The starting training intensities will be at 50-55% of each individual's estimated maximum heart rate for aerobic exercise and one-repetition maximum for resistance training (assessed at baseline only for chest press and leg press). We plan a 5% monthly increase in the intensity to reach 65-70%% of one's maximum efforts by the end of the intervention.</description>
