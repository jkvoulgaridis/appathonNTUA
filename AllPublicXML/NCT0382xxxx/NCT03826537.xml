  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Honey available in New Zeland can contain the toxins tutin and hyenanchin. Tutin is produced
      by several plants native to New Zealand. Bees collect honeydew contaminated with tutin and
      hyenanchin for honey production.

      Honey contaminated with high levels of tutin has caused cases of poisoning in New Zealand
      since the 1800s, with the most recent outbreak in 2008.

      The study aims to find out how tutin and hyenanchin are absorbed and processed by the body.
      This information will help the FSANZ give guidance on acceptable levels of tutin and
      hyenanchin in honey.

      About 6 healthy men will each take a single dose of honey containing known concentrations of
      tutin and hyenanchin.

      This dose level is similar to what someone who eats a lot of honey would have, if the honey
      contained the maximum level of tutin allowed under the Food Standards Code.

      Blood tests to measure tutin and hyenanchin levels will be taken at certain times after
      dosing, and any side effects will be recorded.
