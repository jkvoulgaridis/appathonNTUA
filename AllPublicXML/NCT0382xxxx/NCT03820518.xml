  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common form of heritable rickets. Current
      treatments include active vitamin D metabolites (e.g. calcitriol) and phosphate salts. There
      is no consistent weight-based dosing of calcitriol and phosphate now. The primary objective
      of this study is to establish the efficacy of different dose of calcitriol combined with
      neutral phosphate in children with XLH.
