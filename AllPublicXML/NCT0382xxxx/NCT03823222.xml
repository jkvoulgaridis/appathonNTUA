      This study aims to study the digestibility of isolated duckweed protein. The digestibility of
      the isolated duckweed protein will be compared to an isolated benchmark protein whey.

      Objective: The primary objective is to investigate the digestibility of isolated duckweed
      protein and the isolated benchmark protein whey.

      Study design: The study is a cross-over, double blind, controlled trial in which study
      participants will visit the research facility on two occasions under fasting conditions.
      Subjects will receive two protein sources in randomized order with a washout period of one
      week. Blood will be collected via a catheter before and up-to 3 hours after protein
      consumption.

      Study population: We aim to include 12 healthy volunteers aged 18-50 years. Intervention:
      Study participants will receive 20 grams of isolated duckweed protein and the isolated
      benchmark protein whey.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is blood amino acids measured
      before and after consumption of 20 g protein.
