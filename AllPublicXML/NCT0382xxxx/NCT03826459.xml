    <textblock>
      Cesarean section accounts for nearly 30% of births in Canada, and is the most commonly
      performed surgery by Obstetrician Gynecologists. Cesarean scar isthmocele, meaning a defect
      in the uterine wall at the site of a previous uterine incision, is a common complication of
      this surgery. While most are likely asymptomatic, isthmoceles can lead to major complications
      in pregnancy (uterine rupture, invasive placentation, cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy) and
      outside of pregnancy (abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility and pain). Studies have shown
      that the method used to suture the uterus at the time of a cesarean section may have an
      impact on the incidence of post-operative isthmocele formation. Our study is a randomized
      control trial of the impact of locked vs unlocked uterine closure at cesarean section on the
      incidence of isthmocele formation. Women undergoing cesarean section will be randomized to
      have either a locked or unlocked uterine closure. They will then return 6 months after their
      surgery for a transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate the presence or absence of an isthmocele.

      This study is a pilot trial. The investigators hope to determine the feasibility of
      completing a large randomized control trial by recording: a) the number of patient who agree
      to participate in this study, b) the number of patients who receive the correct intervention
      and, c) the number of patients who return for their post operative ultrasound.

      The investigators also plan to assess multiple secondary outcomes. First, the goal is to
      determine the isthmocele incidence within the study subjects of the pilot trial in order to
      perform a power calculation for a subsequent larger trial in this area. Another goal is to
      determine if the uterine closure techniques in this study lead to differences in surgical
      time, blood loss or the need for intra- or post-operative blood transfusion. Last, the study
      will collect data on the suture material most commonly used in this study to determine if
      this requires standardization in the subsequent larger trial.

    <textblock>
      Cesarean section accounts for nearly 30% of all deliveries in Canada, and is the most
      commonly performed surgery by Obstetrician Gynecologists (OBGYNs) in Canada. Therefore, it is
      important to understand the short and long-term complications of this procedure. Recently,
      emphasis has been placed on cesarean scar isthmocele as a long-term complication. An
      isthmocele is a defect at the cesarean section scar site with a depth of at least 1-2mm.
      Isthmoceles can lead to major obstetrical complications such as cesarean scar pregnancy,
      invasive placentation, and uterine rupture. More commonly, patients present with gynecologic
      symptoms: abnormal uterine bleeding, pain, and infertility. Up to 30-50% of patients with an
      isthmocele report symptoms when inquired. Isthmoceles have an incidence of 19-88% following
      cesarean section. This wide range is due to discrepancies in study technique, diagnostic
      criteria, and patient characteristics.

      While medical and surgical treatment options are available for cesarean scar isthmocele, our
      focus should turn to prevention at the time of cesarean section. Evidence suggests
      double-layer (vs. single-layer) uterine closure decreases the formation of cesarean scar
      isthmocele and increases residual myometrial thickness (RMT). Additionally, uterine closure
      with a locked suturing technique may result in greater isthmocele depth and size, and a
      thinner RMT at the cesarean scar site. To our knowledge however, no study has determined the
      impact of a locked vs. unlocked double-layer closure technique on isthmocele prevention.
      Locked sutures, believed to be more hemostatic, may cause tissue necrosis and impair wound
      healing. Interestingly, evidence does not support reductions in operative blood loss with
      locked closure techniques. The hypothesis is that unlocked double-layer uterine closure can
      reduce isthmocele formation and thus improve longterm maternal outcomes without impacting
      operative blood loss or other short-term surgical outcomes.
