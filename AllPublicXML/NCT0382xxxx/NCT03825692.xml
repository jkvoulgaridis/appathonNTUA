      This trial aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Zhizhu Kuanzhong Capsule in
      the treating patients with functional dyspepsia postprandial distress syndrome(FD PDS). Half
      of participants will receive Zhizhu Kuanzhong Capsule,while the other will receive a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders.
      Current data from clinical studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine can obviously
      relieve clinical symptoms of patients with FD, and has special advantages and good clinical
      application prospects in the treatment of FD. Zhizhu Kuanzhong Capsule is mainly composed of
      the following 4 kinds of Chinese herbs: Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephala, Fructus Aurantii
      Immaturus, Radix Bupleuri and Fructus Crataegi. This trial aims to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy and safety of Zhizhu Kuanzhong Capsule in the treating patients with functional
      dyspepsia postprandial distress syndrome(FD PDS). This is a multi-center, stratified-block
      randomized, double-blind and placebo parallel-controlled trial. The comparison between the
      investigational drug and the placebo will be conducted with superiority design. About 480
      subjects matched Rome IV diagnostic criteria for FD PDS will be enrolled. For each subject,
      this study includes a 0-2 week screening period, a 1-week run-in period, an 8-week
      double-blind treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. The drugs used in the clinical
      study (including investigational drug and placebo) will be supplied by Shuangren
      Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. of Lonch Group.The quality standards and test methods for the
      placebo are consistent with those for the investigational drug, and the quality test meets
      the proposed quality standards. The selection and evaluation bias are controlled by means of
      strictly implementing randomized control blinded method etc, and the investigator will be
      trained on the consistency of scale evaluation.The electronic case report form (hereinafter
      referred to as eCRF) of this trial is created using the Medical Clinical Trial Data
      Management System (eCDMS3.0) for online data acquisition and management via the Internet. The
      data in the eCRF are from the original documents such as the original medical records and the
      physicochemical examination report sheets and should be consistent with the original
      documents. The response rate for functional dyspepsia VAS score will be compared between the
      test group and control group at 8 weeks after randomization.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of the response at 8 weeks after randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with the functional dyspepsia-postprandial distress syndrome are self-rated on the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) which is a scale of 0-10, with subjects indicating the degree of discomfort on a 10 cm ruler marked 0- &quot;Asymptomatic or No Discomfort &quot;to 10- &quot;Extreme Severe or Extreme Discomfort &quot;at its head and tail, respectively. The record is made once a day and 7 days a week via a diary card. For VAS scores for postprandial fullness discomfort and early satiety, the integral average for both symptoms over the past week is evaluated, and a 50% decrease from baseline in the integral average at 8 Weeks is recorded as a response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of VAS score of each symptom of functional dyspepsia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>On the diary cards, subjects recorded the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) of each symptom of the functional dyspepsia daily. VAS is scored on a scale of 0-10 which the higher the score, the severer the symptom is. The record is made once a day and 7 days. The investigators use the average of the weekly VAS scores as the symptom intensity score for this week, with one VAS score per week. The change in the score of each symptom at 8 weeks after randomization relative to the baseline is evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall treatment response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The overall treatment efficacy is evaluated using a 7-point Likert Overall Evaluation Scale (OTE). The clinical investigators asked the subjects the following questions weekly: &quot;In the last week, how much have your dyspeptic symptoms been alleviated as compared to pre-treatment? &quot; There are 7 options: ① the symptoms improved significantly, ② the symptoms improved, ③ the symptoms improved slightly, ④ the symptoms did not change, ⑤ the symptoms aggravated slightly, ⑥ the symptoms aggravated, ⑦ the symptoms aggravated significantly. At the last visit time point of the treatment cycle, patients who selected ① and ② were defined as treatment responders, and those who selected ③—⑦ were defined as non-responders. The response rate at 8 weeks after randomization between the groups are compared for differences.</description>

    <measure>Short Form Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SFNDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form-Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SFNDI) is a reliable and valid measure of quality of life in functional dyspepsia with 10 items which questions are about how subjects stomach pain, discomfort, or other epigastric symptoms over the last 14 days affect their lives. Add up the ten items for each of the five sub‐scale scores (range of each sub‐scale 2-10). The changes of SFNDI score at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after randomization relative to the baseline are calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) is mainly used in patients in general hospitals which provides two sets of tests to assess the state of anxiety and depression, respectively. Among them, A stands for anxiety items, D stands for depression items, and each item is scored at four levels. Each of the two sets of items are superimposed to obtain their respective total score. A total score of 0 to 7 indicates normal, 8 to 10 indicates borderline abnormal, and 11 to 21 indicates abnormal. The changes of HAD score at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after randomization relative to the baseline are calculated.</description>
