  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is being conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the
      Bone Healing Accelerant (BHA) product when applied to tibia (leg bone) fractures with an
      external wound or skin break (also called open tibia fractures). It is hypothesized that by 6
      months, the number of subjects with successful bone healing will be greater in the
      BHA-treated group compared to subjects treated with standard of care alone. Open tibia
      fractures were chosen for this study because healing rates are typically longer than for
      other bone fractures due to the limited vascular supply, limited soft tissue coverage, and
      higher risk of infection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, subjects must meet all of the
        following criteria:

          1. Patient is between the ages of 18-75 inclusive at time of randomization.

          2. Patient has an acute open Gustilo-Anderson Type IIIA or IIIB fracture of the tibia
             shaft, with or without a fibula fracture, secondary to trauma.

          3. Patient received antibiotic treatment within 2 hours of presentation at initial
             medical facility.

          4. Patient underwent their first operative debridement within 24 hours of presentation at
             initial medical facility.

          5. Patient is scheduled to have DWC within 14 days of initial injury.

          6. The tibia fracture requires open fracture reduction and internal fixation with
             intramedullary (IM) nailing;

               -  IM nailing has been cross-locked for stability with a 4-5mm interlock, with a
                  minimum of 1 static screw above the fracture site and 1 static screw below the
                  fracture site, and

               -  All IM nails have a diameter between 8.5-12mm with 1.0-1.5mm over-reaming of the
                  canal.

             The temporary use of external fixation prior to IM rodding and DWC is allowed.

          7. Upon stabilization of the tibia fracture, the patient has a cortical deficit of less
             than or equal to 1.0cm involving no more than 50% of the tibia circumference. The
             cortical deficit of the residual 50% circumference must be less than 1.0cm. Gap
             assessments to be made with calibrated radiographs or visual inspection. In addition,
             patients are not likely to require a secondary procedure(s) to promote bone healing.

          8. BHA is able to be applied through existing soft tissue defects created by the injury
             or those created during surgical treatment. No new incisions should be required
             specifically for application of BHA.

          9. Patient is willing and able to comply with all study procedures including all
             pre-operative, post-operative and rehabilitation requirements.

         10. Patient is able to give voluntary IC to participate and has signed an IC form specific
             to this study prior to study treatment and DWC.

         11. Patients of childbearing potential must use adequate methods of contraception during
             the duration of follow-up (12-months). Adequate methods include abstinence, female and
             male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants,
             injectables, and double barrier methods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are currently participating in another investigational trial or having
             participated in a clinical investigation within the last 90 days or intend to during

             open tibial physes).

          5. Patients with Type I, II, or IIIC open tibia fractures according to the
             Gustilo-Anderson classification.

          6. Current injury is a pathological fracture.

          7. Patients with additional injuries that could impact their ability to complete the

                  of the investigator, the treatment and/or rehabilitation of such injuries will
                  substantially interfere with the treatment, rehabilitation or other requirements
                  outlined in this protocol,

               4. Concomitant ipsilateral or contralateral lower extremity injury/fracture(s) if,
                  in the opinion of the investigator, the treatment and/or rehabilitation of such
                  fracture(s) will substantially interfere with the treatment, rehabilitation or
                  other requirements outlined in this protocol.

               5. Sustained severe burns (&gt;10% total body surface area [TBSA] or &gt;5% TBSA with full

         10. Patients with any medical condition or life circumstances that in the surgeon's
             opinion could impact their ability to return for follow-up visits and/or complete the

             limited to the following:

                  facility unlikely,

               2. The patient has known alcohol or drug abuse within 3 months of screening to a
                  degree that makes it unlikely the patient will follow study requirements.

         13. Upon stabilization of the tibia fracture, the patient has a bone gap greater than
             1.0cm apparent by calibrated radiographs or by visual inspection and/or the patient is

             (e.g., bone stimulation or ultrasound treatment) for the index fracture.

         14. Patients who have mal-alignment post-IM nailing of &gt;10° in the coronal plane or &gt;15°
             in the sagittal plane.
