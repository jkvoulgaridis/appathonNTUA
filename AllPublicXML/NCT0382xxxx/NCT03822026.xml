  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated intracranial pressure is a dangerous and potentially fatal complication after
      traumatic brain injury. Hyperventilation is a medical intervention to reduce elevated
      intracranial pressure by inducing cerebral vasoconstriction, which might be associated to
      cerebral ischemia and hypoxia.

      The main hypothesis is that a moderate degree of hyperventilation is sufficient to reduce the
      intracranial pressure without inducing cerebral ischemia.

    <textblock>
      In patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and with intracranial
      pressure-monitoring, brain tissue oxygen tension and/or microdialysis probes
      hyperventilation-tests are performed in the acute phase after trauma. Data are collected and
      TCCD measurements are performed at baseline, at the beginning of moderate hyperventilation,
      after prolonged moderate hyperventilation (for 50 minutes) and after return to baseline.

      The present study aims to quantify potential adverse effects of moderate short-term
      hyperventilation during the acute phase of the severe TBI on cerebral hemodynamics,
      oxygenation, and metabolism.
