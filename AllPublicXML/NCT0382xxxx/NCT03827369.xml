  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to explore the relationship between coefficient of variation of harmonic
      magnitude (HCV) and different organ failures among those critically ill patients. In the
      future, we can act as a warning system on patients with multiple organ failures or terminal
      illness, also as an indicator of treatment effect.

    <description>We measure the blood pressure of participants with multiple organ failures (MOF) by pressure transducer during the 6 months study in the ICU of Taoyuan General Hospital. The radial artery pressure pulse of both hands are recorded with a pressure transducer fixed on the skin with tape and an adjustable belt with a small button to achieve suitable pressure.</description>

    <description>Pulse pressure of the radical artery was obtained by arterial line. The output of the transducer was connected to an IBM PC for analysis via an A/D converter with sampling rate = 250 datapoints/sec. The pulse spectrum was analyzed with the Fourier transformation using T (period) = 1 pulse time.</description>
