    <textblock>
      The &quot;Elosan Cabin&quot; is a closed, electrically insulated, biocompatible cabin for the
      short-term application of electrostatic high voltage in patients with chronic pain,
      especially those with rheumatic diseases. Patients assigned to the Elosan group (group A)
      will have 8 sessions in the Elosan cabin, with an interval of 3 to 4 days between sessions.
      Patients assigned to the control group (group B) will have no treatment except for the
      continuation of their prescribed pain medication and pain therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Included in the study can be all persons suffering from chronic pain, as it is often the case
      with rheumatic disease or traumata. The Elosan therapy to be investigated aims to treat
      chronic pain by applying an electrical charge to the body surface and by disruption of
      positive bio-feedback to restore physiological reflex relations between the periphery and the
      central regulation. The electric charge is created by a generator which can produce an
      electrostatic field. The electrical voltage is delivered to the hands via a metal handle in a
      closed cabin and is spread over the entire body surface.

      A total number of 42 patients will be included into this trial in order to show a
      statistically significant reduction of pain compared to reduction of pain in the control
      group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Pain Intensity is being assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Intensity of pain at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change of Pain Intensity is being assessed on a horizontal 100 mm VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) pain scale. The total range of this scale is 100 mm. Minimum score is 0 mm, Maximum score is 100 mm. The higher values represent a higher intensity of pain. The values at baseline will be compared to the values at Visit 8 and the mean of the differences will be compared between the 2 treatment arms.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life is being assessed by SF 12 Questionnaire (The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in quality of life (as reported by SF 12 questionnaires) from baseline to end of treatment (Day 28) will be compared between the treatment groups. The impact of the changes in summary scores (NBS: Norm-Based-Scoring) of physical health (PCS) and mental health (MCS) will be assessed by a General Linear Model (GLM) using the treatment as fixed factors and the baseline PCS and MCS as covariates, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Pain medication / pain therapy and any changes thereof shall be recorded during the study.</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after 4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The pain medication taken at baseline will be compared to the amount of pain medication taken at the end of treatment. Changes in pain medication will be qualified by the investigators as either being clinically relevant or not.</description>
