    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry-based study is to evaluate the ongoing, real-world clinical
      performance and safety of commercially available DyeVert Systems during typical clinical use
      for patients undergoing coronary or peripheral angiography for diagnostic and/or
      interventional procedures.

    <description>Osprey Medical DyeVert™ Contrast Reduction Systems (DyeVert Systems) provide fluid pathway resistance modulation such that excess contrast media (CM) (i.e. CM that is not needed for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes) is minimized in the patient's vasculature and total contrast media volume (CMV) reduction occurs, while maintaining adequate image quality.</description>

        DyeVert Systems are indicated for patients undergoing angiographic procedures requiring
        injection of contrast media. Patients at risk for developing contrast-induced nephropathy
        (CIN) represent the target population for these devices.
