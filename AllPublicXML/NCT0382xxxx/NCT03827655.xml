  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous TAK-954 for
      accelerating the recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function postsurgery in participants
      undergoing open or laparoscopic-assisted partial small- or large-bowel resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. In this study TAK-954 is being
      administered presurgery to evaluate if it can enhance the recovery of GI function postsurgery
      in participants undergoing open or laparoscopic-assisted partial small- or large-bowel
      resection. In addition, some participants will also receive TAK-954 postoperatively to
      evaluate if there is an additional benefit when this drug is administered both pre and
      post-surgery.

      The study will enroll approximately 375 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      in 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the five treatment arms- which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need).

      All participants will be given intravenous infusion preoperation and daily postoperation
      until return of upper and lower GI function or for up to 10 days.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Belgium, Germany, and
      Hungary. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 100 days. Participants will
      be treated with the study drug for up to 10 days after surgery or after return of GI function
      post-surgery (whichever occurs first).

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
