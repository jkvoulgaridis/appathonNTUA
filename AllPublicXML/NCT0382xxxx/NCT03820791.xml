  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of a poster containing information on
      dysphagia-specific food procedures at two levels: utility from the point of view of patients'
      caregivers, and impact on patients' health. Half the patients will have the poster placed in
      their room, whereas the other half will not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia is a swallowing disorder that can be associated with clinically relevant
      complications, and caregivers can play a fundamental role in this process, namely because
      they feed the patient. However, studies show a lack of professional-caregiver communication
      in dysphagia, and caregivers' need for more information. Communicating dysphagia-specific
      food procedures through a visual poster might bridge professional-caregiver communication
      gaps, with consequences for the patient's health.
