  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This three-arm clinical trial aims to improve levels of physical activity among Arabic-
      speaking residents of East Jerusalem with prediabetes. Levels of daily physical activity
      (assessed through activity trackers), dietary habits and self-assessed health will be
      compared between patients that receive only the activity tracker and written information
      (group A), receive the activity tracker, written information and a personalized physical
      activity prescription (group B), and those that receive in addition also intensive follow-up
      with motivational interview by physician assistants and a dietitian (group C)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm clinical trial studying the effect of providing activity trackers with
      intensive motivational interview by trained physician assistants, and dietitian counselling,
      on the levels of daily physical activity among Arabic- speaking residents of East Jerusalem
      with prediabetes from Clalit Health Services. In addition, this study will also assess
      healthy dietary changes, and self assessed health and quality of life.

      The study will compare three groups (total 375, each group 125):

      Group A - will receive activity trackers and written educational handouts in addition to
      their usual care.

      Group B - will receive all of group A intervention components and also a personalized
      physical activity prescription.

      Group C - will receive all of group B components and also intensive motivational interview
      support by trained physician assistants (3 sessions), and dietitian support (two sessions).

      Each participant will be followed-up for six months, with data collection occurring at
      baseline, three months and six months. Data collection will include average weekly steps,
      blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, routine blood tests (including fasting glucose,
      HbA1C, and lipid profile), physical activity survey, Mediterranean dietary habits survey,
      Food Frequency Questionnaire, and quality of life survey.
