      A Phase 3, 22-week, Multi-center, Randomized Withdrawal Study of ampreloxetine in Treating
      Symptomatic Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension in Subjects with Primary Autonomic Failure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 3, multi-center, randomized withdrawal study to evaluate the sustained benefit in
      efficacy and safety of ampreloxetine in subjects with primary autonomic failures (MSA, PD, or
      PAF) and snOH. The study consists of 3 periods: (i) 16-week open-label (OL) treatment with
      ampreloxetine, (ii) 6-week randomized placebo-controlled treatment, and (iii) 2-week
      follow-up (only for patients who do not enroll in Study 0171 (long-term extension safety
      study)).
