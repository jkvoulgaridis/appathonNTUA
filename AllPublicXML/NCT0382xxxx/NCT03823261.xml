  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has repeatedly been found to effectively treat depression
      in adult populations, and CBT for adherence and depression (CBT-AD) is an effective treatment
      for improving depressive symptoms and medication adherence in the context of various chronic
      health conditions, including HIV-infection. However, the effects of CBT have not been
      evaluated in South Korea. Even though HIV infection is currently a controllable disease for
      patients on successful antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV (PLWH) are still
      suffering from internal and external stigmatization in many Asian countries, including South
      Korea. It is not clear whether CBP-AD would be successful intervention among Asian countries
      with cultural background of strong stigmatization on HIV/AIDS. We plan to do survey on
      facilitators or barriers to patients and providers to identify significant contextual factors
      in South Korea. Demographic data and clinical data including CD4+ T cell counts, viral loads,
      and antiretroviral therapy regimens will be collected, as well.

      Specialists such as psychiatrist or clinical psychologist would be the best provider for CBT
      intervention. However, an effective and feasible therapy model should be integrated into
      primary HIV care in South Korea. Medical personnel within most HIV clinics in South Korea
      include infectious diseases doctors, clinical nurses, and counselling nurses, but CBT
      services from psychiatrist or clinical psychologist are not routinely available in many
      hospitals. Hospital-based counselling services with experienced nurses have been provided in
      many HIV clinics in South Korea, and the counselling nurses would be feasible providers for
      CBT intervention of this study. So, we plan to investigate the effects of a nurse-delivered
      cognitive behaviour therapy.

    <description>HIV(+) Koreans with depressive symptoms or poor adherence are our target population. This study is a hospital based implementation research. Most PLWH in South Korea regularly visit ID clinics in tertiary hospitals. The ID clinic of study site can reach the target population. In the clinic, the levels of adherence are routinely measured, and depressive symptoms will be asked with key questions We plan to enroll 50 subjects for CBT-AD intervention. In addition, 2 nurses who providing CBT service, and 6 health care workers will be enrolled for survey for providers and healthcare workers.</description>
