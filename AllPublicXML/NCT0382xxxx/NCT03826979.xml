      INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is one of the pathologies affecting women worldwide, with a high
      mortality rate of 14,206 per 100,000 women per year. However, Pilates was used as a
      therapeutic treatment for women who underwent a modified radical mastectomy, being associated
      with the alterations when in the postoperative sequels.

      OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the Pilates Method in the functionality of women submitted to modified
      radical mastectomy.

      METHOD: This is a quantitative clinical trial, in the form of women included in the project,
      to undergo a physical therapy rehabilitation program through the Pilates Method for 2 months,
      where they were evaluated before and after the procedure for measurement and comparison
      obtained.

      CONCLUSION: In this way, the pilates method is presented as an instrument used for the
      rehabilitation of mastectomized women.
