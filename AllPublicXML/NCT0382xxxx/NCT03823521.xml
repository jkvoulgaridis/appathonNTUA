  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, single group, observational study designed to evaluate
      the effects of a Cardioplexol™ preparation and administration training program proposed to
      cardiac surgeons and cardiotechnicians inexperienced in the use of Cardioplexol™.

      The training program aims at increasing the efficacy of Cardioplexol administration while
      reducing the risk of false manipulations. During the training possible risks and consequences
      of incorrect applications as well as the measures to take in case of administration error,
      are discussed. The training program includes one standardized theoretical part and one
      practical part consisting of a direct intra-operative coaching of surgeons practicing their
      first 2 operations.

      The effect of the training will then be assessed by evaluating each trained surgeon's 4 next
      consecutive patients operated with Cardioplexol and without the coach.
