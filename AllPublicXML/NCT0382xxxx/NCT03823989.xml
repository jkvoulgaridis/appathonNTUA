  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, open-label, single-arm, prospective study, in which up to 18
      adult patients requiring radiotherapy for metastatic disease or for an inoperable primary
      tumor with no definitive curative treatment option,, will undergo a combination treatment of
      intravenously (IV) delivered PROMITIL and standard of care radiotherapy. The treatment
      regimen will involve administration of two PROMITIL doses, delivered at a 21-day interval,
      and a 30 Gy course of EBR delivered in 10 fractions (3 Gy/fraction), initiated 1-3 days after
      the first PROMITIL dose and completed within a 2-week period. Treatment safety will be
      assessed on a weekly basis throughout the two 21-day treatment courses (42 days) and
      throughout the follow-up period (up to Day 127). AEs will only be logged until 6 weeks after
      the last PROMITIL dose (up until Day 64). Disease status will be reevaluated between days
      43-50 of the study, and every 6 weeks thereafter (Days 85 and 127±7 days). In addition,
      following completion of the treatment schedule, all patients will be followed up by phone
      every 12 weeks, until either death, disease progression (PD), withdrawn consent or trial
      cut-off date, i.e., for up to 2 years after patient accrual to study, (whichever occurs
      first). No other anticancer treatments will be allowed during the 6-week treatment period and
      until disease reevaluation.

      As combination with radiotherapy is expected to provide an additive or synergistic effect,
      the current dose-escalation study will begin with a dose of 1.25 mg/kg, which will be
      escalated to 1.5 mg/kg PROMITIL in the absence of DLTs after two treatment cycles, with an
      interluding 10-fraction course of radiotherapy.

      PROMITIL will be intravenously delivered on Day 1 of each of the two 21-day cycles.

      Cohort 1: The first 6 patients recruited to the study will receive 1.25 mg/kg PROMITIL.

      Cohort 2: If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are recorded by day 43 of the study, the
      second cohort of 6 patients will begin treatment at a dose level of 1.5 mg/kg PROMITIL.
      However, if 1 DLT is recorded, the second cohort of 6 patients will receive the same dose of
      1.25 mg/kg PROMITIL. If 2 DLTs are recorded in Cohort 1, the second cohort of 6 patients will
      receive 1.0 mg/kg PROMITIL.

      Cohort 3: Upon completion of two treatment cycles, with ≤1 incident of DLTs in Cohort 2, a
      third confirmatory cohort (n=6) will be recruited and will be treated with the same dose as
      that administered to Cohort 2. If 2 DLTs are recorded in Cohort 2 or 3, the study will be
      terminated
