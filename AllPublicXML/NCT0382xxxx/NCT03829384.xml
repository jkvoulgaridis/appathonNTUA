  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, FIH, single-center, randomized, placebo controlled, dose escalation study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of a single dose of mRNA 1944 in healthy
      adult subjects. Cohorts of mRNA-1944 are planned to be investigated in a sequential dose
      escalation manner.
