  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is an essential molecule in the body that is decreased in patients with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to reductions in vascular, movement (&quot;motor&quot;) and
      cognitive functions. This study will determine if daily oral supplementation (3 months) with
      a supplement that increases NO in the body, i.e., nitrate-rich beetroot juice, improves
      vascular, motor and cognitive function in patients with CKD; this study will also provide
      insight into the biological reasons (mechanisms) by which supplementation with nitrate-rich
      beetroot juice improves vascular function in these patients. Overall, this research will
      provide scientific evidence supporting the use of nitrate-rich beetroot juice for preserving
      physiological function and preventing co-morbid clinical conditions and disability in CKD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CKD stage II-IV (eGFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
             prediction equation 20-90 mL/min/1.73m2; stable renal function in the past 3 months)

          -  Ability to give informed consent

          -  Albumin &gt; 3.0 g/dL

          -  Ability to perform motor and cognitive tests (e.g., can rise from a chair, walk for 6
             min, climb 10 stairs)

          -  Not taking medications that will interfere with administered medications (e.g.,
             sildenafil interacts with nitroglycerin)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &lt;40 kg/m2 (vascular function measurements can be inaccurate in

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy &lt;1 year

          -  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or blood methemoglobin &gt;2%

          -  Unwilling to abstain from use of mouthwash or other oral hygiene practices (e.g.,
             tongue scraping) outside of teeth brushing that disrupt the oral microbiome and would
             interfere with nitrate conversion to nitrite

          -  Blood donation within 8 weeks prior to enrolling in the study; unwilling to abstain
             from donating blood for 8 weeks after completing the study
