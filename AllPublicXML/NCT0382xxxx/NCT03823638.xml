  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes disabling motor
      and cognitive impairments. Currently, no disease-modifying therapy exists for this disease.
      Mannitol, a naturally-occurring substance, which is commonly used as sweetener, was offered
      as such agent. In this phase II, safety, tolerability-based dose finding, and efficacy study,
      mannitol or placebo (dextrose) in escalating doses will be given to patients with Parkinson's
      disease for 36 weeks.
