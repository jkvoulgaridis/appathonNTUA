      This study compares early and long-term results of the endovascular treatment among patients
      with different types of aorto-iliac occlusions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular treatment has been increasingly applied as a therapeutic option for aorto-iliac
      occlusive disease during the last decade, becoming the first-line treatment for many of the
      Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus document II (TASC II) categories. TASC II document in
      2007 stated endovascular treatment as the method of choice up to type B occlusions and
      surgery for low-risk patients with type C and D occlusions, emphasizing that the patient's
      comorbidities as well as the operator's long-term success rates should be included in the
      decision-making process.

      Revision of TASC II document in 2015 is suggesting that the preferred revascularization
      method should be based on each vascular center's competence and experience with the anatomic
      complexity, considering patient comorbidity and overall prognosis, supporting the
      endovascular-first approach in all 4 different kinds of lesions in highly experienced
      centers.

      These changes over time are based on expert opinions derived from smaller studies from high
      volume centers, and that they reflect both the widespread gain of endovascular experience and
      technical developments over the last 2 decades, leading to a rising number of centers
      providing an endovascular-first approach even in complex TASC C and D occlusions.

      Rationale for offering endovascular-first option to patient with complex lesion would be low
      risk of complication and long-term patency.

      Our intention is to compare early and long-term results of the endovascular treatment among
      patients with different types of aorto-iliac occlusions in two Serbian vascular centres.

    <description>Stenting of the Common and/or External Iliac Arteries was performed in the angiographic suite. Under local anesthesia, arterial access was obtained through standard percutaneous puncture of the common femoral artery, brachial approach, or simultaneous brachial and femoral approach.
Iliac lesion crossing was achieved through intraluminal or subintimal manner depending on the behavior of the lesion intraoperatively.
Predilatation of the occlusion before stent deployment was performed at the discretion of the operator.
Balloon-expandable stents were used for proximal, ostial lesions, whereas self-expanding stents were deployed in all other lesions.
Both stents were used in long lesions involving heavily calcified common iliac arteries.</description>
