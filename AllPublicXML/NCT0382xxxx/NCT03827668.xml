    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase I, open label, fixed sequence study. The study will consist of 2 periods in a single fixed sequence. In Period 1, participants will receive PF-06650833 once daily on Days 1-5 and PF-06650833 PK will be assessed for 24 hours following Day 5 dosing. Participants will be discharged on Day 6 after completion of study related activities. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between last dosing in Period 1 and first dosing in Period 2. In Period 2, participants will receive PF-06651600 once daily alone on Days 1-7, and PF-06651600 once daily together with PF-06650833 once daily on Days 8-12. PF-06651600 PK will be assessed for 24 hours following Day 7 dosing, while PK for both PF-06651600 and PF-06650833 will be assessed for 24 hours following Day 12 dosing. Across both periods few additional pre-dose (trough) PK samples will be collected. Participants will remain in the unit up to Day 13 when they will be discharged after completion of study related activities.</intervention_model_description>
