    <textblock>
      Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer death in Western
      Countries. Approximately 85% of lung cancers are of the non-small-cell type (NSCLC), with
      25-30% of NSCLC being squamous histology type. Unlike nonsquamous NSCLC, squamous NSCLC
      rarely harbors epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
      mutations for which there are directed therapies, and until the recent approval of
      immunotherapies for pretreated squamous NSCLC, a limited number of traditional cytotoxic
      chemotherapy drugs have been FDA-approved for use in the treatment of advanced and metastatic
      squamous NSCLC. A platinum-based combination chemotherapy regimen has been the standard
      first-line treatment for all NSCLC. Carboplatin is frequently substituted for cisplatin for
      patients who have poor renal function or who experience toxicities from cisplatin (most
      notably, nausea and vomiting). Taxanes, especially paclitaxel, or vinorelbine or gemcitabine,
      commonly complete the standard two-drug backbone of platinum-based chemotherapy for the
      first-line treatment of NSCLC, with platin-gemcitabine as the most commonly used regimen in
      Europe in patients with squamous-histology. A recent press release announced that
      pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy produced higher response rate when compared to chemotherapy
      alone in patients with squamous-cell lung cancer. Nevertheless, no data on Progression-Free
      Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) are available. Therefore, considering the lack of
      data in patients with squamous histology and the lack of information about efficacy of
      combinations of immune-checkpoints inhibitors versus immune-checkpoint inhibitor plus
      chemotherapy, there is a strong rationale for conducting a study assessing efficacy of such
      strategies in patients with advanced, metastatic squamous-cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Better understanding of the role of the immunological system in tumor control has opened
      multiple doors to implement different strategies to enhance immune response against cancer
      cells. It is known that tumor cells elude immune response by several mechanisms. The
      development of monoclonal antibodies against the checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death
      protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), on T cells, has led to high activity in cancer
      patients with long lasting responses. In the KEYNOTE 024 the anti-PD-1 inhibitor
      Pembrolizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC and high PD-L1 level (&gt;50% of tumor cells) compared to
      platinum based chemotherapy, thus becoming a new standard of care in front line setting.
      However, the trial was not restricted to squamous population, with approximately 18% per arm
      having this histology. Nivolumab, another PD-1 inhibitor, has been recently approved for the
      treatment of squamous cell lung cancer patients, given the survival advantage demonstrated in
      a phase III trial comparing the drug to docetaxel, in second-line setting. Importantly, the
      benefit produced by the drug was irrespective of PD-L1 expression suggesting that the high
      mutation burden of squamous-cell lung carcinoma is more relevant than the expression of a
      single biomarker, at least in pretreated individuals. In addition, recent studies in chemo
      naive patients with non-squamous histology demonstrated that combination of chemotherapy and
      immunotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone in terms of Overall Survival irrespective of
      PD-L1 expression (Keynote 189 and IMPOWER 150). In addition, the CheckMate 227 study recently
      showed that, in chemonaive NSCLC, combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab was superior to
      chemotherapy alone in patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), irrespective of PD-L1
      expression. A recent press release announced that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy produced
      higher response rate when compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with squamous-cell lung
      cancer (Keynote 407). Nevertheless, no data on Progression-Free Survival and Overall Survival
      are available. Therefore, considering the lack of data in patients with squamous histology
      and the lack of information about efficacy of combinations of immune-checkpoints inhibitors
      versus immune-checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy, there is a strong rationale for
      conducting a study assessing efficacy of such strategies in patients with advanced,
      metastatic squamous-cell lung cancer.
