  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential improvement of sleep quality in children
      who have residual obstructive sleep apnea, using either an orthodontic intervention or
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), versus no treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consenting patients and their parents will choose one of three options (within the context of
      medical/craniofacial appropriateness): CPAP, orthodontic intervention, or to remain untreated
      (control). It would be ideal if each patient was randomly assigned to one of three groups.
      However, in our study, random allocation is not an option as the established clinical
      pathways for treatment, financial resources, and physiological presentation of the patient
      determines the appropriate intervention. In each group, the effectiveness of the intervention
      will be analyzed through the evaluation of sleep parameters, medical history, questionnaire
      responses, craniofacial characteristics, diet, and metabolomic markers, each at baseline and
      at 12 months.

    <description>This group consists of consenting patients and their parents who choose Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). The CPAP is a type of therapy that applies mild air pressure to a person's upper airway to keep their airway open so that they can breathe normally while they sleep.</description>

    <description>This group consists of consenting patients and their parents who choose orthodontic intervention will be seen by participating orthodontists who will determine types of orthodontic intervention; mandibular advancement devices or rapid maxillary expansion devices. In this group, the patients will also receive a biometric shirt to use once every two weeks, to monitor their sleep during the study.</description>
