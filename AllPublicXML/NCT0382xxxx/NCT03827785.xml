  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was used to treat methamphetamine (MA)
      addiction in previous studies, while the evidence-based protocols still required. The aim of
      this research is to evaluating the effectiveness and safety of rTMS treatment in improving
      the days of abstinence maintenance. In addition, treatment effect on cognitive impairment,
      psychological craving and depression are also evaluated during the study.

      First, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized control study is going to be carried out. 100
      recruited patients will be randomized assigned to the intervention group and the control
      group, receiving either 4-week of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      treatment or 4-week of sham rTMS treatment. Both groups will receive 12-week urine drug test
      follow-up (1 time per week). Negative rate of urine test during the follow-up period is set
      as primary outcome. Cognitive function, craving, depression are also evaluated before and
      after the intervention.

      Secondly, another 40 patients will be recruited from these 100 patients (20 subjects each
      group). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) test is applied to investigate the potential
      neurobiological mechanism of rTMS treatment. This study will be very helpful to develop an
      evidence-based rTMS treatment protocols for MA dependent patients and decrease risk of
      relapse for both the patients and their families.

    <measure>Depression status assessed by Hamilton depression scale (HAMD-17)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate all participants' depression status by Hamilton depression scale (HAMD-17) HAMD can be summarized into 7 types of factor structure: (1) anxiety/somatization:; (2) weight: weight loss (3) Cognitive obstacles; (4) day and night changes; (5) Block; (6) sleep disorder; (7) feeling of despair. The total score can reflect the severity of the symptom, that is, The lighter the symptoms, the lower the score, and vice versa. Mild depression: HAMD 17 scores &gt; 7 points, ≤ 17 points; moderate depression: HAMD 17 scores &gt; 17 points, ≤ 24 points; severe depression: HAMD 17 scores &gt; 24 points.</description>
