  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a disease characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the
      uterus cavity, causing important chronic pain and sterility in those patients suffering from
      it. It affects from 10 to 20% of women at reproductive age. Different types of endometriosis,
      which can coexist in the same patient, exist: deep infiltrating endometriosis (implants
      infiltrate &gt; 5 mm the peritoneum), superficial endometriosis and ovarian endometriosis (OMA).
      OMA sometimes require surgery, and it is known that healthy ovarian tissue is also injured
      during resection. Consequently, ovarian reserve decreases, worsening the reproductive
      prognosis of patients affected. The main objective of the present study is to compare laser
      versus conventional OMA excision according to ovarian reserve in a pairwise-data study.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized prospective pairwise-data study. Patients with bilateral endometrioma with surgical indication will be selected. Ovarian reserve will be evaluated before and after surgery in both ovaries separately, using antral follicle count (AFC) and volume measurement. Type of surgery in each ovary will be randomized in the operating room (standard cystectomy vs laser vaporisation). A blinded ultrasonographer will evaluate AFC and volume measurement in both ovaries, before and three and six months after surgery. Therefore, each ovary will be compared with its contralateral in the same patient.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The ultrasonographer will be blinded to the procedure performed in each ovary after surgery. The patient will not be told which procedure has been performed in each ovary. The investigator will not know which procedure has been performed in each ovary until the end of the study. Only the surgeon will know which procedure is performed in each ovary.</masking_description>
