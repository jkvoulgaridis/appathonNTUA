  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) and radiculopathic pain are a major socio-economic problem affecting all
      age groups. 70% of people consult a doctor at least once in their life due to LBP. Radicular
      pain is thought to be caused by inflammation of the spinal nerve roots near the
      intervertebral disc injury. In this context, fluoroscopic guided transforaminal epidural
      steroid injection (TFESI) has been increasingly preferred in patients who can not benefit
      from conservative approach in the treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathic pain due to lumbar
      disc herniation in recent years.

      The assessment of comorbid psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, and
      somatization disorder and given the detailed and visual information to patients who will be
      undergone TFESI could affect the result of the treatment in a good way. The pain
      questionnaire used for objectively evaluating injection outcomes is personality dependent and
      there are many factors that can affect it.

      Although information leaflets given to patients prior to surgical or non-surgical
      interventions have not yet been used as a standard in each clinic, the effects on patients
      have been frequently researched in recently. A detailed description of the treatment, the
      devices to be used and the disclosure of the steps of the procedure may have an effect on the
      result of the treatment. The aim of the study; (1) the presence of comorbid psychiatric
      conditions in patients with lumbar disc hernia and radiculopathy, (2) to evaluate the effect
      of the written and visual informative form given before the injection of the lumbosacral
      TFESI.

    <masking_description>The study was designed as prospective, single blinded, randomized controlled study. Patients were randomized into two groups.

    <description>The oswestry disability index is a survey designed to investigate how lumbar and leg pain affects their daily lives. It consists of 10 questions investigating the general life activity of the patient. The patient receives at least 0 points and at most 5 points from each question. The higher scores indicate that increased disability.</description>
