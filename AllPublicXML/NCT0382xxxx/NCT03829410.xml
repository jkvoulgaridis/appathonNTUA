    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 1b/2 study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Onvansertib,
      administered orally, daily, for 5 consecutive days on Day 1-5 of each 14-day course in each
      28-day cycle, in combination with FOLFIRI + Avastin, as second-line treatment in adult
      patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer with a Kras mutation. Participants must have
      histologically confirmed metastatic and unresectable disease, and previously failed treatment
      or be intolerant to fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab.

        hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL. Even women who are using oral, implanted or injectable
        contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as an IUD or barrier methods (diaphragm,
