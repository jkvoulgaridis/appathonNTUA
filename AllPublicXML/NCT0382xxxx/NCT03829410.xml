      The purpose of the Phase 1b/2 study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Onvansertib,
      administered orally, daily, for 5 consecutive days on Day 1-5 of each 14-day course in each
      28-day cycle, in combination with FOLFIRI + Avastin, as second-line treatment in adult
      patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer with a Kras mutation. Participants must have
      histologically confirmed metastatic and unresectable disease, and previously failed treatment
      or be intolerant to fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab.

        women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with documented serum follicle stimulating
        hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL. Even women who are using oral, implanted or injectable
        contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as an IUD or barrier methods (diaphragm,
        condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is

             randomization.

          3. More than one prior chemotherapy regimen administered in the metastatic setting.

          4. Major surgery within 6 weeks prior to randomization.
