  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial conducted at two different centers at
      the Department of ORL - Head &amp; Neck Surgery, Odense University Hospital and the Department of
      Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery &amp; Audiology, Rigshospitalet.

      The research question is:

      In a group of patients referred to an otolaryngology department with objective findings of
      peritonsillar abscess, what are the effects of using intraoral ultrasound to diagnose and
      guide needle aspiration compared to the traditional landmark-based technique, when measured
      by the number of performed needle aspirations, procedure-related pain and days on sick leave?

      The secondary outcomes measured are

        -  Number of hospitalization days

        -  Number of Quincy tonsillectomies

        -  Number of visits to an outpatient clinic

        -  Patient-reported outcome (measured using an 11-point numeric rating scale)
