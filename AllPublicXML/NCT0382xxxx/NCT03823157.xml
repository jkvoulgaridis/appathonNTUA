    <textblock>
      The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is widely found in central and peripheral systems, and the
      immune system. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise has shown to increase circulatory
      endocannabinoids. In this study, we will study Tai Chi, a mind-body moderate-intensity
      exercise, intervention for its effects on ECS in women. A pre-post design trial will be
      conducted on 18 qualified subjects. We will measure plasma eCB levels at baseline, before and
      after 4th session of Tai Chi. All data will be analyzed statistically at p&lt;0.05.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is widely found in central and peripheral systems, and the
      immune system. Emerging studies have shown endocannabinoid plays a role in appetite, pain
      sensation, control of chronic pain, macronutrient metabolism, mood/mood disorder, and
      regulation of immune cell functions. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise has shown to
      increase circulatory endocannabinoids. Moderate-intensity exercise improves cognition,
      memory, and wellbeing in adults. Exercisers experience decreased tension, depression, and
      anger. Therefore, these findings in humans suggest a likely relationship for exercise
      effecting well-being via ECS. In this study, we will study Tai Chi, a mind-body
      moderate-intensity exercise, intervention for its effects on ECS in women. A pre-post design
      trial will be conducted on 15 qualified subjects. All subjects will be assigned to Tai Chi
      group for one week including 3 sessions, 60 minutes per session, on 3 non-consecutive days.
      We will measure plasma eCB levels at baseline, before and after 4th session of Tai Chi. All
      data will be analyzed statistically at p&lt;0.05.
