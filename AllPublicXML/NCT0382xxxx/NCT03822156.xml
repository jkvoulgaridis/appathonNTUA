      This study is a retrospective cohort study. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      clinical features of the patients with the cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and
      endobronchial TB from the patients who have been registered in this hospital for treatment
      and follow-up, as part of the &quot;PPM Project (Private-Public Mix project) for Korean National
      Tuberculosis Control&quot; introduced in Korea since 2007.

    <textblock>
      Cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is known to remain its Infectivity for a longer period
      of time than the non-cavitary pulmonary TB, which is usually almost inactivated its
      infectivity within two weeks after the administration of the anti - TB drugs.

      However, there are few studies on this, so it is not known how long the infectivity persists,
      whether there is a correlation with the number of cavities or the size of the cavities
      between persistence of infectivity.

      Meanwhile, endobronchial TB is known also to be highly infectious, unlike simple pulmonary
      TB.

      It is not known how long infectivity can persist after the administration of anti-TB
      medication, and whether there is any difference in persistence of infectivity regarding the
      clinical characteristics of endobronchial TB.

      In this study, investigators will analyze the retrospective data analysis of UUH-PPM Cohort,
      a cohort of PPM project patients in the Ulsan University Hospital (UUH).

      The PPM project is a &quot;Private-Public Mix project&quot; for the eradication of tuberculosis from
      Korea, which the Korean government and private medical institutions have been conducting
      since 2007.
