  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, randomized, concurrently controlled, noninferiority clinical
      trial to compare the safety and effectiveness of instrumented Bio2 Vitrium Cervical Interbody
      Device in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with structural allograft bone and
      local autologous bone graft in treating patients with a symptomatic degenerative cervical
      disc disease at one level from C3/C4 to C7/T1.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate if Bio2 Vitrium® Cervical Interbody Device (VCIBD) is non-inferior to
      allograft cage in single-level ACDF with the use of local autologous bone. VCIBD is a
      restorable cervical interbody cage for the treatment of fusion, following discectomy, of the
      cervical spine from C3/C4 disc space to the C7/T1 disc space. The material used to
      manufacture the implant is 13-93 bioactive glass, which is a silicate-based material as
      described in ASTM F1538-03(R2017). The implant has high porosity and strength and does not
      contain any biological material or constitute a combination product. The device has a central
      lumen for packing with autograft. VCIBD is intended to be used with a supplemental fixation
      system.

      The device, when placed between the vertebrae, provides mechanical stability and prevents
      subsidence prior to bone ingrowth. It restores and maintains the intervertebral space during
      the fusion process. The porosity and material characteristics provide an osteoconductive
      matrix that supports bone ingrowth. Additional stabilization is provided by supplemental
      fixation using anterior cervical plate. The implant incorporates a central lumen, which
      allows for the cage to be packed with autogenous bone graft.

Maintenance or improvement of the neurological status;
Worsening of the neurological status.
Worsening of the neurological status is defined as permanent new neurologic damage or permanent new nerve root injury related to the surgically treated level, defined as one or more:
Permanent decrease in one or more grades of motor strength compared to baseline;

    <time_frame>6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 Health Survey is a 36-item instrument for measuring health status and outcomes. It yields an eight-scale profile score from the following eight health concepts: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and general mental health (psychological distress and psychological well being). In addition, two composites scores are constructed using factorial modeling, one from physical health composite score (PCS) and one for mental health composite score (MCS).</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcomes. It contains questions in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and provides a simple descriptive profile and single index for health status preference. In addition, there is a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is the participant's rating of their health on a scale of 0 &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot; to 100 &quot;best imaginable health state&quot;.</description>

There are 5 choices from &quot;Definitely&quot; to &quot;Definitely Not&quot;.</description>
