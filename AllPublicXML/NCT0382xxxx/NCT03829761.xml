  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the effects of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on self-reported negative affect, cerebellar brain activation and
      alcohol use outcomes in alcohol use disorder (AUD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve study aims, 34 treatment seeking adults with AUD will be recruited from local
      intensive outpatient (IOP) treatment programs and randomized to treatment with either
      inhibitory 1Hz rTMS to cerebellar vermis given daily for 2 weeks (total of 10 sessions) or
      sham. Alcohol use outcomes, self-reported negative affect, and craving will be obtained at
      baseline, 1 day, 1 week and 6 weeks following rTMS termination. An fMRI scan during a Stroop
      task will be obtained at baseline and 1 day after the final rTMS session.

    <description>Change in cerebellar brain activation as indicated by percent signal change in the medial cerebellum during incongruent minus congruent trials during a multisensory Stroop task during fMRI from baseline to day 15 (post-treatment). This will be calculated using a mask derived from preliminary data from a sample of 33 individuals with AUD at a single timepoint. Activation in this brain region was correlated with depression, anxiety, and recent drinking. Manuscript describing this result is under review (Wilcox et al.), and another manuscript describes the task in question (Wilcox et al. 2014 Cognitive Control Network Function in Alcohol Use Disorder Before and During Treatment With Lorazepam. Subst Use Misuse.</description>
