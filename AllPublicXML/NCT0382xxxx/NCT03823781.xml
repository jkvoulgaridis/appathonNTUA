  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study is designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of milrinone compared with placebo in participants after
      corrective surgery for congenital heart disease. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio within 90 minutes after arriving in the intensive care unit (ICU), to receive either
      intravenous milrinone or placebo for 36 hours. Participants will be stratified according
      Vasoactive Inotrope Score after arriving in the ICU.
