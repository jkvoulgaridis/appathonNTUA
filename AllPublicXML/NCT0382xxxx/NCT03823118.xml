  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of S1 combination with
      Anlotinib in patients with small cell lung cancer whose cancer has progression or recurrence
      after at least one standard chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Although SCLC is very responsive to initial treatment, most patients relapse with relatively
      resistant disease.These patients have a median survival of only 4 to 5 months when treated
      with further systemic therapy. Improvements in therapy for relapsed SCLC are much needed.The
      purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of S1 combination with Anlotinib
      in patients with small cell lung cancer whose cancer has progression or recurrence after at
      least one standard chemotherapy.
