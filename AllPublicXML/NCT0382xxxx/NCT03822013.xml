  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GM2 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive subtype of Lysosomal Storage Diseases in which,
      Hexosaminidase A-B deficiency is caused by HEXA-B gene. HEXA deficiency is seen in Tay sachs
      and HEXB deficiency causes Sandhoff disease.

      Infantile forms of Sandhoff and Tay sachs are often lethal and management of the patients is
      supportive including nutrition, hydration, seizure control and management of respiratory
      problems. Recent studies have suggested new methods of treatment, such as enzyme replacement
      therapy, bone marrow transplantation and substrate reduction therapy.

      The first drug used in SRT was Miglustat. It was introduced in 1980 as an anti HIV agent and
      later, it was registered under the trademark of Zavesca in 2009 and was used in treatment of
      Gaucher and Niemann-Pick disease. Zavesca passes blood brain barrier, so causes reduction of
      cholesterol and glycosphingolipids CNS neurons and relief of neurologic manifestations.
      Improvements were seen in oculomotor function, cognition, swallowing, motor disturbances and
      psychological problems after treatment with Zavesca. No effect has been proved on visceral
      involvement. Weight loss during first year of treatment, diarrhea and dyspepsia are seen as
      side effects.

      Studies on SRT in lysosomal storage disease have different results. Some show improvements in
      manifestations of Gausche, Sandhoff &amp; Tay sachs disease, while others show no valuable
      benefit for this method of treatment.

      Finding an effective treatment for these chronic diseases can improve quality of life for the
      patients and their families, and also reduce costs for healthcare services. The controversy
      persists and more studies are needed for judgment. So this study is done to evaluate the
      effect of Miglustat therapy in Sandhoff and Tay sachs disease, and is believed to help for
      further studies in this field.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a case- control, open label clinical trial. Patients are all registered with
      diagnosis of Sandhoff and Tay sachs, and recruited at children's medical center Tehran-IRAN.
      Diagnosis is confirmed by enzyme level and genetic tests. Case group receive Miglustat
      therapy for 1 year and frequently assessed. Patients in control group are also assessed for 1
      year without receiving Miglustat.

      Patients are evaluated for neurologic examination, seizure, nasogastric tube insertion,
      aspiration pneumonia and quality of life at the beginning of study and every 3 months.
      Miglustat is considered as an Orphan drug so clinical trials about this drug are designed
      small and adjusted to limited population.

      Variables in neurologic examination are Muscle tone, Muscular atrophy and contracture. motor
      function is scored according to &quot;Gross Motor Function Classification System&quot; (GMFCS) and
      quality of life is assessed by Infant Toddle Quality Of Life (ITQOL) questionnaire, with
      confirmed validity and stability.

      Data gathered during frequent visits is registered in check lists and analyzed with SPSS
      version 18. Quantitative variables express with mean and standard deviation and qualitative
      variables with frequency and percentile. Analysis of variance for repeated measurements
      (ANOVA) and nonparametric freedman are tests using for comparisons of Outcomes. Sample size
      is calculated by formula for clinical trials with repeated measures.

      Miglustat is FDA approved for Gaucher and Niemann pick diseases. All patients fill the
      informed consent and the nature of the study is explained to them. The information of
      participants is kept confidential. They are informed about side effects of the drug. If any
      cases at any time decides to exclude themselves from the study they are free to do so.
