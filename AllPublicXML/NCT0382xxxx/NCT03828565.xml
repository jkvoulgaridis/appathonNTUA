  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In operating theater, one of the bigger purpose of anesthetist-resuscitator is to optimize
      vascular filling (VF) because of a failure or an excess of filling is deleterious for the
      patient. Several studies have assessed the traditionnal VF based on the clinic and the VF
      guided by quantitative critereas. Thus studies have showed a decrease of morbidity and
      duration of patients' stay whose the VF was guided even on the long term. So, formal
      recommandations of experts (FRE) on the perioperative filling strategy of the SFAR (
      Anesthesia and Resuscitation Francophone Society) advise to titrate the perioperative
      vascular filling of high risk patients guiding on a mesure of end-systolic volume (ESV). The
      inscrease of ESV answering to filling confirmed the VF realized is relevant and authorized
      its pursuite while the absence of an increase of the ESV after a filling test signifies the
      useless and deleterious character of this one. The optimization of perioperative hemodynamics
      consists in adapting the patient's cardiac output to his metabolic needs. ETO, Swan-Ganz:
      limit of its application to the routine. The central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is
      simple and safe, the evaluation of the adjustment of O2 inputs compared to the needs. The
      industry has developed continuous monitoring systems by reflection spectrophotometry using
      optical fibers installed in the central venous pathways. In daily practice, the stricto sensu
      application of FRE leads to administering an VF up to the limit of the preload dependence
      without evaluating the adequacy of the cardiac output, which is not a physiological
      situation. This filling is therefore sometimes performed solely on the criteria of preload
      dependence while it is potentially deleterious for the patient. No study has compared a
      strategy based on the use of ScvO2 and preload dependence with current recommendations based
      solely on preload dependence. Our hypothesis is that the continuous monitoring of the ScvO2
      in the superior cave territory in intraoperative would allow to detect the patients with an
      inadequacy of the cardiac output and thus to select the only ones requiring a vascular
      filling. This would reduce postoperative complications related to overfilling, without
      exposing the patient to episodes of tissue hypoperfusion.

    <description>ScvO2 Perioperative continue monitoring with PreSep® system. If SvcO2 is less than 65% or decreases by more than 10% of its base value, the other parameters affecting ScvO2 (BIS (40-60% objective), Hb (objective&gt; 8g / dL), SaO2 (objective&gt; 94%)) are evaluated. If, after correcting for these parameters, the ScvO2 is not corrected, the preload-dependence parameters are evaluated (variation of the pulsed pressure) to guide the vascular filling: VF of 250 mL of crystalloids if PPV&gt; 13%, norepinephrine if PPV&lt;9%, reassess if PPV between 9 and 13%.
If VF or norepinephrine does not correct ScvO2 (&gt; 65%), a measurement of arterial lactate is performed. If lactatemia is&gt; 2 mmol / L, a positive inotrop is introduced after ETO if possible. If lactatemia is &lt;2 mmol / L, a return to the evaluation phase of the parameters influencing ScvO2 is necessary.</description>
