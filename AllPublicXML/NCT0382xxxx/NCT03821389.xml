  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the tolerance, feasibility, and physiological effects in airway
      clearance by using a novel non-invasive oscillating transducer device (NIOD, FrequencerTM) in
      critically ill children. The project is two years long with two separate stages of
      investigation. This study specifically examines different frequencies of NIOD to find the
      best frequency on patients outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Airway obstruction due to excessive production of secretion in small children especially
      those with bronchiolitis is a critical problem in the clinical management. Chest
      physiotherapy (CPT) and an invasive positive percussion ventilation (IPPV) have been
      recognized as to encourage dislodging the secretions; nonetheless, the tolerance to the
      procedure and its efficiency have not been proved to be sufficient. This study aims to
      examine the tolerance, feasibility, and physiological effects in airway clearance by using a
      novel non-invasive oscillating transducer device (NIOD) in critically ill children. The study
      will be prospective Crossover Randomized Study in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in a
      Canadian Academic Children's Hospital. We will target children less than 24-month-old, for
      whom CPT is prescribed for airway clearance with or without atelectasis. We will apply two
      different frequencies of NIOD (i.e. 40 and 60Hz) for 3 minutes each, on each patient 3 hours
      apart. The investigators will apply a pragmatic design, so that other procedures including
      hypertonic saline nebulization, IPPV, suctioning (e.g., oral or nasal), or changing the
      ventilator settings or modality (i.e., increasing PEEP or changing the nasal mask to total
      face CPAP) can be provided at the direction of bedside pediatric intensivists in charge.

    <description>NIOD will be implemented on four different parts of the chest walls, 3 minutes for each part and 12 minutes in total per each session. Left and right front and posterior chest walls will be stimulated (Figure1), particularly, on the anterior chest, intercostal spaces 1-2 above nipple line and lateral side of the midclavicular line 1-2 below intercostal spaces. The intensity of the NIOD can be selected between 80-100%, which is prespecified on the machine.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All the patients admitted to the PICU during the study period will be screened. The
             investigators will not set any restriction regarding the timing of prescription of CPT
             (i.e., length of PICU stay before screening) for the screening. The investigators will
             include only if CPT is expected to be used as a management at least for the next 24
             hours in the PICU from the time of inclusion. For instance, if CPT will be expected to
             be discontinued from the management in a day, the investigators will exclude the
             participants from the inclusion. CPT can be prescribed for airway clearance with any
             etiology such as atelectasis at the directions of bedside pediatric intensivists in
             charge on the study date. The investigators will only include patients whose
             oxygenation is stable (SpO2&gt;90%) with less than 0.60 of ventilators.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CPT order will (or is expected to) be discontinued within 24 hours from the inclusion
             timing.

          -  CPT is not ordered for airway clearance.

          -  SpO2 is not stable (SpO2=&lt;90%) with more than 0.60 of FIO2 for the ventilated patients
             including patients on NIV, at least for previous 1 hour from the screening.

          -  SpO2 is not stable (SpO2=&lt;90%) with more than 0.60 of FIO2 for the patients on HFNC,
             at least for previous 1 hour from the screening.

          -  Bradycardia (HR&lt;80bpm) at any interventions at least for 24 hours prior to the
             screening.

          -  Patients with known pneumothorax, osteomyelitis in the PICU admission.

          -  Known pulmonary hypertension with treatment(s) underway.

          -  Thoracotomy within 1 month.

          -  Known recent/unhealed rib fractures.

          -  Known skin injury of chest wall.

          -  No obtain of IC.

          -  Brain death or vegetated states.
