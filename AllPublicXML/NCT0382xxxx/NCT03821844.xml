    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to test the effects of a personalized music intervention (Music
      and Memory, Inc.) on agitated and aggressive behaviors for nursing home residents with
      dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized control trial of
      personalized music (Music and Memory) for nursing home residents with moderate to severe
      dementia living in 81 nursing homes from 4 nursing home corporations.

      Music and Memory is a personalized music program that uses portable music players to deliver
      individualized music to people with dementia. Nursing home staff provide residents with
      dementia with music playlists tailored to their personal history of music preferences. The
      program assumes that musical memories remain present and that personalized music can quell
      the anxiety and agitation stimulated by the confusion secondary to dementia.

      The aims of this study are: 1. To use a train-the-trainer model to implement the intervention
      with ongoing monitoring of the program's adoption and acceptance by nursing home residents
      with dementia; 2. To estimate the impact of Music and Memory on agitated and aggressive
      behaviors; and 3. To examine factors associated with variation in providers' adherence to the
      implementation of Music and Memory.

    <measure>Frequency of agitated and aggressive behaviors (staff report)</measure>
    <time_frame>8-months</time_frame>
    <description>The tool used to interview staff about resident behaviors is the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. Research staff interview a nursing staff member who knows the resident well to ask how frequently 29 agitated and/or aggressive behaviors occurred in the past week. There are seven response choices for each item, anchored from never (1) to several times per hour (7). Total scores on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory range from 29 to 203, with higher scores representing more frequent agitated and/or aggressive behaviors. Mean overall scores will be compared for treatment and control populations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of agitated and aggressive behaviors (direct observation)</measure>
    <time_frame>8-months</time_frame>
    <description>The tool used to directly observe resident behaviors is the Agitation Behavior Mapping Instrument. Research staff observe residents for short intervals (3 minutes per observation) and record the number of times 14 specific verbally and physically agitated behaviors occurred (up to 10 times per observation). Total scores on the Agitation Behavior Mapping Instrument range from 0 to 140, with higher scores representing more agitated and/or aggressive behaviors. Mean total scores will be compared for treatment and control populations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of agitated and aggressive behaviors (administrative data)</measure>
    <time_frame>8-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Aggressive Behavior Scale is a 4‚Äêitem measure describing the frequency of physical behavioral symptoms directed toward others; verbal behavioral symptoms directed toward others; other behavioral symptoms not directed toward others; and behaviors related to resisting necessary care. For each item, frequency in the past week is report as: behavior not exhibited (0); behavior occurred 1-3 days (1); behavior occurred 4-6 days (2); or behavior occurred daily (3). The Aggressive Behavior Scale ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more frequent agitated and/or aggressive behaviors. Mean total scores will be compared for treatment and control populations.</description>

    <measure>Observed emotion</measure>
    <time_frame>8-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Observed Emotion Rating Scale is completed by a trained observer to document duration of five observed emotional states (pleasure, anger, anxiety / fear, sadness, and general alertness) during short observations (3 minutes per observation). For each emotional state, the researcher indicates whether or not the emotion was observed: never (1); less than 16 seconds (2); 16-59 seconds (3); 1-2 minutes (4); or 3+ minutes (5). Total scores range from 5 to 25, with higher scores indicating greater duration of observed emotion. Average observed emotion scores will be compared for treatment and control populations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>8-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire is a 9-item screening assessment for depression severity. For each item, respondents indicate the frequency of the symptom in the past 2 weeks using the following choices: never or one day (0); 2-6 days (1); 7-11 days (2); or 12-14 days (3). Total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating more frequent depressive symptoms. Average total scores will be compared for treatment and control populations.</description>
