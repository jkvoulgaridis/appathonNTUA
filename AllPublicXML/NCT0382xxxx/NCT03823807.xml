      A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of SH-1028 with
      Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has Progressed with
      Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy and whose Tumours

      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      SH-1028 in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.The trail is divided into two parts:part A is
      dose extension phase,and Part B is expand sample size phase to confirm the efficacy of
      SH-1028.Patients must agree to provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M mutation
      status following confirmed disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. The
      primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of SH-1028 by assessment of
      Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.
