  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A stroke located in the left parieto-temporal junction is associated, in aphasic right-handed
      patients, with a poor prognosis for language recovery. The role of the right hemisphere in
      recovering post-stroke aphasia is still controversial. Our hypothesis, based on recent work
      in imaging, is that early activation of the right hemisphere linked to the practice of the
      visual arts could facilitate language recovery in extended posterior left strokes that
      completely disrupt language areas.

      The investigators will evaluate, at inclusion and at 6 weeks, the reorganization of
      functional and structural brain connectivity maps before and after rehabilitation of aphasia
      with art therapy and standard orthophonic rehabilitation versus a control group that received
      only standard orthophonic rehabilitation.

      The investigators will include all consecutive patients with recent ischemic or hemorrhagic
      stroke with unilateral lesion(s) of the parieto-temporal left junction present on the
      Diffusion MRI (DWI) performed in acute phase at 24-48h.

      All patients will undergo 2 MRI with tensor diffusion sequences (structural connectivity) and
      fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) resting state sequences (functional
      connectivity) at inclusion and 6 weeks after rehabilitation with or without art therapy.

      The investigators aimed to demonstrate that early activation of the right hemisphere related
      to the practice of the visual arts could facilitate the recovery of language in later strokes
      completely disrupting the language areas of the left hemisphere.
