  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meal ingestion induces sensations that are influenced by a series of conditioning factors.
      Aim: to determine the effect of ambient noise on the sensory responses to a standard probe
      meal. Randomized, cross-over study in healthy subjects comparing the effect of ambient noise
      versus silence on the sensations induced by a probe meal. Participants (12 men) will be
      instructed to eat a standard dinner the day before, to consume a standard breakfast at home
      after overnight fast, and to report to the laboratory, where the test meal will be
      administered 5 h after breakfast. Studies will be conducted in a quiet, isolated room with
      participants sitting on a chair. One study day, a noise will applied via headphones for 60
      min after meal ingestion and the other day headphones without sound will applied. Perception
      of homeostatic sensations (hunger/ satiation, fullness) and hedonic sensations (digestive
      well-being, mood) will be measured at 5 min intervals 10 min before and 20 min after
      ingestion and at 10 min intervals up to 60 min after the probe meal.
