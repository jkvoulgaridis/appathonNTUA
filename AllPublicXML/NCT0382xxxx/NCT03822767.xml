      The purpose of this phrase III clinical trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of
      Sabin Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (Vero cell) in a '2+1'sequential schedule with bivalent
      oral poliovirus vaccine in 2-month-old infants

      his study is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled phrase III clinical trial. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of sIPV manufactured by
      Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd in a '2+1' sequential schedule with bOPV in 2-month-old infants. 240
      infants aged between 60-90 days will be randomly assigned into experimental group or control
      group in the ratio 1:1. The experimental group received sIPV-sIPV-bOPV vaccination schedule
      at one month doses interval (i.e., month 0, 1, 2), and the control group received
      wIPV-wIPV-bOPV vaccination schedule at one month doses interval (i.e., month 0, 1, 2). The
      control wIPV was manufactured by SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.
