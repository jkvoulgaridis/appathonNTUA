      The purpose of this study is to characterize the Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring
      System in pediatric subjects with respect to YSI reference venous plasma sample measurements.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 250 subjects will be enrolled at up to six (6) clinical research sites in the United
      States. Subjects will wear two Sensors. Each Sensor will have a paired Reader that will be
      given to the subject. All Readers will be masked during the study (i.e. subjects will not be
      able to view glucose results obtained from the Sensor on the Reader screen). Subjects will be
      asked to perform at least 4 capillary Blood Glucose (BG) tests per day using the primary
      Reader. Interstitial glucose readings from each Sensor will be obtained with the
      corresponding Readers immediately following each BG test. Subjects will be instructed to
      report any problems with the device. Subjects will make three (3), four (4) or five (5)
      scheduled visits to the clinical study site, including the Enrollment/Screening Visit (Visit
      1). Based on the subjects weight, subjects will have up to two (2) in-clinic visits during
      which intravenous blood draws and YSI reference testing will occur.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be between the ages of 4 and 17 years of age at the time of study
             enrollment.

          -  Subject must have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

          -  Subjects age 11 and older must require insulin therapy through an insulin pump and/or
             multiple daily insulin injections (at least 3 injections daily).

          -  Willing to perform a minimum of 4 finger sticks per day while wearing the sensor in
             the study.

          -  Subject and/or guardian must be able to read and understand English.

          -  For subjects age 6 and older: willing to allow medical personnel to insert an IV
             catheter in the arm to allow for venous blood flow samples to be obtained per the
             study protocol.

          -  For subjects age 11 and older: subject is willing to have their blood sugar
             manipulated during one or more in-clinic sessions.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the subject must be able to follow the instructions
             provided to him/her by the study site and perform all study tasks as specified by the
             protocol.

          -  At the time of enrollment, subject must be available to participate in all study
             visits.

          -  Known insulin sensitivity factor (only applicable to subjects age 11 and older).

          -  Subject's parent, guardian or legally authorized representative must be willing and
             able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to provide written signed and dated informed assent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subject has a history of hypoglycemia unawareness (only applicable to subjects age 11
             and older).
