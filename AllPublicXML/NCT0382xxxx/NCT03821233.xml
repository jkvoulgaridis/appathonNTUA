  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to
      establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dosage (RD) of ZW49, the
      investigational agent under study, and to assess the safety and tolerability of ZW49.
      Eligible patients include those with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic
      HER2-expressing cancers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a 3+3 dose-escalation study design to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of ZW49 and to determine the MTD or RD of ZW49 for further study. Selected expansion cohorts
      will be subsequently opened based upon Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommendation and
      sponsor approval to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZW49 at the MTD or RD and
      to assess preliminary anti-tumor activity.
