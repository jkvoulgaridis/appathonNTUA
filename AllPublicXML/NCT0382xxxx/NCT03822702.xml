  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the real-time kinetics of handwriting regarding
      the design of the utensil and fine motor performances from biomechanical perspectives. It
      includes three parts.

      The first part is an observational study design and the specific aim of the first part of the
      study is to establish a novel kinetic assessment system incorporated with Force Acquisition
      Pens (FAPs) designed with different barrel sizes and shapes for handwriting. The thorough
      calibration, examination of reliability and validity will be presented in this study.

      The second part is also an observational study design and the specific aim of the second part
      of the study is to investigate the handwriting mechanisms using the kinetic assessment system
      incorporated with the motion capture system with children who have writing difficulties.

      The third part is an interventional study design and the aim of this final part is to
      integrate the kinetic assessment system and the intervention concept to establish a
      Biomechanical Assessment and Biofeedback-training System for Handwriting (BABSH). Comparison
      of the intervention effect of the BABSH and traditional training for the children with
      handwriting difficulties will also be carried out in this part.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the total point score of three subtests of Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>These three subtests are 'fine motor precision (subtest-1) ', 'fine motor integration (subtest-2)' and 'manual dexterity (subtest-3)'.
The raw scores of the three subtests were then transformed into point scores based on the BOT-2 manual. The total point scores of the three subtests will be analyzed. For subtest-1, the range of total point score is 0 to 41. For subtest-2, the range of total point score is 0 to 40. For subtest-3, the range of total point score is 0 to 45. Higher total point scores represent a better performance (outcome).</description>
