  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effectiveness of a 6-week Energy Conservation + Problem Solving
      Therapy Intervention to Health Education Intervention for reducing the fatigue impact and
      fatigue level and improving the level of participation in instrumental, leisure, and social
      activities in people with heart failure associated fatigue. Half of the participants received
      Energy Conservation + Problem Solving Therapy Intervention, and the other half received
      Health Education Intervention.

      Energy Conservation+Problem Solving Therapy (EC+PST) Intervention: In this study, the EC+PST
      Intervention will ideally occur twice a week for 6 weeks with each session lasting
      approximately 30 minutes. The intervention will be individually delivered via telehealth;
      therefore, participants will receive the intervention in their home to minimize fatigue from
      the intervention.

      Health Education Intervention: The Health Education Intervention will occur once a week for 6
      weeks with each session lasting approximately 30 minutes. The Health Education Intervention
      will be delivered via telehealth; therefore, participants will receive the intervention at
      their convenient quiet place to minimize fatigue from the intervention.

    <measure>Changes in Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretest (Week 0), Posttest (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>The FIS is a 40-item measure that assesses the impact of fatigue on daily life in three different dimensions: Cognitive (10 items), Physical (10 items), and Psychosocial functioning (20 items). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (no problem) to 4 (extreme problem), and the global score is the sum of 40 items, ranging from 0 to 160.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Short Form Ver 1.0 Fatigue 8a</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretest (Week 0), Posttest (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Fatigue 8a is a test measuring the experience and impact of fatigue. This assessment consists of 8 questions on fatigue experience and impact, and the raw score is converted to T-score (50% is the mean of the population). Higher the T-score, worse the fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Activity Card Sort (ACS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretest (Week 0), Posttest (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>The ACS is a measure of the participation level in instrumental, leisure, and social activities. The ACS uses 89 photographs to calculate the percentage of retained activities since their diagnosis</description>

    <description>EC-PST is a client-centered intervention aiming to guide people with chronic fatigue to create their own solutions so that they can generalize those learned solutions and strategies to other fatigue-related problems even after completing the study participation. Some of the topics covered during the first two introductory sessions are facts regarding fatigue, budgeting and banking energy, and the introduction of EC+PST Intervention.</description>

    <description>The interventionist will be the PI, an occupational therapist (co-I), or OT graduate student who will be trained in the health education topics. During the Health Education sessions, participants will be educated on health-related topics relevant to CHF and EC strategies, although they will not learn how to apply the information to their daily life. Health Education Workbook containing information on the topics taught during the sessions will be provided during the Pretest visit and used throughout the Health Education sessions.</description>
