      Rationale: Anastomotic leakage (0% - 30%) is a severe complication after esophagectomy with
      mortality rates approximately ranging from 2% - 12%. In addition, it is associated with a
      prolonged ICU treatment and hospital stay. Anastomotic leakage severity is currently graded
      according to how it is treated (grade I: conservative treatment, grade II endoscopic or
      radiologic intervention and grade III surgical intervention). However, this scoring system
      cannot be used to guide decision making when anastomotic leakage is diagnosed in a clinical
      setting.

      Factors that may influence the severity of the anastomotic leakage are (amongst others)
      location of the anastomosis, estimated surface of the defect, estimated circumference of the
      defect, extent of contamination, degree of sepsis and time from diagnosis until therapy.
      However, little is known about to what extent these and other factors contribute to
      anastomotic leakage severity. In addition, there is a paucity of data on what leakage
      characteristics dictate the success of a specific treatment.

      Primary study objectives

        1. To investigate what factors contribute to anastomotic leakage severity and to compose an
           evidence based anastomotic leakage severity score.

        2. To investigate what anastomotic leakage characteristics are associated with success of
           different anastomotic leakage treatments and to compare the effectiveness of different
           initial anastomotic leakage treatments for leakages classified according to severity and
           leakage characteristics.

      Study design: International multicenter retrospective cohort study.

      Study population: Adult patients with anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy and gastric
      conduit reconstruction for esophageal cancer.

      Cohort size: 1000-2000 patients with anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy for cancer.

      Primary outcome parameter: 90 day mortality. Secondary outcome parameters: in-hospital
      mortality, 30-day mortality, 180-day mortality, comprehensive complications index, total
      number of reinterventions, hospital and ICU length of stay, hospital related costs.

      2. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE

      The incidence of esophageal cancer is increasing, with an estimated annual incidence of
      480.000 cases worldwide [Jemal 2011]. Esophagectomy remains the cornerstone of curative
      treatment, often in combination with chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. However,
      esophagectomy is associated with considerable morbidity and anastomotic leakage is a severe
      postoperative complication.

      Anastomotic leakage is defined as a &quot;full thickness gastrointestinal defect involving
      esophagus, anastomosis, staple line, or conduit irrespective of presentation or method of
      identification&quot; according to the Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group (ECCG)
      definition [Low 2015]. Anastomotic leakage has been described to occur in 0-30%. If
      anastomotic leakage occurs, it is associated with mortality rates ranging from 2% - 12%
      [Biere 2011, Saluja 2012]. In addition, it is often associated with a prolonged ICU
      treatment, hospital length of stay and multiple reinterventions [Lubbers 2019, submitted].
      The impact of anastomotic leakage on quality of life is high and it is associated with a
      substantial burden in terms of hospital resources and costs [Biere 2011, Alanezi 2004,
      Luketich 2012, Blackmon 2007].

      Treatment of anastomotic leakage ranges from conservative management (nil per mouth,
      antibiotics and nasogastric tube drainage) to radiologic drainage, endoscopic treatment with
      stents, drains or endoVAC (Vacuum Assisted Closure) systems, and surgical exploration. A
      recent systematic review performed by our group assessed the current literature for studies
      that specifically reported on specific therapies and outcome of anastomotic leakage
      [Verstegen 2018, submitted]. Nineteen studies with 273 patients were included and studies
      were of low to moderate quality. No meta-analysis was performed because of substantial
      clinical heterogeneity of the included studies. The main conclusion of the review was that
      due to small cohorts and clinical heterogeneity no evidence based treatment strategy could be
      composed from the current literature. A retrospective multicenter study of 79 patients
      revealed that the used treatment modality of an anastomotic leakage is not only patient
      dependent, but also hospital dependent [Lubbers 2019, submitted]. Until now the management of
      an anastomotic leakage is more or less based on expert opinion rather than on an
      evidence-based anastomotic leakage treatment algorithm. From these studies, it became evident
      that the absence of an anastomotic leakage severity score complicates performing robust
      research on this topic.

      Anastomotic leakage severity is currently graded according to how it is treated (grade I:
      conservative treatment, grade II endoscopic or radiologic intervention and grade III surgical
      intervention) [Low 2015]. Although this scoring system is useful for reporting the
      consequences of anastomotic leakage, by definition it cannot be used to guide decision making
      when anastomotic leakage is diagnosed in a clinical setting. Examples of factors that may
      influence the severity of the anastomotic leakage are location of the anastomosis
      (intrathoracic or cervical), circumference of the defect, surface of the defect, extent of
      contamination (i.e. local, mediastinal, intrathoracic), degree of sepsis and time from
      diagnosis until therapy. However, little is known about to what extent these and other
      factors contribute to anastomotic leakage severity. In addition, there is a paucity of data
      on what leakage characteristics dictate the success of a specific treatment.

      3. STUDY OBJECTIVES 3.1 Main study objectives

        1. To investigate what factors contribute to anastomotic leakage severity and to compose an
           evidence based anastomotic leakage severity score.

        2. To investigate what anastomotic leakage characteristics are associated with success of
           different anastomotic leakage treatments and to compare the effectiveness of different
           initial anastomotic leakage treatments for leakages classified according to severity and
           leakage characteristics.

      3.2 Other study objectives This is an explorative study and relevant interactions between
      factors will be investigated. The following other study objectives are predefined. Outcome
      will be evaluated in terms of mortality, comprehensive complications index (CCI), number of
      reinterventions, length of stay and costs.

        1. To investigate what factors are associated with postoperative mortality in patients with
           anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy and to compose a model that predicts mortality.

        2. To study practice variation in the treatment of anastomotic leakage and to evaluate
           heterogeneity in its outcome.

        3. To investigate whether the number of postoperative days the leak is diagnosed is
           associated with outcome.

        4. To investigate whether diagnostic tests that are performed within 48 hours of
           anastomotic leakage diagnosis (e.g. CT scan, endoscopy) are associated with outcome.

        5. To investigate whether time from diagnosis to first invasive treatment (in a subgroup of
           patients that is treated invasively) is associated with outcome.

        6. To investigate whether outcome is different in patients with anastomotic leakage after
           Ivor Lewis versus McKeown versus Orringer esophagectomy.

        7. To investigate whether outcome is different in patients undergoing open versus minimally
           invasive esophagectomy.

        8. To investigate whether outcome is different in patients in whom an omental wrap of
           pleural flap was used to cover the anastomosis.

        9. To compare outcome in patients receiving selective digestive tract decontamination (SDD)
           versus patients who did not receive SDD.

       10. To compare outcome in patients who have the leakage drained by postoperative drains at
           the time of diagnosis (e.g. mediastinal drain, cervical drain, chest tube) versus
           patients who did not have the leakage drained at the time of diagnosis.

       11. To investigate whether there is a difference in success rate and outcome for endoVACs
           that are placed within the esophagus/gastric tube versus endoVACs that are placed
           through the anastomotic defect.

      4.5 Study setting This study will be performed in a multicenter and multinational setting. A
      large group of Dutch hospitals that are currently performing esophagectomies (Dutch Upper-GI
      Cancer Audit - DUCA group) have consented to participate in this study. The TENTACLE study
      has also been endorsed by the Oesophago-Gastric Anastomosis Audit (OGAA) study group. In
      addition, collaboration is sought with the European Society for Diseases of the Esophagus
      (ESDE) trainee chapter and the Minimally Invasive Oesophagectomy (MIO) think tank initiative
      (see Chapter 5.5 - Feasibility).

      5. STUDY POPULATION

      5.1 Population All adult patients with an anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy and gastric
      conduit reconstruction for esophageal cancer are suitable for inclusion.

      5.2 Inclusion criteria

      In order to be eligible to participate in this study, a subject must meet all of the
      following criteria:

      • Aged 18 years or older;

        -  Esophagectomy and gastric conduit reconstruction for resectable esophageal
           (cT1-4aN0-3M0) cancer;

        -  Postoperative anastomotic leakage according to the ECCG definition [Low 2015].

      5.3 Exclusion criteria

        -  Esophagectomy for benign disease;

        -  Emergency resection;

        -  Patients undergoing extended total gastrectomy.

      5.4 Sample size calculation This is an explorative study and data will be used to investigate
      to what extent specific characteristics of anastomotic leakages are associated with severity
      of the leakage and how they relate to the successfulness of different treatments. Therefore,
      no formal sample size calculation was performed. In order to be able to draw robust
      conclusions from this study, to develop an evidence based anastomotic leakage severity score
      and to gain a solid basis for future anastomotic leakage related research, we aim to include
      at least 1000 patients with anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy for cancer.

      5.5 Feasibility In order to include the proposed number of patients and to collect data from
      international patient cohort, we aim to acquire data from 4 esophageal surgeon networks.
      Although there is some overlap between these groups, we believe that inviting the 4 networks
      to participate will optimize the chance of obtaining robust results from this study.

        1. The Dutch Upper-GI Cancer Audit (DUCA) group A large group of Dutch hospitals performing
           esophagectomies have agreed to participate in this study. During the study period of 8
           years, approximately 750 resections were performed per year and the incidence of
           anastomotic leakage was around 18%. Therefore, data from 1080 patients with anastomotic
           leakage (750*8*0.18) can be included from the Netherlands.

        2. The European Society for Diseases of the Esophagus (ESDE) trainee chapter The ESDE
           trainee chapter is a research collaborative that is managed by trainee members of the
           society. Centers in this network of around 20 hospitals will be invited to participate
           in this study. We estimate that around 10 hospitals will participate, with a mean case
           load of 40 esophagectomies per year and a mean anastomotic leakage incidence of 15%. We
           therefore estimate that 480 patients could be included from this collaboration
           (10*40*8*0.15).

        3. The Oesophago-Gastric Anastomosis Audit (OGAA) group The OGAA was established in 2017
           and aimed to identify patient and differences in operative technique that influence
           outcome. This worldwide network of esophageal surgeons performed a 6 month snapshot
           study and will include an estimated 1750 cases by December 31st 2018. We will invite the
           centers in the OGAA to participate in this study and to contribute the cases that have
           already been registered in the OGAA and to contribute additional data from their
           2011-2018 cohorts. We estimate that there will be approximately 263 patients with
           anastomotic leakage in the OGAA (1750*0.15) . Possibly, more cases will be contributed
           from the participating centers if they contribute additional data from their 2011-2018
           cohorts.

        4. The Minimally Invasive Oesophagectomy (MIO) think tank initiative The European MIO think
           tank group includes members from around 15 European high volume centers. We estimate
           that in the past 8 years, each center performed 40 esophagectomies per year and with a
           leakage incidence of around 10% this group could contribute around 480 cases
           (15*50*8*0.10).

      6. METHODS

      6.1 Primary outcome parameter • 90-day mortality

      6.2 Secondary outcome parameters

        -  In-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality and 180-day mortality.

        -  Comprehensive complications index (CCI) [Slankamenac 2013].

        -  Total number of reinterventions (endoscopic, radiologic, surgical).

        -  Hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay and readmission rates.

        -  Cost estimation.

      6.3 List of study parameters This is a retrospective study and we expect that not all
      relevant data can be obtained from the patient files. For example, estimation of leak
      circumference or leak surface will not be possible without an endoscopy and we expect that
      not all patients underwent an endoscopy. However, it is expected that the large number of
      patients will provide enough data to analyze whether factors with a lot of missing data are
      of influence. Therefore, these factors that are likely to have a lot of missing data are
      taken up in this list, even though missing data may introduce bias.

      7. ANALYSIS

      7.1 Analysis strategy - general considerations The ultimate goal of main study objective 1 is
      to obtain an evidence based anastomotic leakage severity score that reflects the influence of
      leakage associated parameters on 90-day mortality. This will allow researchers to describe
      leakage severity in groups of patients and it can be used to correct for differences between
      groups regarding anastomotic leakage severity. This will therefore aid in performing future
      comparative effectiveness studies.

      Only factors that concern leakage characteristics (listed in chapter 7.3 - List of study
      parameters / Leakage characteristics) and factors that concern the consequences of the leak
      for a patient (listed in chapter 7.3 - List of study parameters / Patient parameters at the
      time of diagnosis) are used to compose this score.

      Other important parameters that are likely to be predictive of 90-day mortality (e.g. age,
      comorbidity index, preoperative performance status, etc.) are not included in the severity
      score since these can be reported (and corrected for) separately. Operation characteristics
      (e.g. resection type, anastomotic site, etc.) may also be predictive of 90-day mortality if
      anastomotic leakage occurs. Operation characteristics are not included in the severity score
      since it is likely that these factors are also important for anastomotic leakage strategy,
      regardless of leakage severity (e.g. cervical anastomotic leakage may require different
      treatment than intrathoracic anastomotic leakage) and we aim to investigate this in our other
      study objectives (see chapter 3.2 - Other study objectives). In addition, it is one of our
      other study objectives to compose a model that predicts 90-day mortality in case of
      anastomotic leakage (see chapter 3.2 - Other study objectives) and for this model all
      predictive factors that are registered in this study will be taken into account.

      7.2 Main study objective 1 The first main study objective is to investigate what factors
      contribute to anastomotic leakage severity and to compose an evidence based anastomotic
      leakage severity score.

      First, univariate analysis is performed on relevant parameters that are described in chapter
      7.3 - List of study parameters / Leakage characteristics and in chapter 7.3 - List of study
      parameters / Patient parameters at the time of diagnosis. Relevant parameters are entered
      into separate binary logistic regression models with 90-day mortality as outcome parameter in
      order to explore associations in the data. Second, factors that are considered to be
      clinically relevant based on literature and/or expert opinion are selected for multivariate
      analysis. Backwards stepwise selection is used to exclude values of p&gt;0.05 from the model.
      Results are presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A 2-tailed
      p&lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. Third, this multivariate model will be
      internally validated by bootstrapping, using 5000 bootstrap resamples. Finally, a nomogram is
      constructed based on the final bootstrapped multivariable regression analysis and this
      nomogram can be used to calculate the anastomotic leakage severity score.

      In order to investigate the relative influence of casemix parameters (e.g. age, comorbidity,
      etcetera) on the leakage severity score, similar analysis will be performed in which casemix
      parameters (listed in (listed in chapter 7.3 - List of study parameters / Patient and tumor
      characteristics and in chapter 7.3 - List of study parameters / operation characteristics)
      are also included. If casemix is found to be very strongly associated with outcome relative
      to the severity score (to the extent that the severity score is of limited additional value
      in the regression model), latent class analysis is used [Rabe-Hesketh 2008]. The parameters
      used for the anastomotic leakage severity score (chapter 7.3 - List of study parameters /
      Leakage characteristics and in chapter 7.3 - List of study parameters / Patient parameters at
      the time of diagnosis) are used to create casemix corrected classes of anastomotic leakage
      severity.

      The results obtained by the described analyses will also be performed in subgroups of
      patients undergoing McKeown, Ivor Lewis and Orringer esophagectomy. By performing this
      sensitivity analysis, we will investigate whether the obtained model is useful for all types
      of esophagectomy or whether different factors are predictive of 90-day mortality for the
      different types of esophagectomy. If substantial differences are found between the primary
      analysis and this sensitivity analysis, the possibility of composing different anastomotic
      leakage severity scoring systems will be considered.

      In addition, we will investigate and report whether the anastomotic leakage severity score is
      also predictive of the other outcome parameters. Together with data from the secondary study
      objective (see chapter 3.2 - Other study objectives) in which associations between 90-day
      mortality and other outcome parameters are investigated, this will result in defining if
      other parameters can be used as a proxy for 90-day mortality.

      7.3 Main study objective 2 The second main study objective is to investigate what anastomotic
      leakage characteristics are associated with success of different initial treatments and to
      compare the effectiveness of different initial anastomotic leakage treatments for leakages
      classified according to severity and leakage characteristics.

      In the first analysis relevant primary treatment parameters (listed in chapter 6.3 - List of
      study parameters / Primary treatment) are the exposures. The association between anastomotic
      leakage characteristics and operation characteristics (see chapter 6.3 - List of study
      parameters / Leakage characteristics and chapter 6.3 - List of study parameters / Operation
      characteristics) and outcome parameters (see chapter 6.1 - Primary outcome parameter and
      chapter 6.2 - Secondary outcome parameters) will be evaluated for the exposures in regression
      analysis. Correction for patient characteristics, tumor characteristics and anastomotic
      leakage severity score is performed, if appropriate.

      Based on the results of this first analysis, subgroups of patients are created based on
      individual operation or leakage characteristics or based on combinations of characteristics.
      The effectiveness of the primary treatment strategies is assessed in a regression models for
      the different outcome parameters and correction for patient characteristics, tumor
      characteristics and anastomotic leakage severity score is performed, if appropriate.
      Comparison of the primary outcome parameter and secondary outcome parameters will be
      expressed in terms of a relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. A
      two-tailed P &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

      7.4 Other study objectives Analysis of other study objectives will follow the same principles
      as described in chapter 7.2 - Main study objective 1 and chapter 7.3 main study objective 2.
      Detailed and predefined analysis plans will be written during the preparation phase of the
      TENTACLE study (see Chapter 4.3 - Study timeline).

      8. ETHICS STATEMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL

      This study will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the declaration of
      Helsinki. The study protocol and relevant documents have been approved by the medical ethical
      committee of the Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. All
      participating centers are provided with the study protocol and relevant documents in January
      2019, so that participating centers can ask their local ethical committees for approval if
      needed according to local ethical protocols.

      9. DATA HANDLING

      9.1 Database system The Castor database system (www.castoredc.com) will be used. This online
      medical research database system is certified to meet international security standards and is
      compliant with all relevant regulations, amongst which are ICH-GCP, GDPR, HIPAA, FDA 21 CFR
      part 11, ISO 27001 and ISO 9001. More information and individual security certificates can be
      found on https://www.castoredc.com/security-statement.

      9.2 Case report form (CRF) A detailed CRF is created from the Castor (www.castoredc.com)
      database and provided to the invited centers (see also appendix 1). The CRF includes info
      points with definitions and guidelines that aid in adequate scoring of the listed parameters.

      9.3 Data collection and data entering All patient data will be entered anonymously by or
      under supervision of the treating physician(s). Up to 4 users per participating center will
      receive a Castor login username and password and these users can enter data into the
      database. In addition to entering data per patient individually, local study teams can upload
      their already existing database into the Castor database system and add only the additional
      data that is required for this study. The TENTACLE study team will provide a short
      step-by-step manual and can provide additional help with this, if needed.

      9.4 Data privacy statement All anonymous study data will be available to the TENTACLE study
      team. The data of a center will be available to that specific center only through the Castor
      database system website. The data will not contain identifiable patient parameters (e.g. no
      date of birth, no date of surgery, etc.). In compliance with the General Data Protection
      Regulation (GDPR - EU 2016/679). Each patient will be coded with a unique patient number so
      that patients in the study are untraceable from the study database. Surgeons that participate
      in the TENTACLE study are asked to keep a password coded file that can identify individual
      patients locked away in their practice. This file can be accessed by the local investigators
      if needed, for example in case a relevant new research question requires entering of
      additional data into the database.

      10. PUBLICATIONS

      10.1 Main publications

      We aim to publish two main manuscripts that cover the investigation of our main study
      objectives:

        1. Investigation of what factors are associated with anastomotic leakage severity and
           composition of the anastomotic leakage severity score.

        2. Investigate of what anastomotic leakage characteristics are associated with success of
           different anastomotic leakage treatments and comparison of the effectiveness of
           different initial anastomotic leakage treatments for leakages classified according to
           severity and leakage characteristics.

      10.2 Other publications Other possible publications will cover the secondary study objectives
      . These manuscripts will be defined at a later stage in the study.

      10.3 Publication policy The TENTACLE study embraces corporate authorship and all
      collaborators that contribute to this study will form the TENTACLE collaborative group. This
      group will co-author all publications in which TENTACLE study data is used.

      The protocol writing committee is fully involved in conducting this study and will be
      included as authors in both main publication(s) in which the TENTACLE study data is used. If
      the journal to which a manuscript is submitted does not allow the number of authors of the
      two main manuscripts, authors join the collaborative group instead, based on scientific input
      during the study, manuscript writing and revising.
