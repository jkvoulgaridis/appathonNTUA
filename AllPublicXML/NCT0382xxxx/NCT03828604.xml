  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anhedonia, or loss of interest or pleasure, is a key feature of depression and
      transdiagnostic construct in psychopathology. Both theory and compelling evidence from
      preclinical models implicates stress-induced inflammation as a key psychobiological pathway
      to anhedonic behavior; however, this pathway has not been demonstrated in human models.
      Further, although anhedonia may reflect dysregulation in multiple dimensions of reward, the
      extent to which stress-induced inflammation alters these dimensions is unclear. The current
      placebo controlled study used a standardized laboratory stressor task to elicit an
      inflammatory response in a sample of a healthy young women and evaluate effects of
      stress-induced inflammation on multiple behavioral indices of reward processing.

      In this study we propose to examine the association between psychosocial stress, the
      stress-induced inflammatory response, and reward processing in a female undergraduate sample.
      Specifically, we will 1) examine effects of an acute psychosocial stressor on reward
      processing; 2) evaluate the association between stress-related changes in inflammation and
      reward processing; and 3) test key vulnerability factors that may moderate the association
      between stress and reward. To achieve these goals, this study will recruit 60 female
      undergraduate students to test effects of stress on reward processing in a 3.5 hour
      laboratory session. Participants will be randomly assigned to either experience a laboratory
      stressor or a placebo control, and will complete reward tasks 90 minutes post stress/placebo
      onset, at which point the peripheral inflammatory response to stress reaches its peak. The
      reward tasks are computerized behavioral tasks that assess three domains of reward
      processing: reward-learning, reward motivation, and reward sensitivity. Throughout the
      session, all participants will complete self-report measures of affect and provide blood and
      saliva samples for evaluation of the psychological and physiological stress response. Within
      one week prior to the session, participants will attend a 1 hour visit in which they complete
      baseline reward tasks and self-report questionnaires assessing mood, personality, early life
      stress, and health behaviors. In total, participants will complete two visits, with a
      duration of 4.5 hours. This study builds upon prior studies demonstrating immediate effects
      of acute stress on reward processing, and further tests for delayed effects of acute stress
      on reward processing. Furthermore, this will be the first study to examine inflammation as a
      mechanism linking stress to deficits in reward processing. Findings may inform theory of
      depression etiology and contribute to more specialized treatment that is targeted at specific
      symptoms of depression.

    <description>The 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD) is a self-report measure; participants are asked to rate how often they have experienced depressed feelings, attitudes, and behavioral symptoms during the past week (0 = rarely; 3 = most of the time). The total score range is 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating higher depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Emotional reactivity and recovery from the TSST/P-TSST will be assessed using items from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the Profile of Mood States. Participants rate how they feel &quot;right now (that is, at the present moment) on a 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely) Likert scale. Average scores for subscales are reported, including positive and negative affect (7 items each), fatigue (8 items) vigor (5 items) and confusion (7 items). Participants also use visual analogue scales (VAS) to indicate how stressed, anxious, angry, confident, calm, socially connected and happy they are currently feeling on a 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely) scale. The VAS are completed alongside the PANAS and three additional times during the TSST/P-TSST.</description>
