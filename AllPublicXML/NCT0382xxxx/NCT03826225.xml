    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to collect ECG data from a wearable cardiac monitor in order to
      evaluate end-to-end performance of a cardiac monitor system and associated data management
      accessories.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the usability of the Wearable Cardiac Monitor
      (WCM) system including the WCM, Mobile Monitors (patient and clinician), Magnet and LATITUDE
      Clarity(TM) Server. The study will exercise the end-to-end system utilizing human ECG data
      generated by the wearable cardiac monitor.
