  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic rib fractures are common, resulting from significant forces impacting on the chest,
      and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Acute pain management in
      inpatients with traumatic rib fractures has been highly emphasized by practitioners.
      Inappropriate analgesia may cause respiratory complications, including pneumonia,
      atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and prolonged hospital stay. These may be
      prevented or reduced by good analgesic therapy. This study is aimed to investigate the
      analgesic effect of acupuncture on traumatic rib fractures.

      This open-label, randomized controlled trial will involve 150 patients who have traumatic rib
      fractures. Subjects are randomly assigned to acupuncture group, laser acupuncture group or
      sham laser acupuncture group with a 1:1:1 ratio. The intervention will be performed on the
      consecutive three day after allocation. Bilateral LI4 (Hegu), SJ6 (Zhigou), ST36 (Zusanli)
      and GB34 (Yanglingquan) are used for each group. The traditional acupuncture group will be
      performed by inserting needles to a depth of 15-35 mm and last for 15 min. The laser
      acupuncture will be performed with the gallium aluminum arsenide LaserPen, which delivered
      0.375 J of energy at each of the acupoints. Subjects in the control group underwent sham
      laser acupuncture treatment without any laser output. The acupuncture points, application
      duration, and total number of treatments were similar to those in the laser acupuncture
      group.

    <masking_description>All the patients are told that they will receive one kind of acupuncture treatment in addition to the original oral analgesics and assess the efficacy of acupuncture. The patients are randomly assigned to three groups after providing written informed consent, without being mentioned which kind of acupuncture treatment is applied as control. Patients are not blinded to TA or LA treatment, but they can be blinded to LA or SLA treatment. The outcome assessor is also blinded to the group assignments and is trained to apply the pain scales and conduct physical tests. To avoid unblinding of the assessment of outcomes, the patients are instructed not to discuss any aspect related to their treatment with the assessor.</masking_description>

Eight disposable, single use, sterilized, stainless steel needles are inserted at each session, and the bilateral LI4 (Hegu), SJ6 (Zhigou), ST36 (Zusanli) and GB34 (Yanglingquan) are used for acupuncture treatment. The acupuncture needles are to be inserted to a depth of 15-35 mm. All needles are rotated manually at least once at each session to elicit needle sensation (De qi). The needle retention time is 15 min.</description>
