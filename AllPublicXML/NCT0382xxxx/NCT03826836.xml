  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (i.e. peripheral artery disease,
      ischemic heart failure, myocardial infarction) are randomised to (1) treatment as usual (i.e.
      best medical care) or (2) treatment as usual (i.e. best medical care) in combination with an
      eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction programme.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Distress, including depression, anxiety, and chronic stress, is common among
      patients with cardiovascular disease. This reduces their quality of life and worsens their
      prognosis. A structured mindfulness training programme, such as the 8-week mindfulness-based
      stress reduction (MBSR) course, may reduce distress, improve quality of life, support a
      healthy lifestyle and modify cardiovascular risks. The aim of this randomised controlled
      trial is to determine whether MBSR improves the quality of life in patients with
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

      Objective: The primary objective is the effect of MBSR on quality of life. Secondary
      objectives are the effects of MBSR on mental health, mindfulness, and cardiovascular risk
      factors, and the cost-effectiveness of MBSR.

      Study design: Multicenter Torgerson preference randomised controlled trial. Complemented with
      qualitative research in a maximum of 12 patients in the intervention arm.

      Study population: Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (i.e. coronary artery
      disease, ischemic heart failure, and peripheral artery disease).

      Intervention: The intervention group will receive an 8-week MBSR programme in addition to
      treatment as usual (TAU+MBSR), while the control group will receive only treatment as usual
      (TAU).

      Main study parameters: The primary outcome is the change of scores on the SF-36 scale, which
      is an instrument for measuring quality of life. Secondary outcomes are depression and anxiety
      (HADS questionnaire), stress (PSS-10 questionnaire), mindfulness (FFMQ-SF questionnaire),
      smoking, BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, plasma lipids and HbA1c, hair cortisol, quality of
      life measured by EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, health care costs, and non-health care costs.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks: Participation in this trial is not associated with
      additional risks compared to treatment as usual. MBSR is proven to be safe and is widely
      accepted for patients with a variety of conditions as well as for healthy persons. The burden
      of participation (i.e. time investment and extra examinations) will be compensated by the
      possible benefits. MBSR is already successfully used for the treatment of a variety of
      physical and mental conditions, including chronic pain, cancer, anxiety, depression and
      burnout. As a substantial number of patients with cardiovascular disease experience distress,
      mindfulness could be an effective intervention for this population as well. The American
      Heart Association recently stated that meditation, as it is a low-cost and low-risk
      intervention, may be considered as an adjunct to current cardiovascular management. However,
      further research on the effects of mindfulness is warranted and should preferably consist of
      randomised, adequately powered studies with use of a control group.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured with the SF-36 (Short Form) questionnaire, which contains 36 questions. The total score is based on a 100-point scale, with a higher score indicating a higher quality of life.
Physical health summary scores are derived using four scales (physical functioning, role functioning due to physical problems, bodily pain and general health perceptions), while mental health summary scores are derived using four other scales (mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, social functioning and vitality).
The change of scores over time for all time points will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a 14-item self-report screening scale which is used to indicate the possible presence of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. The scale includes 7 items on anxiety and 7 items on depression, both with a score ranging from 0 to 21. The total score is classified into no anxiety or depression disorder (≤7), possible disorder (8-10), and probable disorder (≥11).</description>

    <measure>Perception of stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Stress will be measured with the Perceived Stress Scale 10, which is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress and consists of 10 items. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Items are designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. Scores can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>Five facets of mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness will be measured with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire Short-Form (FFMQ-SF), and a single question about daily mindfulness practice (daily, weekly or not regularly).
The FFMQ-SF is a 24-items self-report screening scale which is used to measure five facets of mindfulness. These five facets are observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience. Facet scores range from 5 to 25 (for the 'observing' facet 4 to 20), with higher scores indicating more mindfulness.</description>

    <measure>Smoking status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking status will be measured as dichotomous outcome (yes or no). If yes, the amount of cigarettes smoked per day will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Alcohol use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, and 12 months.</time_frame>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be used for estimating preference weight for health status, which is combined with time in order to compute quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The cost-effectiveness analysis includes health-care and non-health-care costs and is performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Outcomes are the total costs and QALYs. From these costs and QALYs incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are calculated.</description>

    <description>Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured programme of 8 weekly sessions of 2-2,5 hours in groups of 8-16 participants organized at the hospital sites. Additionally, participants are encouraged to practice each day for 30-45 minutes using audio-recordings of the guided exercises. The programme is provided by experienced mindfulness teachers according to the standard MBSR protocol, except for the all-day session.</description>
