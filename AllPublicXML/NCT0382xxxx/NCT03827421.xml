  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Doppler is a noninvasive tool. Using velocity measurements and pulsatility index
      it allows the evaluation of cerebral haemodynamics. In patients presenting brain injury
      cerebral perfusion may be impaired. Indirect cerebral blood flow can be monitored and risk of
      neurological worsening can be detected using transcranial Doppler. Education and performance
      of emergency physicians must be evaluated on brain-injured patients because this tool is
      operator dependent. The main objective of this study is to estimate the average number of
      exams required to learn transcranial Doppler within junior emergency physicians with the
      achievement of their learning curve. We will perform a prospective, monocentric,
      observational study within the neurosurgical resuscitation department of Grenoble Alpes
      University Hospital.

      The transcranial dopplers will be carry out on 75 brain-damaged patients by 13 emergency
      residents physicians after a theoretical and practical training. They will be evaluated by 8
      experts. The primary endpoint will be the mean number of transcranial dopplers required to
      have an excellent concordance between resident and expert. The concordance between the
      Doppler findings of the resident and the expert would exceed 0.8 before 30 examinations. The
      learning curve assessed on the duration necessary to acquire good quality data should
      decrease rapidly with the repetition of the examinations. Validating the transcranial Doppler
      learning curve for junior emergency physician would allow them to perform this exam safely
      and efficiently. Transcranial Doppler may be easy and fast to learn but the persistence of
      its competency over time should be evaluated.
