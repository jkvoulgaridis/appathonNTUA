  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a personalized patient
      education program to the current hospital education and evaluate its impact using patient
      satisfaction scores.

      The investigators hypothesize that a personalized patient education intervention will
      increase patient's understanding of their diagnosis and satisfaction with the care as
      reflected in the survey results.

    <intervention_model_description>Study team members will randomize patients to receive either the current standard hospital education material or the new personalized education material. Investigators will use a stratified randomization process to allocate the patients from different categories including age range, gender, and discharge diagnosis into each group. Thereby the investigators will achieve equal distribution of diagnoses and other demographics among groups in real time. They will review the two groups when performing statistical analysis near the end of the study to ensure heterogeneity of distribution.
A study team member who has also been a member of the care team will use the either the current hospital standard or the new personalized education materials to explain the discharge diagnosis to the patient, the treatment, and the follow up needed. The study team member will also give a survey with a preaddressed envelope to each participant to complete at his or her convenience.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects will be expected to mail the feedback forms within 2 weeks of discharge. Investigators will mail a single reminder prepaid return mail with a copy of the questionnaire to patients who do not respond within this time allowing 1 month total time.</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will answer a survey consisting of seven multiple-choice questions regarding their perception of the education intervention. Each questions will be scored on a scale of one to four for a total possible score of 28 for all 7 questions. A score of 1 indicates a negative perception of the education whereas 4 indicates the most positive impression. Therefore the lowest possible score is 7 for a severely negative perception of the education and the highest score is 28 for a very positive impression of the education program. Only the total scores will be compared for statistical analysis. Scores from patients in the current standard and new personalized education intervention groups will be compared.</description>
