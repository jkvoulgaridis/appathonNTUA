  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the effect of acute caffeine (CAF) and placebo (PLA)
      supplementation on physical capacity and discipline-specific exercise performance in
      athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caffeine (CAF) is often proposed as an ergogenic agent, especially during high-intensity
      efforts. CAF supplementation may reduce effort-induced multi-faceted symptoms of fatigue and
      can improve psychomotor functions (like agility or decision-making processes), which is
      required during the intermittent high-intensity efforts in combat sports and speed-strength
      disciplines. Moreover, it is suggested that CAF treatment is associated with increased
      glycolytic activity during simulated or real training/competition bouts, which results in
      performance and physical capacity improvement.

      However, there are hardly any data on the individual CAF-induced and dose-dependent changes
      in physical capacity and discipline-specific performance in combat sports and speed-strength
      disciplines. Therefore, the study aims to examine the effect of acute, different-dose CAF
      ingestion on physical capacity and discipline-specific performance in combat sports and
      speed-strength athletes, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.

    <description>The experimental procedure for each athlete includes an acute CAF supplementation in a different-dose crossover regimen in order to assess whether the dose affects the actual physical capacity and discipline-specific exercise performance (doses: 3.0-, 6.0- and 9.0 mg/kg of body mass, respectively). CAF (pure pharmaceutical caffeine) will be administered in the dissolved form. On testing days, the supplements will be taken 45 min before physical and exercise capacity test session. Between the CAF and PLA or a PLA and CAF treatments, a minimum 7-day washout period will be introduced.</description>
