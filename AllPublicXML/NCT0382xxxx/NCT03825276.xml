  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mango is rich in bioactive compounds such as dietary polyphenols and carotenoids, which may
      explain its beneficial effect on health. Polyphenols accumulate in the gut where they can
      positively modulate the microbiota. As gut microbiota may have a strong influence on
      cardiometabolic health, we hypothesize that mango consumption improves metabolic profile in
      overweight or obese individuals through beneficial changes in gut microbiota. The study of
      metagenomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics will be used to validate this hypothesis.
