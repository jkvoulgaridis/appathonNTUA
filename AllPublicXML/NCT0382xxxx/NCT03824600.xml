      Registry of patients undergoing invasive fractional flow reserve measurement using a
      motorized device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective registry of patients undergoing clinically indicated coronary angiography with
      fractional flow reserve evaluation for vessels with intermediate coronary lesions defined as
      visual diameter stenosis between 30% and 70%. A motorized fractional flow reservepullback
      evaluation will be performed at the discretion of the operators. The objective of the present
      study is to describe the physiological patterns of coronary artery disease using motorized
      coronary pressure pullbacks during continuous hyperemia in patients with stable coronary
      artery disease.

    <description>Describe the physiological patterns of coronary artery disease using motorized coronary pressure pullbacks during continuous hyperemia in patients with stable coronary artery disease. A pullback device adapted to grip the coronary pressure wire with a speed of 1 mm/sec during continued pressure recording will be used. A fractional flow reserve value every 100 microns will be extracted from the pressure tracing and plotted against the length to generate a pullback curve. Fractional flow reserve will be defined as the ratio of the moving average of the proximal and distal coronary pressures. The patterns of physiological disease will be classified as focal or diffuse according to the visual inspection of the fractional flow reserve pullback curve. The patterns of coronary artery disease will be reported as a focal, diffuse or combined pattern (i.e. focal and diffuse).</description>

    <description>Based on the data obtained using the fractional flow reserve pullbacks and conventional coronary angiography a quantitative classification of the physiological pattern of coronary artery disease based on the functional contribution of the epicardial lesion (i.e. lesion-related pressure drop) with respect to the total vessel fractional flow reserve will be explored.</description>
