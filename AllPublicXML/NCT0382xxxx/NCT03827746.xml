  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The kinesiophobia; defined as irrational fear of movement, which may occur after painful
      injury and reduce physical activity. It develops the idea that movement in individuals will
      cause re-injury and cause additional pain to existing pain. Studies have shown that this
      situation leads to a decrease in physical fitness, avoidance of activity, decrease in quality
      of life and even depression in the long term. It is known that functional problems such as
      balance problems and decrease in physical activity level occur in patients with Parkinson's
      disease. However, in the literature, there is no study investigating the presence of
      kinesiophobia in patients with Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the aims of our study were to
      1) determine the presence / absence of kinesiophobia in patients with Parkinson's disease 2)
      determine the relationship between kinesiophobia and falling, balance, physical activity
      level in the presence of kinesiophobia.

    <description>14-item scale designed to measure balance of the older adult in a clinical setting. Scoring: A five-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0-4. &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest level of function and &quot;4&quot; the highest level of function. Total Score = 56 41-56 = low fall risk 21-40 = medium fall risk 0 -20 = high fall risk</description>

    <time_frame>5-7 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 10 item scale where each item is rated on a scale of 1-10. A score of 10 signifies no confidence in these activities; a score of 1 indicates confidence. Out of a total score of 100, a score of 70 or above indicates the individual has a fear of falling.</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short form</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses the types of intensity of physical activity and sitting time that people do as part of their daily lives are considered to estimate total physical activity in MET-min/week and time spent sitting. Walking = 3.3 METs Moderate Intensity = 4.0 METs Vigorous Intensity = 8.0 METs Total MET-minutes/week = Walk (METs*min*days) + Mod (METs*min*days) + Vig (METs*min*days)
1. Low: • No activity is reported OR • Some activity is reported but not enough to meet Categories 2 or 3. 2. Moderate: • 3 or more days of vigorous activity of at least 20 minutes per day OR • 5 or more days of moderate-intensity activity and/or walking of at least 30 minutes per day OR • 5 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorousintensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 600 MET-minutes/week. 3. High: • Vigorous-intensity activity on at least 3 days and accumulating at least 1500 MET-minutes/week OR • 7 or more days of any combination of walki</description>
