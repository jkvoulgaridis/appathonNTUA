  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelin is a human hormone which has been associated with increased portal pressure in
      patients with liver cirrhosis (also called portal hypertension). Ambrisentan blocks the
      effects of endothelin. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of ambrisentan on
      portal pressure and renal function in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis and with portal
      hypertension. In this study, portal pressure will be determined at multiple times with the
      aid of a catheter inserted into the body of the patient. The effect of ambrisentan on the
      function of the kidney will also be investigated. This study will also evaluate the
      concentrations of ambrisentan in blood in patients with liver cirrhosis.

    <measure>Mean change in Hepatic Vein Pressure Gradient (HVPG) from Baseline to Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline HVPG is defined as the HVPG assessment performed prior to the first study drug administration. Day 14 HVPG is defined as the HVPG assessment prior to the last dose of study drug. The mean change in HVPG will be calculated as the difference between the HVPG assessment performed at Day 14 and the HVPG assessment performed at baseline</description>

    <measure>Change in 24-hour Urinary Sodium Volume (UNaV)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The change in 24-hour Urinary Sodium Volume (UNaV) will be calculated as the difference in 24-hour UNaV at Baseline and the 24-hour UNaV at Day 1 (after the first study drug administration).
Urinary sodium volume collected in the 24 hours of baseline will be compared to the Urinary sodium volume collected in the 24 hours after the first dose of the drug. Collection of urine will be ongoing for 48 hours in total.</description>

    <measure>Change in abdominal girth</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The change in MELD score will be calculated as the difference in MELD score at baseline and the MELD scores recorded throughout the study.
The MELD score is calculated according to the following formula:
MELD = 3.78×ln[serum bilirubin (mg/dL)] + 11.2×ln[INR] + 9.57×ln[serum creatinine (mg/dL)] + 6.43
The MELD score provides an indication of the anticipated mortality observed in previous studies when subjects were followed for 3-months, according to the following ranges:
71.3% mortality if score is 40 points or more
52.6% mortality if score between 30-39 points
19.6% mortality if score between 20-29 points
6.0% mortality if score between 10-19 points
1.9% mortality if score 9 points or less
The MELD score will be calculated at each visit during a 28 day period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Child-Pugh score</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The change in Child-Pugh score will be calculated as the difference in Child-Pugh score at baseline and the Child-Pugh scores recorded throughout the study
The Child-Pugh score provides information on the prognosis of a patient based on 5 clinical parameters which are individually graded. These parameters include laboratory values and other clinical information from the patient, such as the presence of ascites or hepatic encephalopathy. A lower score signifies a better chance and a higher score indicates a worse chance of survival at one year. Once the score is calculated it is further subclassified into three stages, depending on the score:
Child A - the score is between 5 and 6. The survival rate is 100%
Child B - the score is between 7 and 9. The survival rate is 80%
Child C - the score is between 10 and 15. The survival rate is 45%</description>
