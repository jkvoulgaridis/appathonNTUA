  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testing of a new ready-to-use Tape in comparison to the currently used skin prick test for
      the diagnosis of allergies. Assessment of clinical equivalence of the SPT Tape for
      representative common inhalant allergens to conventional SPT in terms of wheal reaction
      positivity and overall safety. Tests are performed in patients who have a medical history of
      relevant allergic rhinitis to any of the tested allergens.

      An open-label, single site bridging study. Subjects with a history of in-halation allergies
      will be tested in parallel with the SPT Tape and with the conventional SPT procedure using
      one forearm each.

      In each patient, a panel of 8 allergens with the SPT Tape and with the conventional SPT is
      applied on the two forearms one time only.

      The following Soluprick® allergens and control solutions will be evaluated:

      Positive control, negative control, Phleum pratense, birch, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus,
      D. farinae, dog dander, cat dander, mugwort, Alternaria sp. The allergens used for the SPT
      and the SPT Tape are identical Soluprick allergen solutions; allergens will be applied in the
      same location and order on both arms.

    <description>The Skin Prick Test Tape is an innovative sterile &quot;all-in&quot; drug carrying 8 allergens and 2 control solutions including prick needles in one Tape for easy use and standardization. Single use. Reading of wheal reactions after 15 minutes, facilitated by stripes with the allergen names.</description>

    <description>The conventional SPT is the world-wide standard in allergy Type 1 diagnosis for inhalant and food allergens. Drops of allergens are applied to the forearm and, with the help of a lancet, brought into the skin. Reading of wheal reactions after 15 minutes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be included only, if

               2. they are at least 18 years of age,

               3. they have a history of allergic rhinitis due to grass and/or birch pollen, house
                  dust mites, mugwort, cat and/or dog dander, and/or Alternaria since 2 years or
                  more

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects may not be included, if

                    3. severe diseases,

                    4. impaired reactivity of the skin (e.g. hyperkeratosis, ichthyosis, urticaria
                       factitia) and acute chronic eczema in the skin test areas, skin infections,

                    5. pregnancy or nursing,

                    6. treatment with β-blockers,

                    7. treatment with antihistamines or systemic glucocorticoids during the last 4

                    8. treatment with tricyclic antidepressants benzodiazepines, and neuroleptic
                       drugs which may have histamine-antagonistic effects during the last 2 weeks,

                    9. participation in any other medication study at the study time
