      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate both the safety and efficacy of using the
      NuShield® allograft in addition to standard of care surgical procedures in subjects requiring
      surgical repair of the peroneal tendon. The effects of this treatment will be assessed using:

        -  Questionnaires

             -  Visual Analog Scale Foot and Ankle (VAS FA)

             -  FAAM Sport

             -  PROMIS Global Health SF

             -  Tegner Activity Scale

             -  Foot and Ankle Outcomes Instrument (Q1, Q2)

        -  Swelling assessments

        -  Ultrasound imaging for tendon thickness, gliding and adhesion formation
