  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective multicenter clinical study, to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the treatment with Allergovac Poliplus subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) with a
      mixture of 2 allergenic extracts (pollens or mites), in polymerized-depot formulation,
      administered in its different available allergenic extracts mixtures (2 pollens or 2 mites),
      and in one of the 2 recommended administration schedules (1 Day or Rapid).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Combined Symptoms and Medication Score (CSMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Basal-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The score ranged from 0 to 6 points and is obtained as follows:
Symptoms Score (SS) (from 0 to 3 points) + Medication Score (MS) (from 0 to 3 points). Through these 2 sub-scales the total score of the Combined Symptom and Medication Scale (CSMS) is obtained as follows:
CSMS = SS (0-3) + MS (0-3) = 0-6 points The 0 value indicate no symptoms and no medication, and 6 points indicate the worst state of symptoms and the highest medication step</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Basal-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RQLQ has 28 questions in 7 domains (activity limitation, sleep problems, nose symptoms, eye symptoms, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems and emotional function). It is a self-administered questionnaire where patients respond to each question on a 7-point scale (0 = not impaired at all - 6 = severely impaired). The overall RQLQ score is the mean of all 28 responses and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains. Higher scores reflect lower quality of life.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged between 5 and 60 years with allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis
             mediated by IgE, caused by sensitization to more than one allergenic source (pollens
             or mites) and with or without associated mild / moderate asthma.

          2. Patients susceptible to receive treatment with Allergovac Poliplus (SCIT), according
             to usual clinical practice

          3. Patients who have given their signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received or initiated treatment with Allergovac Poliplus previously
             to study inclusion.

          2. Patients who have received previous immunotherapy treatment, both subcutaneous (SCIT)
             and sublingual (SLIT), with any of the allergenic extracts that they plan to receive,
             in the 5 years prior to study inclusion.

          3. Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may present difficulties that prevent
             the understanding of what was written in the informed consent form or the completion
             of self-administered questionnaires / scales or the patient's diary.

          4. Patients who are participating in another clinical trial or observational study with
             any drug.
