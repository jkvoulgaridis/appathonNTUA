  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral pain medicine is largely absent from perioperative pathways, and on post-surgical
      recovery units. The goal of this project was to develop and implement &quot;Recovery Toolkits&quot;,
      physical branded bags presented to patients after surgery. The &quot;Recovery Toolkits&quot; include a
      descriptive brochure and orientation to the contents of the bag. &quot;Recovery Toolkits&quot; include
      a behavioral pain medicine self-help book, an app with a downloadable pain management
      audiofile, earbuds, and a pen. Patients on each unit have access to iPads where they may view
      a digital behavioral pain medicine program (&quot;My Surgical Success&quot;), consisting of three
      15-minute video learning modules. The &quot;Recovery Toolkits&quot; are psychologist-developed and
      nurse-delivered to every patient on the surgical recovery units. This pragmatic project seeks
      to understand:

        1. Nurse perceived value of the intervention

        2. Burden to nurses to deliver the intervention to all patients

        3. Patient engagement with the Recovery Toolkits

        4. Patient perceived value of the Recovery Toolkits

        5. Patient satisfaction with pain care

        6. Impact of Recovery Toolkits on pain and opioid use in hospital and at one-month
           discharge relative to a pre-Recovery Toolkit program cohort of patients.

      The Stanford &quot;Recovery Toolkit&quot; program is delivered by nurses across multiple surgical
      recovery units and surgery types, including neurosurgery, spine, and orthopedic surgeries.
      All patients who enter the units are offered a &quot;Recovery Toolkit&quot;, which is a physical and
      branded bag. The program includes the following elements: a descriptive brochure and
      orientation to the contents of the bag. &quot;Recovery Toolkits&quot; include a behavioral pain
      medicine self-help book, an app with a downloadable pain management audiofile, earbuds, and a
      pen. Patients on all participating units have access to iPads where they may view a digital
      behavioral pain medicine program (&quot;My Surgical Success&quot;), consisting of three 15-minute video
      learning modules.

      At discharge, patients are asked to evaluate their pain care and perception about the
      &quot;Recovery Toolkit&quot; in a 10-item survey that includes items as to whether the patient received
      a &quot;Recovery Toolkit&quot; (yes/no), did they use the &quot;Recovery Toolkit&quot; (yes/no), their
      satisfaction with the &quot;Recovery Toolkit&quot; (6-point likert scale), and recommendation for
      continuing the program (5-point likert scale). Chart review will extract data for
      demographics, surgery type, existing pain conditions and comorbidities, pain intensity scores
      averaged over the duration of their inpatient stay, as well as total opioid use during
      hospital stay and a daily average for inpatient opioid use. At one month after surgery,
      patients who agreed to be contacted will be asked their average pain intensity (0-10),
      whether they are taking opioid medication (yes/no) and how much (morphine equivalent daily
      dose), whether they have used the Recovery Toolkit information (yes/no), and, if yes, to
      please rate the helpfulness of the Recovery Toolkit information (0-10).

      Nurses will be surveyed to determine the level of burden to deliver the intervention (0-6),
      their perceived value of the intervention to their patients (0-6), and their assessment on
      whether the program should be continued/expanded (0-6).

Survey questions ask about pain, and satisfaction with pain care. The investigators will conduct chart review for pain and opioid use.</description>

    <description>After launch of the Recovery Toolkit program on Jan 25, all post-surgical patients will be offered a Recovery Toolkit by a unit nurse. A pain survey will be administered at hospital discharge to assess about pain in the hospital, satisfaction with pain care, whether they received a Toolkit, use of the Toolkit, and likelihood to recommend the Toolkit. The investigators will conduct chart review for pain and opioid use.</description>
