    <textblock>
      Overweight and obese endometrial cancer (EC) survivors at the University of North Carolina
      (UNC) at Chapel Hill will be approached for tailored feedback fitness intervention. The
      investigators plan to enroll 36 women (18 in each arm) to evaluate if receipt of weekly
      tailored feedback messages can improve physical activity in EC survivors. It is hypothesized
      that women receiving the feedback message intervention will increase step counts from
      baseline more than 2,000 steps compared to women in the non-intervention arm.

      Objectives:

        -  To assess if a tailored feedback fitness intervention can increase physical activity in
           EC survivors from baseline to 12 weeks post-baseline

        -  To determine the acceptability of the fitness intervention in EC survivors through a
           completion survey.

        -  To assess if a tailored feedback message fitness intervention can (1) decrease BMI, (2)
           reduce waitst to hip (W.H) ratios, (3) improve quality of life (QOL) and (4) improve
           serum metabolic markers (insulin, glucose and low density lipoprotein (LDL) in EC
           survivors.
