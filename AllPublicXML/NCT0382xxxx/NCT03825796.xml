    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well CPX-351 and enasidenib work in treating patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia characterized by IHD2 mutation that has come back. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as CPX-351, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Enasidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving CPX-351 and enasidenib may work better in treating patients
      with acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the remission rate (defined as complete remission [CR]/ CR with incomplete
      hematologic recovery [CRi]) of the combination of liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) plus enasidenib mesylate (enasidenib) in adults with
      relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by a 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) producing
      IDH2 mutations that include IDH2^R172 and IDH2^R140.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate persistent severe hematologic toxicity at induction day 60 in patients with a
      morphologic leukemia-free state (bone marrow blasts &lt; 5%).

      II. To evaluate delayed CR/CRi with enasidenib maintenance in participants with stable
      disease after induction with CPX-351.

      IV. To evaluate 30- and 60-day survival. V. To evaluate CPX-351 plus enasidenib as a bridge
      to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the co-existing mutations that are present with the IDH2 mutation and
      describe those that are present in patients who achieve CR/CRi.

      II. To determine the depth of molecular response to induction by minimal residual disease
      (MRD) using next generation sequencing.

      III. To estimate the subclinical cardiotoxicity of CPX-351 as measured by troponin I,
      electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine intravenously (IV)
      over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5, and enasidenib mesylate orally (PO) on days 10-60 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients whose bone marrow is not
      hypoplastic with no excess blasts receive re-induction including liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine IV on days 1 and 3, and enasidenib mesylate PO on days 8-60 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients &lt; 60 years receive cytarabine twice daily (BID) on days 1, 3, and 5,
      and patients &gt;= 60 years receive cytarabine IV once daily on days 1-5. Patients also receive
      enasidenib mesylate PO on days 6-55. Treatment repeats every 28-55 days for up to 4 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who maintain CR/CRi
      after completion of consolidation therapy undergo allogeneic HSCT at the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive enasidenib mesylate PO daily in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days, then periodically
      thereafter.
