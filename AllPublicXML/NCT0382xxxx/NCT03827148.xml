  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of pharmacist intervention in
      improving disease knowledge, adherence to treatment, health related quality of life and
      direct cost of treatment. The study also documented patient satisfaction with pharmacist
      counselling as a quality control measure.

      This is a randomized controlled single-blind two-arm trial in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis in Karachi, Pakistan. The study will enroll patients with established diagnosis of
      rheumatoid arthritis over three months. The patients after signing written consent would be
      randomized through a computer-generated list in control group, i.e., usual care and
      intervention group, i.e., pharmaceutical care with a ratio of 1:1. The study will take place
      in three patient-visits over the course of three months. The patients would be intervened by
      pharmacist in intervention group while those in control group will have usual care. Primary
      outcomes include change in mean score at follow-up, i.e., week 12, for disease knowledge,
      adherence to medications and rehabilitation/physical therapy, health related quality of life
      (HRQoL). The secondary outcomes include change in the mean direct cost of treatment and
      patient satisfaction from pharmacist counselling.

      This is a novel study that evaluates the role of pharmacist in improving treatment outcomes
      of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The results of this trial could set the foundation for
      future delivery of care for such patients in Pakistan. The results of this trial would be
      published in a peer-reviewed journal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the joints and
      results in pain, swelling and decreased mobility. The disease over the course of time, leads
      to joint deformity and disability. The disease ranks third as major cause of disability after
      osteoarthritis and gout and affects roughly 1% of global population. Decrease mobility in
      patients results in decreased productivity and further worsens their quality of life. While
      pharmacological treatment may be essential in managing the acute flares and episodic pain
      associated with the disease, self-care and home-based management of RA is another important
      area of care which patients need to incorporate to manage it effectively.

      Several studies have reported that self-care in RA effectively reduces acute flares. This
      could be done through the use of patient education and counselling. Pharmacist provide
      pharmaceutical care that incorporates these areas of care. Pharmaceutical care is an
      individualized patient-centric health service delivered by pharmacists that incorporates, but
      is not limited to, disease education, therapy management, self-care and self-management of
      disease and therapy as well as motivational guidance.

      Evidence from several randomized trials indicate that patient counselling, disease education
      and telephonic interventions have improved self-care practices of patients. Educating
      patients about managing RA empowers them in understanding signs and symptoms of disease and
      devise ways to reduce or limit aggravating factors. A randomized trial conducted by Petkova
      that involved community pharmacy-based patient education program improved treatment outcomes
      of arthritis patients. Moreover, Mary and colleagues demonstrated positive effect of mobile
      phone short message service on medication adherence of patients with RA.

      In the last decade there has been only few studies that have evaluated the impact of
      pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care on treatment outcomes in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis. In Pakistan, no study has been conducted till date that evaluates the same. Since,
      the disease prevalence has increased in Pakistani population of late, and mainly affects the
      middle-aged individuals, it is expected to affect their productivity, employ-ability and
      income. This would worsen their health-related quality of life and adds to economic burden of
      this disease on the society. Therefore, a need was felt to evaluate the impact of
      pharmacist-delivered pharmaceutical care on treatment outcomes in Pakistani patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized single-blind parallel trial. The patients who participate in this study after signing of consent would be randomly assigned to either control group (CG), i.e., usual care or intervention group (IG), i.e., pharmaceutical care. The allocation ratio will be 1:1. The participants in the intervention group would be counselled by pharmacist, provided a disease education literature and would have access to pharmacist for 90 days via telephone. The participants in the control group would received usual care without pharmacist intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The investigators, data collectors, study observers, data entry operators and data analysis statistician will be blinded to the allocation. The patients in the control group will be blinded to pharmacists as they would not know if the person they find in the room is a pharmacist or, a data collector. Similarly, the data collector would not know if the patient belong to IG or CG. However, the patients enrolled in intervention group will not be blinded to the pharmacist considering the nature of intervention yet, the pharmacist will be blinded to the outcome assessment so that there will be less likelihood of intervention bias.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient knowledge regarding rheumatoid arthritis will be assessed after three months (week 12) from baseline (week 0). The Rheumatoid Knowledge Assessment Scale (RAKAS) will be used to measure rheumatoid arthritis disease knowledge. The RAKAS is a thirteen-item scale that contains questions related to knowledge, symptoms, treatment and risk factors. The items are multiple choice questions (MCQs) and correct answer awards a score while the wrong answers provides no score. A cumulative score is calculated which is interpreted as excellent, good, low and poor knowledge.</description>
