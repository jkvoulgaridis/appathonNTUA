    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, females with a diagnosis of thumb CMC OA, will be recruited. The
      primary outcome of potential risk factors of osteoarthritis, pain and function will be
      measured using the demographic data, visual analog scale (VAS) and Disabilities of the Arm,
      Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH). Secondary out-comes will include the Pain Self-Efficacy
      Questionnaire (PSEQ), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), Fear Avoidance Beliefs
      Questionnaire (FABQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Impairment and
      Functioning Inventory (IFI). Measurements will be taken at the baseline, three, six and 12
      months follow up.

      The study will start recruitment in April 2019.In this clinical trial, 50-100 females, aged
      50 to 90 years of age, with a diagnosis of thumb CMC OA, will be recruited. The primary
      outcome of potential risk factors of osteoarthritis, pain and function will be measured using
      the demographic data, visual analog scale (VAS) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and
      Hand (QuickDASH). Secondary out-comes will include the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire
      (PSEQ), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ),
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Impairment and Functioning Inventory (IFI).
      Measurements will be tak-en at the baseline, three, six and 12 months follow up.

A total score, ranging from 0 to 60, is calculated by adding the scores for each item. Higher scores reflect stronger self- efficacy beliefs.</description>

    <description>measure of fear of movement, the total score ranges between 17 and 68. A high value on the TSK indicates a high degree of kinesiophobia, and a cutoff score was developed by Vlaeyen (1995), where a score of 37or over is considered as a high score, while scores below that are considered as low scores. Use of a total score (including all 17 items) is recommended, although practitioners may wish to interpret results using two subscales</description>

    <description>self report measure of avoidance of activities of daily livin, The questionnaire consists of 16 items in which a patient rates their agreement with each statement on a 7-point Likert scale. Where 0= completely disagree, 6=completely agree. There is a maximum score of 96. A higher score indicates more strongly held fear avoidance belief</description>
