  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial (1:4 ratio of placebo to
      vaccine) of Hepatitis E virus vaccine containing a 239 amino acid subfragment of Hecolin(R)
      (HEV-239) in 25 US males and non-pregnant females ages 18 - 45 (inclusive) to assess the
      safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of HEV-239. Subjects will receive 3 doses of study
      product on Days 1, 29, and 180. Subjects will remain in the study for up to 13 months
      (including screening). The study duration will be approximately 15 months. Subjects will be
      observed for 30 minutes after vaccination. The occurrence of solicited injection site and
      systemic reactogenicity events will be measured from the time of study vaccination through
      Day 8 after each vaccination. These will be ascertained through use of an electronic memory
      (e-memory) aid, a telephone call on day 4 after each dose of vaccine, a Day 8 clinic visit,
      and potentially at the Day 15 clinic visit after each dose of vaccine. Unsolicited adverse
      events will be collected from vaccination through Day 29 after each vaccination. Serious
      adverse events will be collected from the time of the first study vaccination through the
      last study visit (Day 360). The study includes multiple phlebotomy time points for
      immunogenicity and blood collection for future use at visit 1 and Days 8, 15, and 29 after
      each vaccination. The durability of the immune response and future use collection will be
      assessed at 5 months after the first boost (Day 180) and at 6 months after the second boost
      (Day 360). The primary objectives of the study are to; 1) assess the safety and
      reactogenicity of HEV-239 following delivery of each vaccine dose; and 2) assess the number
      of subjects with &gt; / = 4 fold rise in Hepatitis E virus (HEV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) at any
      time after vaccination.

      number of subjects with HEV IgG seroconversion at any time after vaccination; and 3) Assess
      the HEV IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) at any time after vaccination.

             gonadotropin (beta-HCG) pregnancy test at screening and negative urine beta-HCG
             pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to (each) vaccination.

          4. Subject must be in good general health as determined by medical history, vital signs*,
             body mass index (BMI)**, physical examination, and clinical judgment of the

          5. Subject's screening laboratory values*,** must be within site normal limits*** within
             28 days of enrollment.

             *Screening labs will include: White blood cell (WBC) count; Hemoglobin (HgB);
             Platelets; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC); Absolute eosinophil count (AEC);
             Creatinine; Glucose (random, must be &lt; 140); Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT); HIV 1/2
             antibody/antigen test, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and Hepatitis C virus
             (HCV) antibody.

             **Minor abnormalities are considered acceptable if not clinically significant (e.g.,
             Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)). Repeating the screening tests once is permitted for
             out-of-range values provided there is an alternative explanation for the out-of-range

             **Abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse), monogamous
             relationship with vasectomized partner, barrier methods such as male or female condoms

             immunogenicity outcomes of the protocol.

             ***Use of systemic, over-the-counter medications and PRN systemic, prescription
             medication may be allowed if, in the opinion of the investigator, they pose no
             additional risk to subject safety or assessment of immunogenicity/reactogenicity.

         11. Has a known or suspected congenital or acquired disease that impairs the immune

         12. Has prior organ and/or stem cell transplant.

         13. Has a history of abuse of alcohol or drugs that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the protocol.

         14. Has behavioral or cognitive impairment or psychiatric conditions that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the
             trial.

         15. Has received blood products or immunoglobulin within six months prior to vaccination.

         16. Travel to Asia, the Middle East, Africa, or Central America or to an area with an
             active Hepatitis E outbreak* within the last 90 days or intention to travel to such
             areas during the study.

             *Outbreaks within the last 3 years.

         17. Receipt of any inactivated vaccine from 2 weeks prior to each vaccination through 2
             weeks after each vaccination.

         18. Receipt of any live vaccine from 4 weeks prior to each vaccination through 4 weeks
             after each vaccination.

         19. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to aluminum, any component of the vaccine, or other
             serious adverse reactions to vaccines or vaccine products.

         20. Subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to adhere to the
             requirements of the study.

         21. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with assessing
