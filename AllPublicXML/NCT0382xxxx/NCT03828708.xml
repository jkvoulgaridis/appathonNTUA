  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the amount of iron in infant formula and how that affects a child's
      gut development. The children of mothers who plan to formula feed their children will be
      randomized to receive either high iron or low iron formula from birth until 4 months of age.
      Infants will consume only the study provided formula during enrollment. Blood and stool
      samples will be collected at birth and end of study to measure the effects of the iron
      exposure. The overall object is to compare high iron versus low iron exposure in formula-fed
      infants during the first months of life. Aims include determining the types of bacteria that
      are present in the infants' fecal microbiome, determining the effect of high iron exposure on
      gut microbiome and sleep patterns, and comparing iron status and homeostasis between the low
      and high iron formula groups.

      Disturbance of the gut microbial colonization during infancy may result in long-term
      programming impact of metabolism and disease risks of the host. The early gut microbial
      colonization coincides with the maturation of the infant's mucosal innate immune system and
      research showed that the gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with impaired innate immune
      development. Thus, ensuring proper microbial colonization early in life is critical to the
      maturation of the immune system and long-term health.

      Iron fortification can increase the abundance of pathogenic bacteria and induce inflammation
      in older infants. However, it is still not known what the effect of iron is on a more
      vulnerable population: the newborn infant, who has immature immune system. Infants 0-4 months
      are at a low risk for iron deficiency due to the iron endowment at birth, which is compatible
      with the very low iron content (&lt;0.5mg Fe/L) in breastmilk. However, commercial infant
      formulas are all fortified with â‰¥12mg Fe/L. Whether this striking difference drives adverse
      health effects is unknown/unexamined, especially on early colonization and immune
      homeostasis. The overall objective is to determine the impact of high vs. low iron exposure
      in formula-fed infants during the early post-natal months on gut microbiome.
