  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monitoring of intraoperative core temperature is essential for patient safety, reducing the
      risk of perioperative hypothermia. A recently developed measuring system, SpotOn® (3M, St.
      Paul, MN), measures the core temperature in a non-invasive manner. Its accuracy in patients
      undergoing general surgery has not been investigated yet. The study was aimed at comparing
      the accuracy of the SpotOn® in comparison with the oesophageal probe which is considered the
      current standard in our care units.

      the accuracy of the SpotOn® in comparison with the oesophageal probe which is considered the
      current standard in our care units. In this study, patients who were candidates for major or
      urological surgery will be considered eligible for enrollment. The core body temperature will
      be thus measured with both a single-use oesophageal probe and a SpotOn® heated controlled
      servo sensor.
