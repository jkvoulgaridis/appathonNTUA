  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vertebral column is a structure that transfers the weight of the head and torso to the
      lower extremity, provides trunk movements and protects the spinal cord.A three dimensional
      deformity involving lateral flexion of the vertebrae in the frontal plane at 10 ° and above,
      including axial rotation and physiologic flexion (hypokyphosis) components in the sagittal
      plane, is defined as scoliosis. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a type of idiopathic
      scoliosis that occurs in the period from the onset of puberty (up to 10 years) until the
      closure of growth plates.

      Scoliosis is caused by postural, balance and neuromotor disorders as a primary cause of
      impaired sensory integrity, proprioceptive feedback deficits, secondary lung problems, organ
      disorders and pain. In addition, the quality of life in these individuals is also seen to
      decrease.Children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have inadequate respiratory function
      and a decrease in functional capacity. At the same time, these children show muscle weakness
      in certain parts of the body.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between home based core
      stabilization training, respiratory parameters, peripheral muscle strength, balance,
      functional capacity and quality of life in individuals with young scoliosis. The
      investigators suggest that the addition of core stabilization training to children with mild
      and moderate adolescent idiopathic scoliosis will produce good results.

    <description>In addition to home based traditional scoliosis exercise, the training group will also receive core stabilization exercise training for 8 weeks, 5 days a week, for 30 minutes. Core stabilization training; exercises for 2 muscle systems that contribute to spinal stability are given. The first one is the &quot;local system&quot; muscles; multifidus, transversus abdominis, diaphragm and pelvic floor muscles. The second, the &quot;global system&quot; includes large superficial muscles, such as erector spines, rectus abdominis, internal and external obliques, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, and latissimus dorsi.</description>
