  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent multicentre randomised controlled trial compared autofluorescence imaging (AFI) with
      CE for dysplasia detection in colonoscopy surveillance of patients with longstanding UC
      (FIND-UC). In this study, CE detected significantly more dysplastic lesions per patient
      compared with AFI. It is unclear whether this increased dysplasia detection also translates
      to a reduction of dysplasia at follow-up colonoscopy. The aim of this pre-specified study is
      therefore to prospectively determine whether there is a difference in dysplasia detection at
      follow-up colonoscopy between UC patients who were randomized to AFI or CE at index
      colonoscopy for the FIND-UC trial.

        Exclusion criteria

        A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from
        participation in this study:

          -  Patients who not receive their surveillance colonoscopy with CE

          -  Patients who not undergo their surveillance colonoscopy within 3 months of the
             surveillance recommendations

        Withdrawal of individual subjects

        A patient will be excluded from the study if any of the following events occur:
