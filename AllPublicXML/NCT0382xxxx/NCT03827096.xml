  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in whom a posterolateral fusion surgery has been planned and who meet the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria were proposed to receive a single-dose AMSC treatment, in order to
      assess its safety and efficacy on posterolateral interbody fusion. After the surgery, the
      subjects were followed up as out-patients during 5 study visits for 12 months in total.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following informed consent collection at the screening visit and verification of all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible patients will undergo the procedure of bone marrow
      cell aspiration from iliac crest for the purpose of receiving autologous multipotent
      mesenchymal stem cells. The cells will be cultivated for 3 passages (for 3 - 4 weeks) in
      order to expand them to sufficient quantity. Suspension of the cultured AMSC will then be
      sterilely packed and transported to the surgery site. During the posterolateral spine fusion
      operation, 1.5 ml of cell suspension will be mixed with 5 cc of beta-tricalcium phosphate
      foam (Vitossâ„¢, Orthovita) and 3.5 ml of patient's blood, and inserted between the transverse
      processes of the lumbar spine.

      All subjects will be hospitalized and followed up as per standard medical care rules used in
      the investigational site hospital for this type of intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety: To demonstrate absence of complications at the site of spinal fusion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Complications at the site of spinal fusion and other treatment-related adverse events will be recorded in ten patients at Visits I through VII. All adverse events (AEs) will be classified by seriousness, severity and relationship to hAMSC application.
All AEs will be collected as symptoms spontaneously reported by the patient, clinically relevant changes and abnormalities observed by the Investigator (clinically significant laboratory measurements confirmed by repeated measurement, results of physical examinations) Intensity
The following 3-point rating scale will be used for rating of the intensity of each AE:
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity Moderate: Event sufficient to affect usual activities (disturbing) Severe: Inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy: To assess the quality of life determined by Oswestry Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life determined by Oswestry Questionnaire will be recorded in ten patients at Visits II, and IV through VII. The test has 10 sections and maximum score is 50 points; change from the baseline valie will be recorded. The points are then transferred into percentage and interpreted in a standard way when 0-20% means minimal disability while 81-100% means bed-bound condition. Minimum detectable change (90 % confidence) is 10 % (5 points).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy: To assess the quality of spinal fusion by X-ray imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of spinal fusion will be measured by X-ray imaging at Visits V and VII. Dynamic X-ray of the lumbar spine will be performed at 3 and 12 months following the surgery and hAMSC application to measure the angle of the spine movement in the fusion area. The angle will be recorded in degrees. The movements above 10 degrees will beregarded as &quot;unstable&quot;.
The bone fusion morphology will be evaluated based on the following scale:
Cyst or pseudo-cyst formation
Fusion not visible
Pseudo-joint (or false joint) development
Low degree of bone fusion
High degree of bone fusion</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy: To assess the quality of spinal fusion measured by computed tomography (CT).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of spinal fusion will be measured by CT in ten patients at Visits V and VII.
The density will of the fusion will be expressed as % on a linear scale between two standardized measuring points: soft tissue= 0%, vertebral arch= 100%.</description>
