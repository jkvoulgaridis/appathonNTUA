  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study was to determine the joint mobility levels and its effects on
      performance in male basketball players and their sedentary peers aged 16-22 years.

      According to the studies on the effect of hypermobility on the performance; The young
      athletes who played tennis had lower equilibrium results than those without hypermobility.
      Although there is not any study that investigate its effects in basketball, there are studies
      for tennis and volleyball in literature.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beighton Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Beighton score is used to assess the levels of joint mobility in people. In this scoring, the lowest score is 0 and the highest score is 9. A total score of 4 and above is considered as joint hypermobility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Y-Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Y balance test is used to evaluate dynamic balance in individuals. In the test setup, 3 pieces of tape measure are adhered to the floor in an angle of 120 degrees. At the intersection of 3 tapes, the subject is asked to stand on one foot and extend with the other foot in 3 directions, anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral. Test is repeated 3 times for each directions and the average score is recorded in cm. Higher score shows better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Flamingo Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Flamingo ebalance test is used to evaluate static balance in individuals. The aim is to be able to balance successfully on the dominant barefoot. The subject is asked to step on the wooden wedge (50x4x3 cms) with the foot. He is asked to bend other foot to the back and to hold his foot with the same hand. Till maintaning the balance, subject holds the arm of tester. After he leaves the arm, test begins. The subject is asked to keep balance within 1 minute. The stopwatch is started as soon as the person leaves the arm of the tester. The stopwatch is stopped when the subject leaves each leg or any part of the body touches the ground. Any attemptation which maintain the balance during 1 minute is considered as score. Higher scores show better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vertical Jump Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The vertical jump test is used to measure bounce strength and jump height. To perform the test, a special setup or a measurement system marked on the wall, chalk are required. The subject is asked to touch the highest point that he can reach out by extending his arm. This is called stopping height. It is important to note that the feet of the subject must be completely in contact with the ground. Then the subject is asked to reach the highest point by jumping. The difference between the height reached by the stop and the height reached by the jump give the score of test. The subject is asked to jump 3 times and the average score is recorded. Highest score shows better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>T Drill Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>T Drill test was used to assess agility and speed. 3 funnels are placed in line with a distance of 4.57 meters between them. Taking the starting point from the middle of the funnels (in the form of the letter T), it comprises a 9.14 meter forward fast run, 4.57 meter side step to the right, 9.14 meter side step to the right, 4.57 meter side step to the right and 9.14 meter backward to the right.The subject performs the test for three times. The average of the scores are recorded in seconds. Lower scores show better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>It has been developed and tested to evaluate the physical activity levels of individuals aged 15-69 years. In the short version of the questionnaire consisting of 7 questions; information on time spent walking, moderate to severe and violent activities are provided. According to questionnaire lower scores show physical inactivity levels.</description>

        The e-picos website was used to calculate the sample size. We used correlation coefficient
        (r = 0.505) from Acar et al's study in tennis players according to flamingo test results.
        When 90% power for each group is determined as α = 0.05, sample size is determined as 37.
        Considering the possibility of drop out by 10 percent, the sample size was determined as
        41. 41 basketball players and 41 sedentary peers were included in the study.
