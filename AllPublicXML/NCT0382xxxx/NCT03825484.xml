  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this program is to provide participants an early access to erdafitinib prior
      to market authorization (that is, Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approval in the United
      States). The program is limited to participants with advanced cancers and fibroblast growth
      factor receptor (FGFR) genetic alterations who have exhausted at least 2 lines of standard of
      care therapy and who are not eligible for an erdafitinib clinical trial.

    <description>Participants will start erdafitinib 8 milligram (mg) (formulated as tablets with 3 mg, 4 mg and 5 mg dosages) orally once daily until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or decision by the doctor to discontinue treatment. Dose will be up-titrated to 9 mg based on serum phosphate levels and if there is no drug-related toxicity.</description>
