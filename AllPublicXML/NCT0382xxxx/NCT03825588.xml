  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this 2-site study, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and Western
      Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC), the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical
      trial (RCT) in 240 psychiatrically hospitalized suicidal adolescents, examining the single
      and additive effects of two components of an inpatient unit intervention for suicidal
      adolescents, As Safe As Possible (ASAP), which focuses on emotion regulation and safety
      planning, and an emotion regulation/safety plan phone app (BRITE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to randomize 240 adolescents psychiatrically hospitalized for suicidal
      ideation with a plan or a suicide attempt to one of four treatment arms: (1) ASAP + BRITE +
      TAU (treatment as usual); (2) BRITE + TAU (treatment as usual); (3) ASAP + TAU (treatment as
      usual); and (4) TAU (treatment as usual) alone. The investigators will assess suicidal
      ideation and behavior at 4, 12, and 24 weeks post-intake, in order to:

        1. Assess the relative efficacy of ASAP, BRITE and the combination on suicidal ideation,
           non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and suicide attempts, and re-hospitalizations.

        2. Examine mediators and moderators of treatment outcome.

        3. Examine the costs and cost efficacy of ASAP and BRITE and the combination.

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>During the RCT, the independent evaluator (IE) will be blinded to the assigned condition and will take the following steps to preserve the blind: participants and families will be asked not to share with the IE which condition they are assigned to; at staff meetings when cases are reviewed, IEs will not be present; IEs will be asked to guess what the treatment assignment is at the end of each interview, and they will notify the project coordinator if they become unblinded. Participants will complete complementary self-report forms that will not be influenced by interviewer bias.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 - 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the time to a suicide attempt or suicidal event. Ideation Intensity subscale range = 0-5 (higher values represent more severe intensity of ideation); Ideation Frequency subscale range =0-5 (higher values represent higher frequency); Suicidal Behavior subscales are categorical (yes/no) to define 1) actual attempt, 2) non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, 3) interrupted attempt, 4) aborted attempt, 5) preparatory acts or behavior, and 6) completed suicide.
Actual Lethality/Medical Damage of Suicidal Behavior subscale range = 0-5 (higher values represent greater lethality/medical damage); Potential Lethality of Suicidal Behavior subscale range = 0-2 (higher values represent greater potential lethality</description>
