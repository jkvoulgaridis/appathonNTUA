  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use eye-tracking technology to study attentional biases,
      reward sensitivity, and cognitive control in adult patients with bipolar disorder with or
      without anxiety and/or substance use disorder comorbidity.

    <measure>Measure the differences in attentional bias among the 5 groups by assessing how long it takes a subject to locate and fixate on each face on the screen</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This paradigm involves the simultaneous presentation of 2 facial images. Two facial expressions (happy-neutral, sad-neutral, fearful-neutral, and neutral-neutral) from the same actor are presented simultaneously on each side of the screen. For each participant, happy, sad, fearful, and neutral facial expressions are randomly assigned to each side with each emotion category presented on each side with equal frequency. Each trial presents happy-neutral, sad-neutral, fearful-neutral and neutral-neutral facial expression in a new random order for each participant. Each trial begins with a central cross, followed by presentation of facial stimuli for 250-500 ms. Direction of gaze is measured with x and y coordinates. The latency and velocity of eye movement will be measured. Eye movements that are stable for more than 100 msec within 1Ëšof visual angle are classified as a fixation. The time to locate the face and fixation time to each face will be compared.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure the differences in reward sensitivity among the 5 groups by assessing the amplitude of the saccade to reward and non-reward stimuli</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The reward paradigm is to measure amplitude and velocity of saccades toward reward stimuli. A saccade is a rapid eye movement made by the primate and human after they make their decision among several options. The participant will be told that he/she will be rewarded for a making a correct saccade in response to congruent conditional stimulus and she/he will not be rewarded for making a correct saccade in response to an incongruent stimulus. Each participant will have 5-10 trials to practice before the recording begins. The velocity and amplitude of saccade to reward and non-reward stimuli will be recorded for each trials. The mean velocity and amplitude to reward and non-reward stimuli among the different groups of patients will be compared.</description>

    <measure>Measure the differences in cognitive control among the 5 groups by assessing the amplitude of the antisaccade</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Antisaccade (AS) performance is a sensitive marker for cognitive control of behavior and executive functioning. In contrast to saccade, antisaccade is an eye movement away from a target of reward or non-reward stimulus. Commonly used antisaccade paradigm includes cue, preparation, and response execution. In this protocol, the patients will learn to make an antisaccade to a reward or non-reward stimulus. Patients will receive a reward for each correct antisaccade movement to reward stimuli. The paradigm will include equal number of reward and non-reward trials. Trials are pseudorandomized across runs. For the reward condition, the value of any single correct response is intentionally ambiguous to prevent subjects from keeping a running total of earnings during the task.</description>
