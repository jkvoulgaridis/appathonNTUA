    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have received all approved standard
      treatments (except Regorafenib and TAS 102) no longer have treatment options available while
      maintaining a good performance status which would allow them to receive a new treatment

      A Phase III randomized trial that compared Nexiri (Nexavar® + Irinotecan) vs irinotecan or
      versus Sorafenib alone showed a progression-free survival at two-months which was favorable
      to the NEXIRI combination ; 59% ( IC95% : 39-66 ) versus 23% (IC95% : 10-33) and 22% (IC95%:
      8-30) respectively.

      The patients treated with Irinotecan or Sorafenib alone could receive NEXIRI combination
      after progression and the progression-free survivals were 3,7 months (IC95% : 2,2-4,9) and
      3,5 months (IC95% : 2,1-3,7) in patients treated with NEXIRI or after progression and 1,9
      months (IC95% : 1,7-2,1) and 2,1 months (IC95% : 1,9-2,5) in patients treated only with
      Irinotecan and Sorafenib respectively.

      The median overall survival was higher with NEXIRI : 7,2 months (patients treated from the
      beginning of the study) and 7,9 months (patients treated after progression and crossover)
      versus 3 months in patients treated only with Irinotecan and 3,2 months in patients receiving
      only Sorafenib.

      The A870A rs603965 polymorphism of cyclin D1, a molecule involved in the initiation of cell
      division, was favorable to the NEXIRI combination on overall survival with a median of 19.6
      months versus 6.2 months for two other genotypes A/G and G/G.

      Regorafenib, which is an oral signal deactivation agent with a chemical structure very
      similar to Sorafenib, is a standard treatment in heavily pretreated mCRC patients since the
      results of CORRECT study which compared Regorafenib to placebo on overall survival showed a
      superiority of Regorafenib : 6,4 months versus 5 months (HR 0,774 [IC95% 0,63, 0,94]).

      Sorafenib isn't approved in mCRC so the objective of this NEXT-REGIRI trial is compared
      REGIRI combination (Regorafenib-Irinotecan) to Regorafenib alone in a phase III trial in
      patients in progression after having received all standard treatments and bearing genotype
      A/A of cyclin D1
