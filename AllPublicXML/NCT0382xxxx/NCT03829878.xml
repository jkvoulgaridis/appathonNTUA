  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent autism spectrum disorder subjects with associated GI symptoms will be randomized
      to receive oral dosing of CP101 capsules in Treatment Group I or matching placebo capsules in
      Treatment Group II. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness
      of CP101 in subjects with ASD and associated GI symptoms.
