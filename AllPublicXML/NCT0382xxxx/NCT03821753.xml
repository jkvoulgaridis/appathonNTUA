  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Revadiab is case-control study aimed to demonstrate that retinal capillary density is altered
      in patients with type 1 diabetes with glycemic variability compared to those with comparable
      glycemic control without glycemic variability. An OCT angiography will be used to precisely
      evaluate retinal capillary density.

      A secondary objective will be to evaluate if glycemic variability is associated with
      cognitive dysfunction, using a neuro psychologic evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HbA1c doesn't explain all the microvascular complications of diabetes, especially
      microvascular complications. Glycemic variability is associated with increased oxidative
      stress, free radicals and endothelial dysfunction; it contributes to the pathogenesis of
      diabetic complications.

      The relationship between glycemic variability and microangiopathic complications especially
      retinal but also neurological, needs to be studied.

      The principal objective of Revadiab study is to demonstrate a correlation between glycemic
      variability and macular retinal microcirculation in patient with type 1 diabetes.

      The secondary objective is to search a correlation between glycemic variability and :

        -  Alteration of cognitive functions.

        -  Severity of peripheral diabetic retinopathy and retinal neuronal damage.

        -  Other micro and macro angiopathic complications.

        -  Oxidative stress and inflammation.

      Two groups of type 1 diabetic patients will be compared:

        -  Case: Patient with significant glycemic variability.

        -  Control: Patients without glycemic variability.

      The severity of diabetic retinopathy will be evaluated by the degree of occlusion of small
      vessels in the central retinal region as measured by OCT angiography.

      Acts or Product necessary to research :

        -  Non-invasive retinal imaging (OCT and OCT- Angiography, retinophotography)

        -  Neuropsychological tests.

        -  Blood test.
