  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Beinaglutide versus glargine ,
      in individuals with type 2 diabetes who did not achieve adequate glycaemic control with oral
      antidiabetic drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wonder in clinical hypoglycemic treatment for patients with hyperglycemia,
      whether to reduce fasting blood glucose or postprandial blood glucose first.

      In this study, subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with oral medication
      will be treated with basic insulin to reduce fasting blood glucose, or with beinaglutide to
      reduce postprandial blood glucose, in order to find out which one of controling blood glucose
      can be more effective and observe the change of blood fluctuation.
