  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates targeted subsidies as a strategy to improve sanitation infrastructure
      and behaviours in communities that have reached Open Defecation Free (ODF) status after a
      Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) program. The investigator's hypothesis is that
      sanitation subsidies targeted at the most vulnerable households within ODF communities will
      increase and help sustain latrine coverage, quality, and use amongst the targeted households,
      and through a spill-over effect, amongst the rest of the community. Half of participating
      communities will receive the targeted subsidy, while the other half will not receive any
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is a widely used approach to eradicate open defecation
      in rural communities in developing countries. Using emotional triggers, CLTS promotes
      community self-help to build household latrines. In Ghana, where CLTS is part of the
      government's official sanitation strategy, a community is declared &quot;Open Defecation Free&quot;
      (ODF) when 80 percent of households own a latrine.

      There is however evidence that open defecation persists in so-called &quot;ODF&quot; communities,
      especially as the most vulnerable households (the poorest of the poor) cannot afford to
      construct or maintain durable latrines. As a result, subsidies for these vulnerable
      households have been proposed as a strategy to promote the construction of durable latrines
      and help sustain safe sanitation behaviours in communities having received CLTS.

        This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial that will enroll entire communities.
        Within a community, only specific households will be selected to receive sanitation subsidy
        vouchers. Outcomes will be measured both for voucher recipients and for the rest of the
        community.

        Inclusion Criteria (for Communities):

          -  Community was targeted by UNICEF's Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) program in
             Tatale, Yendi, and Kpandai districts in Ghana.

          -  Community has Open Defecation Free (ODF) status according to local authorities.

          -  Community has more than 15 and less than 100 households.

        Exclusion Criteria (for Communities):

          -  Community is located less than 2 kilometers away from a community in the opposite

             criteria: i) older than 65 years old, ii) person with a disability, iii) orphan or
             vulnerable child, iv) female head of household, v) widow(er), vi) terminally-ill
             persons, vii) unemployed, viii) outcast groups.
