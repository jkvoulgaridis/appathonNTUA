  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the metabolization and the bioavailability of
      bioactive compounds from Sinetrol® Xpur, a polyphenol-rich ingredient, during a 16-week long
      chronical supplementation. It will be investigated the mechanism of action in adipocyte cells
      to try to explain the beneficial effects of the ingredient on body composition, especially on
      both abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat mass.
