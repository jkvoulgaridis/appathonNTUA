    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product during the course of a clinical investigation. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not thought to be related to the investigational product. A serious AE (SAE) is any AE that results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is medically significant or requires intervention.</description>

             test at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A known allergy or history of significant adverse reaction to naloxone, other opioids
             or related compounds, or to any of the excipients

          -  Any documented clinically significant infection, injury, or illness within 1 month
             prior to screening

          -  A condition that the investigator believed would have interfered with the ability to
             provide informed consent or comply with study instructions, or that could confound the
             interpretation of the study results or put the subject at undue risk

          -  Used any opioids for 30 days prior to Day 1

          -  Required treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) within 30 days prior to
             Day 1 and during the study.
