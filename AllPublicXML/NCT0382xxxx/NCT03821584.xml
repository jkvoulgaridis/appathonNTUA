    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the proportion of patients with change in brain
      perfusion during the acute phase of migraine attack with aura.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a benign and frequent disorder. Migraine aura consists in reversible focal
      neurological symptoms developing gradually during attack. Its diagnosis relies mainly on
      patient's history, clinical examination and exclusion of other possible secondary causes to
      explain transient neurological signs. Thus it can be difficult particularly during first
      attack or during attack without headache to differentiate migraine aura from transient
      ischemic stroke. Considering the difference of care management and prognosis, an early
      distinction of migraine aura based on imaging techniques will have a particular interest. MRI
      with diffusion, SWI, Flair 2D, ARM 3D TOF, ASL sequences' are routinely performed for the
      management of acute neurological deficit. Arterial spin labeling (ASL), as a MR perfusion
      method, will be used to describe brain perfusion during migraine aura. The study hypothesis
      is that hyperperfusion occurs in brain territories corresponding to the neurological symptoms
      during migraine aura.
