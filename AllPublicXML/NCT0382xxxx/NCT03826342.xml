  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study is to test whether Health Check-up for Expectant Moms (HCEM), a
      computer-delivered screening and brief intervention (SBI) that simultaneously targets
      sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk and alcohol/drug use during pregnancy, reduces
      antenatal and postpartum risk more than an attention, time, and information matched control
      condition among pregnant women seeking prenatal care.

    <description>Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) is used to assess USOs which are sex-risk behaviors . The TLFB is a calendar assisted structured interview that provides a way to cue memory so that accurate recall is enhanced for event-level data; it has been used to assess sexual risk-taking. USOs will be assessed in the 90 days prior to the baseline, as well as the 8-week follow-up assessments.</description>
