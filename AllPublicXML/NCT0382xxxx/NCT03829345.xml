      SOlar is a multi-centre phase II clinical trial of single agent olaparib in advanced
      oesophagogastric cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric and oesophageal cancers are a significant health burden and are a leading cause of
      cancer related death. Despite improvements in survival over the last 4 decades overall the
      outcomes remain poor. In patients with advanced disease the outlook is particularly bleak
      with survival rates of less than one year with first line chemotherapy. New treatments are
      urgently needed to improve the poor survival rates in these cancers.

      Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor which blocks poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, an enzyme
      which is involved in repair of damaged DNA. By inhibiting PARP1 olaparib prevents repair of
      damaged DNA. Cells with unrepaired DNA cannot survive and die.

      This trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety/tolerability of olaparib in patients
      with advanced oesophagogastric cancer. It will be conducted in two stages:

        -  The first stage will evaluate the efficacy of olaparib in 27 patients. If 4 or fewer
           patients have control of their disease at 8 weeks then the trial for the olaparib arm
           will stop and no further patients will be recruited to the study. If 5-13 patients have
           control of their disease at 8 weeks then the study will progress to stage 2. If 14 or
           more patients have disease control at 8 weeks then a larger study may be opened in an
           unselected population.

        -  The second stage will evaluate disease control in a further 27 patients. This is to
           allow identification of potential biomarkers of response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal, gastro-oesophageal junction or gastric
             adenocarcinoma that has progressed during or within 6 months of first or subsequent

             normal (ULN) or a calculated creatinine clearance &gt;51 mL/min for patients with
             creatinine levels above institutional normal. For GFR estimation, the Cockcroft and
             Gault equation should be used: GFR = CrCl (ml/min) = (140 - age [years]) × weight (kg)
