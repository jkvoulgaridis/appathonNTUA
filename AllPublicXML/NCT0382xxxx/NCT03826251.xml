  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative management after small bowel obstruction (SBO) surgery is not consensual and
      better knowledge of risk factors for postoperative morbidity could help to add evidence of
      the feasibility of enhanced recovery programs (ERPs).

      In elective surgery, ERPs have shown a significant benefit for the patient but this is not
      performed routinely in emergency surgery due to the difficulty to avoid postoperative
      nasogastric tube.

      The aim was to identify risk factors for postoperative morbidity and for nasogastric tube
      (NGT) replacement after SBO surgery.
