  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the effect of a health system initiative
      aiming to change clinician opioid prescribing behaviors using two behavioral economic
      interventions - individual audit feedback and peer comparison feedback of clinicians.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid-related abuse and overdose represent a growing national epidemic in the United States.
      Clinician practice patterns play an important role: opioid prescriptions impact the
      likelihood that patients will misuse or become dependent on these medications, with longer
      prescriptions leading to greater sustained use. In this study, we will evaluate a Sutter
      Health System quality improvement initiative using monthly individual audit feedback and/or
      monthly peer comparison feedback to clinicians to change opioid prescribing patterns. In
      partnership with Sutter Health System, this will be conducted using randomization to evaluate
      its effect. We will also conduct a process evaluation to understand factors associated with
      better or worse performance at the clinician level.

    <description>Practice sites randomly assigned to have peer comparison feedback will be sent information by email to each clinician at the site each month for the duration of the intervention period. Data on the mean number of opioid pills per prescription and the proportion of visits with an opioid prescription will be delivered using a 3-month rolling average as follows: a) If clinician is above median: informed how their data compares to the median; b) If clinician is below median but above 10th percentile: informed how their data compares to the 10th percentile; c) If clinician is 10th percentile or below: informed of their data and commended for being a &quot;low prescriber.&quot;</description>
