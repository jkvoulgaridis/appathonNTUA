  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related cognitive decline affects negatively daily living and quality of life of older
      adults. Previous research has shown a moderate impact of cognitive and physical training on
      the cognitive functioning of elders. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the
      differential impact of multi-domain cognitive (video game training) and physical training
      (the physical exercise was Body-attack, a mixed of dance, aerobic, strength, and muscular
      resistance versus cognitive training and physical training separately, on executive control
      and memory functions of healthy older adults (N=120), in comparison with an active control
      group. Participants (between 60 and 80 years old) will be allocated randomly to one of the
      four experimental groups: 1) physical training-single domain: physical training and cognitive
      control activity; 2) cognitive training-single domain: cognitive training and physical
      control activity; 3) cognitive-physical multi-domain: physical training and cognitive
      training; 4) active control: physical control activity and cognitive control activity.
      Physical training will be group-based and include coordination, aerobic exercise and strength
      exercise. The physical control activity will include stretching and relaxation exercises. The
      cognitive training will consist of commercial brain training video games. Difficulty will be
      automatically adjusted to the performance level of the participant. The cognitive control
      activity will be cognitively non-demanding video games. Physical activities (experimental and
      control) will be trained for 40 min and cognitive activities (experimental and control) for
      40 min consecutively during the same session. There will be 2 session/wk over 3 months.
      Executive functioning, memory functions and psychological wellbeing will be assessed using
      behavioral and electrophysiological measures at baseline, after study completion and at
      3-month follow-up. The main goal was to investigate possible intervention-related transfer
      effects to untrained executive and memory functions. The goal is to find out whether
      multi-domain training improves more executive and memory functions that are often compromised
      in later years, but essential for everyday activities. We expect to find larger transfer
      effects in the multi-domain condition than in the uni-domain conditions, shorter ERP
      latencies of the P2 component, and enhanced N2 and P3b components after training.

      All participants complete one of the four combinations of cognitive training with video games
      and physical exercise. The cognitive component will be either a brain training video game
      program selected from Lumosity (cognitive intervention, CI) or video games not specifically
      designed to train attention and executive control (cognitive control, CC). The physical
      exercise component will be either Body-attack, a combination of dance, aerobic, strength, and
      muscular resistance (exercise intervention, EI) or its control condition composed of
      stretching, toning and relaxation (exercise control, EC).
