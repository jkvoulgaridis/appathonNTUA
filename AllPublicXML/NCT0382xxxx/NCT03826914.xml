  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), primarily heart disease and stroke, are the leading causes of
      death and prescription drug use in Canada. Research on certain dietary supplements looks
      promising as a way to help reduce CVD risk factors. Studies show that supplementation of
      certain nutrients such as antioxidants, amino acids, electrolytes, vitamins and minerals may
      effectively reduce cardiovascular risk factors. The dietary supplement CardioFlex Q10, which
      is high in the aforementioned components, was developed to help regulate the body's
      production of cholesterol, strengthen the arteries and heart, and reverse oxidation.

      The overall objective of this study is to determine if 90 days of supplementing with
      CardioFlex Q10 can reduce CVD risk factors in adults, independent of other dietary or
      physical activity changes.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not daily supplementation with the
      dietary supplement CardioFlex Q10 for 90 days can reduce cardiovascular risk factors in
      healthy adults. The health markers that will be tested include the participant's waist
      circumference, body weight, body mass index (BMI), atherosclerosis risk factors (blood
      pressure, plethysmogram (PTG) wave form, heart rate variability, accelerated plethysmograph
      (APG) type (biological age of arteries)), and blood work including total plasma lipid profile
      (total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL),
      triglycerides (TGs)), kidney and liver function (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), creatinine),
      and inflammatory and endothelial function biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6
      (IL-6), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell
      adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) ).

      All health markers will be tested the day before starting the study and the day after the
      study is completed.

    <masking_description>The selected participants will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to the experimental or control group. Participants in the experimental group will be given 1 serving (10g) of Cardioflex each day. Participants in the control group will be given a flavored 10g placebo that looks and tastes exactly like Cardioflex. Participants will be instructed to consume the beverage in 500mL of water upon waking each morning, prior to eating or drinking anything else.
The clinical trial is double blinded so neither the participants or investigators will know which experimental group they are in until the data collection period is over.</masking_description>

    <description>CardioFlex Q10 is a cardiovascular health supplement developed to increase collagen production, repair connective tissues, and help the body metabolize fats and protein. CardioFlex Q10 contains high amounts of lysine, proline and vitamin C, which the body requires to produce connective tissue (collagen). CardioFlex Q10 also includes additional supporting nutrients such as vitamin E, selenium, bio flavonoids, Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiqionol) and magnesium. The ingredients in CardioFlex Q10 help regulate the body's production of cholesterol, strengthen the arteries and heart, and reverse oxidation.</description>
