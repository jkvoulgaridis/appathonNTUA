  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data will be collected from 50 participants in coma. Electroencephalogram/event-related
      potentials (EEG/ERP) data will be recorded for 24 consecutive hours at a maximum of 5
      time-points spanning 30 days from the date of recruitment to track participants' clinical
      state. In the case of patient emergence (clinically diagnosed using the GCS), data are
      recorded to form an additional basis for assessment. An additional dataset from 20 healthy
      controls will be collected, each spanning a 15-hour recording period in order to formulate a
      baseline. Collected data are to form the basis for automatic analysis and detection of ERP
      components in coma. Salient features (i.e., biomarkers) extracted from the ERPs and
      resting-state EEG will be identified and combined in an optimal fashion to give an accurate
      indicator of prognosis.

    <measure>Change in multiple electrophysiological measures across specified time points during coma</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days from date of recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>Event-related potentials (ERP) and resting state periods will be assessed at the specified intervals as a difference between successive time points. The ERP measures will include amplitude and latency values of BAEP, MLAEP, N1, P2, MMN, P3a, P3b, N400 to assess different levels of conscious processing and presence of signs of a conscious state predictive of subsequent emergence. Also, resting EEG measures will be obtained at regular intervals. EEG/ERP data will be recorded for 24 consecutive hours at a maximum of 5 time-points spanning 30 days from the date of recruitment to track the participants' progression. The date of the initial assessment will be denoted as Day 0, and the subsequent assessments will take place on Day 3, Day 10, Day 20 and Day 30, unless there is a ≥ 2 point of change in the GCS scores (as specified above). Change in all specified measures will be assessed across 24 hour periods taken at 5 different time points (&quot;Day&quot; points as above).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between behavioral and electrophysiological measures after coma emergence</measure>
    <time_frame>Within a 30-day time period post recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>In the case of patient emergence (GCS diagnosed), the full electrophysiological test procedures are recorded to correlate with traditional behavioral measures. The electrophysiological measures obtained at this time point (emergence) will be compared to the same measures obtained at the 5 different time points (Outcome 1) to detect both clinically relevant change and possible prognostic markers obtained at an earlier test point.</description>

        The Coma Group (n = 50) will be selected from the Intensive Care Unit, Neurological Step
        Down Unit or Coronary Care Unit at Hamilton General Hospital (Ontario, Canada) who are in
        coma with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3-8.

        The Control Group (n = 20) of matched healthy controls will be recruited primarily from the
        Hamilton community (Ontario, Canada).
