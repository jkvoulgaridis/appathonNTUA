  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, cross-over, double blind, controlled trial in which study
      participants will visit the research facility on two occasions under fasting conditions with
      a washout period of one week. During each visit, study subjects will receive a test shake
      with phospholipid-bound choline or a control shake with choline added as a salt and DHA added
      separately. The two shakes will be given in randomised order and blood will be collected via
      a catheter before and up-to 6 hours after choline consumption. All study participants will
      receive a standardised evening meal prior to each study day and asked not to drink alcohol or
      perform heavy exercise the day before each study day. Study subjects are also asked to avoid
      choline rich products the day before each test day. Study participants are offered a meal
      after the test day.

      Choline is water-soluble vitamin-like essential nutrient. It is made in small amounts by the
      liver, but humans need to receive choline through the diet or by supplementation for proper
      health. Pregnancy and lactation are times when demand for choline is especially high. Infant
      formula not made from cow's milk is therefore supplemented with choline. Choline is therefore
      widely used. It is normally added to food products as a salt. However, if choline is present
      in a natural form, bound to phospholipids, it may be more efficiently absorbed.
      Docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) are also bound to these phospholipids.

      The primary objective is determine choline uptake and bioavailability after consumption of a
      test shake with phospholipid-bound choline (and DHA), and to compare this to a control shake
      with choline added as a salt (and DHA added as an oil). Secondary objective is to compare the
      uptake and bioavailability of DHA after the two shakes.

      The study is a cross-over, double blind, controlled trial in which study participants will
      visit the research facility on two occasions under fasting conditions. Subjects will receive
      two different choline products in randomized order with a washout period of one week. Blood
      will be collected via a catheter before and up-to 6 hours after choline consumption.
