  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Dementia rates are increasing worldwide and consequently burden global healthcare resources
      to a serious degree. However, there is a declining number of caregivers to provide care. It
      is for this reason that many new technologies, such as socially assistive robots, have been
      developed because of their potential to support caregivers in promoting the independence of
      people with dementia. Most of the (socially assistive) robots have so far been tested for
      people without dementia in mainly laboratory or institutional settings, like nursing homes.
      Consequently, there is a lack of knowledge about the possible uses of robots from the
      perspective of those affected by dementia in real-life/care situations (e.g. at home).
      Testing in a laboratory setting cannot capture the complexity and high variability of
      everyday situations occurring during the care of persons with dementia.

      Methods

      The design is a mixed method intervention study of a refined socially assistive humanoid
      robot. In total, three people with dementia, three relatives, three dementia trainers and
      three professional caregivers were included in the study. Quantitative data of technology
      acceptance were collected using the &quot;Technology Usage Inventory&quot;. Qualitative data (main
      focus: experiences with the robot and handling the robot) were collected by means of
      observation and qualitative interviews. Movement data of people with dementia were collected
      by means of the eye camera of the robot.

      This study helps to further refine and test a socially assistive robot for people with
      dementia living at home.

    <description>The questionnaire &quot;Technology Usage Inventory&quot; measures technology acceptance. It captures technology-specific and psychological factors contributing to the use of a technological device. The questionnaire has 8 dimensions (curiosity:4 items, anxiety:4 items, interest:4 items, usability/user-friendliness: 3 items, immersion:4 items, utility:4 items, skepticism:4 items and accessibility:3 items) with 30 items (7-point Likert scale). For every dimension 1- 21 or 28 points can be obtained. For all dimensions, higher levels on the respective dimension indicate a higher level of expression in the respective construct.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Persons with dementia:

          -  adults

          -  living at home

          -  all types of dementia

          -  light and moderate dementia (MMSE 10 and above)

          -  light dementia: living alone or with a relative at home (if alone: the relative should
             live in the neighborhood and be in daily contact with the person with dementia.)

          -  speak and understand German

          -  have no physical, auditory or visual restrictions, as this would make the application
             of the interventions impossible
