  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the report to assess the effect of supplementation with soybean peptides on blood
      pressure among people with mild hypertension. Overall, soybean peptides consumption for 8
      weeks could successfully reduce mean diastolic and systolic BP through the suppression of ACE
      that is linked to downstream suppresion of angiotensin II formation, which further decreases
      the sympathetic outflow that leads to hypertension.

      This is the report to assess the effect of supplementation with soybean peptides on blood
      pressure among people with mild hypertension. Thirty subjects with systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) between 120 and 159 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 80 and 99 mm Hg
      were randomized to ingest 2 bags soybean peptides or placebo perday for 8 weeks of a stage.
      Anthropometric measurements (blood pressure, body weight, body fat) and blood biochemical
      markers including fasting blood glucose (FBG), albumin, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride
      (TG), HDL-C, LDL-C, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), AST, ALT were examined every
      four weeks.
