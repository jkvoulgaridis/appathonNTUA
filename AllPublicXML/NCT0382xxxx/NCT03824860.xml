    <textblock>
      This research study will examine the feasibility of conducting an eight-week yoga
      intervention for individuals with chronic painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.
      The investigators will also explore participants' perceptions of acceptability and
      satisfaction with the yoga intervention. Lastly, the investigators will examine changes in
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy severity, physical function, sleep-related
      impairment, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and pain following the eight-week yoga
      intervention.
