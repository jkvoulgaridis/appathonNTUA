      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of
      vedolizumab for intravenous (IV) infusion 300 milligrams (mg) in ulcerative colitis (UC)
      patients in the routine clinical setting.

      The drug being tested in this survey is called vedolizumab for IV infusion 300 mg. This drug
      is being tested to treat patients who have UC.

      This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the long-term
      safety and effectiveness of vedolizumab for IV infusion 300 mg in the routine clinical
      setting. The planned number of observed patients will be approximately 1,000.

      This multi-center observational trial will be conducted in Japan.

    <description>Mayo score is used to assess UC disease activity. It consists of 4 sub-scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on sigmoidoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each ranges from 0 to 3. Complete Mayo score sums 4 sub-scores and ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <description>Mayo score is used to assess UC disease activity. It consists of 4 sub-scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on sigmoidoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each ranges from 0 to 3. Partial Mayo score sums 3 sub-scores excluding the sigmoidoscopy sub-score and ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <description>The SIBDQ is an instrument used to assess quality of life and is a disease-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire, that consists of 10 questions, each question is scored on a scale from 1 (poor quality of life) to 7 (good quality of life). The total score will be reported and is ranging from 10 to 70 with a higher score indicates a better health-related quality of life.</description>
