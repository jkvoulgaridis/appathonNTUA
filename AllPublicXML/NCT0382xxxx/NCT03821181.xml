  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moyamoya disease is a common reason of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke in
      children. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has been shown to prevent recurrent stroke in
      intracranial arterial stenosis, but it is unclear whether RIC can prevent TIA or stroke in
      children with moyamoya disease. This study aims to evaluate the effect of RIC on TIA/stroke
      in children with moyamoya disease.

    <textblock>
      This study will provide insights into the preliminary proof of principle, safety, and
      efficacy of RIC in pediatric MMD patients, and this data will provide parameters for future
      larger scale clinical trials if efficacious
