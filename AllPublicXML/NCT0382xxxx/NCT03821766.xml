  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ballistocardiography (BCG) and the seismocardiography (SCG) are old techniques recording
      the vibrations at the skin level generated by the acceleration and displacement of the blood
      and cardiac mass at each cardiac contraction. The former records the acceleration near the
      subject's center of mass, the latter at the local chest wall. So far, the unclear
      physiological origin of those acceleration signals has led to important ambiguities in their
      scientific and clinical interpretation. Therefore, several ongoing studies would aim to
      highlight the physiological genesis of those acceleration-induced signals.

      Indeed, the main objective of this study is to correlate the BCG and SCG signals recorded at
      the body surface with several haemodynamic parameters recorded invasively during a cardiac
      catheterisation, pulmonary pressure, wedge pressure, cardiac output to cite a few.

      Patients suffering from severe heart failure regardless of the etiology will undergo a
      cardiac catheterization as required by their medical condition.

      The SCG and BCG signals will be recorded simultaneously to the catheterization by the mean of
      an unintrusive and friendly device consisting of two houses, the first one placed on sternum
      and the second one in the lumbar column. The device will record a continuous tracing
      synchronized with the intracavitary pressure profiles recorded during the invasive procedure.

    <description>SCG and BCG signals will be recorded by the mean of an unobtrusive and friendly device consisting of two houses, the first one placed on the sternum and the second one place on the lumbar region near the subject's center of mass. The signal will be transferred to a tablet by Bluetooth and tracings will be analysed automatically with Matlab. The SCG+BCG signals are synchronized to the intracardiac pressure tracings in order to allow a comparative interpretation between the two tracings.</description>

        Patients suffering from heart failure and undergoing a planned cardiac catheterization as
        required by their medical condition will be asked to participate to the study.

        The inclusion criteria include heart failure regardless of its etiology. Patients with a
        left ventricle assistance device will not be enrolled because the high-frequency
        accelerations generated by the mechanical device and transmitted to the skin level will
        likely hamper the ballisto- and seismocardiographic signal.
