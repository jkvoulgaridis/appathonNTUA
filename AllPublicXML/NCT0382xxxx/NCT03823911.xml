      This is an interventional, non-randomized, controlled prospective study to treat HCV in
      mono-infected and HIV co-infected individuals and compare cardiovascular risk outcomes to HIV
      mono-infected controls. This pilot study will demonstrate whether functional cure of HCV
      reduces myocardial injury and risk of cardiovascular disease.

                  (eGFR)&lt;30ml/min/1.73m2 body surface area. The eGFR must be within two weeks of
                  the the MRI exam.

               -  Patients with acute renal disease.

         13. Patients who choose to have the cardiac MRI and are over 60 years of age, have a
             history of renal failure, or have type I or II diabetes mellitus must have laboratory
             tests the same day as the MRI exam.

Individuals with new seroconversion to HIV will have samples sent for viral sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Individuals with detectable HCV RNA after completion of HCV treatment or new infection during the follow up period will have current sample, and baseline stored sample sent for viral sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.
In addition, we will study the viral and host immunity to HCV and HIV in all patients. The results will be used to characterize each individual with regards to immune status and chronicity of disease.</ipd_description>
