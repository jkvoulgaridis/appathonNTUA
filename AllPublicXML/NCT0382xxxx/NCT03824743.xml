      Introduction:

      Obstetric hemorrhage is the most feared complication that can occur during childbirth and
      continues to be the leading cause of death in pregnant women worldwide, about 7 women die
      every hour in the world. This is defined as an accumulated loss of blood of more than 1000 mL
      with signs and symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 hours of the birth process. The main
      objective of resuscitation in these patients is precisely to reduce the deleterious effects
      that are generated from the depletion of volume and the altered capacity of oxygen transport.
      The current debate focuses on the safety and efficacy of each particular liquid during
      resuscitation and on improving long-term patient outcomes. At present, there is no conclusive
      evidence on the impact at the level of acid-base status, hydroelectrolytic balance and
      potential kidney injury with respect to the use of balanced solutions such as Plasma-Lyte or
      Ringer's Lactate.

      Objective:

      To determine the differences in the volume of liquids and blood products required with the
      use of balanced crystalloids (Ringer's Lactate or Plasma-Lyte) in patients with obstetric
      hemorrhage in the Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá during 2018 - 2019.

      Design, Materials, and methods:

      Historical cohort analytical study. All patients over 18 years of age who present an
      obstetric hemorrhage defined as bleeding&gt; 1000 mL or less associated with signs or symptoms
      of hemodynamic instability will be included. The most important exclusion criterion is the
      presence of active infection at the time of the event. Patients will be divided into two
      groups, those who underwent hydroelectrolytic resuscitation with Plasma-Lyte and Ringer
      Lactate.

      Results and conclusions With this study, we intend to describe the differences in the base
      acid status measured by arterial gases in patients with obstetric hemorrhage. The aim is to
      find a relationship between the different groups with clinical outcomes, such as days of ICU
      stay and hospitalization, blood transfusion requirement, electrolyte disorders, acute kidney
      injury and survival.

      Problem Statement Maternal mortality is a tragic event with great social, economic and legal
      impact. The incidence rate varies depending on the source, however, it covers 400 cases per
      100,000 live births per year. The first cause of death in these patients is obstetric
      hemorrhage, which generates 150,000 deaths per year in the world. Not being outside of this
      situation, Bogotá presents a high number of women who present this complication, being the
      cause of death in 29% of cases in the years 2012 and 2013. Once this problem is identified,
      multiple strategies have sought to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality, one of the most
      influential being the &quot;Millennium Development Goals&quot;, now called &quot;Sustainable Development
      Goals&quot;. Associated with these, national and regional public policies are developed that seek
      to raise awareness about the importance of timely and early diagnosis, multidisciplinary and
      synchronous management among several health areas with the aim of preventing and treating
      obstetric hemorrhage to avoid fatal outcomes.

      Within the prevention and management of obstetric bleeding, there are behaviors that have
      shown significant impact on outcomes, such as, for example, the administration of uterotonics
      in the active management of delivery, which reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage by up to
      50% or the early administration of tranexamic acid, reducing mortality by 30%. However,
      despite these advances, a fundamental part of the initial handling of support is the
      volumetric resuscitation with crystalloids and in this field, although there is an indication
      to initiate replenishment of losses it is not clear what type of liquid to use and if any
      given their characteristics intrinsic can be superior to the other.

      Justification In clinical practice, the goal of resuscitation is to return to cellular
      homeostasis. Normal saline has been used for volumetric resuscitation for more than 50 years.
      However, questions about its suitability have been raised given the association with negative
      outcomes given its composition and question whether modifications in these would bring better
      results. Multiple studies associated resuscitation with an unbalanced solution (normal
      saline) with hyperchloremic acidosis, acute kidney injury and morbidity in general,
      especially in the critically ill patient.

      However, until now the evidence is not conclusive about whether this impact on the base acid
      state, hydroelectrolytic imbalance, and potential kidney injury is less with &quot;balanced&quot;
      solutions and generate better clinical results in all scenarios, surgical patients, patients
      and particularly in hypovolemic shock due to obstetric hemorrhage.

      Research question Are there differences in the volume of fluids and blood products to be used
      in the outcomes of patients with obstetric hemorrhage with the use of balanced crystalloids
      (Lactate Ringer or Plasma-Lyte) at the Hospital Universitario Santa Fe de Bogotá during the
      years 2018 - 2019?
