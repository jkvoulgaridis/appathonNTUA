  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory functions and body control are affected in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      Because of this effect, the dependency of individuals increases in daily living activities
      and their quality of life decreases.

      We think that respiratory functions, respiratory muscle strength and trunk control affect
      vital mobility as well as vital importance for individuals with MS. As a result of the
      investigations, it is concluded that the literature is insufficient in this area.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of pulmonary function, respiratory muscle
      strength and trunk control on functional mobility in individuals with MS and compare with
      healthy individuals.

    <measure>Side Bridge Test (core muscles endurance)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to lie on their left or right sides and extend their legs straight. Then the subjects lift their hips off the ground and form a straight line with their bodies. The measurements are recorded with a chronometer as seconds. The tests end when the subjects break the test positions.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>During the test, the subjects are placed in an exercise bed that extends outwardly from the leading edge of the upper body and ensures that the upper iliac spine is flush with the bench edge. Subjects are asked to raise their arms while maintaining body positions.Measurements are recorded in seconds with a stopwatch. The tests will end when the subjects break the test positions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Push-ups Test (core muscles power)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In the push-ups test, the subjects are required to push their lower body until their elbows reach a 90° angle. They are then asked to extend their arms straight to return to the starting position.It is recorded how many times the subjects can perform each test for 30 seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lumbopelvic Stability Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Lumbopelvic stability is assessed using a stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback UnitTM (Chattanooga, Australia). With the participant lying supine on a plinth, the cushion is inflated underneath the participant's lumbar spine to 40 mmHg. Prior to testing, all participants are instructed in the &quot;abdominal hollowing&quot; manoeuvre that activates Transversus Abdominis muscle, and told to perform and continue the contraction this during subsequent lumbopelvic stability testing while attempting to minimize contraction of rectus abdominis. Scores are recorded as the highest level completed (0-5) with a pressure change no greater than 10 mmHg.</description>
