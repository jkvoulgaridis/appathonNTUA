             of screening with the exception of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alkaline
             phosphatase (ALT), which must be &lt; 1.25 times the upper limit of normal, or

             vitamin D (&gt; 1000 IU/day), glucocorticosteroids (inhaled or topical corticosteroids

             administration: bisphosphonates, fluoride for osteoporosis

          -  diagnosed with any condition that affects bone metabolism

          -  greatly differing levels of physical activity compared with the 6 months before
             investigational product administration or constant levels of intense physical
             activities

          -  routine alcohol intake of ≥ 2 drinks/day, on average, within 6 months of

          -  donated any amount of blood within 16 weeks, or over 400 mL (Note: not 400 mL but 200
             mL, for the subjects who were to be enrolled into cohorts 4 or 5) within 1 year of the
             start day of screening

          -  subject had previously entered this study

          -  any other condition that might have reduced the chance of obtaining data (eg, known
             poor compliance) required by the protocol or that might have compromised the ability
             to give truly informed consent

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
