  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experimental models have linked lipid lowering therapies with systemic inflammation; however,
      relatively little is known about this network in clinical populations and specifically how it
      changes with PCSK9 inhibition. The aim of the study is to define how PCSK9 inhibition alters
      the circulating monocyte populations and to systematically profile the transcriptional and
      proteomic responses to TLRS and how these responses are modulated by PCSK9 inhibition in the
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) clinical samples and relate these molecular
      signatures to clinical.

      Multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase IV study
      with two treatment arms: evolocumab SC 420 mg/dL QM or matching placebo. The population will
      include 40 participants with documented Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease (CAD, Stroke, PAD)
      and type 2 diabetes who receive treatment with maximal tolerated statin therapy and stable
      doses of anti-hyperglycemic therapy.

      Subjects will be followed for 12 weeks during the treatment phase, maintaining the
      double-blind throughout. Assessments of ACUTE and SHORT-TERM effects of PCSK9 inhibition with
      evolocumab on biocellular markers of endothelial function will be measured at baseline, Week
      2, and Week 12. Safety assessments will be undertaken at each study visit.

    <description>The Seattle Angina Questionnaire is a quality-of-life measure for patients with coronary artery disease. The SAQ is a self-report instrument with 19 items that yields five subscale scores: physical limitation, angina stability, angina frequency, treatment satisfaction, and disease perception. The possible range of scores for each of the five subscales is 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. There is no summary score generated.</description>
