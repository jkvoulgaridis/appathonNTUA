  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome according to 2016 ACR criteria and 18-70 years
      old healthy subjects will be included in the study. Their smell and taste will be assessed
      with sniffin sticks and taste strips. Besides they will be evaluated for quality of life,
      anxiety, depression, and alexithymia.

    <description>Sniffin' Sticks test (Burghardt®, Wedel, Germany) is a psychophysical test. It allows semi-objective assessment of the patient's olfactory performance by means of 3 subtests: threshold test, identification test and discrimination test. The Sniffin' Sticks Olfactory Test Kits contain pen like bodies as, for example, in pens used to write on flipcharts or whiteboards.These pen-like bodies, however, contain a fibre stick which is filled with scents. For testing, the cap should be removed so the patient can smell on the tip of the pen.
The taste strips are a validated examination procedure to investigate the taste ability. When testing the whole mouth taste ability, the taste strips are applied by putting them on the tongue and closing the mouth.</description>

Sniffin' Sticks test and Taste strips: Sniffin’ Sticks test (Burghardt®, Wedel, Germany) is a psychophysical test. It allows semi-objective assessment of the patient's olfactory performance by means of 3 subtests: threshold test, identification test and discrimination test. The Sniffin’ Sticks Olfactory Test Kits contain pen like bodies as, for example, in pens used to write on flipcharts or whiteboards.These pen-like bodies, however, contain a fibre stick which is filled with scents. For testing, the cap should be removed so the patient can smell on the tip of the pen.
The taste strips are a validated examination procedure to investigate the taste ability. When testing the whole mouth taste ability, the taste strips are applied by putting them on the tongue and closing the mouth.</description>

Sniffin' Sticks test and Taste strips: Sniffin’ Sticks test (Burghardt®, Wedel, Germany) is a psychophysical test. It allows semi-objective assessment of the patient's olfactory performance by means of 3 subtests: threshold test, identification test and discrimination test. The Sniffin’ Sticks Olfactory Test Kits contain pen like bodies as, for example, in pens used to write on flipcharts or whiteboards.These pen-like bodies, however, contain a fibre stick which is filled with scents. For testing, the cap should be removed so the patient can smell on the tip of the pen.
The taste strips are a validated examination procedure to investigate the taste ability. When testing the whole mouth taste ability, the taste strips are applied by putting them on the tongue and closing the mouth.</description>
