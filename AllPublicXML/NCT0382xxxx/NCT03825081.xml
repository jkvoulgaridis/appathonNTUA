    <textblock>
      The current study aims to assess the use of pilocarpine and brimonidine to improve near
      visual acuity in patietns with monofocal intraocular lenses. Thirty-three subjects with be
      enrolled and baseline visual acuity with be measured at near and distance. This will be
      compared to visual acuity after drop administration over 6 hours. A quality of life
      questionnaire will also be evaluated.

      This research study will try to find out if pilocarpine and brimonidine can help people with
      intraocular lens implants read without reading glasses. Thirty-three subjects will take part
      in this research study. Baseline visual acuity with be measured at near and distance. This
      will be compared to visual acuity after drop administration over 6 hours. A quality of life
      questionnaire will also be evaluated.All subjects will take part at Massachusetts Eye and Ear
      Infirmary (MEEI).

    <description>Interventions will be the drugs:
pilocarpine - 0.5%
brimonidine - 0.2%
One drop of each of the study drugs will be placed in the non-dominant eye and patient will be evaluated for adverse events. At hour 1 and 3 vision will be measured for distance at 20 ft and reading at 14 inches; pupil size will be measured and patient will be evaluated for adverse events. At hour 6 vision will be measured for distance at 20 ft and reading at 14 inches; pupil size will be measured; patient will be evaluated for adverse events; and quality of life/satisfaction survey (NEI RQL-42) will be given to patient.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals must meet all of the inclusion criteria in order to be eligible to
             participate in the study. Men and women between ages 60 years and above with monofocal
             intraocular lenses bilaterally corrected for distance and +/- 0.5D sphere vision who
             need only +/- 2.5 D correction for reading. Given the age group selected only post
             menopausal women will be evaluated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from
             study participation including: allergies to proparacaine, pilocarpine or brimonidine,
             eye infection or inflammation, glaucoma, retinal tear or retinal disease, eye surgery
             within the past 30 days, use of eye drops within the last seven days, participated in
             any other research study within the past 30 days. Patients using contact lenses.
