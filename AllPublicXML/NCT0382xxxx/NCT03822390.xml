  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Diminutive colorectal polyps (1-5mm in size) have a high prevalence and very low
      risk of harbouring cancer. Current practice is to send all these polyps for histopathological
      assessment by the pathologist. If an endoscopist would be able to correctly predict the
      histology of these diminutive polyps during colonoscopy, histopathological examination could
      be omitted and practise could become more time- and cost-effective. Studies have shown that
      prediction of histology by the endoscopist remains dependent on training and experience and
      varies greatly between endoscopists, even after systematic training. Computer aided diagnosis
      (CAD) based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) may facilitate endoscopists in diminutive
      polyp differentiation. Up to date, studies comparing the diagnostic performance of CAD-CNN to
      a group of endoscopists performing optical diagnosis during real-time colonoscopy are
      lacking.

      Objective: To develop a CAD-CNN system that is able to differentiate diminutive polyps during
      colonoscopy with high accuracy and to compare the performance of this system to a group of
      endoscopist performing optical diagnosis, with the histopathology as the gold standard.

      Study design: Multicentre, prospective, observational trial. Study population: Consecutive
      patients who undergo screening colonoscopy (phase 2)

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The accuracy of optical diagnosis of diminutive colorectal
      polyps (1-5mm) by CAD-CNN system compared with the accuracy of the endoscopists.
      Histopathology is used as the gold standard.
