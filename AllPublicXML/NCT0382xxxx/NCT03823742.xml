  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is find out if we can use simple tests (biomarkers) to tell us if a
      specific child would benefit most from CBT or from the low FODMAPs diet.

      AIM 1: We will categorize children ages 7-12 yrs. of age with FGIDs (n=250) as to whether
      they have/do not have one or more of the following abnormal physiologic changes: a) Autonomic
      Nervous System imbalance as indicated by low heart rate variability; and/or (b) Abnormalities
      in gut physiology: Impaired gut barrier function (increased permeability); and/or increased
      abundance of species of Gammaproteobacteria and/or Clostridia; and/or Gut neuroimmune
      dysfunction (increased fecal chromogranin A and secretogranin 2 concentrations).

      AIM 2: Children will be randomized to the two treatments most commonly used in clinical
      practice: CBT or a low FODMAP diet for a 3-week treatment period. We will compare the
      response to the treatments in those with/without abnormal physiologic biomarkers at 3 weeks,
      3 months, and 6 months.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study is a randomized trial with a two group design. Children will be equally likely to be randomized to either CBT or a low FODMAP diet. There is no placebo treatment and no healthy controls are to be studied. Subjects will be stratified based on age (7-9 vs 10-12), sex, baseline pain (mean pain frequency: less than or equal to 50% of the rated intervals or &gt; 50% of the rated intervals, as reported on the baseline pain and stool diary) and PedsQL.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A child 7-12 years of age with a FGID will be recruited if the medical evaluation
             reveals no organic reason for the abdominal pain and the child has abdominal pain that
             meets the definition of a FGID (i.e., IBS, functional abdominal pain) according to the
             pediatric Rome III criteria (Rome IV will be substituted when validated). Parents and
             children must speak and understand English because of the psychological assessment and
             CBT requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who have: had past bowel surgery; documented GI disorders (e.g., Crohn's
             disease); a serious chronic medical condition (e.g., diabetes); weight and/or height &lt;
             2 SD for age; chronic conditions with GI symptoms (e.g., cystic fibrosis); autism
             spectrum disorder, significant developmental delay, psychosis, or a history of bipolar
             disorder; been treated with antibiotics/probiotics within 2 mo. (because of effects on
             gut microbiome analysis), and children who for some reason could not be randomized to
             the low FODMAP diet.Vegetarian; children who are currently on the FODMAP Diet or
             receiving CBT Children who speak only Spanish are not eligible because the Rome
             questionnaire and psychological testing are not available in Spanish. Despite this, a
             large proportion of the children enrolled will be Hispanic.
