      This study evaluates the effect of a multicomponent intervention applied to restaurant staff
      about training and nutritional quality of menu improvement, in order to promote a healthy
      diet and a better management of allergies and intolerances addressed to each family member
      satisfying the customers with specific needs (allergies and intolerances of food).
