  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study is to determine the presence of the human sequence on Ang-(1-12) in the plasma of
      normal male and female normotensive, hypertensive and/or resistant hypertensive subjects.

      To measure concentrations of Ang-(1-12) in either serum or spot urine collections from male
      and female normal, hypertensive and/or resistant hypertensive subjects.

      To assess whether chymase activity can be detected in human serum and urine using the
      radiolabeled amino acid sequence of 1251-Ang-(1-12)
