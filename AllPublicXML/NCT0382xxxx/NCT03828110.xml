  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recovery of walking ability is one of the primary rehabilitation goals for children with
      neurological impairment. The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical effectiveness of
      rehabilitation treatments based of Robotic-Assisted Gait Training (RAGT). Additional goals of
      the research are to identify the specific effects of RAGT in children with different
      etiologies (acquired brain injury and cerebral palsy) and with different levels of function
      (according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System).

    <description>The RAGT treatment consisted of sessions lasting 45 minutes each performed with the commercially available Lokomat device. The same exercises were offered to the children with preset duration, speed, and difficulty. For all patients, the initial body-weight support was set at 50%, and was then gradually decreased according to the individual functional capacity. The guidance force was initially set to 100% for all children, and then gradually reduced.</description>
