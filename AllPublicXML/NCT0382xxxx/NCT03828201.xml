  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to at least
      isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most important anti-TB drugs. It occurs in 3.6% of newly
      diagnosed TB patients in the world and 17% of patients who have been previously treated. In
      2017, approximately 558,000 people were estimated to have acquired MDR-TB. However, only 25%
      of persons with MDR-TB were diagnosed and started on treatment, reflecting inadequate
      diagnostic capacity and lack of TB treatment capacity.

      The investigators propose to randomize participants with MDR-TB to 16 or 24 weeks of
      treatment with a 5-drug oral experimental regimen or to the standard World Health
      Organization (WHO) 9-11-month regimen (the &quot;control&quot; regimen). The primary objective is to
      assess the non-inferiority of the 24-week experimental regimen. In addition, the study also
      aims to examine the non-inferiority of an even shorter (16-week) regimen. The proposed
      investigational regimen combines two new drugs, bedaquiline (BDQ) and delamanid (DLM), with
      three anti-TB agents of known potency, linezolid (LZD), levofloxacin (LFX), and clofazimine
      (CF), to provide a shorter, better-tolerated and more effective MDR-TB treatment regimen for
      persons with fluoroquinolone-susceptible MDR-TB. This regimen can be expected to be effective
      for the vast majority of MDR-TB patients throughout the world.

    <textblock>
      Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to at least
      isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most important anti-TB drugs, and it accounts for 3.6% of
      newly diagnosed TB patients in the world and 17% of patients who have been treated in the
      past. In 2017, approximately 558,000 new people were estimated to have developed MDR-TB, and
      approximately 8.5% of the cases had extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).(3)
      However, only 25% of persons with MDR-TB were diagnosed and started on treatment.The recent
      roll-out of the genotypic test GeneXpert™ has greatly expanded the diagnosis of MDR-TB,(3)
      and thus a substantial increase in the demand for MDR-TB treatment is anticipated.

      In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed a shortened treatment regimen for a
      subset of patients with MDR-TB.(1, 2) In a recent clinical trial, this regimen was able to
      achieve 78% cure.(4) This 9-11-month regimen, also known as the &quot;Bangladesh regimen&quot;, uses 7
      drugs given for 9 months including an injectable agent, which is the cause of the most common
      and severe toxicities seen when treating MDR-TB. In some reports, the regimen has been found
      to be associated with as many as 63% of participants experiencing adverse drug reactions.(5)
      In 2018, WHO updated its guidance recommending consideration of this regimen only in patients
      who do not have any of the following: resistance to or suspected ineffectiveness of any drug
      in the regimen (other than isoniazid); exposure to any second-line drug in the regimen for &gt;1
      month; intolerance or risk of toxicity to any of the drugs; pregnancy; disseminated TB or
      extrapulmonary TB in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -coinfected patients.(2) Thus, while
      this regimen is shorter than the WHO 20-24 month regimen, it does not provide an easily
      tolerated alternative, largely because it contains an injectable agent and because its use is
      somewhat restricted by the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This regimen is now being rolled out
      worldwide for eligible patients.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, partially blinded, three-arm, phase 3, controlled clinical
      trial in patients with MDR-TB comparing the efficacy and tolerability of two durations (16
      and 24 weeks) of an all-oral regimen of bedaquiline, delamanid, levofloxacin, linezolid, and
      clofazimine (investigational arms) with the WHO-recommended 9 to 11 month regimen containing
      injectables (control arm).

      Primary Aims:

        1. Determine if 24 weeks of the investigational regimen is non inferior to the WHO 9 to 11
           month regimen.

        2. Determine if 16 weeks of the investigational regimen is non inferior to the WHO 9 to 11
           month regimen.

        3. Describe the safety profiles of the investigational regimens and the standard WHO 9 to
           11 month regimen in a randomized trial.

           Secondary Aims:

        4. Conduct a QT safety run-in substudy to characterize the frequency, magnitude, and time
           course of corrected QT interval (QTcF) prolongation associated with the study regimen;
           and, in the event extreme increases in QTcF and increased proarrhythmic risk are
           observed, to identify relevant clinical risk factors.

        5. Describe the relationship between duration of the oral regimen and safety and
           tolerability of the regimen.

        6. Estimate the minimum duration of the experimental regimen that is non-inferior to the
           WHO standard 9-month regimen.

        7. Describe the relationship between the duration of the oral regimen and the proportion of
           successful outcomes in the following subpop¬ulations: HIV-infected persons, persons with
           extensive pulmonary disease, persons with greater baseline bacterial burden in sputum.

        8. Collect biospecimens from consenting participants for the purpose of research on
           discovery and validation of TB biomarkers.

        9. Evaluate survival at 132 weeks post randomization.

      The proposed study asks an important research question that will yield essential information
      for improved MDR-TB treatment. Results will inform composition of combination regimens, and
      reducing the duration of treatment from 9 to 6 months (24 weeks) or less would not only
      reduce the time over which patients were exposed to potential drug toxicities, but also free
      up program staff to treat additional TB patients. Development of a shorter, better-tolerated
      treatment regimen will greatly enhance the ability of programs to keep up with the
      anticipated increase in patients needing treatment. Moreover, the study can be implemented
      promptly after funding is awarded. The results of the proposed trial will immediately be
      applied to reformulating MDR-TB treatment standards throughout the world.

Clofazimine has shown activity against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and is now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to treat drug resistant tuberculosis as a &quot;Group B&quot; drug. It is thought that clofazimine acts by inhibiting the formation of matrixes within the DNA and thus delaying the growth of the bacterium. Clofazimine first received FDA approval in 1986, although its use in the treatment of MDR-TB has not been approved by any stringent regulatory authorities and it is therefore used &quot;off-label&quot; for this function.</description>

    <description>In patients with Rifampicin-resistant (RR-TB) or MDR-TB who were not previously treated with second-line drugs and in whom resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable agents was excluded or is considered highly unlikely, a shorter MDR-TB regimen of 9-12 months may be used instead of the longer regimens.
In patients with RR-TB or MDR-TB, a regimen with at least five effective TB medicines during the intensive phase is recommended, including pyrazinamide and four core second-line TB medicines - one chosen from Group A, one from Group B, and at least two from Group C1 (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence). If the minimum number of effective TB medicines cannot be composed as given above, an agent from Group D2 and other agents from Group D3 may be added to bring the total to five.
In patients with RR-TB or MDR-TB, it is recommended that the regimen be further strengthened with high-dose isoniazid and/or ethambutol (1).</description>
