  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture has emerged in China about 2,000 years ago and is one of the oldest medical
      procedures in the world. Acupuncture continued to evolve and develop over the centuries, and
      gradually became one of the standard treatments used in China. Introduced to other regions
      such as Asia, Europe and the United States. The most extensive use of acupuncture is for pain
      relief. The aim of this study was to prevent complications due to pain frequently seen in
      patients who would be treated with endovenous ablation in the postoperative period. In
      addition, the effect of acupuncture on operative hemodynamics, pain, vascular diameter,
      postoperative, nausea, vomiting, pain and analgesic needs, IL17 and IL 23.

      Patients will be divided into two groups. Control group (Group C, n: 35) and Acupuncture
      group (Group A, n: 35). Inclusion criteria: willing to participate in the study, being in the
      18-65 age range, a saphenous vein diameter greater than 5.5 mm and a small saphenous vein
      diameter of less than 4 mm with reflux for greater than 0.5 s The patients with the study
      will be taken.Exclusion criteria: patients outside the 18-65 age range, patients with deep
      venous system obstruction, patients who have previously used another invasive treatment
      method (thermal and chemical ablation, surgery), patients with heart and kidney failure,
      patients with secondary varicose veins patients with hypercoagulable state, patients with
      local or systemic infection, patients with obesity (body mass index&gt; 35), patients with
      impaired consciousness, patients who do not want to participate in the study. Blood will be
      taken from Group A and Group C patients for the measurement of IL 17 and IL 23 prior 24 hours
      before the endovenous ablation procedure. Group A will be done LU 9 (Taiyuan), LU 7 (Lieque),
      SP 6 (Sanyinjiao) , ST 36 (Suzanli), LI 4 (Hegu) and LIV 3 (Taichong) points to be
      acupunctured. Vasculer access will be opened in the preoperative patient preparation room in
      both patient groups.The points of the acupuncture group will be checked and recorded. The
      falling press needle will be reapplied to replace the needles. Patients will be taken to the
      operating room. In both patient groups, measurement of the vessel diameter by ultrasound
      before the endovenous ablation procedure will be performed.During the endovenous ablation
      procedure, SBP (Systolic blood pressure), DBP (Diastolic blood pressure), OAB (Mean arterial
      pressure), HR (Heart rate), SPO2 (Oxygen) , the number of interventional procedures needed to
      be successful and the duration of the procedure, the pain conditions during operation (VAS)
      will be recorded in 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 minutes.After completion of the procedure, ultrasound
      vein ablation and measurement will be reassessed by the surgeon to evaluate the success of
      the procedure.Nausea, vomiting, itching and pain conditions (VAS) will be measured again in
      the postoperative 1, 30 and 60 minutes and a comparison will be made between the groups.After
      the operation, the acupuncture points will be checked in the postoperative resting room and
      if there are falling needles, the needles will be replaced again.Patients will be told that
      acupuncture points should be stimulated from time to time and pres needle needles should be
      protected for three days.On the 3rd postoperative day, patients will be referred to the
      cardiovascular surgery outpatient clinic. Pain conditions (VAS) and analgesic consumption
      will be evaluated.Preoperatively, postoperatively and on the 3rd day, the vessel diameters
      will be measured and compared with ultrasonography.IL17 and IL 23 values will be compared
      between both groups and before and after endovenous ablation.The effect of acupuncture on IL
      17 and IL 23 will be investigated.Patients will also be told to return to the hospital
      immediately in cases such as shortness of breath, edema, redness, pain in the legs and the
      complications will be recorded.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
      acupuncture on pain, IL17, IL 23 and vessel diameters in patients treated with N-Butyl
      Cyanoacrylate, a new method in the treatment of endovenous ablation.
