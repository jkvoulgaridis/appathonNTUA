  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of
      Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) intravenous infusion when used to treat alcoholic hepatitis
      (inflammation of the liver from heavy alcohol use) and sepsis (life-threatening complication
      of an infection).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholic hepatitis is inflammation of the liver due to alcohol consumption. It can cause one
      or more of the following symptoms such as jaundice (yellow discoloration of the eyes and
      skin), pain on the right side of the abdomen, and is accompanied by an enlarged liver. Sepsis
      is a life-threatening complication of an infection. As the body tries to fight an infection
      it sends chemicals into the bloodstream. These chemicals that are trying to fight the
      infection can cause inflammation. This inflammation can cause damage to many body systems and
      make them fail. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis and sepsis have low levels of Vitamin C in
      the bloodstream. Vitamin C has been shown to reduce inflammation and organ dysfunction in
      patients with severe infections.

      The investigators do not yet know if Vitamin C will be effective in alcoholic hepatitis.
      Taking Vitamin C by mouth is not effective as a treatment in people with this condition so
      participants will receive the Vitamin C intravenously (IV). Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive either Vitamin C or a placebo given through an IV every six hours for
      four days.
