  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test that hypothesis that topical administration of the FDA approved
      immunomodulatory agent cyclosporin A emulsion will minimize irritation and ocular surface
      disease that results from a short term low humidity environmental stress
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the effect of two conventional dry eye therapies,
      artificial tears to hydrate and cyclosporine A as an anti-inflammatory, on the irritation
      symptoms and ocular surface disease of dry eye patients who will be exposed to a low humidity
      environment for 90 minutes. Patients with dry eye will be enrolled in this study and complete
      a validated symptom questionnaire and then undergo a complete ocular surface and tear
      examination to characterize their disease. Enrolled subjects will be exposed to a low
      humidity environment at the initial evaluation prior to any treatment and will be exposed to
      a low humidity environment for a second time. They will be randomized to receive either
      artificial tears or 0.05% cyclosporine A emulsion drop four times a day for 6 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Fluorescein Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mean difference in corneal staining using the adjusted CCLR global staining score before and after the environmental challenge at visits baseline and Visit 3/Day 42 when patients were subjected to a 90-minute low humidity stress. Corneal fluorescein staining was graded 0-100 in 5 zones on the cornea. The scores ranged from 0 (minimum) to 500 (maximum). A higher score indicates there was greater cornea disease induced by the low humidity stress on Day 42</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eye Irritation Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mean difference in subject's scoring of eye irritation symptoms using a VAS (visual analog scale) questionnaire before and after the environmental challenge after treatment at Visit 3/Day 42 when patients were subjected to a 90-minute low humidity stress. Symptoms were graded on a 4 question VAS 0-5 for each question, with scores summed for all questions for a total score that ranges from 0 (minimum) to 20 (maximum) for the pre and post challenge questionnaires. The outcome measure is the difference in the post to pre total score ranging from -20 (maximum improvement) to 20 (maximum worsening). A minus difference indicated the subject had lower irritation symptoms following the lower humidity challenge, while a positive difference indicated the subject had greater irritation following the low humidity challenge on Day 42.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Conjunctival Goblet Cells</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of conjunctival goblet cells measured in impression cytology at screening/baseline before and after low humidity exposure at the baseline and Day 42 visits. No (zero) subjects were analyzed because the assay was not performed and data was not collected because the study was terminated due to loss of funding.</description>

          <title>Corneal Fluorescein Staining</title>
          <description>The mean difference in corneal staining using the adjusted CCLR global staining score before and after the environmental challenge at visits baseline and Visit 3/Day 42 when patients were subjected to a 90-minute low humidity stress. Corneal fluorescein staining was graded 0-100 in 5 zones on the cornea. The scores ranged from 0 (minimum) to 500 (maximum). A higher score indicates there was greater cornea disease induced by the low humidity stress on Day 42</description>

        <title>Eye Irritation Symptoms</title>
        <description>The mean difference in subject's scoring of eye irritation symptoms using a VAS (visual analog scale) questionnaire before and after the environmental challenge after treatment at Visit 3/Day 42 when patients were subjected to a 90-minute low humidity stress. Symptoms were graded on a 4 question VAS 0-5 for each question, with scores summed for all questions for a total score that ranges from 0 (minimum) to 20 (maximum) for the pre and post challenge questionnaires. The outcome measure is the difference in the post to pre total score ranging from -20 (maximum improvement) to 20 (maximum worsening). A minus difference indicated the subject had lower irritation symptoms following the lower humidity challenge, while a positive difference indicated the subject had greater irritation following the low humidity challenge on Day 42.</description>
