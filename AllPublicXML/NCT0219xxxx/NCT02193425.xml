      Background:

      - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to investigate brain function. Researchers want to
      use MRI to better understand the function patterns and connections between brain regions in
      healthy people. This might help people with brain diseases in the future.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate MRI methods performed twice on the same day.

        -  To evaluate brain function using positron emission tomography (PET).

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years old.

      Design:

        -  Visit 1:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and interview about
           drug and alcohol use and psychiatric history.

        -  They will give blood and urine samples. Their breath will be tested for alcohol and
           smoking.

        -  Visit 2:

        -  Participants will have urine collected. They will have MRI scans, some while resting,
           some while doing tasks on a computer.

        -  The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on
           a table that slides in and out of the cylinder, with a coil over their head.
           Participants will get earplugs for loud noises.

        -  Visit 3:

        -  Participants will have urine collected.

        -  A needle will guide a thin plastic tube (catheter) into each arm. The needle will be
           removed, leaving the catheter in the vein.

        -  Participants will then have a PET scan. They will get the chemical 18FDG in the
           catheter. They will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the PET scanner, with a cap
           on their head.

        -  Participants may have tests of memory, attention, concentration, and thinking. They may
           complete interviews, questionnaires, tests on paper or computer, and simple actions.

        -  Participants will wear a device for 1 week between visits to measure activity and sleep.

      Objectives: The overarching goal of this study is to quantify the reproducibility of multiple
      measures of brain functional connectivity (FC) during resting conditions and during task
      performance. Secondary objectives are to assess the dynamic properties and energy
      requirements of the human brain connectome as well as the effects of physiologic noise,
      gender and aging on measures of brain functional connectivity at rest and during task
      performance.

      Study population: 60 healthy males and 60 healthy females 18 years or older will be included.

      Design: Participants will undergo two MRI/MRS sessions to evaluate test-retest reliability of
      FC at rest as well as during task performance, and one 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET
      session to assess the association between FC and glucose metabolism in the human brain.

      Outcome parameters: The variability of the gender and aging effects on FC measures (lFCD, L,
      C, and S) collected in RS and TS conditions , which will be quantified using volxelwise ICC.
      The variability of brain metabolite concentrations in precuneus.

             inhibitors (SSRIs), or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), stimulant
             or stimulant-like medications (amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil); opioid
             analgesics; antianginal agents; antiarrhythmics; systemic corticosteroids;
             anticholinergics; anticoagulants; anticonvulsants; antihistamines (sedating); beta

          3. Current or past DSM-IV or DSM-5 diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder as determined by
             history and clinical exam including substance use disorder (except for
             nicotine/caffeine), alcoholism and alcohol dependence. Past history of a mental
             disorder as defined by DSM-IV or DSM-5 will be excluded only if it required
             hospitalization (any length), or chronic medication management (more than 4 weeks),
             and that could impact brain function at the time of the study.

          4. Those with a binge drinking history every month continuously for the last 10 years
             will also be excluded. Binge drinkers are those who being female consume 4 or more
             drinks and males consume 5 or more drinks in one occasion at least once a month.

          5. Major medical problems that can impact brain function at the time of the scan
             (including but not limited to HIV; central nervous system including seizures and
             psychosis; cardiovascular including hypertension and arrhythmias; metabolic,
             autoimmune, endocrine) as determined by history and clinical exam. Participants aged
             60 and older with any medical problems that are controlled will not be excluded.

          6. Any clinically significant laboratory finding as determined during the screening
             procedures.

          7. Have had previous radiation exposure (from X-rays, PET scans, or other exposure) that,
             with the exposure from this study, would exceed NIH annual research limits.

          8. Head trauma with loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes.

          9. Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for MRI/MRS of
             the head (pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some
             types of dental implants, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner,
             implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments), fear of enclosed spaces, or other
             standard contraindication to MRI/MRS (self-report checklist).

         10. Cannot lie comfortably flat on back for up to 2 hours in the PET and MRI/MRS scanners.

         11. Body weight &gt; 250 kg. This is the upper limit that the bed of the MR scanner can
             accommodate.

         12. NIH employees who are study investigators, as well as their superiors, subordinates
             and immediate family members (adult children, spouses, parents, siblings).

               -  Subjects will not be excluded from enrollment onto this study if their urine test
                  is positive for drugs. However, if they test positive on scheduled study
                  procedure days involving study imaging (MRI/MRS and PET) and Neuropsychological
                  testing, the procedures will be postponed and rescheduled. We will allow for up
                  to 3 rescheduled study days that were the result of positive urine drug screens.
                  If the drug test is positive on the third rescheduled visit, the participant will
                  be withdrawn from the study.
