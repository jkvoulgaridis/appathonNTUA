  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate if Eloctate is superior to Emicizumab in reducing inhibitors in
      children with severe hemophilia when given before the first bleed (preemptive) and continued
      weekly to prevent bleeds (prophylaxis); and whether Eloctate immune tolerance induction (ITI)
      plus emicizumab is superior to Eloctate ITI alone in eradicating inhibitor formation in
      children and adults with severe hemophilia A.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized Phase III Clinical Trials Platform (INHIBIT) in which
      hemostatic agents will be compared using adaptive design to prevent and eradicate inhibitors
      in patients with severe hemophilia A. This adaptive design is necessary as randomized trials
      in rare diseases are otherwise not possible. The INHIBIT Trial Platform includes one
      Inhibitor Prevention Trial and one Inhibitor Eradication Trial that will be conducted at up
      to 41 U.S. hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) affiliated with universities. The Inhibitor
      Prevention Trial is a 48-week randomized phase III trial in which 66 previously untreated
      patients (PUPs) (children &lt; 6 yr) with severe hemophilia A will be enrolled and randomized to
      preemptive weekly Eloctate vs. Emicizumab to prevent inhibitor formation, defined as
      anti-FVIII &gt; 5.0 BU. The Inhibitor Eradication Trial is a 48-week randomized phase III trial
      in which 90 previously-treated patients (PTPs) with severe hemophilia A and high-responding
      inhibitors (anti-VIII &gt;5.0 B.U.), including subjects developing inhibitors during the
      Prevention Trials and adults or children of any age at the same HTCs refractory to or never
      previously tolerated, will be enrolled and randomized to Eloctate ITI god plus weekly
      Emicizumab vs. Eloctate ITI alone to eradicate inhibitor formation, defined as anti-FVIII&lt;0.6
      B.U. Blood draws will be minimized to 6 timepoints, pre, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks, and
      validated for small volumes, 3.8 cc (Â¾ tsp) each. The Inhibit Trials Platform is considered
      greater than minimal risk as study drug is given before the first bleed and special inhibitor
      studies are obtained.
