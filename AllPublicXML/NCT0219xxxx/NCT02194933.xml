    <measure>Change From Baseline Brain Activation in the Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex (VLPFC) Based on Change From Baseline to Week 6 in fMRI Blood Oxygen-level Dependent (BOLD) Activation Score in the Right VLPFC During Performance of the Go/No-go Task</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (Day 0), and week 6 (Day 42) of the treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of brexpiprazole on brain regions activated by impulsive behavior (specifically, activation of the right VLPFC). Assessed by fMRI measurements taken when participants perform tasks designed to assess impulsivity. The tasks to be performed in the scanner included the Go/No-go. Participants were asked to press a button as fast as they could to Stimulus A (eg, neutral face) that appeared on the screen (Go trials) &amp; to NOT press a button to Stimulus B (eg, happy face) that appeared on the screen (No-go trials). The Go trials were presented at a higher frequency (eg, 75% of the time) than the No-go trials to build up a pre-potent response/response bias. Scores were not bounded by a minimum or maximum range, higher fMRI BOLD activation scores indicate increased brain blood flow, which reflects brain activity.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the effect of brexpiprazole on brain regions activated by impulsive behavior (specifically, activation of the right VLPFC). Assessed by fMRI measurements taken when participants performed impulsivity assessment tasks. A white circle was shown for 500ms, followed by a left (&lt;)/right (&gt;) arrow. When an arrow was presented, participants responded as fast as possible with their index/middle finger. A titration procedure with 4 staircases started with stop signal delay (SSD) values of 100, 150, 200 &amp; 250ms to determine participant's SSRT. The tasks included 3 runs with 166 repetition times (TRs), TR=2s; 5 minutes, 32 seconds/run; 96 go trials, 32 stop trials/ run. The total task duration was 16 minutes &amp; 36 seconds. Scores were not bounded by a minimum or maximum range, higher fMRI BOLD activation scores indicate increased brain blood flow, which reflects brain activity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 3 in fMRI BOLD Activation Score in the Right VLPFC, Scanned by fMRI During Performance of Tasks Associated With Impulsivity (SSRT Task, Go/No-go Task)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (Day 0), and week 3 (Day 21) of the treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>Go/No-go: Participants were to press button fast to Stimulus A (neutral face) (Go trials) &amp; to NOT press button to Stimulus B (happy face) (No-go trials). Task comprised 4 runs of 3 minutes &amp; 8 seconds each. Each run included 36 target (Go) &amp; 13 non target (No-go) stimuli. The stimuli were presented for 500ms with 2 to 14.5 inter-stimulus interval fixation cross in between. Target stimuli were pseudo-randomized across runs so that each participant was presented with 2 Happy Go &amp; 2 Neutral Go conditions.
SSRT: White circle was shown for 500ms, followed by left (&lt;)/right (&gt;) arrow. When an arrow was presented, participants were to respond fast with their index/middle finger. A titration procedure with 4 staircases that started with stop signal delay (SSD) values of 100, 150, 200 &amp; 250ms determined participant's SSRT.

    <time_frame>At baseline (Day 0), and Week 6 (Day 42) of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>A participant-rated scale was used to assess impulsive personality traits. The BIS-11 consisted of 30 items scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (rarely/never) to 4 (almost always/ always) and the scores were used to assess 6 first-order factors (attention, motor, self-control, cognitive complexity, perseverance and cognitive instability impulsiveness) and 3 second-order factors ( motor impulsiveness, nonplanning impulsiveness and attentional impulsiveness). The total score ranged from 30 to 120 with higher scores indicating impulsive personality traits, and took 10 to 15 minutes to complete the BIS-11.</description>

    <time_frame>During trial visits from Day 0 to Week 6 (Day 42).</time_frame>
    <description>To measure &quot;delay discounting&quot; as an index of impulsive behavior. It measured the extent to which the value of a reward decreased as the delay to obtaining that reward increased. The propensity of participants to delay reward was assessed with an MCQ. Discounting rate is estimated using, k= (A/V)1/D, where k is the discounting rate parameter, V is the immediate reward, A is the higher delayed reward and D is the amount of days to the delayed reward. The MCQ consisted of 27 choices between immediate and delayed rewards. The participants chose repeatedly between 2 hypothetical sums of money: a smaller amount now or a larger amount in the future (ex: ''Would you prefer $27 today or $50 in 21 days?&quot;). The answers provided an estimate of the participant's discounting rate. The discounting rate parameter takes values between 0 and 1 and higher discounting rates indicated impulsivity. It took 5 to10 minutes to complete the MCQ</description>

    <time_frame>During trial visits from Day 0 to Week 6 (Day 42).</time_frame>
    <description>The AX trials were &quot;target trials&quot; with a valid cue followed by a valid probe X. This feature was intended to encourage participants to &quot;expect&quot; a valid probe to follow a valid cue. A consequence of this manipulation was that participants developed a prepotency to respond with &quot;target&quot; responses on trials for which valid cues were presented. The cue was presented for 1000msec, the inter-stimulus interval was 2000msec, and the target was presented for 500msec with a response window of 1500msec. The ITI was 1200msec. Participants had to practice until criteria were obtained. In the AX‐CPT task, the subjects were instructed to press the &quot;Yes&quot; button every time there is a blue letter 'X' (target) following a white letter 'A' (cue). During this task, any letter appears on the screen randomly. The value calculated was the rate of correct response for all the reaction of target trial.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Brain Activation in the Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex (VLPFC) Based on Change From Baseline to Week 6 in fMRI Blood Oxygen-level Dependent (BOLD) Activation Score in the Right VLPFC During Performance of the Go/No-go Task</title>
        <description>To evaluate the effect of brexpiprazole on brain regions activated by impulsive behavior (specifically, activation of the right VLPFC). Assessed by fMRI measurements taken when participants perform tasks designed to assess impulsivity. The tasks to be performed in the scanner included the Go/No-go. Participants were asked to press a button as fast as they could to Stimulus A (eg, neutral face) that appeared on the screen (Go trials) &amp; to NOT press a button to Stimulus B (eg, happy face) that appeared on the screen (No-go trials). The Go trials were presented at a higher frequency (eg, 75% of the time) than the No-go trials to build up a pre-potent response/response bias. Scores were not bounded by a minimum or maximum range, higher fMRI BOLD activation scores indicate increased brain blood flow, which reflects brain activity.</description>

        <description>To evaluate the effect of brexpiprazole on brain regions activated by impulsive behavior (specifically, activation of the right VLPFC). Assessed by fMRI measurements taken when participants performed impulsivity assessment tasks. A white circle was shown for 500ms, followed by a left (&lt;)/right (&gt;) arrow. When an arrow was presented, participants responded as fast as possible with their index/middle finger. A titration procedure with 4 staircases started with stop signal delay (SSD) values of 100, 150, 200 &amp; 250ms to determine participant's SSRT. The tasks included 3 runs with 166 repetition times (TRs), TR=2s; 5 minutes, 32 seconds/run; 96 go trials, 32 stop trials/ run. The total task duration was 16 minutes &amp; 36 seconds. Scores were not bounded by a minimum or maximum range, higher fMRI BOLD activation scores indicate increased brain blood flow, which reflects brain activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)</title>
        <description>A participant-rated scale was used to assess impulsive personality traits. The BIS-11 consisted of 30 items scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (rarely/never) to 4 (almost always/ always) and the scores were used to assess 6 first-order factors (attention, motor, self-control, cognitive complexity, perseverance and cognitive instability impulsiveness) and 3 second-order factors ( motor impulsiveness, nonplanning impulsiveness and attentional impulsiveness). The total score ranged from 30 to 120 with higher scores indicating impulsive personality traits, and took 10 to 15 minutes to complete the BIS-11.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Go/No-go Task Behavior</title>
        <description>Brexpiprazole reduced impulsivity was measured by a change in false alarm rate on the Go/No-go task (a lower false alarm rate was suggestive of better inhibition). Participants were instructed to press a button as fast as they could to Stimulus A (eg, neutral face) that appeared on the screen (Go trials) and to NOT press a button to Stimulus B (eg, happy face) that appeared on the screen (No-go trials). The stimuli were presented randomly. The value calculated was the rate of incorrect response for each condition (Go and No-go).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) Score</title>
        <description>To measure &quot;delay discounting&quot; as an index of impulsive behavior. It measured the extent to which the value of a reward decreased as the delay to obtaining that reward increased. The propensity of participants to delay reward was assessed with an MCQ. Discounting rate is estimated using, k= (A/V)1/D, where k is the discounting rate parameter, V is the immediate reward, A is the higher delayed reward and D is the amount of days to the delayed reward. The MCQ consisted of 27 choices between immediate and delayed rewards. The participants chose repeatedly between 2 hypothetical sums of money: a smaller amount now or a larger amount in the future (ex: ''Would you prefer $27 today or $50 in 21 days?&quot;). The answers provided an estimate of the participant's discounting rate. The discounting rate parameter takes values between 0 and 1 and higher discounting rates indicated impulsivity. It took 5 to10 minutes to complete the MCQ</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Stop Signal Reaction Time Task (SSRT) Task Behavior</title>
        <description>Brexpiprazole reduced impulsivity was measured by a change in Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) on the SSRT task (a lower SSRT was suggestive of better inhibition). A white circle was shown for 500ms, followed by a left (&lt;)/right (&gt;) arrow. When an arrow was presented, participants responded as fast as possible with their index/middle finger. A titration procedure with 4 staircases started with stop signal delay (SSD) values of 100, 150, 200 &amp; 250ms to determine participant's SSRT. The tasks included 3 runs with 166 repetition times (TRs), TR=2s; 5 minutes, 32 seconds/run; 96 go trials, 32 stop trials/ run. The total task duration was 16 minutes &amp; 36 seconds. During scanning, the SSD was dynamically adjusted to yield a 50% successful inhibition rate, so that SSRT could be estimated for each participant. This resulted in approximately equal proportions of stop trials with &amp; without a response</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Continuous Performance Task (CPT) Behavior</title>
        <description>The AX trials were &quot;target trials&quot; with a valid cue followed by a valid probe X. This feature was intended to encourage participants to &quot;expect&quot; a valid probe to follow a valid cue. A consequence of this manipulation was that participants developed a prepotency to respond with &quot;target&quot; responses on trials for which valid cues were presented. The cue was presented for 1000msec, the inter-stimulus interval was 2000msec, and the target was presented for 500msec with a response window of 1500msec. The ITI was 1200msec. Participants had to practice until criteria were obtained. In the AX‐CPT task, the subjects were instructed to press the &quot;Yes&quot; button every time there is a blue letter 'X' (target) following a white letter 'A' (cue). During this task, any letter appears on the screen randomly. The value calculated was the rate of correct response for all the reaction of target trial.</description>
