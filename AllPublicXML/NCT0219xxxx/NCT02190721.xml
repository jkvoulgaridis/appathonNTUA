    <measure>Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Non-TEAE: signing of informed consent to Day -1 (last day of CTX in week 1). And &gt; 30 days after last dose of tbo-filgrastim (Day 46+). TEAE timeframe: Day 1 (start of tbo-filgrastim) to &lt;= 30 days after the last dose (up to Day 45)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is an AE occurring during the timeframe. A non-TEAE is any AE not considered a TEAE.
Severity was rated by the investigator using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) scale where 3=severe but not life-threatening, 4=life-threatening and 5=death. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator (related=reasonable possibility). Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

    <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECGs were conducted at screening, predose, 4 and 6 hours postdose on day 1 of tbo-filgrastim administration, and at the end-of-study visit. The ECGs were interpreted by both the investigator and a qualified physician at the central diagnostic center as normal, abnormal not clinically significant, or abnormal clinically significant. The following parameters were measured/derived for each ECG assessment: heart rate, PR interval, RR interval, QT interval, corrected QT interval according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF), corrected QT interval according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), QRS duration, and QRS axis.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 55 patients were screened for this study. Of the 55 patients screened, 50 patients at 33 investigational centers in Central and Eastern Europe met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were considered to be eligible for enrollment into the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 5 patients who were not enrolled, 2 patients were excluded due to inclusion criteria not met (baseline AST elevation, baseline ANC count was too low), 2 patients were excluded due to exclusion criteria not met (ongoing active infection or history of infectious disease within 2 weeks prior to screening), and 1 patient withdrew consent.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is an AE occurring during the timeframe. A non-TEAE is any AE not considered a TEAE.
Severity was rated by the investigator using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) scale where 3=severe but not life-threatening, 4=life-threatening and 5=death. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator (related=reasonable possibility). Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

Any physical examination finding that is judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) compared with a baseline value were considered as an adverse event.
Counts of participants with a negative shift from baseline in any of the body systems (including shifts from normal to abnormal, not clinically significant) are presented.</description>

          <description>Physical examination was performed at screening and at the end-of-study visit. The following body systems were marked as normal or abnormal and if abnormal, whether clinically significant: Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat (HEENT), chest and lungs, heart, abdomen, skin, lymph nodes and neurological.
Any physical examination finding that is judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) compared with a baseline value were considered as an adverse event.
Counts of participants with a negative shift from baseline in any of the body systems (including shifts from normal to abnormal, not clinically significant) are presented.</description>

        <description>Blood was drawn for the assessment of anti-drug antibody (ADA) at screening, at the end-of-study visit, and at 30 and 90 days after the last administration of tbo-filgrastim in chemotherapy (CTX) cycle 1.
The main endpoint from the assessment was the presence of antibodies in the sample, reported as positive or negative. Participants with positive results are summarized.</description>

Daily dosing with tbo-filgrastim at a dose of 5 μg/kg/day of body weight continued until the expected neutrophil nadir was passed and the neutrophil count had recovered to 2.0 × 10^9/L but not longer than 14 consecutive days.
