  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study examines the effect of hyaluronidase on the length of time of insulin
      infusion set wear. The aim of the study is to improve the length of time that an infusion set
      can be worn by infusing hyaluronidase directly into the insulin infusion site.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to see if the use of hyaluronidase will improve insulin infusion
      set survival and improve the onset of insulin action. The investigators will also assess the
      accuracy of the Dexcom G4P sensors with extended site use beyond the 7 day FDA approved time
      frame.

      The use of sensor information combined with the knowledge of infused insulin from pump
      therapy could potentially help us detect when an infusion set is beginning to fail.
      Information from the sensor function to the point of failure, and sensor function in response
      to Tylenol may allow us to develop special formulas to determine when a sensor is not working
      well. This will be very important for creating an artificial pancreas.

      Thirty subjects will be enrolled. Fifteen patients from each of the two sites: Stanford
      University and University of Colorado.

    <measure>Maximum Glycemic Excursion</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of hyaluronidase on post-prandial glucodymamic parameters is presented as the estimated glycemic excursion, a composite value which was calculated based on peak glucose concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), time to early half-maximal glucose concentration (t50%), time to late t50%, and area under the curve (AUC) of glucose concentrations at time intervals of 120 and 240 minutes, with or without hyaluronidase. Estimated glycemic excursion for a patient with Type 1 diabetes that is less than 80 mg/dL is considered acceptable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Tolerability of Hyaluronidase Injections</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients recorded pain experience at the infusion site (at time of injection and pain each day of wear) in subject diaries on a 0-5 pain scale (0 = no pain and 5 = worst pain imaginable).
The number of diary entries are presented by scale category.</description>

Hyaluronidase: If assigned to hyaluronidase week, subjects will inject 1 milliliter (ml) Hylenex (150 units/ml) into the catheter hub prior to connecting the insulin infusion set. They will then give a catheter fixed prime of 0.7 cc to clear the infusion set of hyaluronidase. On the morning of day 3 during a Hyaluronidase week, a second dose of 1ml Hylenex (150 units/1ml) will be injected through the catheter hub prior to breakfast using the Duo Infusion Set Tubing.

          <title>Hyaluronidase Week</title>
          <description>Infuse 1mL Hyaluronidase at time of infusion set placement and again on Day 3
Hyaluronidase: If assigned to hyaluronidase week, subjects will inject 1 milliliter (ml) Hylenex (150 units/ml) into the catheter hub prior to connecting the insulin infusion set. They will then give a catheter fixed prime of 0.7 cc to clear the infusion set of hyaluronidase. On the morning of day 3 during a Hyaluronidase week, a second dose of 1ml Hylenex (150 units/1ml) will be injected through the catheter hub prior to breakfast using the Duo Infusion Set Tubing. They will then reconnect their pump catheter and give a fixed prime of 0.7 cc to clear the infusion set of hyaluronidase.</description>
