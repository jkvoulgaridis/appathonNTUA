    <textblock>
      Background: Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition among postmenopausal women,
      requiring a multifaceted treatment approach that requires patient retention of information
      given to them in clinic. Recall of recommendations is a key component of compliance.
      Supplemental educational tools such as handouts and audiovisual information have been
      investigated for their ability to improve patients' recall of information and increase
      satisfaction with the clinical encounter.

      Objective: To determine if a written list of seven management strategies for overactive
      bladder leads to improved immediate and delayed recall of these recommendations in
      postmenopausal women presenting with OAB compared to a traditional verbal discussion.

      Methods: In this single-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients' immediate and delayed
      (2-week) recall of seven OAB management strategies will be compared between two groups. The
      intervention group will receive a handwritten list during their verbal discussion of OAB
      treatment while the control group will receive standard care (verbal discussion only).
      Immediate and delayed recall will be assessed by a member of the study team who has been
      blinded to participants' group assignments.

      Results: The results of this study may guide clinicians in the most effective mode of
      providing treatment recommendations to post-menopausal patients with OAB.
