      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of Tantum Verde® for improving recovery
      following tonsillectomy Study design: A prospective double-blined randomized trial. Sample
      size: Thirty patients undergoing tonsillectomy who will be treated with Tantum Verde® Mouth
      wash solution, and a control group of 30 patients that will undergo tonsillectomy and will be
      treated with a placebo.

      The study will be conducted in the Departments Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery in the
      Western Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel. Patients who are scheduled for
      tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy will be recruited for the study. They will sign
      the inform consent in one of two places: in the departments before the surgery or in the
      clinic in the visit before the surgery. The patients will be evaluated for their ability to
      gargle and spit water before the surgery, after which they will be assigned to either the
      treatment group who will get a solution of Tantum Verde or the control group who will receive
      saline with mint flavor, both in identicle bottles. Randomization will be done using a random
      number generator program.

      The patients will be asked to gargle and spit the solution they received three times a day
      for 30 seconds, for the following week after surgery.
