  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease
      characterized by painful, recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that result
      in abnormal bone formation in muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Flare-ups begin early in life
      and may occur spontaneously or after soft tissue trauma, vaccinations, or influenza
      infections. Recurrent flare-ups progressively restrict movement by locking joints leading to
      cumulative loss of function and disability. Mouse models of FOP have demonstrated the ability
      of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) gamma agonists to prevent heterotopic ossification (HO)
      following injury. The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether palovarotene, an RAR gamma
      agonist, will prevent HO during and following a flare-up in subjects with FOP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the ability of different doses of palovarotene to
      prevent HO at the flare-up site in subjects with FOP as assessed by plain radiographs.

      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, sponsor-unblinded,
      placebo-controlled study. Two cohorts of subjects will be randomized into different dosing
      regimens of palovarotene for a 6-week (42 days) treatment period. The study will consist of
      three periods:

        1. A Screening period to occur within 7 days of a distinct flare-up. The first dose of
           study drug will be taken within 7 days of the flare-up initiation.

        2. A double-blind treatment period of 6 weeks (42 days) duration.

        3. A follow-up period of 6 weeks (42 days) duration.

      An initial cohort (Cohort 1) of subjects will be randomly assigned 3:1 to either palovarotene
      or placebo daily for 42 days. Subjects randomized to palovarotene in Cohort 1 will receive an
      initial daily dose of 10 mg for 14 days followed by 5 mg daily for 28 days.

      In Cohort 2, new FOP subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly
      assigned 3:3:2 to two dose regimens of palovarotene (10 mg for 14 days and 5 mg for 28 days;
      5 mg for 14 days and 2.5 mg for 28 days) or placebo daily for 42 days. Doses will be
      weight-adjusted and subjects randomized within three weight-range categories (20 to &lt;40 kg,
      40 to &lt;60 kg, and ≥60 kg).

      Subjects completing the study and still meeting eligibility requirements will be given the
      opportunity to enroll into an open-label extension study.

    <measure>Percentage of Responders at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 6 (Day 42)</time_frame>
    <description>A responder was defined as a subject with no or minimal new heterotopic ossification (HO) at flare-up site versus baseline as assessed by plain radiographs at Week 6. Minimal new HO is defined as new HO with an HO score &lt;=3 in both anterior/posterior (AP) and lateral projections (or if one view is non-interpretable or non-evaluable, then remaining evaluable view is used). The HO score ranges from 0 to 6 where, 0 = no HO and 6 = single contiguous HO with longest dimension &gt;2 diameters of reference normotopic bone in any projection. The highest HO score from the 2 projections was used. Results from Primary Read reviews are presented. The Primary Read process included a double-read radiology review paradigm with consensus adjudication. Radiography and CT scans were examined independently by scan type, flare-up region, and imaging time point in order to determine whether radiography would be sufficient to measure new HO formation. Only subjects with interpretable outcomes were evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With New HO at Weeks 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 6 and 12 (Day 84)</time_frame>
    <description>Low dose CT scan was used as a secondary imaging assessment of HO and was performed at the same time points as plain radiographs. The percentage of subjects with new HO (regardless of the amount of new HO) at the flare-up site as assessed by CT scan and/or plain radiographs at Weeks 6 and 12 were analysed. The results are from Global Read reviews. The holistic Global Read process allowed concurrent review of all modalities across all time points, and provided access to selected clinical data at the time of review.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Amount (Area) of New HO Formed at the Flare-up Site at Weeks 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Interpretation of plain radiographs document the amount (area) of HO on both the AP and lateral radiograph views. The area for each view was a sum of all the new HO at the flare-up location (and thus if there are multiple HO lesions, the area of each lesion was determined and then the total across all lesions were summed to obtain a total new HO). This total new HO sum was used in the analysis of the area of new HO. Results from Primary Read reviews are presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Amount of Bone Formation (Volume) at Weeks 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Low dose CT scan were used as a secondary imaging assessment of HO, and was performed at the same time points as plain radiographs. Interpretation of the CT scan documented the amount (volume) and grade of HO. The independent reviewer scored HO lesions according to the following scale for HO on CT. Grade 1 = fluid attenuation without evidence of calcification at CT, Grade 2 = calcification of soft tissues without evidence of bone formation, Grade 3 = immature bone formation, and Grade 4 = mature bone with cortical differentiation. Volume of new HO was determined according to the following steps: (1) calculate volume of new HO compared to baseline for each reviewer/HO ID, (2) sum the volume of new HO across HO IDs for each reviewer, and (3) average the volume of new HO across reviewers. Results from Primary Read reviews are presented.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Soft Tissue Swelling and Cartilage Formation Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Ultrasound (US) at Weeks 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MRI was utilized to evaluate the presence of soft tissue swelling/edema (and volume of the swelling/edema) and presence of cartilage formation (yes or no). For subjects who could not have an MRI, US was used to assess edema severity for the sub-set of subjects enrolled after this opinion was introduced in a protocol amendment. Imaging film from MRI was assessed by two independent readers. When there was sufficient agreement between the independent readers on volume, both of the independent readings were used for analysis with the volume measurements averaged. When there was insufficient agreement between the independent readers, an adjudication reading was provided and used for analysis. The US was used for soft tissue swelling/edema but not cartilage formation. Percentage calculated as % = 100 x n/N' where N' is the number of subjects with interpretable outcomes. Results from Primary Read reviews are presented.</description>

    <measure>Subject and Investigator Global Assessment of Movement at Weeks 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Flare-up movement outcomes were independently assessed by both the subject (or parent of a subject under 8 years of age) and the Investigator at Weeks 6 and 12 by completing the global assessment of movement. The subject/parent completed the global assessment first. Prior to reviewing the subject's assessment, the Investigator completed his/her own assessment of the flare-up outcome. Subjects were assessed how the flare-up affected their movement on a scale ranging 1 to 5 where, 1 = severely worse movement and 5 = better movement compared with study Day 1 (day of first dose of study drug). Investigators were assessed how the flare-up affected the subject's movement on a scale ranging 1 to 5 where, 1 = severely worse movement and 5 = better movement compared with baseline (day of screening physical examination).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Flare-Up Pain and Swelling at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The pain and swelling associated with flare-ups was evaluated using 2 separate numeric rating scales, one for pain and one for swelling. The pain scale ranges from 0 to 10 where, 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain ever experienced. The swelling scale ranges from 0 to 10 where, 0 = no swelling and 10 = worst swelling ever experienced. The Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) was used for children less than 8 years old. The FPS-R ranges from 0 to 10 where, 0 = no pain and 10 = very much pain in two-point increments.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Percentage of Worst Total Score for FOP-Specific Physical Function Questionnaire (FOP-PFQ) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FOP-PFQ consists of 28 questions rated on scales from 1 to 5, with lower scores denoting more difficulty. The adult form of the FOP-PFQ was administered to subjects 15 years of age and older. There are two Pediatric FOP-PFQ (FOP-PFQ-P) forms: a self-completed form for 8 to 14 year-olds and a parent proxy-completed form for 5 to 14 year-olds. For subjects between 8 to 14 years of age, both the self-completed (for 8 to 14 year-olds) and the proxy-completed (for 5 to 14 year olds) forms of the FOP-PFQ-P were administered. However, only the proxy-completed form was used for analysis. Percentage of worst scores ranges from 0% to 100% with 0% = best possible function and 100% = worst possible function. Change from baseline for each time point is presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physical and Mental Health Using Age-Appropriate Forms of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Scale at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Global Health contains 10 questions which are rated on scales from 1 to 5 or 0 to 10. Global physical health scores were calculated as the sum of scores from parameters 3, 6, 7, and 8 and ranges from 4 to 20 where, 4 = worse health and 20 = better health. Global mental health scores were calculated as the sum of scores from parameters 2, 4, 5, and 10 and ranges from 4 to 20 where, 4 = worse health and 20 = better health. For paediatric subjects, the PROMIS was administered as per the adult version. However, there is a single total score for the paediatric PROMIS (as opposed to global physical and global mental health scores as are in the adult version). The total score were converted to a T-score. A T-score of 50 is normal and increments of 10 are +/- 1 standard deviation away from the norm. A T-score &lt;50 indicates worse health, while a T-score &gt;50 indicates better health. The higher values (positive changes) indicate better health.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Eight subjects were randomized 3:1 to either palovarotene or placebo in Cohort 1; 8 additional subjects were randomized 3:1 in an interim period between Cohorts 1 and 2. In Cohort 2, 24 additional fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) subjects were randomized 3:3:2 across 2 weight-based regimens of palovarotene or placebo.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study included clinically diagnosed FOP subjects at least 6 years of age (Cohort 2) or 15 years of age and older (Cohort 1) with symptomatic onset of a flare-up within 7 days of treatment start and accessible for treatment and follow-up.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Responders at Week 6</title>
        <description>A responder was defined as a subject with no or minimal new heterotopic ossification (HO) at flare-up site versus baseline as assessed by plain radiographs at Week 6. Minimal new HO is defined as new HO with an HO score &lt;=3 in both anterior/posterior (AP) and lateral projections (or if one view is non-interpretable or non-evaluable, then remaining evaluable view is used). The HO score ranges from 0 to 6 where, 0 = no HO and 6 = single contiguous HO with longest dimension &gt;2 diameters of reference normotopic bone in any projection. The highest HO score from the 2 projections was used. Results from Primary Read reviews are presented. The Primary Read process included a double-read radiology review paradigm with consensus adjudication. Radiography and CT scans were examined independently by scan type, flare-up region, and imaging time point in order to determine whether radiography would be sufficient to measure new HO formation. Only subjects with interpretable outcomes were evaluated.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Responders at Week 12</title>
        <description>A responder was defined as a subject with no or minimal new HO at the flare-up site versus baseline as assessed by plain radiographs at Week 12. Minimal new HO is defined as new HO with an HO score &lt;=3 in both the AP and lateral projections (or if one view is non-interpretable or non-evaluable, then the remaining evaluable view is used). The HO score ranges from 0 to 6 where, 0 = no HO and 6 = single contiguous HO with longest dimension &gt;2 diameters of the reference normotopic bone in any projection. The highest HO score from the 2 projections was used. Results from the Primary Read reviews are presented. The Primary Read process included a double-read radiology review paradigm with consensus adjudication. Radiography and CT scans were examined independently by scan type, flare-up region, and imaging time point in order to determine whether radiography would be sufficient to measure new HO formation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Amount of Bone Formation (Volume) at Weeks 6 and 12</title>
        <description>Low dose CT scan were used as a secondary imaging assessment of HO, and was performed at the same time points as plain radiographs. Interpretation of the CT scan documented the amount (volume) and grade of HO. The independent reviewer scored HO lesions according to the following scale for HO on CT. Grade 1 = fluid attenuation without evidence of calcification at CT, Grade 2 = calcification of soft tissues without evidence of bone formation, Grade 3 = immature bone formation, and Grade 4 = mature bone with cortical differentiation. Volume of new HO was determined according to the following steps: (1) calculate volume of new HO compared to baseline for each reviewer/HO ID, (2) sum the volume of new HO across HO IDs for each reviewer, and (3) average the volume of new HO across reviewers. Results from Primary Read reviews are presented.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With Soft Tissue Swelling and Cartilage Formation Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Ultrasound (US) at Weeks 6 and 12</title>
        <description>The MRI was utilized to evaluate the presence of soft tissue swelling/edema (and volume of the swelling/edema) and presence of cartilage formation (yes or no). For subjects who could not have an MRI, US was used to assess edema severity for the sub-set of subjects enrolled after this opinion was introduced in a protocol amendment. Imaging film from MRI was assessed by two independent readers. When there was sufficient agreement between the independent readers on volume, both of the independent readings were used for analysis with the volume measurements averaged. When there was insufficient agreement between the independent readers, an adjudication reading was provided and used for analysis. The US was used for soft tissue swelling/edema but not cartilage formation. Percentage calculated as % = 100 x n/N' where N' is the number of subjects with interpretable outcomes. Results from Primary Read reviews are presented.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Subjects With Soft Tissue Swelling and Cartilage Formation Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Ultrasound (US) at Weeks 6 and 12</title>
          <description>The MRI was utilized to evaluate the presence of soft tissue swelling/edema (and volume of the swelling/edema) and presence of cartilage formation (yes or no). For subjects who could not have an MRI, US was used to assess edema severity for the sub-set of subjects enrolled after this opinion was introduced in a protocol amendment. Imaging film from MRI was assessed by two independent readers. When there was sufficient agreement between the independent readers on volume, both of the independent readings were used for analysis with the volume measurements averaged. When there was insufficient agreement between the independent readers, an adjudication reading was provided and used for analysis. The US was used for soft tissue swelling/edema but not cartilage formation. Percentage calculated as % = 100 x n/N' where N' is the number of subjects with interpretable outcomes. Results from Primary Read reviews are presented.</description>

        <description>Flare-up movement outcomes were independently assessed by both the subject (or parent of a subject under 8 years of age) and the Investigator at Weeks 6 and 12 by completing the global assessment of movement. The subject/parent completed the global assessment first. Prior to reviewing the subject's assessment, the Investigator completed his/her own assessment of the flare-up outcome. Subjects were assessed how the flare-up affected their movement on a scale ranging 1 to 5 where, 1 = severely worse movement and 5 = better movement compared with study Day 1 (day of first dose of study drug). Investigators were assessed how the flare-up affected the subject's movement on a scale ranging 1 to 5 where, 1 = severely worse movement and 5 = better movement compared with baseline (day of screening physical examination).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Flare-Up Pain and Swelling at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</title>
        <description>The pain and swelling associated with flare-ups was evaluated using 2 separate numeric rating scales, one for pain and one for swelling. The pain scale ranges from 0 to 10 where, 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain ever experienced. The swelling scale ranges from 0 to 10 where, 0 = no swelling and 10 = worst swelling ever experienced. The Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) was used for children less than 8 years old. The FPS-R ranges from 0 to 10 where, 0 = no pain and 10 = very much pain in two-point increments.</description>

        <population>The PP population included all subjects who were eligible for the FAS population, completed Week 6 study visit with no major protocol deviations with at least 80% compliance with study drug, and had an evaluable radiograph or CT at Week 6 sufficient to allow determination of HO at flare-up site.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Percentage of Worst Total Score for FOP-Specific Physical Function Questionnaire (FOP-PFQ) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</title>
        <description>The FOP-PFQ consists of 28 questions rated on scales from 1 to 5, with lower scores denoting more difficulty. The adult form of the FOP-PFQ was administered to subjects 15 years of age and older. There are two Pediatric FOP-PFQ (FOP-PFQ-P) forms: a self-completed form for 8 to 14 year-olds and a parent proxy-completed form for 5 to 14 year-olds. For subjects between 8 to 14 years of age, both the self-completed (for 8 to 14 year-olds) and the proxy-completed (for 5 to 14 year olds) forms of the FOP-PFQ-P were administered. However, only the proxy-completed form was used for analysis. Percentage of worst scores ranges from 0% to 100% with 0% = best possible function and 100% = worst possible function. Change from baseline for each time point is presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Physical and Mental Health Using Age-Appropriate Forms of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Scale at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12</title>
        <description>The PROMIS Global Health contains 10 questions which are rated on scales from 1 to 5 or 0 to 10. Global physical health scores were calculated as the sum of scores from parameters 3, 6, 7, and 8 and ranges from 4 to 20 where, 4 = worse health and 20 = better health. Global mental health scores were calculated as the sum of scores from parameters 2, 4, 5, and 10 and ranges from 4 to 20 where, 4 = worse health and 20 = better health. For paediatric subjects, the PROMIS was administered as per the adult version. However, there is a single total score for the paediatric PROMIS (as opposed to global physical and global mental health scores as are in the adult version). The total score were converted to a T-score. A T-score of 50 is normal and increments of 10 are +/- 1 standard deviation away from the norm. A T-score &lt;50 indicates worse health, while a T-score &gt;50 indicates better health. The higher values (positive changes) indicate better health.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There IS an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Radiography was less sensitive than CT for detecting new HO. Also, some subjects had new HO only at Week 12. Thus, Global Read data are presented where available using more sensitive CT scans at Week 12 in the PP population.</limitations_and_caveats>
