      To determine minocycline's effects on cognitive performance and measures of mood in abstinent
      cocaine users. Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative antibiotic that also inhibits
      microglia activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and nitric
      oxide (NO) production. Previous animal and human studies suggest that minocycline may have
      utility as a treatment for cocaine addiction.

      We are proposing a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. A total of 40 male and or
      female subject completers will have two 4-day treatment periods, in which they will be
      randomized to minocycline (200 mg/day) or placebo. During the first 3 days of each treatment
      period, subjects will have daily clinic visits for medication administration and monitoring
      of adverse events. On Day 4, subjects will have an experimental session in which measures of
      mood and cognitive performance will be obtained. Following a washout period, ranging from 5
      to 15 days, subjects will be crossed over to the alternative treatment.

      This study began July 2013; currently 7 subjects were randomized with 5 completers and two
      drop outs. This study is in data analysis phase.
