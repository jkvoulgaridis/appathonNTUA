      Background and study aims: The prostate gland sits around the exit of the bladder in men. As
      men get older, the prostate grows, and this can narrow the exit from the bladder, so that
      there is restriction of flow. As a result, some men develop difficulty passing urine
      (voiding) as they age. For these men, prostate surgery can be helpful by removing the part of
      the prostate causing the narrowing, so that flow improves. However, for some men, almost
      identical symptoms of difficulty passing urine are due to underactive bladder. In other
      words, the bladder contraction is too weak, and is not effective at expelling the urine. This
      is a smaller group, but important, as these men may have no improvement after prostate
      surgery, while being exposed to risk of complications of surgery. Medical assessment of men
      with voiding problems typically involves discussing the symptoms, doing a physical
      examination of the prostate and measuring the urine flow rate. In many NHS hospitals, these
      are the only tests done before deciding whether to proceed to prostate surgery. In effect,
      voiding symptoms are presumed to be a result of prostate enlargement for these men, since it
      is the more common problem compared with bladder underactivity. However, this approach cannot
      identify which men actually have bladder underactivity as the cause of their voiding
      symptoms. So, in some hospitals an extra test is used, called urodynamics. Urodynamics is
      done to measure how much pressure the bladder generates when passing urine, because a high
      pressure shows the problem is obstruction, and a low pressure shows it is bladder weakness.
      Urodynamics involves gently putting a small tube into the bladder via the penis to measure
      the bladder pressure, and to fill the bladder with a sterile fluid (saline). Another small
      tube is gently placed into the rectum, via the anus, to measure abdominal pressures.
      Measuring abdominal pressure is necessary because any change in abdominal pressure can affect
      bladder pressure, and if the test did not allow for this it could give a misleading result.
      Urodynamics is safe, but some men find it uncomfortable or undignified, and a few develop
      urine infection afterwards. No studies have been conducted so far to tell us which of these
      two approaches to assessing men with voiding urinary problems is better overall.

      UPSTREAM consists of two phases: &quot;UPSTREAM - Phase I&quot; was a pragmatic, two-arm, multicentre,
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of
      invasive urodynamics (UDS) for the diagnosis and management of bladder outlet obstruction in
      men. Men from 26 urology departments of NHS Hospitals in England who had bothersome lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and were seeking further treatment, which may have included
      surgery, were randomised to one of two study arms; 'Routine Care' (as per the NICE diagnostic
      pathway), or routine care plus UDS ('Urodynamics'), which is currently optional. The design
      was utilised to establish noninferiority in symptom severity (International Prostate Symptom
      Score [IPSS]) 18-months post-randomisation. The primary outcome was IPSS at 18-months
      post-randomisation, and a key secondary outcome was the influence of UDS on rates of bladder
      outlet surgery. The RCT started 01 April 2014 and ended 30 September 2018.

      In 2018, we were awarded an extension to conduct a further (long term) follow up of UPSTREAM
      participants, five years post-randomisation; &quot;UPSTREAM - Phase II&quot;. We aim to identify: the
      symptom outcomes of treatment; definitive surgery rates in the two study arms; and the
      long-term impact of LUTS and its therapy. The focus will continue to be on effectiveness and
      patient outcomes as per the original commissioning brief. &quot;UPSTREAM - Phase II&quot; started 01
      July 2019 and has a planned end date of 30 June 2022.

      The aim of the UPSTREAM trial (&quot;UPSTREAM - Phase I&quot;) was to determine whether a care pathway
      including invasive urodynamics is no worse for men in terms of symptom outcome than one in
      which it is not included, at 18 months after randomisation. We also aimed to establish
      whether inclusion of invasive urodynamics reduces rates of bladder outlet surgery as a main
      secondary outcome.

      The following men were invited to participate (inclusion criterion); • Men seeking further
      treatment for their bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) which may include surgery

      Men were not invited to participate (exclusion criteria) if they:

        -  were unable to pass urine without a catheter (urinary retention)

        -  had a relevant neurological disease, such as a stroke

        -  were undergoing treatment for prostate or bladder cancer

        -  had previously had prostate surgery

        -  were not medically fit for surgery, or were unable to complete outcome assessments

        -  did not consent to be assigned at random to one of the pathways

      We compared the two methods of investigation by finding out whether the men had similar
      relief of their symptoms, by measuring the change in the prostate symptom score (IPSS) in the
      two groups at 18 months after randomisation (primary outcome).

      We also looked at the following secondary outcomes:

        -  Whether the invasive tests changed the decision for surgery in some of the men (how many
           men had surgery in each of the two groups?)

        -  The cost-effectiveness of the two management pathways

        -  Adverse effects of (a) the tests and (b) the treatments (e.g. urinary infection, urinary
           retention)

        -  Urinary symptoms at 6, 12 &amp; 18 months, using the International Consultation on
           Incontinence Questionnaires (ICIQ) and the Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms
           questionnaire (ICIQ-MLUTS)

        -  Quality of life, using the IPSS-QoL question

        -  Sexual function, using the ICIQ-MLUTS sex questionnaire

        -  Satisfaction with urodynamic testing, using the ICIQ-UDS-S questionnaire

        -  The maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) at 18 months

        -  Health outcomes, using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire

      For &quot;UPSTREAM - Phase II&quot;. In this further follow up study (&quot;UPSTREAM - Phase II&quot;), we want
      to find out the longer term (5-year) results of treatment for the men's LUTS, and see how
      many men went on to receive surgery after the initial 18-months (i.e. after the original
      study, &quot;UPSTREAM - Phase I&quot;).

      We will approach existing participants of the UPSTREAM trial (&quot;UPSTREAM - Phase I&quot;). In
      taking part in &quot;UPSTREAM - Phase II&quot;, men do not need to return to hospital for any clinical
      assessments. Instead we will ask them to complete one questionnaire booklet about their
      urinary symptoms, the effect on their everyday life, and their general state of health. We
      will also securely collect information relevant to this study from central NHS records (such
      as information about relevant inpatient stays and outpatient attendances).

      Outcome measures will include:

      LUTS will be measured with the widely-used patient reported outcome, the International
      Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), at five years post-randomisation.

      • Measures from the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaires (ICIQ) will
      also be used, giving sensitive and comprehensive assessment of LUTS severity/ bother, sexual
      function and quality of life (QoL), i.e.: O IPSS QoL O ICIQ Male LUTS (ICIQ-MLUTS) O ICIQ
      sexual function in Male LUTS (ICIQ-MLUTS-sex)

        -  The EQ-5D-5L will be used to provide the QoL weights used to calculate Quality Adjusted
           Life Years (QALYs).

        -  Data for: Surgery rates (the relative proportion of men in each group having surgery up
           to five years post-randomisation); diagnostic testing after the main trial (where
           possible); and resource use will be obtained via a one-off bespoke data extraction of
           Health Episode Statistics (HES) and HES-Office of National Statistics (ONS) linked data,
           via NHS Digital. This will include individual level data about participants' relevant:
           inpatient stays; outpatient attendances: including procedures; radiology and accident
           and emergency (A&amp;E) episodes; and cause of death (where applicable).

    <description>EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). In the descriptive system, respondents rate their health 'TODAY' according to 5 dimensions (Mobility; Self-Care; Usual Activities; Pain/Discomfort; and Anxiety/Depression), with 5 levels of severity (No Problems; Slight; Moderate; Severe; and Extreme Problems). This results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions are combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' (100) and 'The worst health you can imagine' (0). The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome reflecting the patient's own judgement.
