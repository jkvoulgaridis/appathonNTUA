  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marijuana is by far the mostly commonly used illicit drug during pregnancy, and prenatal
      exposure to marijuana can have lasting negative effects. However, current answers to this
      problem are failing to reach most women who use marijuana while pregnant. This project will
      develop and begin testing two technology-based, highly practical interventions that could
      reduce the number of children who are prenatally exposed to marijuana.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are at present no evidence-based interventions for marijuana use during pregnancy,
      despite its being by far the most commonly used illicit drug during pregnancy (particularly
      among African-American women), and despite growing evidence that it may have a range of
      long-term cognitive and neurobehavioral consequences. This R34 clinical trial planning grant
      therefore proposes the development and preliminary validation of two high- reach and mutually
      compatible technology-based interventions for marijuana use during pregnancy. The first, a
      theory-based, synchronous, and highly interactive computer-delivered brief intervention, will
      be based on an emerging knowledge base regarding key elements of efficacious
      technology-delivered interventions. The second intervention, a series of tailored text
      messages, will build on the rich literature regarding key tailoring elements. These
      interventions will be developed and refined with input from pregnant women who report active
      use of marijuana, as well as from health care providers. They will subsequently be
      tested-alone and in combination-in a pilot randomized trial involving 80 women actively using
      marijuana during pregnancy. This Stage I pilot work would set the stage for a confirmatory
      Stage II trial. It would also produce the first high-reach brief interventions for marijuana
      use during pregnancy. If effective, these approaches could have a substantial population
      impact on marijuana use among pregnant women, with potential for lifelong improved outcomes
      for both mother and child.

          <description>The Alcohol Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is used to detect and manage substance use and related problems. For this measure the sum of all the marijuana related items was calculated for each participant. We reported the median score for each intervention arm group. Scores on the marijuana subscale range from 0 to 33. Scores of 0 to 3 present low risk; 4 - 26 moderate risk (at risk of health &amp; other problems from current pattern of use); and 27 - 33 high risk (severe problems &amp; likely to be dependent).</description>

          <title>Electronic SBIRT (eSBIRT)</title>
          <description>Participants in this condition will receive empathic exploration of their thoughts regarding marijuana use, provision of information on possible consequences of marijuana use during pregnancy and potential benefits of changing use (with permission), normed feedback, use of Motivational Interviewing techniques to elicit their own reasons for change, video testimonials modeling successful change, and information on change methods with optional goal setting.
eSBIRT: A single 20 minute interactive computer-delivered intervention designed to promote motivation to change prenatal marijuana use, without presuming the participant to be currently using marijuana while pregnant.</description>

        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Tailored Texting</title>
          <description>Participants in this condition will chose the frequency and time of text messages that will continue until childbirth or the participant opts out. The text messages will be a mix of marijuana targeted content (without directly referring to marijuana in a way that implies use by the participant) and general content related to healthy pregnancy; using appropriate humor and tips for community resources. Tailoring will focus on gestational age, self-efficacy, and social support.
Tailored texting: Group text messaging software from Trumpia, Inc. will be used to create the tailored text messages that will be sent to participants assigned to this intervention. Text messages will sent after the initial study participation visit until childbirth or participant opts out of receiving them.</description>
