  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of
      brexpiprazole (2.0 mg/day) as adjunctive therapy in adult subjects with a diagnosis of MDD
      with and without anxious distress
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of atypical antipsychotics has created a renewed interest in adjunctive
      therapy for MDD, particularly for treatment-resistant MDD. Several atypical antipsychotics
      have been shown to enhance the response to ADT. This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy
      of brexpiprazole (2.0 mg/day) as adjunctive therapy to an assigned open-label ADT in
      depressed subjects with and without anxious distress.

    <measure>Change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (end of Phase A [Week 8]) to week 14</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score from Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) to Week 14. The MADRS was utilized as the primary efficacy assessment of the participant's level of depression and was administered utilizing the Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA). The MADRS consisted of 10 items each with 7 defined grades of severity. The rater decided whether the rating lied on predefined scale steps (0, 2, 4, 6) or between them (1, 3, 5). The 10 items were apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, suicidal thoughts. Each item was scored using a scale of 0 to 6 (a higher score indicates increased severity). The maximum total score was 60; 0, no symptom; 60, severely affected.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) From Baseline to End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (end of Phase A [Week 8]) to week 14</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the change in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Score (the mean of 3 individual item scores) from Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) to Week 14 (End of Phase B). SDS was a 3-item clinician-rated questionnaire used to evaluate impairments in the domains of work, social life, and family life/home responsibility. Each item was scored using a scale of 0 to 10 (a higher score indicates symptoms have disrupted work, social life, and family life/home responsibility extremely). The maximum total score was 30; 0 = not at all, to 30 = extremely.</description>

    <measure>Change From End of Phase A to End of Phase B in MADRS Total Score for the Subpopulation With &lt;25% Improvement From Baseline of Phase A to End of Phase A in MADRS Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (end of Phase A [Week 8]) to week 14</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the change from end of Phase A (Week 8 visit) to end of Phase B (Week 14 visit) in MADRS Total Score for the subpopulation with &lt; 25% improvement from baseline of Phase A (Week 0) to end of Phase A (Week 8) in MADRS Total Score. The MADRS was utilized as the primary efficacy assessment of the participant's level of depression and was administered utilizing the Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA). The MADRS consisted of 10 items each with 7 defined grades of severity. The 10 items were apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, suicidal thoughts. Each item was scored using a scale of 0 to 6 (a higher score indicates increased severity). The maximum total score was 60; 0, no symptom; 60, severely affected.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This trial was conducted in 837 participants at 51 trial sites in the following 5 countries:Germany,Hungary,Poland,Slovakia,andUnited States (US).A total of 1144 participants with major depressive disorder were screened for the trial, 837 enrolled into Phase A,394 were randomized into Phase B and 322 continued treatment with placebo+ADT in Phase A+</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Trial consisted of a screening phase and 3 phases. In phase A (8-week single-blind prospective treatment phase) and in phase A+ (Single-blind phase A Responder), there was single treatment group. In phase B (6-week double-blind randomization phase), there were 2 treatment groups. All Outcome Measures were assessed in phase B.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Phase A: All ADT (Antidepressant Therapy)</title>
          <description>Participants meeting entrance criteria who were experiencing a major depressive episode with a HAM-D17 Total Score of greater than or equal 18 at baseline were enrolled into an 8-week Single-blind Prospective Treatment Phase (Phase A). All participants received single-blind placebo plus an investigator determined, open-label, ADT. Once assigned to an ADT by the investigator, participants remained on the same ADT for the duration of the trial. At the Week 8 visit, the IWRS (Interactive web response system) determined based on scores entered by the investigator, whether a participant was a “Phase A Responder” or a “Phase A Inadequate Responder.”</description>

          <title>Phase A +: ALL ADT</title>
          <description>Phase A+ included participants who met criteria for a response at the end of the prospective treatment phase (Week 8 visit of Phase A) and participants who were not suitable for randomization in Phase B per the judgment of the investigator or medical monitor. Treatment response in Phase A was determined at the Week 8 visit based on improvement or lack of improvement of the participant’s depressive symptoms, which was confirmed by clinical criteria that prospectively defined response. Participant response was determined from clinical data that were entered into the IWRS at each visit. Participants in Phase A+ received single-blind placebo+ADT for an additional 6 weeks, for a total of 14 weeks, and attended visits at Weeks 11 and 14.</description>

        <title>Change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression</title>
        <description>To assess the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score from Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) to Week 14. The MADRS was utilized as the primary efficacy assessment of the participant's level of depression and was administered utilizing the Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA). The MADRS consisted of 10 items each with 7 defined grades of severity. The rater decided whether the rating lied on predefined scale steps (0, 2, 4, 6) or between them (1, 3, 5). The 10 items were apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, suicidal thoughts. Each item was scored using a scale of 0 to 6 (a higher score indicates increased severity). The maximum total score was 60; 0, no symptom; 60, severely affected.</description>

SDS was a 3-item clinician-rated questionnaire used to evaluate impairments in the domains of work, social life, and family life/home responsibility. Each item was scored using a scale of 0 to 10 (a higher score indicates symptoms have disrupted work, social life, and family life/home responsibility extremely). The maximum total score was 30; 0 = not at all, to 30 = extremely.</description>

        <title>Change From End of Phase A to End of Phase B in MADRS Total Score for the Subpopulations With Anxious Distress as Specified in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V).</title>
        <description>To assess the change from end of Phase A (Week 8) to end of Phase B (Week 14) in MADRS Total Score for the subpopulations with anxious distress as specified in DSM-V. The MADRS was utilized as the primary efficacy assessment of the participant's level of depression and was administered utilizing the Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA). The MADRS consisted of 10 items each with 7 defined grades of severity. The 10 items were apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, suicidal thoughts. Each item was scored using a scale of 0 to 6 (a higher score indicates increased severity). The maximum total score was 60; 0, no symptom; 60, severely affected.</description>
