      The purpose of this study is to determine the mycobactericidal activity of combinations of
      bedaquiline (J), moxifloxacin (M), PA-824 (Pa) and pyrazinamide (Z) regimens during 8 weeks
      of treatment.

      The trial design is a phase 2, multi-center, open-label, partially randomized clinical trial
      in four parallel treatment groups. Subjects with drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) will be
      randomized to receive either J(loading dose/three times a week)PaZ; or J(200mg)PaZ; or HRZE.
      Subjects with multi drug-resistant tuberculosis will receive J(200mg)MPaZ. The HRZE treatment
      arm is included as a control for the drug-sensitive treatments and as a control for the
      quantitative laboratory mycobacteriology testing.

      A total of approximately 240 male and female, newly diagnosed subjects with drug-sensitive or
      multi drug-resistant, smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis aged 18 to 75 years (inclusive)
      will be included in the study. A total of 180 subjects with drug-sensitive tuberculosis (60
      per treatment arm) will be randomized. Up to 60 subjects with multi-drug resistant
      tuberculosis will be assigned.

      All subjects will have up to a maximum of 9 days screening, receive 8 weeks of treatment, and
      have follow-up visits at 2 and 12 weeks after study treatment completion or last dose of
      investigational medicinal product in the case of early withdrawal. Subjects who withdraw from
      the study after receiving &lt; 14 days of investigational medicinal product, will only attend a
      follow-up visit at 2 weeks after last dose of investigational medicinal product.

      Upon treatment completion, the subjects with drug-sensitive tuberculosis will be provided
      with sufficient doses of standard of care tuberculosis treatment, as appropriate, to cover
      the time period from attending their last visit at the study clinic until their scheduled
      visit at the TB clinic. All subjects with drug sensitive and multi-drug resistant
      tuberculosis will be referred to the local community tuberculosis clinics for standard
      anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy according to National Tuberculosis Guidelines.

    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 56 (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The bactericidal activity (BA) was determined by the rate of change in TTP collected from overnight sputum samples over 8 weeks of treatment in the liquid culture media MGIT system, represented by the model-fitted log(TTP) results as calculated by the regression of the observed log(TTP) results over time. The bactericidal activity of log(TTP) over Day 0 to Day 56 (BATTP[0-56]) was presented and expressed as the daily percentage change in TTP from Day 0 to Day 56. The mean BATTP (0-56) was calculated from Bayesian non-linear mixed effects regression models fitted to log(TTP) collected from sputum samples (observed from Day 0 to Day 56).</description>

    <description>A TEAE was defined as any AE which started or worsened on or after first study drug administration up to and including the Day 70 follow-up visit (or up to and including 14 days after last study drug administration for participants not having Day 70 follow-up visit). Drug-related TEAEs were defined as TEAEs for which relationship to study drug was indicated as 'possible', 'probable', 'certain' or missing. TEAEs leading to death were defined as TEAEs resulted 'fatal' outcome. Serious TEAEs were defined as TEAEs for which serious was indicated as 'yes'. TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were defined as TEAEs for which action taken with study drug was indicated as 'study drug stopped'. TEAEs leading to early withdrawal from study were defined as TEAEs resulted study discontinuation. Grade III and IV TEAEs were defined as TEAEs for which severity (DMID grade) was indicated as 'Grade 3 (severe)' and 'Grade 4 (potentially life-threatening)' or missing, respectively.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This trial was conducted at 10 centers in 3 countries (South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda) from 23 October 2014. Adult male and female participants with drug-sensitive (DS) or multi-drug resistant (MDR) smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were recruited into this open-label multi-center study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were confirmed positive for M.tuberculosis on molecular test. DS-TB participants were to be sensitive to rifampicin and newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB (or untreated for at least 3 years). MDR-TB participants were to be resistant to rifampicin, sensitive to moxifloxacin and newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB (or treated for &lt;=7 days).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Rate of Change in Time to Sputum Culture Positivity (TTP) Over 8 Weeks in the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) System</title>
        <description>The bactericidal activity (BA) was determined by the rate of change in TTP collected from overnight sputum samples over 8 weeks of treatment in the liquid culture media MGIT system, represented by the model-fitted log(TTP) results as calculated by the regression of the observed log(TTP) results over time. The bactericidal activity of log(TTP) over Day 0 to Day 56 (BATTP[0-56]) was presented and expressed as the daily percentage change in TTP from Day 0 to Day 56. The mean BATTP (0-56) was calculated from Bayesian non-linear mixed effects regression models fitted to log(TTP) collected from sputum samples (observed from Day 0 to Day 56).</description>

        <description>A TEAE was defined as any AE which started or worsened on or after first study drug administration up to and including the Day 70 follow-up visit (or up to and including 14 days after last study drug administration for participants not having Day 70 follow-up visit). Drug-related TEAEs were defined as TEAEs for which relationship to study drug was indicated as 'possible', 'probable', 'certain' or missing. TEAEs leading to death were defined as TEAEs resulted 'fatal' outcome. Serious TEAEs were defined as TEAEs for which serious was indicated as 'yes'. TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were defined as TEAEs for which action taken with study drug was indicated as 'study drug stopped'. TEAEs leading to early withdrawal from study were defined as TEAEs resulted study discontinuation. Grade III and IV TEAEs were defined as TEAEs for which severity (DMID grade) was indicated as 'Grade 3 (severe)' and 'Grade 4 (potentially life-threatening)' or missing, respectively.</description>
