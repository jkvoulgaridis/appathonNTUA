  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, repeat-dose, study of sebelipase alfa in infants with rapidly
      progressive lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D). Eligible participants received
      once-weekly infusions of sebelipase alfa for up to 3 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder that is
      caused by a marked decrease or complete absence of the LAL enzyme, leading to the
      accumulation of lipids, predominately cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, in various
      tissues and cell types. In the liver, accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes and macrophages
      leads to hepatomegaly, fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver dysfunction, and hepatic failure. In the
      small intestine, lipid-laden macrophage accumulation in the lamina propria leads to profound
      malabsorption.

      Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency presenting in infancy is an extremely rare form of the
      disease characterized by profound malabsorption, growth failure, and hepatic failure that is
      usually fatal within the first 6 months of life.

    <measure>Participants Experiencing Severe Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening through Month 37</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants experiencing severe TEAEs is presented for participants who received sebelipase alfa in this open-label study. Adverse events were obtained through spontaneous reporting or elicited by specific questioning or examination of the participant's parent or legal guardian. An adverse event was defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition in a participant, whether or not causally related to administration of study drug. Adverse event severity was graded by the Investigator as mild, moderate, or severe based on definitions developed from Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium Study Data Tabulation Model standard terminology v3.1.1. Adverse events reporting was from the date of informed consent until completion of the follow-up visit at approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A summary of all serious and other nonserious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported AE module.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants in the FAS who survived to 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age. The exact confidence interval was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. Participants with unknown survival status at the age specified in the analysis were excluded. At 36 months, there were 2 participants who were alive and still on study who had not yet reached the age specified in the analysis. As such, these participants were excluded from the calculation of percent surviving.</description>

    <measure>Number Of Participants Achieving And Maintaining Transfusion-free Hemoglobin Normalization (TFHN)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants achieving and maintaining TFHN are presented. For TFHN to be achieved, the participant had to meet the following criteria:
Two post baseline measurements of hemoglobin, at least 4 weeks apart, were above the age-adjusted lower limit of normal (LLN);
No known additional measurements of hemoglobin were below the age-adjusted LLN during the (minimum) 4 week period;
No transfusions were administered to the participant during the (minimum) 4 week period, or for 2 weeks prior to the first hemoglobin measurement in the (minimum) 4 week period. If all 3 criteria were met, a participant was considered to have achieved TFHN on the date of the first hemoglobin assessment in the 4 week period. A participant was considered to have maintained TFHN if he/she was transfusion free at Week 6 and had no abnormally low hemoglobin levels (levels below the age adjusted LLN) beginning at Week 8 of the study and continuing for at least 13 weeks (3 months).</description>

    <description>All participants initiated once weekly (qw) intravenous (IV) infusions with sebelipase alfa at a dose of 1 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) qw. A participant who met protocol defined dose escalation criteria at a dose of 1 mg/kg qw could be considered for a dose escalation to 3 mg/kg qw. If a participant continued to meet dose escalation criteria after at least 4 infusions at a dose of 3 mg/kg qw, the participant could be considered for a further dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw. Under country-specific provisions (United Kingdom only), participants could be considered for a further dose escalation to 7.5 mg/kg qw if a thorough case review indicated that a participant continued to have evidence of disease progression at a dose of 5 mg/kg qw. All dose escalations were contingent upon acceptable safety and tolerability of preceding infusions and were undertaken by mutual agreement of the Investigator and Sponsor and after approval by an independent safety committee.</description>

        <title>Participants Experiencing Severe Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>The number of participants experiencing severe TEAEs is presented for participants who received sebelipase alfa in this open-label study. Adverse events were obtained through spontaneous reporting or elicited by specific questioning or examination of the participant's parent or legal guardian. An adverse event was defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition in a participant, whether or not causally related to administration of study drug. Adverse event severity was graded by the Investigator as mild, moderate, or severe based on definitions developed from Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium Study Data Tabulation Model standard terminology v3.1.1. Adverse events reporting was from the date of informed consent until completion of the follow-up visit at approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A summary of all serious and other nonserious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported AE module.</description>

A participant who met protocol defined dose escalation criteria at a dose of 1 mg/kg qw could be considered for a dose escalation to 3 mg/kg qw. If a participant continued to meet dose escalation criteria after at least 4 infusions at a dose of 3 mg/kg qw, the participant could be considered for a further dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw. Under country-specific provisions (UK only), participants could be considered for a further dose escalation to 7.5 mg/kg qw if a thorough case review indicated that a participant continued to have evidence of disease progression at a dose of 5 mg/kg qw. All dose escalations were contingent upon acceptable safety and tolerability of preceding infusions and were undertaken by mutual agreement of the Investigator and Sponsor and after approval by an independent safety committee.</description>

        <title>Number Of Participants With Stunting, Wasting, Or Underweight At Baseline, 12, 24, And 36 Months</title>
        <description>The number of participants who met criteria for the following 3 dichotomous indicators of under nutrition were reported. These indicators included the following:
Stunting was defined as at least 2 standard deviations below the median for length-for-age/height-for-age.
Wasting was defined as wasting at least 2 standard deviations below the median for weight-for-length/weight-for-height.
Underweight was defined as at least 2 standard deviations below the median for WFA.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12, Month 24, and Month 36</time_frame>
        <population>FAS: All participants who received any amount of sebelipase alfa (1.0, 3.0, 5.0, or 7.5 mg/kg qw) during the study and where applicable, met end point criteria.</population>

            <title>Open-Label Sebelipase Alfa</title>
            <description>All participants initiated qw IV infusions with sebelipase alfa at a dose of 1 mg/kg qw. A participant who met protocol defined dose escalation criteria at a dose of 1 mg/kg qw could be considered for a dose escalation to 3 mg/kg qw. If a participant continued to meet dose escalation criteria after at least 4 infusions at a dose of 3 mg/kg qw, the participant could be considered for a further dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw. Under country-specific provisions (UK only), participants could be considered for a further dose escalation to 7.5 mg/kg qw if a thorough case review indicated that a participant continued to have evidence of disease progression at a dose of 5 mg/kg qw. All dose escalations were contingent upon acceptable safety and tolerability of preceding infusions and were undertaken by mutual agreement of the Investigator and Sponsor and after approval by an independent safety committee.</description>

A participant who met protocol defined dose escalation criteria at a dose of 1 mg/kg qw could be considered for a dose escalation to 3 mg/kg qw. If a participant continued to meet dose escalation criteria after at least 4 infusions at a dose of 3 mg/kg qw, the participant could be considered for a further dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw. Under country-specific provisions (UK only), participants could be considered for a further dose escalation to 7.5 mg/kg qw if a thorough case review indicated that a participant continued to have evidence of disease progression at a dose of 5 mg/kg qw. All dose escalations were contingent upon acceptable safety and tolerability of preceding infusions and were undertaken by mutual agreement of the Investigator and Sponsor and after approval by an independent safety committee.</description>

Two post baseline measurements of hemoglobin, at least 4 weeks apart, were above the age-adjusted lower limit of normal (LLN);
No known additional measurements of hemoglobin were below the age-adjusted LLN during the (minimum) 4 week period;
No transfusions were administered to the participant during the (minimum) 4 week period, or for 2 weeks prior to the first hemoglobin measurement in the (minimum) 4 week period. If all 3 criteria were met, a participant was considered to have achieved TFHN on the date of the first hemoglobin assessment in the 4 week period. A participant was considered to have maintained TFHN if he/she was transfusion free at Week 6 and had no abnormally low hemoglobin levels (levels below the age adjusted LLN) beginning at Week 8 of the study and continuing for at least 13 weeks (3 months).</description>
