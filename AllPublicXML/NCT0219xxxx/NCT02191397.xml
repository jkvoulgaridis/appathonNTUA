  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-centre study will follow a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group,
      active-controlled design and will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of bupropion
      extended-release (XL) (300 mg/day) compared with escitalopram (10-20 mg/day) in outpatients
      and inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The total duration of the study will be
      11 weeks consisting of three phases. The screening phase (phase I) will be lasting for 0-14
      days, subjects will be randomised to bupropion XL or escitalopram in a 1:1 ratio for acute
      phase treatment phase (phase II) for 8 weeks. There are 3 dose levels during this acute
      treatment phase. The 3-dose level plan is designed to ensure each drug is titrated according
      to the prescribing information and to reach an optimal clinical dose. Finally patients will
      enter the taper phase (phase III) for up to 1 week to assess and reduce the possible
      withdrawal symptoms.

      In China almost all existing antidepressants are available on the market, but bupropion XL
      has not yet been approved. This Phase III clinical trial will be used for the purpose of
      registering bupropion XL in China.

    <measure>Mean Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - 17 (HAMD-17) Total Score From Baseline to End of Acute Treatment Phase (Week 8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>HAMD-17 is used to assess the severity of depression and symptom improvement. It consisted of 17 questions. The HAMD-17 total score is calculated by summing the individual response scores if there is no missing response. HAMD-17 has a total score in a range of 0 (not present) to 52 (severe). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline total score (at Day 0, Week 0) from Week 8 observed total score. The Per Protocol (PP) Population is defined as all randomized participants in the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population who do not meet criteria of a major protocol deviation, with overall compliance of active drug for acute treatment phase in the range of 75%-125% and complete the first 6 weeks treatment and has HAMD-17 assessment at/after week 6 (that is &gt;=35 days). All participants in the PP population were included in the mixed model repeated measures analysis. Only those participants with data available at the specified time point were analyzed.</description>

             the Baseline Visit.

          -  Subject must be in general good health and be considered clinically appropriate for
             therapy with bupropion or escitalopram, based upon the investigator's overall clinical
             evaluation.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential only: patients must not be lactating and
             must test negative for pregnancy at screening and agree to use a medically accepted
             method of birth control during the study.

          -  Liver function tests: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN);
             alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Corrected QT (QTc) criteria： QTc &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480msec for patients
             with bundle branch block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate
             according to either Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or machine
             or manual overread. For subject eligibility and withdrawal, QTcF will be used. For
             purpose of data analysis, QTcF will be used. The QTc should be based on single or
             averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief
             recording period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (XL) and escitalopram oxalate in participants with major depressive disorder. This study was conducted in China from 10-February-2015 to 25-October-2016.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study had screening phase (up to 14 days), 8-week double blind treatment phase and taper phase (up to 1 week). A total of 655 participants were screened and 538 were randomized into the study. 4 participants were randomized but discontinued prior to receiving any study treatment. Hence, the Safety Population was comprised of 534 participants.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Bupropion XL</title>
          <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

          <title>Escitalopram</title>
          <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 capsule of escitalopram 10 mg per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). Escitalopram dose was maintained at 10 mg per day (1 capsule of Escitalopram 10 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), the escitalopram dose could be increased to 20 mg per day (2 capsule of Escitalopram 10 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were also dosed with placebo matching bupropion XL at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - 17 (HAMD-17) Total Score From Baseline to End of Acute Treatment Phase (Week 8)</title>
        <description>HAMD-17 is used to assess the severity of depression and symptom improvement. It consisted of 17 questions. The HAMD-17 total score is calculated by summing the individual response scores if there is no missing response. HAMD-17 has a total score in a range of 0 (not present) to 52 (severe). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline total score (at Day 0, Week 0) from Week 8 observed total score. The Per Protocol (PP) Population is defined as all randomized participants in the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population who do not meet criteria of a major protocol deviation, with overall compliance of active drug for acute treatment phase in the range of 75%-125% and complete the first 6 weeks treatment and has HAMD-17 assessment at/after week 6 (that is &gt;=35 days). All participants in the PP population were included in the mixed model repeated measures analysis. Only those participants with data available at the specified time point were analyzed.</description>

The HAMD-17 adopted for this study consisted of 17 questions with multiple choice responses, each of which is numerically scored. The HAMD-17 total score is calculated by summing the individual response scores if there is no missing response. HAMD-17 has a total score in a range of 0 (not present) to 52 (severe). Values at Day 0, Week 0 was considered as Baseline value. Remission was defined as HAMD-17 total scores at end of acute treatment phase (Week 8) &lt;=7.</description>

To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <description>MADRS is a 10-point rating scale. Each item is scored on a scale of 0-6, with a total score range of 0-60. Higher score indicates worst symptoms. This scale is mainly used to assess the efficacy of antidepressant treatment. The ratings were based on the signs and symptoms during the preceding week prior to the visit. Values at Day0, Week 0 was considered as Baseline value. The observed MADRS total score was considered as missing if any item is missing. Change from Baseline in MADRS was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the specific post-Baseline value. All participants in the PP population were analyzed and n=X in the category titles represented the number of participants with data available at the specified time points.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAMD-17 Depressed Mood Subscale Score (Score of Item 1) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8</title>
        <description>HAMD-17 is an extensively used tool to assess the severity of depression and symptom improvement during the treatment. The HAMD-17 adopted for this study consisted of 17 questions with multiple choice responses, each of which is numerically scored. The HAMD-17 Depressed Mood Subscale is a factor score of item-1 (Depressed Mood) of HAMD-17 scale. This subscale has a score in a range of 0 (absence of depressed mood feelings) to 4 (when participants report virtually only these feeling states in his/her spontaneous verbal and non-verbal communicationtotal score). Values at Day 0, Week 0 was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline response from the specific post-Baseline response. All participants in the PP population were analyzed and n=X in the category titles represented the number of participants with data available at the specified time points.</description>

            <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

Escitalopram dose was maintained at 10 mg per day (1 capsule of Escitalopram 10 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), the escitalopram dose could be increased to 20 mg per day (2 capsule of Escitalopram 10 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were also dosed with placebo matching bupropion XL at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms.

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAMD-17 Anxiety/Somatization Subscale Score (Sum of Scores of Items 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8</title>
        <description>HAMD-17 is an extensively used tool to assess the severity of depression and symptom improvement during the treatment. The HAMD-17 adopted for this study consisted of 17 questions with multiple choice responses, each of which is numerically scored. The HAMD-17 Anxiety/Somatization subscale score was derived as sum of scores of items 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17 from HAMD-17. This subscale has a score in a range of 0 (absence of condition) to 18 (most severe condition). Values at Day 0, Week 0 was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline response from the specific post-Baseline response. All participants in the PP population were analyzed and n=X in the category titles represented the number of participants with data available at the specified time points.</description>

            <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

Escitalopram dose was maintained at 10 mg per day (1 capsule of Escitalopram 10 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), the escitalopram dose could be increased to 20 mg per day (2 capsule of Escitalopram 10 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were also dosed with placebo matching bupropion XL at each dose level.

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAMD-17 Retardation Subscale Score (Sum of Scores of Items 1, 7, 8 and 14) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8</title>
        <description>HAMD-17 is an extensively used tool to assess the severity of depression and symptom improvement during the treatment. The HAMD-17 adopted for this study consisted of 17 questions with multiple choice responses, each of which is numerically scored. The HAMD-17 Retardation subscale score was derived as sum of scores of items 1, 7, 8 and 14 from HAMD-17. This subscale has a score in a range of 0 (absence of condition) to 14 (most severe condition). Values at Day 0, Week 0 was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline response from the specific post-Baseline response. All participants in the PP population were analyzed and n=X in the category titles represented the number of participants with data available at the specified time points.</description>

At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAMD-17 Sleep Disorder Subscale Score (Sum of Scores of Items 4, 5 and 6) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8</title>
        <description>HAMD-17 is an extensively used tool to assess the severity of depression and symptom improvement during the treatment. The HAMD-17 adopted for this study consisted of 17 questions with multiple choice responses, each of which is numerically scored. The HAMD-17 Sleep Disorder subscale score was derived as sum of scores of items 4, 5 and 6 from HAMD-17. This subscale has a score in a range of 0 (absence of condition) to 6 (most severe condition). Values at Day 0, Week 0 was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline response from the specific post-Baseline response. All participants in the PP population were analyzed and n=X in the category titles represented the number of participants with data available at the specified time points.</description>

At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) Score at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8</title>
        <description>CGI-S records the severity of illness at specific time points, with a range of responses from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill participants). Participants with zero values (0) representing &quot;Not assessed&quot; were excluded from analysis. Values at Day 0, Week 0 was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the specific post-Baseline value. All participants in the PP population were analyzed and n=X in the category titles represented the number of participants with data available at the specified time points.</description>

            <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) Score at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8</title>
          <description>CGI-S records the severity of illness at specific time points, with a range of responses from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill participants). Participants with zero values (0) representing &quot;Not assessed&quot; were excluded from analysis. Values at Day 0, Week 0 was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the specific post-Baseline value. All participants in the PP population were analyzed and n=X in the category titles represented the number of participants with data available at the specified time points.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention or all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia were categorized as SAE. Participants who received any of the study treatment and had any non-serious AE or SAE were considered for analysis. Safety Population comprised of all participants who took at least one dose of the study medication.</description>

At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Screening (within 14 days prior to dosing) and at Week 8, Taper visit (Week 9) and Follow-up visit (Week 10). Baseline was considered as the value obtained at Screening. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the specific post-Baseline values. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in White Blood Cell (WBC) Count, Total Neutrophil, Lymphocyte, Basophil, Eosinophil, Monocyte and Platelet Count at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Screening (within 14 days prior to dosing) and at Week 8, Taper visit (Week 9) and Follow-up visit (Week 10). Baseline was considered as the value obtained at Screening. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the specific post-Baseline values. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Screening (within 14 days prior to dosing) and at Week 8, Taper visit (Week 9) and Follow-up visit (Week 10). Baseline was considered as the value obtained at Screening. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the specific post-Baseline values. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Screening (within 14 days prior to dosing) and at Week 8, Taper visit (Week 9) and Follow-up visit (Week 10). Baseline was considered as the value obtained at Screening. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the specific post-Baseline values. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Screening (within 14 days prior to dosing) and at Week 8, Taper visit (Week 9) and Follow-up visit (Week 10). Baseline was considered as the value obtained at Screening. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the specific post-Baseline values. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Screening (within 14 days prior to dosing) and at Week 8, Taper visit (Week 9) and Follow-up visit (Week 10). Baseline was considered as the value obtained at Screening. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the specific post-Baseline values. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

        <description>Vital signs including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were taken at Screening (within 14 days prior to dosing), randomization visit (Week 0) and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, Taper visit (Week 9) and Follow-up visit (Week 10). SBP &lt;30 or &gt;170 millimeter of mercury (mmHg); DBP &lt;20 or &gt;110 mmHg and heart rate &lt;40 or &gt;120 beats per minute (bpm) were considered as values outside of clinical concern range and were presented as 'High' or 'Low' values. Number of participants with vital signs outside of clinical concern range at any post-Baseline visit are presented. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed.</description>

            <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), the escitalopram dose could be increased to 20 mg per day (2 capsule of Escitalopram 10 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were also dosed with placebo matching bupropion XL at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Changes in Sexual Function Questionnaire (CSFQ)</title>
        <description>CSFQ is a questionnaire about sexual activity and sexual function (sexual intercourse, masturbation, sexual fantasies and other activity). CSFQ is a gender-specific questionnaire. Both male and female versions consist of 14 items, each with 5 possible answers. CSFQ has a score in a range of 14 to 70. Higher score indicates higher sexual activity and sexual function. Value at Day 0 (Week 0) was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline at Week 8 was calculated by subtracting the Baseline score from the specific post-Baseline score. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed.</description>

          <title>Bupropion XL</title>
          <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 tablet of bupropion XL 150 milligram (mg) per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). At dose level 2 (Week 1 to Week 4), bupropion XL dose was increased to 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), bupropion XL dose was still maintained at 300 mg per day (2 tablets of bupropion XL 150 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were dosed with placebo matching escitalopram at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>

          <description>In a double-blind 8-week acute treatment phase, participants received 1 capsule of escitalopram 10 mg per day at dose level 1 (Week 0 to Week 1). Escitalopram dose was maintained at 10 mg per day (1 capsule of Escitalopram 10 mg) for further 3 weeks to ensure that participants had achieved the clinical recommended dose. At dose level 3 (Week 4 to Week 8), the escitalopram dose could be increased to 20 mg per day (2 capsule of Escitalopram 10 mg). To ensure study blind, the participants were also dosed with placebo matching bupropion XL at each dose level. After treatment phase, participants entered in taper phase where dose in was down-titrated step by step to reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms. In taper phase, both dose level 2 and dose level 3 were down titrated to dose level 1 for 1 week before discontinuation.</description>
