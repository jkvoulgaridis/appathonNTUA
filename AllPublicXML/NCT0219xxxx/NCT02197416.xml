    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This open label, single arm prospective cohort study was designed to assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate (DE) for secondary prevention of paediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) with 12-month (365 days) treatment period followed by 28 days end of treatment follow-up. Results of participants were reported via 3 mutually exclusive age groups.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that they (the subjects) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. 1 enrolled subject was withdrawn before treated due to unable to swallow the capsules.</pre_assignment_details>

Single oral dose of DE capsule ranging from 50 mg to 330mg was administrated twice daily in the morning and evening for participants aged at least 8 years.
Dosage of DE was adjusted by age and weight of participants intending to achieve trough plasma dabigatran concentrations between 50 and &lt;250 ng/mL. The DE dose limit was 22.2 mg/kg/day.The maximal DE single dose was 330 mg.
