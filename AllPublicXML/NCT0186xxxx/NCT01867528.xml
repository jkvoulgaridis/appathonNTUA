  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small bowel obstruction is a common reason for surgical admission. Most common reason for
      small bowel obstruction is adhesions, which account up to 70-80 % of small bowel
      obstructions. Large proportion of adhesive small bowel obstructions may be treated
      nonoperatively, but up to 50-60% may need surgical intervention. Current golden standard for
      surgical intervention is open adhesiolysis. Recently, retrospective studies have provided
      encouraging results of laparoscopic adhesiolysis for small bowel obstructions. However, no
      prospective randomized trials have been carried out and retrospective series carries a high
      risk for patient selection and bias. Although in general laparoscopy has been associated with
      shortened hospital stay, less pain and reduced mortality, laparoscopic adhesiolysis for small
      bowel obstruction has been reported to cause iatrogenic small bowel lesions up to 7% of
      patients. Aim of the study is to compare open adhesiolysis to laparoscopic adhesiolysis. The
      investigators hypothesis is that laparoscopic adhesiolysis is safe, will shorten the hospital
      stay, and reduce mortality compared to open approach.
