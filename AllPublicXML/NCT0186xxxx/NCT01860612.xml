          4. Subjects with any of the following conditions:

               1. Severe chronic uveitis

               7. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy

          5. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating at the time of surgery.

          6. Subjects with a known sensitivity to required postoperative study medications (4th
             generation fluoroquinolone or steroid anti-inflammatory) if an alternative medication
             is not available.

          7. Subjects under legal guardianship or who, in the investigator's opinion, lack the

             steroids are required.

         10. Surgical difficulty of the planned surgery, which might increase the potential for
             complications.

         11. No useful vision or vision potential in the fellow eye.

         12. Clear crystalline lens.

         13. Implantation of a CustomFlex Artificial Iris prosthesis in the contralateral eye

         14. In the investigator's opinion, the presence of a condition or finding in the
             contralateral eye that would make it unsafe to implant a CustomFlex Artificial Iris
             prosthesis in the study eye.
