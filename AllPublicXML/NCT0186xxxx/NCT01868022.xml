  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IB trial aims to identify anticancer activity of GSK3052230 in subjects with
      malignancies with abnormal dependence on FGF pathway signaling. Combination doses of
      GSK3052230 with standard of care chemotherapy in the first and second line or greater setting
      of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and first line malignant pleural
      mesothelioma subjects will be studied in the 3+3 dose-escalation design. This will be a
      multi-arm, multicenter, non-randomized, parallel-group, uncontrolled, open-label Phase IB
      study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary activity of GSK3052230 in
      combination with paclitaxel + carboplatin (Arm A), in combination with docetaxel (Arm B), or
      in combination with pemetrexed + cisplatin (Arm C). Approximately 70 subjects will be
      enrolled in the study (approximately up to 120 may be enrolled).

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis: Arm A and B- stage IV recurrent
             metastatic squamous NSCLC with Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene
             amplification by central laboratory testing. Arm C- recurrent after local therapy or
             unresectable MPM with measurable lesions.

        For specific arms the following requirements:

        Arm A: Subjects who have received no prior therapy for Stage IIIB or Stage IV or recurrent
        metastatic disease. Note, to avoid any undue delay of initiating systemic chemotherapy for
        these subjects with newly diagnosed metastatic disease, it is allowed to initiate the first
        cycle of chemotherapy while eligibility for the study is still being determined, as long as
        the first dose of GSK3052230 is given no later than Cycle 2 Day 1 of chemotherapy. In
        addition, subjects with Stage IIIB or Stage IV disease and recurrence after previous NSCLC
        that has been treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy or a radio- chemotherapy
        regimen with curative intent are eligible, provided 6 months has passed since this
        treatment ended.

        Arm B: Subjects who have documented tumor progression (based on radiological imaging) or
        intolerability after receiving at least one prior line of platinum containing combination
        chemotherapy for Stage IIIB or Stage IV or recurrent metastatic disease. Note: Prior
        treatment should not include docetaxel but may have included paclitaxel.

        Arm C: Subjects who have received no prior systemic therapy for MPM.

        - Availability of archival tumor tissue required for assessment of deregulated FGF pathway
        signalling, but not limited to, FGFR1 amplification or FGF2 or FGFR1 expression. If
        archival tissue is not available, a fresh biopsy is required. In Arms A and B, subjects
        will be prospectively screened for FGFR1 gene amplification using a Fluorescence in situ
        hybridization (FISH) assay for the dose expansion and the MTD/MFD cohorts only. For
        inclusion in this study, based on the central laboratory testing, FGFR1 gene amplification
        must meet one of the following criteria: a ratio of FGFR1/CEN 8 of &gt;=2; or average number
        of FGFR1 signals per tumor nucleus of &gt;=6; or the percentage of tumor nuclei containing &gt;=5
        FGFR1 signals is &gt;=50%.

        In Arm C, FGF2 expression by IHC will be evaluated retrospectively in tissue samples by a
        central laboratory and is not a requirement for study entry.

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 (Arm A and B) and modified RECIST for Arm C.

          -  Male or female &gt;=18 years of age.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7
             days of first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective contraception, from
             14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment, throughout the study, and for 6

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, protocol-specific events including drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia, any new primary cancers, cardiac toxicity including Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) changes or treatment emergent cardiac valve toxicity and treatment emergent acute anterior uveitis were categorized as SAE. Participants having non-serious AE or SAE were included in the analysis. The All Treated Subjects Population comprised of all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT)</title>
        <description>DLT is defined as toxicities due to GSK3052230 or due to the combination of GSK3052230 with chemotherapy within Cycle 1 (first 21 days of period on study) that are unlikely to be due to another cause, such as the known effects of cytotoxics chemotherapy alone, disease progression, or accident, and protocol-specified criteria. Clinically significant toxicities that persist or occur beyond Cycle 1 that the investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) medical monitor consider dose-limiting may also be designated a DLT for the purpose of establishing Maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

          <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Chemistry Changes From Baseline With Respect to the Normal Range</title>
          <description>Clinical chemistry parameters included potassium, sodium, chloride (Cl), total carbon dioxide (CO2), total and ionized calcium, magnesium, phosphate, albumin, glucose (fasting), Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), uric acid, creatinine clearance, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, Total bilirubin (T. Bil), and Direct bilirubin (D. Bil), total T3 and T4, free T4, amylase, lipase, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, and fibrinogen. Baseline is defined as the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study GSK3052230 treatment dose date. Change from Baseline is calculated as visit value minus Baseline value. Clinical chemistry parameters with change from Baseline with respect to normal range only has been presented. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Overall Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a confirmed Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR) from the start of treatment until disease progression as per RECIST version 1.1 or modified RECIST for participants in Arm C. This was determined based on Investigator assessments of response. 95% confidence intervals (CI) are calculated based on the unconditional exact method. ORR as per RECIST vesrion 1.1 for Arm A and B has been reported. ORR as per RECIST version 1.1 and modified RECIST version 1.1 for Arm C has been reported. The study population used for decision-making at the interim analyses during the dose expansion cohorts of the study arms is termed as the All Evaluable Participants Population. NA indicates 0 participants met ORR criteria therefore no dispersion.</description>

        <description>Serial blood sample were collected at an indicated time points. A nonlinear mixed effects model was used to determine clearances. The Pharmacokinetic Population (PK) consisted of all participants in the All Treated Subject Population for whom a blood sample for pharmacokinetics was obtained and analyzed. Plasma GSK3052230 concentration-time data were to be combined with data from other studies to be analyzed using a population PK approach. However, other studies with GSK3052230 were not performed and thus no population PK analyses were done.</description>

        <description>FVC is the total amount of air exhaled during the Forced Expiratory Volume test. Baseline is defined as the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study GSK3052230 treatment dose date. Change from Baseline is calculated as visit value minus Baseline value. Assessment of FVC was done on Day 1 of every odd cycle for Arm C participants with MPM. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). NA indicates that data were not available as standard deviation could not be calculated for a single participant.</description>
