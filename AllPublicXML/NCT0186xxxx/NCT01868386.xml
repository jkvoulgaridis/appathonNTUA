  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is one of the standard treatments for men with prostate cancer who have
      detectable levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA, a prostate cancer specific marker) after
      surgery. When radiation therapy is given to patients who have an increase in PSA after
      surgery, it is called &quot;salvage radiation therapy&quot;. Currently the standard radiation therapy
      course length for this type of cancer is around 7 ½ -8 weeks. Sometimes, radiation therapy
      after prostate removal causes unpleasant side effects. A shorter course of radiation therapy,
      known as a &quot;hypofractionated&quot; course, gives fewer but higher doses of radiation than standard
      radiation.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a shorter course of radiation therapy at
      progressively lower dose levels and shorter lengths of treatment (hypofractionated) with
      patients who have had their prostate removed. The study will assess whether the
      hypofractionated course works better without causing additional side effects to the remaining
      cancer cells in the prostate bed.

      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the shortest dose-fractionation schedule (Dose Schedule) with acceptable grade
      ¡Ã 3 GU/GI toxicity rate for salvage HypoFx RT to maintain a constant, high BED for prostate
      cancer response while reducing the BED for late GU and GI toxicity

      To assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the recommended Dose Schedule of salvage
      HypoFx RT by demonstrating no significant change in 1-year disease specific QoL, as compared
      to baseline

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate and characterize the acute and late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI)
      adverse effects associated with postoperative, hypofractionated radiation therapy.

      To evaluate biochemical failure rate, defined separately as nadir plus 2 ng/mL and as three
      consecutive rises in PSA, at 2 years after hypofractionated, post-prostatectomy radiation
      therapy.

      To evaluate health utilities at 1 year after HypoFx salvage RT, as measured by the EQ-5D
      instrument.

      To evaluate changes in sexual domain of EPIC quality of life instrument at 1 year after
      HypoFx salvage RT.

      To evaluate the treatment burden for patients undergoing salvage HypoFx RT, in order to
      examine whether HypoFx RT results in less burdensome treatment for patients, as measured by
      patient-reported direct and indirect (i.e., transportation) health care costs and lost
      productivity due to treatment, as evaluated by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment
      Questionnaire¢-General Health (WPAI-GH).
