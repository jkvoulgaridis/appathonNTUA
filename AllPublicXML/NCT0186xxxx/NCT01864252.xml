  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN) reduces injury to
      the heart during heart-lung bypass surgery in combination with the newer technique of remote
      ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischaemic heart disease is a leading cause of mortality in the western world. A number of
      patients undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery as treatment for ischaemic heart
      disease. With the rise of interventional procedures, patients who are coming to have CABG
      surgery are higher risk1. Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been shown to reduce
      perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) in patients having CABG even when cold blood
      cardioplegia or intermittent cross clamp fibrillation is used as cardioprotective measures.
      These patients have a general anaesthetic with multiple infusions including Glyceryl
      Trinitrate (GTN). The use of GTN in these patients is based on theoretical assumptions of
      coronary vasodilation pre operatively along with maintaining graft potency postoperatively.
      We intend to investigate the effect of GTN in patients undergoing cardiac surgery being
      subjected to RIPC in its role as a Nitric Oxide (NO) donor. Exogenous NO has been shown to be
      cardioprotective in animal models.

    <measure>Troponin T area under the curve</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Troponin T area under the curve will be calculated using blood samples collected at 0,6,12,24,48 and 72 hours plotting it against time to calculated AUC.</description>

    <measure>Inotrope/Vasopressor requirements peri-operatively</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-operative day 1,2,3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The inotrope score will be calculated as follows:
Dosages (in μg/kg/min) of [Dopamine + Dobutamine] + [(Adrenaline + Noradrenaline + Isoproterenol + Isoproterenol) x 100] + [(Enoximone + Milrinone) x 15]</description>

    <time_frame>Post-operative day 1,2,3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of endotracheal intubation will be noted in hours. Re-intubation rates will be calculated by noting down the number of patients requiring re-intubation and comparing this amongst the 4 groups.</description>

    <time_frame>Post-operative day 1,2,3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>Serum creatinine levels will be noted in the first 3 days postoperatively. If a patient requires renal replacement therapy, this will be recorded and comparisons made amongst the groups. Hourly urine output and daily urine volumes for the duration of ITU stay will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Atrial fibrillation will be diagnosed using ECG. A record of the number of patients developing AF post operatively, the intervention used to treat it and whether or not the patient reverted to sinus rhythm prior to ITU discharge will be documented</description>
