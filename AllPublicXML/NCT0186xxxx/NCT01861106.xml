  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - GATA2 deficiency is a disease caused by mutations in the GATA2 gene. It can cause different
      types of leukemia and other diseases. Researchers want to see if a stem cell transplant can
      be used to treat this condition. A stem cell transplant will give stem cells from a matching
      donor (related or unrelated) to a recipient. It will allow the donor stem cells to produce
      healthy bone marrow and blood cells that will attack the recipient s cancer cells.

      Objectives:

      - To see if stem cell transplants are successful at treating GATA2 mutations and related
      conditions.

      Eligibility:

        -  Recipients who are between 8 and 70 years of age and have GATA2 deficiency, or the
           clinical syndrome MonoMac.

        -  Donors who are between 6 and 70 years of age and are matched with the recipients.

        -  Have a 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or a haploidentical related
           donor.

      Design:

        -  All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood
           samples will be collected. Recipients will have imaging studies and other tests.

        -  Donor participants will provide stem cells for the treatment. In some cases, Filgrastim
           injections will allow these cells to be collected from the blood. Bone marrow donations
           will be used as stem cells source.

        -  Recipients will have chemotherapy or radiation to prepare for the transplant. On the day
           of the transplant, they will receive the donated stem cells.

        -  Recipients will stay in the hospital until their condition is stable after transplant.

        -  Frequent blood tests and scans will be required for the first 6 months after the
           transplant, followed by less frequent visits over time.

      Background:

      Genetic and sporadic mutations on one allele of the GATA2 gene lead to a syndrome termed
      MonoMAC. MonoMAC is characterized by: 1) infections with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
      and other opportunistic infections, 2) deficiency of monocytes, B-lymphocytes, and Natural
      Killer (NK) cells in the peripheral blood, and 3) progression to myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and 4)
      mutations on one allele of GATA2 in most patients. We propose to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using different
      conditioning regimens from different donor sources in reconstituting normal hematopoiesis and
      reversing the disease phenotype in patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome
      of MonoMAC.

      Objectives: Primary:

      -To determine whether allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) approach
      reconstitutes normal hematopoiesis and reverses the disease phenotype by one year
      posttransplant in patients with mutations in GATA2 or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC.

      Eligibility:

        -  Recipients ages 8-70 years old with mutations in GATA2 or the clinical syndrome of
           MonoMAC. MDS or clinical history of at least one life-threatening infection.

        -  Have a 10/10 or a 9/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (HLA -A, -B, -C, DRB1,
           DQB1 by high resolution typing identified through the National Marrow Donor Program), or
           a haploidentical related donor.

      Design: Two Arms

        -  Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with a 10/10 (or
           9/10 matched if the mismatch is at DQ) HLA-matched related or unrelated donor will
           receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV once
           daily for 4 days on day s -6, -5, -4, and -3, busulfan based on pharmacokinetic levels
           from test dose (3.2 mg/kg IV will be the default dose) once daily on days -6, -5, -4,
           and -3, and HSCT on day 0.

        -  Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with a 9/10
           HLA-matched related or unrelated (except if the mismatch is at DQ), or with a
           haploidentical related donor, will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen
           consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on days -6 and -5,
           busulfan based on pharmacokinetic levels from test dose ( 3.2 mg/kg IV will be the
           default dose) once daily on days -4, -3, (if poor or very poor risk clonal cytogenetic
           abnormalities are present, then three days of busulfan IV once daily on days -4, -3, and
           -2 will be given), fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV once daily for 5 days on days -6 to -2, 200
           cGy TBI on day -1, and HSCT on day 0.

        -  Post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis for recipients of all groups will
           consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s +3 and +4, along
           with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to approximately day +35 and tacrolimus from day
           +5 to approximately day +180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus- host disease,
           tacrolimus will be stopped or tapered at approximately day +180.

          1. Patient age of 8-70 years.

          2. Mutation in the GATA2 gene, or evidence of loss of expression of one allele of GATA2,
             by cDNA analysis performed by a CLIA certified laboratory, or the clinical syndrome of
             MonoMAC

          3. Clinical history of at least one life-threatening infection and/or MDS with
             International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) category of Intermediate-1,
             Intermediate-2 or High.

          4. Availability of a 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or a
             haploidentical related donor.

          5. Patients may have evidence of MDS with one or more peripheral blood cytopenias and
             greater than 5% blasts but less than 10% blasts in the bone marrow in the absence of
             filgrastim - The majority of patients with MDS will have less than 5% blasts.

          6. Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40%, preferably by 2-D echocardiogram obtained
             within 90 days prior to enrollment.

          7. Creatinine: Adult patients: less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl and creatinine clearance
             greater than or equal to 30 ml/min; Pediatric patients ( &lt;18 years old): creatinine
             &lt;1.5 mg/dL and a creatinine clearance , using the Schwartz Formula, &gt; 30

          8. Serum conjugated bilirubin &lt; 2.5 mg/dl; serum ALT and AST less than or equal to 5
             times upper limit of normal.

          9. Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) (if the patient is
             deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired
             in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is
             questionable) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study or
             written informed consent obtained from parent or legal guardian if subject is a minor.

         10. Disease status: Patients are to be referred in remission for evaluation. Should a
             patient have progressive disease, or a donor becomes not available after enrollment,
             the patient will be referred back to their primary hematologist-oncologist for
             treatment. If this course of action is not in the best interest of the patient
             according to the clinical judgment of the PI/LAI, then the patient may receive
             standard treatment for the malignant disease or hematological disorder under the
             current study. If under either of these settings, it becomes apparent that the patient
             will not be able to proceed to transplant, then he/she must come off study.
             Recipient-Subjects receiving a standard therapy will be told about the therapy,
             associated risks, benefits and alternatives of the proposed therapy, and availability
             of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol.

         11. As therapeutic agents used in this trial may be harmful to a fetus, women of
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for at least
             one-year post-allo HSCT. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in the study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately.

         12. All transplant patients remain in the NIH hospital or, if discharged, stay close to
             the NIH for a minimum of 100 days after transplant or longer, if there are
             complications. An adult caregiver must be with the patient at all times from discharge
             to day 100.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA- Recipient

          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents with the exception of
             virus- specific cytotoxic T-cells for the treatment of viral infection/reactivation
             prior to allo HSCT

          2. HIV-positive patients are ineligible because these patients are at increased risk of
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when
             indicated.

          3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biological composition to agents (steroids, cyclophosphamide, busulfan) used in the
             study

          4. Chronic active hepatitis B. Patient may be hepatitis B core antibody positive. For
             patients with a concomitant positive hepatitis B surface antigen, patients will
             require a hepatology consultation. The risk-benefit profile of transplant and
             hepatitis B will be discussed with the patient, and eligibility determined by the PI
             or Lead Associate Investigator.

          5. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.

          6. Active infection refractory to antimicrobial therapy.

          7. Active CNS involvement by malignancy (patients with known positive CSF cytology or
             parenchymal lesions visible by CT or MRI).

          8. Pregnant or lactating.

          9. Sexually active individuals capable of becoming pregnant who are unable or unwilling
             to use effective form(s) of contraception during time enrolled on study and for 1 year
             post- transplant. Effective forms of contraception include one or more of the
             following: intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or
             implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy, partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom,
             diaphragm, or cervical cap), or abstinence. The effects on breast-milk are also
             unknown and may be harmful to the infant; therefore, women should not breast feed
             during the interval from study entry to one year post-transplant. Males on the
             protocol must use an effective form of contraception at study entry, and for one year
             post-transplant. The effects of transplant, the radiation, and the medications used
             after transplant may be harmful to a fetus.

         10. Presence of active malignancy in another organ system other than the hematopoietic,
             except when driven by viruses in which case the immune reconstitution after transplant
             may control the malignancy. This includes solid tumors not in remission.

         11. No available 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-matched related, unrelated donor, or haploidentical
             related donor.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA-Related Donor

             evaluations who are additionally willing to donate blood, urine, and marrow specimens
             for research. Related donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing Standard
             Policies and Procedures for determination of eligibility and suitability for clinical
             donation. Note that participation in this study is offered to all related donors, but
             is not required for clinical donation.

          3. No mutation in GATA2, or in the case where the mutation in GATA2 has not been
             identified, but the recipient has the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, the donor is
             required to have no clinical evidence of MonoMAC .

        INCLUSIN CRITERIA- Matched Unrelated Donor

          1. Unrelated donor matched at 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 loci high
             resolution typing.

          2. The evaluation of donors shall be in accordance with existing NMDP Standard Policies
             and Procedures. General donor inclusion criteria specified in the NMDP Standards.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA-Related Donor

          1. History of psychiatric disorder which in the opinion of the PI may compromise
             compliance with transplant protocol, or does not allow for appropriate informed
             consent.

          2. History of other medical conditions that in the opinion of PI constitute a
             contraindication to donation.

          3. History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially
             curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-by-case basis.
             Risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells
             at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the patient.

          4. Donors must not be pregnant. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication under this
             protocol. The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown. Donors of
