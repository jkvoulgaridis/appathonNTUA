  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological mindedness(PM) is a meta cognitive process in which the person uses his
      cognitive and affective abilities to better understand his thoughts, feelings, and his
      behaviors as they interact with his internal experiences and his external experiences in the
      world, and dynamically modifies his behavior to move towards self actualization, in a manner
      positive to himself and the world. We investigate whether assessment of PM can distinguish
      depressed patients who benefit from CBT.

    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective psychotherapy for depression.
      Yet, it is effective only for 40% of the depressed people who receive this treatment.
      Currently, there is no method of predicting who can be helped among depressed patients by
      CBT. In this study, we examine whether the level of psychological mindedness can predict who
      may benefit from CBT among depressed patients. Participants who are clinically depressed are
      randomized to 12 sessions of CBT and supportive therapy.

      The screening procedure for this study includes a 20-30 minute telephone or in-person
      interview. Clinical staff members trained in diagnostic interviewing will conduct an initial
      phone interview to determine likely diagnostic suitability. If the subject is deemed
      preliminarily eligible for participation, meaning he or she is clinically depressed, they
      will then be invited for an in-person psychiatric evaluation conducted at the Depression
      Evaluation Services at New York State Psychiatric Institute.

      Upon arrival, the participant will read the Depression Evaluation Services consent form for
      evaluation and will sign it. The evaluation will include a clinical interview, a structured
      clinical interview (the SCID-IV). The participant will need to provide a blood test and a
      urine test from the last six months. Important to note: subjects who enroll in the study
      can't take any psychiatric medications, or they must be on the same medications for three
      months and the same dose for four weeks. During psychotherapy, the patients will continue to
      see their physician for medications. Medication management will NOT be within the province of
      this protocol. Should the MD or patient decide to make alternations in the use of medication,
      this will not affect the patient's participation in psychotherapy or in this study.

      Participants who are eligible for the study will return within two weeks after the evaluation
      visit. An evaluator will rate the HDRS-17 and CG I-Severity. If they are still eligible, they
      will sign the study consent form, have the study explained, including its risks and possible
      benefits, as well as alternatives and its voluntary nature. Once they sign the consent form,
      patients will complete a battery of self-report instruments. Also, they will be interviewed
      by a clinician with a structured clinical interview of PM. After that, they will be
      randomized between CBT and supportive therapy (control group) and will schedule their weekly
      sessions with the study therapist. During 12 weeks, they will be clinically monitored by Beck
      Depression Inventory at the beginning of every session and HDRS-17 every four weeks. They
      will complete study measures at week six and after the 12 weeks sessions.

      Study participants who do not remit (end treatment HDRS-17 &gt; 7) at the end of the CBT trial
      will receive a referral for alternative psychotherapy per patient's preference.
