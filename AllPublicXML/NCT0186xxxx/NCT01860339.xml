  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disease manifested in a triad of
      cognitive, psychiatric, and motor signs and symptoms. HD is caused by a triplet repeat
      (CAG)expansion in the gene Huntingtin (HTT). This disease has classically been conceptualized
      as a neurodegenerative disease. However, recent evidence suggests that abnormal brain
      development may play an important role in the etiology of HD. Huntingtin (HTT)is expressed
      during development and through life. In animal studies, the HTT gene has been shown to be
      vital for brain development. This suggests that a mutant form of HTT (gene-expanded or CAG
      repeats of 40 and above) would affect normal brain development. In addition, studies in
      adults who are gene-expanded for HD, but have not yet manifested the illness, (pre-HD
      subjects) have significant changes in the structure of their brain, even up to 20 years
      before onset of clinical diagnosis. How far back these changes are evident is unknown. One
      possibility is that these brain changes are present throughout life, due to changes in brain
      development,though initially associated with only subtle functional abnormalities.

      In an effort to better understand the developmental aspects of this brain disease, the
      current study proposes to evaluate brain structure and function in children, adolescents, and
      young adults (ages 6-30) who are at risk for developing HD - those who have a parent or
      grandparent with HD. Brain structure will be evaluating using Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) with quantitative measures of the entire brain, cerebral cortex, as well as white
      matter integrity via Diffusion Tensor Imaging. Brain function will be assessed by cognitive
      tests, behavioral assessment, and physical and neurologic evaluation. Subjects that are
      gene-expanded (GE) will be compared to subjects who are gene non-expanded (GNE). Changes in
      brain structure and/or function in the GE group compared to the GNE group would lend support
      to the notion that this disease has an important developmental component.

    <description>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data will be analyzed to assess brain structure based upon variables including global volume, total cerebral spinal fluid, subregion volumes, cortical surface anatomy including cortical depth, surface area and gyral shape, and symmetry between brain hemispheres, all in consideration of age, gender, and height. Results will be evaluated for comparative differences between the GE group and the GNE group. In addition, these measures of brain structure will be paired with corresponding measures of brain function to evaluate brain development based upon growth and performance.</description>

      Bio-specimens are collected and retained for all participants for genetic testing purposes
      and future research. Specimens are either a single sample of 3-4 teaspoons of blood drawn
      from the arm.

      Biospecimens will be tested for the number of CAG repeats in the Huntingtin Gene. Each sample
      obtained will be coded with a randomly assigned number and never linked with personal
      identifiers. The results from the genetic analysis will be sent directly to the data manager
      on the project, who is the ONLY research member with access to this data. This person has no
      direct contact with study participants.
