      The purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the
      safety and tolerability of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with docetaxel, paclitaxel
      and carboplatin, and gemcitabine in participants with solid tumors.

To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

        <description>Duration of response: time from the date of first documented response per the investigator response assessment (CR or PR) to the date of PD or the date of last disease assessment if the participant discontinued the study before PD using RECIST 1.1 CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with exception of nodal disease; all nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm); no new lesions. PR: &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of sum of diameters of all target lesions; short axis was used in sum for target nodes, while longest diameter was used in sum for all other target lesions; no unequivocal progression of non-target disease; no new lesions. PD: at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>
