    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Smoking is a difficult habit to quit, and some people find it more difficult to quit than
      others do. Nicotine is the substance in cigarettes that makes smoking so addictive. Nicotine
      changes some patterns of brain activity, and smokers have differences in brain activity when
      compared to non-smokers. Some genes make it more likely that a person will become addicted to
      smoking. Researchers want to study how nicotine interacts with genes and brain activity. This
      may help develop better treatments to help people quit smoking.

      Objectives:

      - To develop a test of nicotine dependence, using brain activity and genetic analysis, which
      may be useful in predicting success in smoking cessation and in the development of new
      smoking cessation treatment targets.

      Eligibility:

        -  Main group: Current smokers between 18 and 55 years of age who are seeking treatment to
           quit.

        -  Comparison group: Current smokers between 18 and 55 years of age who are not seeking to
           quit.

        -  Comparison group: Healthy former smokers between 18 and 55 years of age.

        -  Comparison group: Healthy nonsmoking volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples
           will be collected.

        -  The three comparison groups will have one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan session.
           They will have tests of thinking, concentration, and memory both inside the scanner, and
           while sitting in front of a computer.

        -  Current smokers who are trying to quit must be willing to undergo a course of nicotine
           treatment that includes weekly counseling (for 12 weeks) and e-cigarettes. Participants
           will attempt smoking abstinence and will have a total of 6 MRI scanning sessions. They
           will do thinking, concentration, and memory tasks inside and outside of the scanner.

        -  For smokers, the first scanning session will take place before they attempt to quit.
           This will be a baseline scan. The second scanning session will take place 48 hours after
           having their last real cigarette. After this scan, they will use electronic cigarettes
           to help quit their habit.

        -  After using e-cigarettes for two weeks, smokers will have a third scan session.. They
           will then gradually taper their use of the electronic cigarettes over the course of
           three weeks, at which point they will be nicotine abstinent.

        -  After about 5 weeks of abstinence, they will have the fourth scan. The fifth scan will
           be approximately 6 months after start of the study, and the final scan will take place
           at about 1 year from the study start.

        -  Smokers will continue to receive support on quitting smoking until the study ends at
           about 1 year.

      Objective: To develop a neuroimaging/genetic/epigenetic biomarker of nicotine dependence
      severity that may be useful in predicting success in smoking cessation and in development of
      new smoking cessation treatment targets.

      Study population: Four groups will be studied: target group of treatment seeking smokers;
      nontreatment seeking current smokers; never smokers and former smokers. We estimate that we
      will need n=50/group completers to have sufficient power to develop the brain/genetics
      biomarkers.

      Design: This study consists of a 4 group between/within subject design. The experimental
      group will proceed in 4 phases: Baseline (scan 1), peak withdrawal (scan 2), stable on
      e-cigarettes (scan 3), and complete abstinence (scans 4-6). Counseling will start after the
      first scan session and will generally continue weekly until scan 4 (about 12 weeks). After
      scan 4, therapeutic support will be provided at least monthly via phone until completion of
      the protocol. The non-treatment seeking smoker comparison group will be scanned twice; at
      baseline (scan 1) and at peak withdrawal (scan 2). Each of the non-smoking comparison groups
      (non- and Ex-smokers) will be scanned only at baseline (scan 1). Genetic and epigenetic
      markers will be obtained in all groups.

      Outcome measures: Network and multivariate pattern analysis, behavior on a decision making
      task and task based and resting state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation in
      neural circuits relevant to nicotine addiction during fMRI scanning. Secondary outcomes
      include BOLD response comparisons between e-cigarettes and smoking and genetic markers of
      nicotine addiction and relapse susceptibility.

Resting state MRI will be assessed between- and within- groups as a function of relapse status and time since last treatment visit at each of the follow-up time-points (4weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months). These data will be entered into the network and pattern classification models discussed above. This will allow us to address the following questions:i. What characteristics of rsFC are associated with treatment success (vs. failure)? ii. Are there characteristics of rsFC that vary as a function of time post-treatment in successfully abstinent individuals?</description>

        No preferences in participant recruitment will be made on the bases of gender, race, or
        ethnic background. Efforts will be made to avoid participant distribution bias such that if
        skewing is noted, subjects in the over-represented group may temporarily be excluded from
        the study until additional participates from under-represented groups can be established.
        Efforts will be made to include minorities in proportion to their presence in the local
        population. The major metropolitan Baltimore area (Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Anne
        Arundel County, Howard County) consists of 64% White, 32% Black or African American, 3%
        Asian, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.04% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific
        Islander and 0.8% some other race (http://www.census.gov/ ). Of this population (any race),
        2% are Hispanic or Latino.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All participants must:

          1. Be between the ages of 18-60. Be right-handed.

          2. Be in good health.

          3. Be free of active DSM-IV abuse/dependence, or dependence in partial remission, on
             alcohol or any drug except nicotine. Past active dependence is acceptable provided it
             is at least five years in the past. Those with past dependence on substances other
             than alcohol or marijuana may not have any current use (past 6 months) of the
             substance on which they were dependent. Individuals with past dependence on either
             alcohol or marijuana who report current use of the previously dependent substance may
             be included, provided they do not currently meet any criteria for dependence, with the
             exception of tolerance.

          4. Be able to abstain from alcohol 24hrs before each of the imaging sessions and able to
             abstain from caffeine 24hrs before each session.

          5. For the treatment and non-treatment seeking smoker groups, must have a urine cotinine
             level corresponding to smoker status for the specific test being used, typically
             corresponding to a urine cotinine above about 200 ng/ml and have been smoking
             consistently for at least one year. For lighter smokers (less than 10 cpd), this is
             defined as smoking at their current level or more for at least the past year
             (excluding any quit attempts in the last year). For heavier smokers (more than 10
             cpd), they must have been smoking at least an average of 10 cpd for at least the past
             year (excluding quit attempts). Based on the correlation between self-reported
             cpd/FTND and urine cotinine levels [85a, 85b], a single inclusion criterion will be
             easier to manage and provide adequate characterization of dependent smokers. Urine
             cotinine level provides a biomarker that does not rely on self-report/memory. Quit
             attempts will be assessed via clinical interview and judgment.

          6. For the treatment and non-treatment seeking smoker groups, must be willing to attempt
             an acute abstinence period lasting approximately 48 hours.

          7. For the treatment seeking group, be actively seeking treatment for smoking cessation
             and willing to engage in 12-weeks of treatment involving weekly counseling sessions,
             as well as follow-up imaging and behavioral assessments following treatment onset.

          8. For the ex-smoker group, must have smoked approximately 8 or more cigarettes per day
             for at least 1 year, and have remained abstinent continuously for at least the last 12
             months.

          9. For the non-smoking control group, less than 20 cigarettes lifetime, none in past year
             and no history of daily smoking

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. are not suitable to undergo an fMRI experiment due to certain implanted devices
             (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial joints, metal pins, surgical
             clips or other implanted metal parts), body morphology, or claustrophobia.

          2. have coagulopathies, history of, current superficial, or deep vein thrombosis,
             musculoskeletal abnormalities restricting an individual s ability to lie flat for
             extended periods of time.

          3. have HIV or Syphilis.

          4. regularly use any prescription (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines,
             antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, barbiturates), over-the-counter (e.g., cold medicine)
             or herbal medication (e.g., Kava, Gingko biloba, St. John s wort) that may alter CNS
             function, cardiovascular function, or neuronal-vascular coupling.

          5. have any current neurological illnesses including, but not limited to, seizure
             disorders, frequent migraines or on prophylaxis, multiple sclerosis, movement
