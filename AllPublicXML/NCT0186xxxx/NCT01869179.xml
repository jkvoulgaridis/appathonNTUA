  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 450 older adults and will utilize 12 Administration on Aging
      (AoA)-supported senior centers to implement a multisite, cluster randomized (by center),
      wait-list clinical trial. Centers will be randomized to receive the choir program immediately
      (intervention group) or after a 6-month delayed intervention phase (control group). The
      community choirs will be led by professional music directors. The investigators will assess
      both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months, with the main intervention
      group comparison being at 6 months. The investigators will also evaluate the start-up and
      ongoing program costs for senior centers, including cost/person served and determine quality
      adjusted life years.

      The hypotheses are:

        1. Compared to delayed intervention controls, participation in a community choir program
           will be associated with improvements/maintenance on the primary outcomes of physical
           function (balance, walking speed, strength), depressive symptoms, and cognition
           (executive function and memory) at 6 months. The investigators also predict within-group
           improvements on these primary outcomes at 12 months.

        2. Compared to delayed intervention controls, participation in a community choir program
           will be associated with improvements in the secondary outcomes of well-being (depressive
           symptoms, loneliness, resilience, social participation, health-related quality of life,
           shortness of breath, functional status, falls, and health services use) at 6 months. The
           investigators also predict within-group improvements on these secondary outcomes at 12
           months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure several physical function outcomes. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) chair stands will be the primary outcome measure. Baseline, 6 months, 12 months. Additional motor function outcomes using the NIH Toolbox are listed below.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Trailmaking Test as a primary outcome of executive function. Baseline, 6 months, 12 months. Additional tests of executive function and memory are listed as secondary outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) as a primary measure of depressive symptoms. Baseline, 6 months, 12 months. Additional NIH Toolbox Emotion measures are listed as secondary outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the brief, self-report European Quality of Life (EQ-5D) to measure health-related quality of life. It has versions in both English and Spanish and also alternate and phone versions. It covers five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Care Services Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will track utilization of health care services for cost analysis. The list of health care services is modified from the Chronic Disease Self-Management study and includes visits to a doctor, mental health provider (e.g., counselor, psychologist), other health providers (e.g., home health nurse, physical therapist), and emergency room and hospitalizations (and reason for stay). Participants (including those on the wait-list) will be contacted by phone every three months to complete the form about health care services used in the prior three months. Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Falls</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will query frequency of falls using a single question commonly used in several large diverse studies about falls. Falls will also be assessed by phone every three months. Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shortness of breath</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will ask three questions about shortness of breath based on Blazer and colleagues. Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance and Endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the NIH Toolbox Motor to assess endurance (4 Meter Walk Gait Speed Test) and balance (Standing Balance Test). Baseline, 6 months, 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory and Executive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>As secondary cognitive outcomes, we will use the NIH Toolbox to assess executive function and attention (NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test) and verbal memory (NIH Toolbox Auditory Verbal Learning Test - Rey). Baseline, 6 months, 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotion</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will also be using the NIH Toolbox to assess additional aspects of emotion, including psychological well-being (Positive Affect), Self-Efficacy, social relationships (Emotional Support, Friendship, Loneliness), negative affect (Fear-Affect, Sadness), Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) social support, and Apathy. Baseline, 6 months, 12 months.</description>
