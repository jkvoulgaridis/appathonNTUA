  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By using functional MRI the investigators have recently shown that TNFi elicit rapid changes
      in brain function linked to the perception of RA [5]. Functional MRI represents a method
      allowing detecting tiny changes in neuronal activity by measuring alterations of blood flow
      in the context of neuronal activation. TNFi rapidly reversed the widespread activation of
      brain centers involved in pain such as the thalamus and the somatosensoric cortex, as well as
      those involved in the control, of mood and emotions such as the limbic system. Moreover, as
      small phase I study with 10 patients with RA showed that high brain activity detected in the
      functional MRI predicts clinical response to Certolizumab Pegol after 1 month, suggesting the
      central nervous system activity may be used as a tool to predict response to TNFi [8]. The
      rationale of this study is to test whether response to TNFi can be predicted by using
      functional MRI.

    <textblock>
      Randomized double-blinded controlled multi-centre, study over 12 weeks, followed by a 12
      weeks single blinded multicenter trial in 156 patients with RA with inadequate response to
      DMARD therapy. The study is composed of 3 arms with a 1:1:1 randomization at baseline: High
      functional MRI/400mg Certolizumab Pegol on week 0,2 and 4 followed by Certolizumab Pegol
      200mg every two weeks for a total of 24 weeks; low functional MRI/400mg Certolizumab Pegol on
      week 0,2 and 4 followed by Certolizumab Pegol 200mg every two weeks for a total of 24 weeks
      with the possibility of early escape at week 12.

      Patients who did not respond sufficiently according to EULAR response criteria (DAS28
      reduction ≥ 1.2) to Certolizumab-Pegol (Treatment Arm A and Arm B) after 12 weeks will be
      off-Study and treated according to local guidelines.

      Patients in the Placebo group with an EULAR response ≥ 1.2 reaching remission (DAS28 ≤ 2.6)
      will also be off study and treated according to the local guidelines or will be followed
      while they are in clinical remission. Patients with an EULAR response (DAS28 reduction ≥ 1.2)
      but not fulfilling the clinical remission criteria (DAS28 ≤ 2.6) will receive Certolizumab
      Pegol in week 12,14 and 16 with Certolizumab Pegol 400mg s.c. followed by s.c.injection of
      200mg Certolizumab Pegol every two weeks till week 24.

      In the situation that in one group sufficient patients will be randomized, fMRI done at
      screening, needs to be analyzed first to ensure that no further patient will be randomized
      with the randomization to the closed group. A blinded person, not involved either in the
      analysation of the fMRI nor in the treatment of the patients or the clinical assessments,
      will be responsible for the randomization list. If the next number on the randomization list
      represent the number of the closed group, the patient is not eligible for the study and will
      be treated according to local guidelines.

    <description>Certolizumab Pegol (Cimzia®) is an engineered, humanized antibody-Fab'-fragment with specificity for human TNF-α, that is conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG). Certolizumab Pegol (Cimzia®) is a humanized antibody-Fab'-fragment that is produced in Escherichia coli and subsequently PEGylated to prolong its circulating half-time to be similar to that of an intact mAB. Certolizumab Pegol has a high affinity for TNF α with a Kd90pM and is an effective TNF α inhibitor. Certolizumab pegol does not neutralize TNFß (lymphotoxin), a related cytokine, and does not activate complement or kill cells via antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.</description>
