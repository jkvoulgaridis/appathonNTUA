      The goal of this MEEI Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI) research study is to find new ways to
      improve hearing in children who are deaf and cannot receive a cochlear implant. The ABI is a
      surgically placed bionic implant that converts sounds into electrical signals that are
      directly transmitted to the cochlear nucleus, the first auditory center of the brain. For
      many years, ABIs have improved the hearing of patients who are deaf due to brain tumors
      associated with a genetic syndrome called Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). However, a number
      of recent studies suggest that deaf patients who do not have NF2 and are not eligible for a
      cochlear implant may also benefit from placement of an ABI. These preliminary studies suggest
      that these non-NF2 or &quot;nontumor&quot; patients may actually have better outcomes after ABI surgery
      than patients suffering from NF2. Children appear to be particularly good candidates because
      of their developmental plasticity and in many studies, outcomes are more favorable in
      children that adults. Patients who do not have NF2 and are deaf due to abnormalities in their
      hearing nerves or inner ears from congenital malformations, infection, disease, or injury are
      not cochlear implant candidates and there are no other options to improve hearing in these
      cases except for the ABI. Thus, the purpose of our study is to carefully analyze whether ABI
      surgery improves the hearing and quality of life of non-NF2 children based on subjective and
      objective measures of their hearing before and after ABI surgery. In particular, we plan to
      study ABI outcomes in non-NF2 pediatric patients, characterize the parameters used on their
      devices, and determine the safety profile of ABIs in these patients.

    <description>We will track any major and minor complications peri-operatively and post-operatively in all study participants. Major complications include mortality, cerebellar contusion, facial palsy, meningitis, lower cranial neuropathy, hydrocephalus, pseudomeningocele and CSF leak. Minor complications include transient hydrocephalus, wound seroma, minor infections, balance problems, transient nerve palsies, transient dysphonia or difficulty swallowing, headache, flap problems, and non-auditory side effects. These complications will be tracked through serial clinical exams as well as patient recorded questionnaires to determine the safety profile of ABI surgery.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pure Tone Threshold (dB HL) Using the ABI</measure>
    <time_frame>1-4 years from date of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We will complete audiometric threshold testing and speech based tests to determine performance before and after ABI surgery.
The measure data value was calculated as mean threshold shift in dB HL from pre-surgery (or baseline) to postoperatively (following activation of the ABI) across subjects analyzed. Only those subjects that had auditory perception abilities were included. 2/9 subjects did not have auditory perception and are not using their devices.
The outcome measure time frame varies across subjects based on available followup data as this study was stopped early.
Audiometric testing will include:
â€¢ Behavioral pure tone threshold average (PTA) in both aided (with ABI) and unaided (without ABI)</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Similar eABR Morphology on the Day of ABI Activation Compared to Intraoperative Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>4 to 8 weeks after surgery (day of activation under anesthesia)</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure and record the specific programmed parameters of the ABI device. Intraoperatively, evoked Auditory Brainstem Response (eABRs) will be recorded and saved. These tracings and data will be compared to the settings on activation to determine whether the same electrodes are appropriately positioned. By following these measures, we will be able to capture how electrophysiologic parameters vary (if at all) over time.
The outcome measure data are the number of subjects whose eABR morphology was similar on the day of activation (4 to 8 weeks following surgery) as recorded intraoperatively during ABI surgery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-linguistic hearing loss (birth-5 yrs.; age at ABI implantation 18 months-5yrs)
             with both:

               1. MRI +/- CT evidence of one of the following:

                    -  Cochlear nerve deficiency

                    -  Cochlear aplasia or severe hypoplasia

                    -  Severe inner ear malformation

                    -  Post-meningitis ossification

               2. When a cochlea is present or patent with a normally appearing cochlear nerve,
                  lack of significant benefit from CI despite consistent use (&gt;6 mo.)

                    -  No or limited speech perception ability (limited to pattern perception on
                       closed set testing materials using the CI)

                    -  Lack of progress in auditory skills development

          2. Post-linguistic hearing loss (&lt;18 yrs. of age) with both:

               1. Loss or lack of benefit from appropriate CI without the possibility for revision
                  or contralateral implantation. Examples might include:

                    -  Post-meningitis ossification

                    -  Bilateral temporal bone fractures with cochlear nerve avulsion

                    -  Failed revision CI without benefit

               2. Previously developed open set speech perception and auditory-oral language skills

          3. No medical contraindications

          4. Willing to receive the appropriate meningitis vaccinations

          5. No or limited cognitive/developmental delays which would be expected to interfere with
             the child's ability to cooperate in testing and/or programming of the device, in
             developing speech and oral language, or which would make an implant and subsequent
             emphasis on aural/oral communication not in the child's best interest

          6. Strong family support including language proficiency of the parent(s) in the child's
             primary mode of communication as well as written and spoken English.

          7. Reasonable expectations from parents including a thorough understanding:

               -  of potential benefits and limitations of ABI

               -  of parental role in rehabilitation

               -  that the child may not develop spoken language as a primary communication mode or
                  even sufficient spoken language to make significant academic progress in an
                  aural/oral environment

          8. Involvement in an educational program that emphasizes development of auditory skills
             with or without the use of supplementary visual communication.

          9. Able to comply with study requirements including travel to investigation sites and
             clinic visits.

         10. Informed consent for the procedure from the child's parents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre- or post-linguistic child currently making significant progress with CI - This
             will be considered if a child is progressing along the expected speech reception
             hierarchy (SRI-Q) as detailed by Wang et al (50). Even for the very young children (18
             months of age with 6 months of use), nearly all children with a good auditory signal
             from their CI will have reached ceiling effects on the IT-MAIS and have pattern
             perception beyond chance using the ESP (50). Moreover, there will evidence of
             improvement in these metrics over time.

          2. MRI evidence of one of the following:

               -  normal cochlea and cochlear nerves or NF2

               -  brainstem or cortical anomaly that makes implantation unfeasible

          3. Clear surgical reason for poor CI performance that can be remediated with revision CI
             or contralateral surgery rather than ABI.

          4. Intractable seizures or progressive, deteriorating neurological disorder

          5. Unable to participate in behavioral testing and mapping with their CI. If this appears
             to be an age effect, ABI will be delayed until we can be assured that the child will
             be able to participate, as reliable objective measures of mapping are currently not
             available for mapping these devices.

          6. Lack of potential for spoken language development. This will be considered the case
             when evidence of the following exist:

               -  Severe psychomotor retardation, autism, cerebral palsy, or developmental delays
                  beyond speech that would preclude usage of the device and oral educational
                  development. Autism is a special case where there is the potential for delayed
                  presentation. When early signs are considered present, we will request a
                  comprehensive developmental assessment for further evaluation prior to
                  considering routine evaluation.

          7. Unable to tolerate general anesthesia (cardiac, pulmonary, bleeding diathesis, etc.).

          8. Need for brainstem irradiation

          9. Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject/family regarding the possible
             benefits, risks and limitations that are inherent to the procedure and prosthetic
             device.

         10. Unwilling to sign the informed consent.

         11. Unwilling to make necessary follow-up appointments.

          <title>Sound detection via pure-tone threshold audiometry</title>
          <description>As all participants have (1) absent cochleae or absent cochlear nerves or (2) anatomic conditions of the inner ear that preclude the use of a traditional cochlear implant array, it was expected that participants would have profound hearing loss at baseline and no residual hearing. Therefore, it was hypothesized that sound detection would be at the upper limit of clinical testing.
The decibel unit is plotted on a logarithmic scale; higher values represents worse hearing. 120 dB HL represents the upper limit of clinical testing.</description>

        <description>We will track any major and minor complications peri-operatively and post-operatively in all study participants. Major complications include mortality, cerebellar contusion, facial palsy, meningitis, lower cranial neuropathy, hydrocephalus, pseudomeningocele and CSF leak. Minor complications include transient hydrocephalus, wound seroma, minor infections, balance problems, transient nerve palsies, transient dysphonia or difficulty swallowing, headache, flap problems, and non-auditory side effects. These complications will be tracked through serial clinical exams as well as patient recorded questionnaires to determine the safety profile of ABI surgery.</description>

        <title>Change in Pure Tone Threshold (dB HL) Using the ABI</title>
        <description>We will complete audiometric threshold testing and speech based tests to determine performance before and after ABI surgery.
The measure data value was calculated as mean threshold shift in dB HL from pre-surgery (or baseline) to postoperatively (following activation of the ABI) across subjects analyzed. Only those subjects that had auditory perception abilities were included. 2/9 subjects did not have auditory perception and are not using their devices.
The outcome measure time frame varies across subjects based on available followup data as this study was stopped early.
Audiometric testing will include:
â€¢ Behavioral pure tone threshold average (PTA) in both aided (with ABI) and unaided (without ABI)</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Similar eABR Morphology on the Day of ABI Activation Compared to Intraoperative Responses</title>
        <description>We will measure and record the specific programmed parameters of the ABI device. Intraoperatively, evoked Auditory Brainstem Response (eABRs) will be recorded and saved. These tracings and data will be compared to the settings on activation to determine whether the same electrodes are appropriately positioned. By following these measures, we will be able to capture how electrophysiologic parameters vary (if at all) over time.
The outcome measure data are the number of subjects whose eABR morphology was similar on the day of activation (4 to 8 weeks following surgery) as recorded intraoperatively during ABI surgery.</description>
