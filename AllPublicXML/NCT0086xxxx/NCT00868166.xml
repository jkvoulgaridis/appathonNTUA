      The purpose of the assay is to assess the safety and the efficacy of TRO19622 330 mg QD as
      add-on therapy to riluzole 50 mg bid in the treatment of patients suffering from ALS, as
      compared to placebo, assessed by the 18-month survival rate.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A stand alone treatment with TRO19622 is not acceptable for ethical reasons. Riluzole is an
      approved and widely used ALS treatment in the European community, in Japan and in the USA.

      Therefore, in this study, TRO19622 will be assessed as add-on to riluzole in patients
      suffering from ALS.

      At the start of the study, patients will be randomized to one of two groups : TRO19622 (330
      mg QD or placebo (once a day).

      Each treatment will be administered for 18 months under double-blind conditions. The product
      under evaluation will be administered to patients receiving the standard of care for ALS,
      including riluzole.

      Riluzole dosage (50 mg bid) must be stable and well tolerated for at least one month prior to
      inclusion into the study.

      After the double-blind period, open-label administration of TRO19622 will be allowed for
      safety and survival assessments and until efficacy results are available.

      A separate open-label protocol will be written 6 months after the randomization of the last
      patient into the study.

    <description>Overall survival was defined from the date of randomization until the date of death (event) or last known alive date (censored). If the death date was after 18 months, the participant was censored at 18 months (548 days). Participants still alive at or after 18 months were censored at 18 months/ 548 days. All data over the 18-month follow-up period after randomization, and participant survival status at the 18-month follow-up visit for participants who withdrew prematurely from the study for reasons other than death were included.</description>

    <time_frame>Inclusion, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 and Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>The ALSFRS-R is an ordinal rating scale (0 through 4) used to determine the ALS participant's self assessment of their ability and need for assistance in 12 activities or functions. This is a validated scale, both in person and by phone, which provides a total score from four sub-scores which assess speech and swallowing, (bulbar function), use of upper extremities (cervical function), gait and turning in bed (lumbar function), and breathing (respiratory function). Total scores range from 0 (most impaired) to 48 (normal ability).</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with a global ALS FRS-R score of &lt; 30 or death was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method in the ITT, with a two-tailed log-rank, both stratified by site of onset (bulbar or spinal) and non-stratified. The ALSFRS-R is an ordinal rating scale (0 through 4) used to determine the ALS participant's self assessment of their ability and need for assistance in 12 activities or functions. This is a validated scale, both in person and by phone, which provides a total score from four sub-scores which assess speech and swallowing, (bulbar function), use of upper extremities (cervical function), gait and turning in bed (lumbar function), and breathing (respiratory function).

    <description>MMT score involved the examination of 30 items. These 30 items are scored from 0 (no trace of contraction) to 5 (normal power at first try). The global score is the sum of the item scores and can range from 0 to 150. Higher score indicates some power.</description>

        <description>The ALSFRS-R is an ordinal rating scale (0 through 4) used to determine the ALS participant's self assessment of their ability and need for assistance in 12 activities or functions. This is a validated scale, both in person and by phone, which provides a total score from four sub-scores which assess speech and swallowing, (bulbar function), use of upper extremities (cervical function), gait and turning in bed (lumbar function), and breathing (respiratory function). Total scores range from 0 (most impaired) to 48 (normal ability).</description>
