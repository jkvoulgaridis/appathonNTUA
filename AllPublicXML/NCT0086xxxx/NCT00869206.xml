  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies two different schedules of zoledronic acid to compare
      how well they work in reducing bone-related complications in patients with breast cancer,
      prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma that has spread to other places in the body and have
      bone involvement. Bone-related complications are a major cause of morbidity in patients with
      metastatic prostate cancer, breast cancer, and multiple myeloma. Zoledronic acid may stop the
      growth of cancer cells in the bone and may help relieve some of the symptoms caused by bone
      metastases. It is not yet known whether giving zoledronic acid more or less frequently is
      more effective in treating patients with metastatic cancer that has spread to the bone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether every-12-week therapy with zoledronic acid is not inferior to
      every-4-week therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer,
      or multiple myeloma involving bone, as measured by the proportion who experience at least one
      skeletal related event within 24 months after randomization.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare pain scores (Brief Pain Inventory) of patients with metastatic breast cancer,
      metastatic prostate cancer, or myeloma involving bone receiving every 12 week dosing of
      zoledronic acid to those receiving every 4 week dosing.

      II. To compare the functional status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance
      status) of patients with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or myeloma
      involving bone receiving every 12 week dosing of zoledronic acid to those receiving every 4
      week dosing.

      III. To compare the incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with metastatic breast
      cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or myeloma involving bone receiving every 12 week dosing
      of zoledronic acid to those receiving every 4 week dosing.

      IV. To compare the incidence of renal dysfunction in patients with metastatic breast cancer,
      metastatic prostate cancer, or myeloma involving bone receiving every 12 week dosing of
      zoledronic acid to those receiving every 4 week dosing.

      V. To compare the skeletal morbidity rate of these patients, defined as the number of
      skeletal-related events per year, of patients receiving every 12 week dosing to those
      receiving every 4 week dosing.

      VI. To compare the suppression of serum markers of bone resorption of patients with
      metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or myeloma involving bone receiving
      every 12 week dosing of zoledronic acid to those receiving every 4 week dosing.

      VII. To determine whether every 12 week therapy with zoledronic acid is not inferior to
      every-4-week therapy for each subgroup of patients with either breast cancer, prostate
      cancer, or multiple myeloma, as measured by the proportion who experience at least one
      skeletal related event within 24 months after randomization.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) over at least 15 minutes every 4
      weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive zoledronic acid IV over at least 15 minutes every 12 weeks for up to
      2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 2 years from
      registration.

    <description>To compare pain scores (Brief Pain Inventory) of patients with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or myeloma involving bone receiving every 12 week dosing of zoledronic acid to those receiving every 4 week dosing. The change scores were evaluated in a general linear model with repeated measures for treatment effect and the time trend with patient-specific characteristics being adjusted for the mean interference score. Specifically the difference in score change per 4 weeks for Arm I using Arm II as the reference is reported. The score of the BPI questionnaire ranges from 0 being no pain to 10 being the most pain. The average score is reported for each arm below.</description>

The change scores were evaluated in a general linear model with repeated measures for treatment effect and the time trend with patient-specific characteristics being adjusted. Specifically the difference in score change per 4 weeks for Arm I using Arm II as the reference is reported. ECOG performance status is a measurement of a patients disability ranging from 0, fully active and able to carry out all pre disease performance without restriction, to 5, dead.

        <description>To compare pain scores (Brief Pain Inventory) of patients with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or myeloma involving bone receiving every 12 week dosing of zoledronic acid to those receiving every 4 week dosing. The change scores were evaluated in a general linear model with repeated measures for treatment effect and the time trend with patient-specific characteristics being adjusted for the mean interference score. Specifically the difference in score change per 4 weeks for Arm I using Arm II as the reference is reported. The score of the BPI questionnaire ranges from 0 being no pain to 10 being the most pain. The average score is reported for each arm below.</description>

        <title>Average ECOG Performance Status</title>
        <description>To compare functional status (ECOG performance status) of patients with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or myeloma involving bone receiving every 12 week dosing of zoledronic acid to those receiving every 4 week dosing. The change scores were evaluated in a general linear model with repeated measures for treatment effect and the time trend with patient-specific characteristics being adjusted. Specifically the difference in score change per 4 weeks for Arm I using Arm II as the reference is reported. ECOG performance status is a measurement of a patients disability ranging from 0, fully active and able to carry out all pre disease performance without restriction, to 5, dead. The average performance status is reported below by arm.</description>
