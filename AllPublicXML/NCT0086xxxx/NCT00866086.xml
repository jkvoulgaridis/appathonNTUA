      RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Abdominal compression methods that hold the
      body and the tumor from moving during treatment may permit radiation therapy to kill more
      tumor cells. This study is looking at the comfort level of two abdominal compression methods
      in patients with lung tumors undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the comfort level of two abdominal compression
      methods used to hold patients still while undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy for
      lung tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate comfort associated with the existing screw-based abdominal compression
           device and the new automated abdominal compression device in patients with lung tumors
           undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate tumor motion in patients using these devices.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo fluoroscopic assessment of tumor motion with a screw-based abdominal
      compression device. Patients then undergo non-contrast 4D-CT imaging with the screw-based
      abdominal compression device followed by contrast 4D-CT imaging with an automated abdominal
      compression device.

      Immediately after stereotactic body radiotherapy simulation, patients complete a
      questionnaire to assess the overall level of comfort of each abdominal-compression device.
