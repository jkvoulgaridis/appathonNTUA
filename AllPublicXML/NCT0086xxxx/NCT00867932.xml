  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter estimates of eculizumab to confirm the dose regimens for
      pediatric and adolescent participants with PNH.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, multi-center study of eculizumab administered to approximately 6 to 8
      pediatric and adolescent participants aged 2 to 17 years with PNH. There were 3 periods in
      this study (screening, treatment, and post-treatment) with the treatment period having 2
      dosing phases (induction and maintenance). If all screening criteria were met, the
      participant was eligible to enter the treatment period of the study after receiving Neisseria
      meningitidis (N. men), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumo), and Haemophilus influenzae (H.
      influ) vaccinations at least 14 days prior to first dose of study drug, or was vaccinated and
      received treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 14 days after the vaccinations.
      Participants received eculizumab intravenously (IV) based on their weight. Eculizumab was
      administered via an IV infusion at a rate of 5 to 10 milliliters (mL) per kilogram (kg) per
      hour (hr) (mL/kg/hr) for at least 25 minutes. The planned duration of treatment was 12 weeks
      with a 4-week induction phase and an 8-week maintenance phase. At the Investigator's and
      parents/legal guardian's discretion, participants who completed this study with eculizumab
      could continue treatment with commercially available eculizumab (Soliris®) and were followed
      in the Soliris® PNH Registry. Participants who stopped study participation before study
      completion or who did not continue with Soliris® treatment at the completion of the study
      were followed for 8 weeks and monitored for signs and symptoms of serious hemolysis.

    <time_frame>Pre-infusion and 1 hour post-infusion at End of Treatment (EOT) (Day 84 [Week 12]) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>Serum concentrations of eculizumab were measured by using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method developed at Alexion Pharmaceuticals Bioanalytical Laboratory. The range of the analytical assay was 10 to 600 microgram per milliliter (μg/mL). Peak concentrations were not measured at the early termination (ET) visit.</description>

    <measure>Number Of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of study drug (Day 0) to End of Follow-up (Week 20 [8 weeks after EOT])</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was defined as any adverse event (AE) not present prior to exposure to eculizumab or any event already present that worsened in either intensity or frequency following exposure to eculizumab. A serious TEAE was defined as any event that resulted in death, was immediately life threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Related TEAEs were considered by investigators to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to administration of the study drug. Relationship is ordered as follows: unrelated, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related. TEAEs and TEAE severity were classified in accordance with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 13.0 dictionary. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Area Under The Curve (AUC) Of The Change From Baseline To Week 12 In Levels Of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, EOT (Day 84 [Week 12]) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC of LDH was calculated by using the change of LDH from baseline values for each participant up to Week 12. For those participants with missing LDH values, the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) was used to impute missing values. Individual AUC values of LDH were summarized and tabulated.</description>

        <title>Number Of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>A TEAE was defined as any adverse event (AE) not present prior to exposure to eculizumab or any event already present that worsened in either intensity or frequency following exposure to eculizumab. A serious TEAE was defined as any event that resulted in death, was immediately life threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Related TEAEs were considered by investigators to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to administration of the study drug. Relationship is ordered as follows: unrelated, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related. TEAEs and TEAE severity were classified in accordance with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 13.0 dictionary. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>
