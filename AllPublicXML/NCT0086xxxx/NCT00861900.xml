  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have obtained compelling evidence that the development of anti-human
      leukocyte antigen (anti-HLA) antibodies against mismatched donor antigens significantly
      correlates with the development of bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS). Further, these anti-HLA
      antibodies are developed at least 15 months prior to any clinical evidence of BOS. This lag
      period between the development of anti-HLA antibodies and the onset of BOS gives us an
      opportunity to intervene to delay and/or prevent the development of BOS.
