        <description>Participants are divided into 3 categories as per CDC classification based on the level of HIV infection as follows: Category A= asymptomatic HIV-1 infection, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy and acute (primary) HIV-1 infection with accompanying illness or history of acute HIV-1 infection in an adult or adolescent aged &gt;=13 years, Category B: conditions attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity; or the conditions are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection in an HIV-infected adolescent or adult; and Category C: clinical conditions listed in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnostic criteria, corresponding to conventional AIDS. Once criteria C has occurred, the person will remain in Category C even if symptoms are alleviated.</description>

            <description>HIV infected participants, prescribed with Celsentri tablet 150 mg depending upon physician’s discretion, within the duration from April 2009 to March 2017 were enrolled in the study. Frequency and duration of taking Celsentri tablet were according to package insert, &quot;The usual adult dosage is 300 mg twice daily. Maraviroc must be used in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. The dosage may be adjusted according to co-administered medical products. Maraviroc can be taken with or without food&quot;. The participants in this study were retrospectively observed from the first dosing date of Celsentri tablet to the completion of study or treatment discontinuation due to reasons such as participant’s death or hospital transfer, within the duration from April 2009 to December 2018.</description>

        <description>CD4 cells are the white blood cells and act as a laboratory marker providing an indication of immune functioning. A higher number is associated with better immune functioning. Participants are divided into 3 categories as per CDC classification based on the level of HIV infection as: Category A= asymptomatic HIV-1 infection, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy and acute(primary)HIV-1 infection with accompanying illness or history of acute HIV-1 infection in an adult or adolescent aged&gt;=13 years, Category B: conditions attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity; or the conditions are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection in an HIV-infected adolescent or adult; and Category C: clinical conditions listed in the AIDS diagnostic criteria, corresponding to conventional AIDS. Once criteria C has occurred, the person will remain in Category C even if symptoms are alleviated.</description>

            <description>HIV infected participants, prescribed with Celsentri tablet 150 mg depending upon physician’s discretion, within the duration from April 2009 to March 2017 were enrolled in the study. Frequency and duration of taking Celsentri tablet were according to package insert, &quot;The usual adult dosage is 300 mg twice daily. Maraviroc must be used in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. The dosage may be adjusted according to co-administered medical products. Maraviroc can be taken with or without food&quot;. The participants in this study were retrospectively observed from the first dosing date of Celsentri tablet to the completion of study or treatment discontinuation due to reasons such as participant’s death or hospital transfer, within the duration from April 2009 to December 2018.</description>

            <description>HIV infected participants, prescribed with Celsentri tablet 150 mg depending upon physician’s discretion, within the duration from April 2009 to March 2017 were enrolled in the study. Frequency and duration of taking Celsentri tablet were according to package insert, &quot;The usual adult dosage is 300 mg twice daily. Maraviroc must be used in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. The dosage may be adjusted according to co-administered medical products. Maraviroc can be taken with or without food&quot;. The participants in this study were retrospectively observed from the first dosing date of Celsentri tablet to the completion of study or treatment discontinuation due to reasons such as participant’s death or hospital transfer, within the duration from April 2009 to December 2018.</description>

        <title>Mean Number of Plasma HIV-RNA Copies: Factor The Presence or Absence of Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) Enzyme Inducer Taken Along With Celsentri</title>
        <description>HIV-RNA copy numbers were measured employing the TaqMan assay with the lower limit of detection of 40 copies/mL. CYP3A4 is an important enzyme in the body, mainly found in the liver and in the intestine. This enzyme is responsible for metabolism of majority of drugs. Many of the food substances and commonly used drugs act as inducers of enzyme CYP3A4. The reported data for plasma HIV-RNA copies was calculated after logarithmic conversion.</description>

        <population>The efficacy analysis set included participants infected with HIV, had received Celsentri tablets at least once for HIV as primary indication and in whom information about number of CD4 or RNA copies was confirmed.

            <description>HIV infected participants, prescribed with Celsentri tablet 150 mg depending upon physician’s discretion, within the duration from April 2009 to March 2017 were enrolled in the study. Frequency and duration of taking Celsentri tablet were according to package insert, &quot;The usual adult dosage is 300 mg twice daily. Maraviroc must be used in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. The dosage may be adjusted according to co-administered medical products. Maraviroc can be taken with or without food&quot;. The participants in this study were retrospectively observed from the first dosing date of Celsentri tablet to the completion of study or treatment discontinuation due to reasons such as participant’s death or hospital transfer, within the duration from April 2009 to December 2018.</description>

        <description>CD4 cells are the white blood cells and act as laboratory marker providing an indication of immune functioning. A higher number is associated with better immune functioning. CYP3A4 is an important enzyme in the body, mainly found in the liver and in the intestine. This enzyme is responsible for metabolism of many of drugs. Many of the food substances and commonly used drugs act as inducers of enzyme CYP3A4.</description>

            <description>HIV infected participants, prescribed with Celsentri tablet 150 mg depending upon physician’s discretion, within the duration from April 2009 to March 2017 were enrolled in the study. Frequency and duration of taking Celsentri tablet were according to package insert, &quot;The usual adult dosage is 300 mg twice daily. Maraviroc must be used in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. The dosage may be adjusted according to co-administered medical products. Maraviroc can be taken with or without food&quot;. The participants in this study were retrospectively observed from the first dosing date of Celsentri tablet to the completion of study or treatment discontinuation due to reasons such as participant’s death or hospital transfer, within the duration from April 2009 to December 2018.</description>
