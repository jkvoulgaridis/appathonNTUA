    <textblock>
      Seventy two patients are being asked to take part in this research study because they have
      been diagnosed with Stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study is
      being done to determine the highest safe dose of proton beam radiotherapy and/or study drug
      (called Nelfinavir) that can be given with concurrent chemoradiotherapy to patients with
      cancer without causing bad side effects; and to develop biomarker for clinical outcome. This
      study will be done in two phases. In the first phase, feasibility will be established. We
      will follow patients treatment courses and record side effects at the standard proton
      radiation dose that can be given together with Cisplatinum + Etoposide or Carboplatin +
      Paclitaxel. In the second phase, we will see if it is possible to increase the total proton
      radiation dose or study drug without increasing the number of bad side effects while treated
      together with chemotherapy drugs.

      Overall objectives:

        1. Determine MTD of proton beam radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide for
           stage III NSCLC.

        2. Determine MTD of proton beam radiotherapy with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel for
           stage III NSCLC in non-cisplatin candidates.

        3. Determine MTD of Nelfinavir with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage III NSCLC at
           RPTD of proton beam radiotherapy.

        4. Develop biomarker for clinical outcome with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III
           NSCLC.

        5. To determine clinical efficacy, as defined by metabolic response, sites of recurrence
           (e.g., local, regional, distant) and progression-free and overall survival.
