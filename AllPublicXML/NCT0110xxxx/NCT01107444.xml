    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of LY2181308 in combination
      with docetaxel compared to docetaxel alone in participants with non-small cell lung cancer
      who were previously treated with first line chemotherapy.

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to date of death from any cause (up to 21.6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) was the duration from enrollment to death from any cause. For participants who were alive, OS is censored at the date of last contact.</description>

    <measure>Time to Worsening of Symptoms as Defined by Lung Cancer Symptom Score (LCSS) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the worsening of symptoms (up to 4.6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The worsening of symptoms was defined as a 15-millimeter (mm) increase in any 1 symptom on the LCSS. The LCSS is an assessment used to evaluate 6 major symptoms associated with lung malignancies and their effect on overall symptomatic distress, functional activities, and global quality of life. LCSS consists of 2 scales: 1 completed by the participant and 1 completed by the health care professional (which is the average symptom burden index [ASBI]). Participant-reported outcomes are assessed using 9 visual analog scales (100-mm horizontal line). Participants indicate intensity of response to the items in question (0 = lowest rating, 100 = highest rating). The LCSS total score ranges from 0 (lowest rating) to 100 (highest rating). The LCSS total score was defined as the mean over all 9 items. Time to worsening of symptoms was censored at the date of the last assessment visit for participants who did not experience any worsening of symptoms as of the data cut-off date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Objective Tumor Response of Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to the date of first response (up to 12.1 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to objective tumor response was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first date of documented objective tumor response. Time to objective tumor response was censored at the date of the last assessment visit for participants who had not had documented response as of the data cut-off date. Complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Documented Disease Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to the first date of progressive disease (up to 12.9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to documented disease progression was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first date of documented progression. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Time to documented disease progression was censored at the date of the last assessment visit for participants who had not had documented progressive disease as of the data cut-off date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants Having a Partial Response (PR) or a Complete Response (CR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to the first date of progressive disease (up to 12.1 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of response to progressive disease (PD) (approximately 8.7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was measured from the time measurement criteria were met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever was first recorded) until the first date of documented progressive disease (PD) or death. Complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Duration of response was censored at the date of the last assessment or follow-up visit for responders who were still alive and had not progressed.</description>

    <measure>Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) on Cycle 2 Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 2 Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The worsening of symptoms was defined as a 15-millimeter (mm) increase in any 1 symptom on the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS). The LCSS is an assessment used to evaluate 6 major symptoms associated with lung malignancies and their effect on 3 overall symptomatic items: distress, functional activities and global quality of life. LCSS consists of 2 scales: 1 completed by the participant and 1 completed by the health care professional (which is the average symptom burden index [ASBI]). Participant-reported outcomes are assessed using 9 visual analog scales (100-mm horizontal line). Participants indicate intensity of response to the items in question (0 = lowest rating, 100 = highest rating). The LCSS total score ranges from 0 (lowest rating) to 100 (highest rating) and was defined as the mean over all 9 items. ASBI was calculated as the mean of six symptom-specific questions from the LCSS, with scores range from 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome).</description>

        <title>Time to Worsening of Symptoms as Defined by Lung Cancer Symptom Score (LCSS) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The worsening of symptoms was defined as a 15-millimeter (mm) increase in any 1 symptom on the LCSS. The LCSS is an assessment used to evaluate 6 major symptoms associated with lung malignancies and their effect on overall symptomatic distress, functional activities, and global quality of life. LCSS consists of 2 scales: 1 completed by the participant and 1 completed by the health care professional (which is the average symptom burden index [ASBI]). Participant-reported outcomes are assessed using 9 visual analog scales (100-mm horizontal line). Participants indicate intensity of response to the items in question (0 = lowest rating, 100 = highest rating). The LCSS total score ranges from 0 (lowest rating) to 100 (highest rating). The LCSS total score was defined as the mean over all 9 items. Time to worsening of symptoms was censored at the date of the last assessment visit for participants who did not experience any worsening of symptoms as of the data cut-off date.</description>

        <title>Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) on Cycle 2 Day 1</title>
        <description>The worsening of symptoms was defined as a 15-millimeter (mm) increase in any 1 symptom on the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS). The LCSS is an assessment used to evaluate 6 major symptoms associated with lung malignancies and their effect on 3 overall symptomatic items: distress, functional activities and global quality of life. LCSS consists of 2 scales: 1 completed by the participant and 1 completed by the health care professional (which is the average symptom burden index [ASBI]). Participant-reported outcomes are assessed using 9 visual analog scales (100-mm horizontal line). Participants indicate intensity of response to the items in question (0 = lowest rating, 100 = highest rating). The LCSS total score ranges from 0 (lowest rating) to 100 (highest rating) and was defined as the mean over all 9 items. ASBI was calculated as the mean of six symptom-specific questions from the LCSS, with scores range from 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome).</description>
