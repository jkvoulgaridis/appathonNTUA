      The present proposal is to study whether Prolonged Exposure (PE) delivered via Telemedicine
      is as effective as PE delivered In Person for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation
      Enduring Freedom (OEF) Veterans and Veterans of all theatres, particularly Vietnam era with
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). ).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project Background/Rationale: Approximately 15 to 17% of current Iraq war Veterans meet full
      diagnostic criteria for MH problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Hoge et
      al., 2004). Prolonged Exposure (PE) is an empirically supported treatment for PTSD (Foa 1997;
      Schnurr et al., 2007), and has been adopted by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DOVA) as
      one of the treatments of choice for the disorder, as evident by the DOVA-sponsored national
      training of clinicians to use PE. It is therefore important to employ treatment delivery
      methods that maximize the likelihood that all Veterans in need, including Veterans residing
      in rural settings, and Veterans who avoid DOVA settings due to the stigma of receiving mental
      health treatment, will receive interventions such as PE. The May, 2005 Committee on Veterans
      Affairs, Subcommittee on Health has identified Telemedicine as a DOVA priority area to
      address this need. The present proposal is to study whether PE delivered via Telemedicine is
      as effective as PE delivered In Person. Telemedicine has been chosen for its ability to
      overcome what appear to be two major barriers to mental health care (Frueh et al., 2000): the
      difficulty that rural-residing Veterans face in reaching VAMC facilities, and the stigma
      Veterans perceive related to receiving mental health treatment. Indeed, if effective, PE
      delivered via telemedicine may address the problem inherent in the finding that 42% of those
      screening positive for PTSD indicate that they are interested in receiving help, but only 25%
      actually receive services (Hoge, et al., 2006).

      Project Objectives: Although effective treatments for PTSD exist and have been adopted by the
      Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC), barriers to care of a social (e.g., stigma) and
      geographic (e.g., rural) nature prevent many Veterans in need from receiving care.
      Telemedicine might address this need. The major objective of this study is to determine if PE
      delivered via Telemedicine is as effective as In Person PE in terms of (1) clinical; (2)
      process; and (3) economic outcomes.

      Project Methods: The investigators propose to use a randomized between groups repeated
      measures (baseline, post-treatment, 3&amp; 6-month followups) design with 226 OIF-OEF Veterans
      diagnosed with PTSD to assess the relative effectiveness, measured in terms of symptoms,
      patient satisfaction, and costs, of PE delivered via Telemedicine vs. In Person formats. The
      investigators hypothesize that no differences (i.e., non-inferiority) between the two formats
      will be evident in terms treatment gains, patient satisfaction, treatment attrition, patient
      satisfaction and direct health care costs.

      Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health care: This study will provide important information
      regarding whether PE delivered via home-based Telemedicine equipment is as effective as
      traditional In Person delivery of PE for post-traumatic stress disorder. If shown to be as
      effective as In Person treatment, a new, innovative, and cost effective intervention delivery
      system for PTSD will have initial empirical support.

    <description>The major objective of this study is to determine if PE delivered via Telemedicine is as effective as In Person PE in terms of (1) clinical (PTSD and Depression); (2) process (Treatment Satisfaction and Attrition); and (3) economic (Cost) outcomes. Per protocol, participants could have as many as 12 treatment sessions. Per protocol treatment completers completed at least 6 90-minute sessions of Prolonged Exposure either In Person or via Telemedicine. Treatment dropout is defined as initiating treatment but completing fewer than 6 sessions.</description>

    <measure>PTSD Checklist-Military (PCL-M)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD Checklist-Military (PCL-M): The PCL is a 17 Item Self Report Measure of PTSD Symptoms Based on the DSM-IV Criteria. The PCL uses a 5-point Likert scale response format ranging from not at all to frequently. The instrument is highly correlated with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (r = .93), has good diagnostic efficiency (&gt; .70), and robust psychometrics with a variety of trauma populations (Blanchard, 1996), including combat veterans (Magruder, Frueh, et al, 2005). Total scores on the PCL range from 17 to 85, with lower scores indicating less symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II): (BDI; Beck et al., 1961): The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report scale, is among the most widely used instruments to measure depression. Beck and Steer (1984) demonstrated that the BDI-I has high internal consistency (α = .86 - .91). Lower scores indicate less symptom severity, and higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. Raw scores of 0-13 indicates minimal depression; 14-19 indicates mild depression; 20-28 indicates moderate depression; 29-63 indicates severe depression. The lowest possible score on this measure is 0, and the highest possible score is 63.</description>

    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS IV)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a structured interview designed to make a categorical PTSD diagnosis, as well as to provide a measure of PTSD symptom severity. The structure corresponds to the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD diagnoses, with B, C, and D symptoms rated for both frequency and intensity; these two scores (frequency + intensity) are summed to provide severity ratings. Additional questions assess Criteria A, E, and F. It is recommended that the &quot;1, 2&quot; rule be used to determine whether a symptom meets criteria; that is, a frequency score of at least 1 (scale 0 = &quot;none of the time&quot; to 4 = &quot;most or all of the time&quot;) and an intensity score of at least 2 (scale 0 = &quot;none&quot; to 4 = &quot;extreme&quot;) is required for a particular symptom to meet criteria. Total scores from B, C and D range from 0 to 136, with lower scores indicating better outcomes, and higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Deployment Risk and Resiliency Inventory (DRRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>The DRRI is collection of self-report measures assessing 14 key deployment-related risk and resilience factors with demonstrated implications for veterans' long-term health. With the nature of military deployment changing, with a larger proportion of women, National Guard and Reserves being deployed for more contemporary conflicts, the DRRI was developed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the current combat-related experiences. The DRRI is made up of multiple scales to represent different constructs. Responses are either dichotomous (0=No, 1=Yes), polytomous (0=No, 1=Not Sure, 2=Yes), or recorded on a 4, 5 or 6 point Likert scales. Scores for each section are summed are contain scoring ranges. Higher scores are indicative of worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Health Related Functioning: Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Short Study Forms-36 Health Survey (SF 36)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS SF-36 is an indicator of overall health status. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each of the eight summed scores is linearly transformed onto a scale from 0 (negative health) to 100 (positive health) to provide a score for each subscale. Therefore, lower scores indicate more disability while higher scores indicate less disability. Each subscale can be used independently. Sections of the SF-36 include: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health.</description>

    <measure>Charleston Psychiatric Outpatient Satisfaction Scale (CPOSS-VA)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CPOSS is a 16-item measure, with a Likert scale response format, based on a general measure of patient satisfaction. Extant data demonstrate that the measure has excellent reliability (alpha = 0.96) and good convergent validity with relevant anchor items (&quot;would you recommend this treatment to a friend or family member?&quot;). Items are scored using a 5 point Likert scale (5=excellent; 4=very good; 3=good; 2=fair; 1=poor). The scale is scored by summing the scores of all individual items. The possible range is 16 to 80, with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Credibility</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measures assesses for differences in outcome expectancy. The Treatment Credibility Scale (as used in this study) contains 4 questions. Each question is scored individually via 10-point Likert scales. Questions asses how logical treatment seems, how confident participants are about treatment, and expectations of success and is administered at treatment session 4. Scores on treatment logicality, confidence and predicted success on each question range from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very logical), with mid-range scores indicating moderate logicality, confidence and predicted success.</description>

    <measure>Service Delivery Perceptions Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is used to assess Veterans' perceptions about variables specifically related to this mode of service delivery (e.g., the quality of communication, ease of use, and willingness to use treatment via videoconferencing in the future). There are 8 questions (1 question was not assessed due to asking about group participation which is irrelevant to the current study). All questions are answered via a 5 point Likert scale, with 1 indicating poor perceptions and 5 indicating excellent perceptions. Scores range from 7-35, with higher scores indicating more positive outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) is a semistructured interview to determine whether an individual meets criteria for any Axis I disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (version IV). The SCID is broken down into separate modules corresponding to categories of diagnoses, and uses skip logic to allow the interviewer to skip questions or modules if certain diagnostic criteria are indicated. Most sections begin with an entry question that would allow the interviewer to &quot;skip&quot; the associated questions if not met. For all diagnoses symptoms are coded as present, subthreshold, or absent. It assesses for both current and lifetime diagnoses and prompts the interviewer to document age of illness onset and to rate current illness severity (Glasofer et al., 2015).</description>

    <measure>Prior Experience With Computer and Audiovisual Technology</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>The Prior Experience With Technology questionnaire is an 8-item short measure to learn more about participants' prior experiences and comfort level with computers and audiovisual technology. For 8 different technological devices, the measure asks if the participant has the device in his/her home (i.e. Is there a telephone in your home)? Subsequent questions determine whether the patient is comfortable using that device or, if he/she does not own one, if he/she would be willing to learn to use one. Devices assessed include telephone, television, stereo, video player (e.g. VCR, DVD), computer, internet, e-mail, and audiovisual conferencing technology. These data may help identify whether these variables are associated with clinical outcome.</description>

Per protocol, participants could have as many as 12 treatment sessions. Per protocol treatment completers completed at least 6 90-minute sessions of Prolonged Exposure either In Person or via Telemedicine. Treatment dropout is defined as initiating treatment but completing fewer than 6 sessions.</description>

        <description>PTSD Checklist-Military (PCL-M): The PCL is a 17 Item Self Report Measure of PTSD Symptoms Based on the DSM-IV Criteria. The PCL uses a 5-point Likert scale response format ranging from not at all to frequently. The instrument is highly correlated with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (r = .93), has good diagnostic efficiency (&gt; .70), and robust psychometrics with a variety of trauma populations (Blanchard, 1996), including combat veterans (Magruder, Frueh, et al, 2005). Total scores on the PCL range from 17 to 85, with lower scores indicating less symptom severity.</description>

Beck and Steer (1984) demonstrated that the BDI-I has high internal consistency (α = .86 - .91). Lower scores indicate less symptom severity, and higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. Raw scores of 0-13 indicates minimal depression; 14-19 indicates mild depression; 20-28 indicates moderate depression; 29-63 indicates severe depression.

        <title>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS IV)</title>
        <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a structured interview designed to make a categorical PTSD diagnosis, as well as to provide a measure of PTSD symptom severity. The structure corresponds to the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD diagnoses, with B, C, and D symptoms rated for both frequency and intensity; these two scores (frequency + intensity) are summed to provide severity ratings. Additional questions assess Criteria A, E, and F. It is recommended that the &quot;1, 2&quot; rule be used to determine whether a symptom meets criteria; that is, a frequency score of at least 1 (scale 0 = &quot;none of the time&quot; to 4 = &quot;most or all of the time&quot;) and an intensity score of at least 2 (scale 0 = &quot;none&quot; to 4 = &quot;extreme&quot;) is required for a particular symptom to meet criteria. Total scores from B, C and D range from 0 to 136, with lower scores indicating better outcomes, and higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

        <description>The DRRI is collection of self-report measures assessing 14 key deployment-related risk and resilience factors with demonstrated implications for veterans' long-term health. With the nature of military deployment changing, with a larger proportion of women, National Guard and Reserves being deployed for more contemporary conflicts, the DRRI was developed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the current combat-related experiences. The DRRI is made up of multiple scales to represent different constructs. Responses are either dichotomous (0=No, 1=Yes), polytomous (0=No, 1=Not Sure, 2=Yes), or recorded on a 4, 5 or 6 point Likert scales. Scores for each section are summed are contain scoring ranges. Higher scores are indicative of worse outcomes.</description>

          <title>Deployment Risk and Resiliency Inventory (DRRI)</title>
          <description>The DRRI is collection of self-report measures assessing 14 key deployment-related risk and resilience factors with demonstrated implications for veterans' long-term health. With the nature of military deployment changing, with a larger proportion of women, National Guard and Reserves being deployed for more contemporary conflicts, the DRRI was developed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the current combat-related experiences. The DRRI is made up of multiple scales to represent different constructs. Responses are either dichotomous (0=No, 1=Yes), polytomous (0=No, 1=Not Sure, 2=Yes), or recorded on a 4, 5 or 6 point Likert scales. Scores for each section are summed are contain scoring ranges. Higher scores are indicative of worse outcomes.</description>
          <population>The outcome data for this measure is not available because there was not enough sufficient responses to generate analyses.</population>

        <title>Health Related Functioning: Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Short Study Forms-36 Health Survey (SF 36)</title>
        <description>The MOS SF-36 is an indicator of overall health status. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each of the eight summed scores is linearly transformed onto a scale from 0 (negative health) to 100 (positive health) to provide a score for each subscale. Therefore, lower scores indicate more disability while higher scores indicate less disability. Each subscale can be used independently. Sections of the SF-36 include: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health.</description>

        <title>Charleston Psychiatric Outpatient Satisfaction Scale (CPOSS-VA)</title>
        <description>The CPOSS is a 16-item measure, with a Likert scale response format, based on a general measure of patient satisfaction. Extant data demonstrate that the measure has excellent reliability (alpha = 0.96) and good convergent validity with relevant anchor items (&quot;would you recommend this treatment to a friend or family member?&quot;). Items are scored using a 5 point Likert scale (5=excellent; 4=very good; 3=good; 2=fair; 1=poor). The scale is scored by summing the scores of all individual items. The possible range is 16 to 80, with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I)</title>
        <description>The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) is a semistructured interview to determine whether an individual meets criteria for any Axis I disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (version IV). The SCID is broken down into separate modules corresponding to categories of diagnoses, and uses skip logic to allow the interviewer to skip questions or modules if certain diagnostic criteria are indicated. Most sections begin with an entry question that would allow the interviewer to &quot;skip&quot; the associated questions if not met. For all diagnoses symptoms are coded as present, subthreshold, or absent. It assesses for both current and lifetime diagnoses and prompts the interviewer to document age of illness onset and to rate current illness severity (Glasofer et al., 2015).</description>

        <title>Prior Experience With Computer and Audiovisual Technology</title>
        <description>The Prior Experience With Technology questionnaire is an 8-item short measure to learn more about participants' prior experiences and comfort level with computers and audiovisual technology. For 8 different technological devices, the measure asks if the participant has the device in his/her home (i.e. Is there a telephone in your home)? Subsequent questions determine whether the patient is comfortable using that device or, if he/she does not own one, if he/she would be willing to learn to use one. Devices assessed include telephone, television, stereo, video player (e.g. VCR, DVD), computer, internet, e-mail, and audiovisual conferencing technology. These data may help identify whether these variables are associated with clinical outcome.</description>
