    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Bowel Movements (BMs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Core Phase: Baseline to Weeks 9-12; Extension Period: Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the number of bowel movements in a daily diary. The change from baseline value was calculated as the difference between mean numbers of BMs of the post-baseline interval (Weeks 9 to 12) and baseline. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline for the Extension Period was defined as non-missing assessment in Run-in period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Stool Form/Consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>Core Phase: Baseline to Weeks 9-12; Extension Period: Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed stool form/consistency in a daily diary using a 6-point scale (0-none, 1-hard, 2-firm, 3-soft, 4-loose, 5-watery). The change from the baseline value was calculated as the difference between a mean score of the post-baseline interval (Weeks 9 to 12) and baseline. 0 indicates the best score and 5 indicates the worst score. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline for the Extension Period was defined as non-missing assessment in Run-in period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Percentage of Days With Sensation of Urgency to Defecate</measure>
    <time_frame>Core Phase: Baseline to Weeks 9-12; Extension Period: Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed the urgency to defecate using a daily diary response to the following question, &quot;Have you felt or experienced a sense of urgency to pass stool today?&quot;. The change from the baseline value was calculated as the difference between the mean score (percentage of days) of the post-baseline interval (Weeks 9 to 12) and baseline. Baseline for the Extension Period was defined as non-missing assessment in Run-in period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sensation/Severity of Nausea Using 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Core Phase: Baseline to Weeks 9-12; Extension Period: Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Sensation/severity of nausea was measured using a 100 mm VAS. Participants rated their perception of the sensation/severity of nausea experienced by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No vomiting and 100 = vomiting. The change from the baseline value was calculated as the difference between the mean score of the post-baseline interval (Weeks 9 to 12) and baseline. 0 indicates the best score, 100 indicates the worst score. Baseline for the Extension Period was defined as non-missing assessment in Run-in period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With an Improvement in Global Assessment of Symptoms Associated With Carcinoid Syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>Core Phase: Weeks 9-12; Extension Period: Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their symptoms using a weekly subjective response to the following question, &quot;In the past 7 days, have you had adequate relief of your carcinoid syndrome bowel complaints such as diarrhea, urgent need to have a bowel movement, abdominal pain, or discomfort?&quot;. The values for improvement in global assessment of symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome in the Core Phase were averaged from Weeks 9 to 12.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily Severity of Abdominal Pain or Discomfort Using 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Core Phase: Baseline to Weeks 9-12; Extension Period: Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of abdominal pain was measured using a 100 mm VAS. Participants rated their perception of the sensation/severity of abdominal pain or experienced by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No vomiting and 100 = vomiting. The change from the baseline value was calculated as the difference between the mean score of the post-baseline interval (Weeks 9 to 12) and baseline. 0 indicate the best score, 100 indicates the worst score. Baseline for the Extension Period was defined as non-missing assessment in Run-in period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily Number of Cutaneous Flushing Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Core Phase: Baseline to Weeks 9-12; Extension Period: Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the number of daily cutaneous flushing episodes experienced in the daily diary. The change from baseline value was calculated as the difference between the mean numbers of cutaneous flushing episodes of the post-baseline interval (Weeks 9 to 12) and baseline. Baseline for the Extension Period was defined as non-missing assessment in Run-in period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Clinically Meaningful Symptom Reduction in the Core Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically meaningful symptom reduction was defined as either: a) an average of &lt; 4 bowel movements per day over 15 consecutive days, b) a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of bowel movements, c) a positive response to the question regarding adequate relief, or d) a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of daily flushing episodes.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Urinary 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (HIAA) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Core Phase: Baseline to Week 12; Extension Period: Baseline to Weeks 20-21</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary 5-HIAA (u5-HIAA) is a standard test used in clinical practice to assess the neuroendocrine tumor (NET) activity and is collected as a 24-hour urine specimen. The change from baseline value for the Extension Period was calculated as the difference between mean change in 5-HIAA of the post-baseline interval (Weeks 20 to 21) and baseline. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline for the Extension Period was defined as non-missing assessment in Run-in period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>

    <description>Following a 2-week Run-In Period, participants received telotristat etiprate capsules at a starting dose of 150 mg, orally three times daily (TID) for 14 days in the Core Phase. Dose escalations (250 mg, 350 mg, 500 mg) occurred serially every 14 days, up to a maximum dosage of telotristat etiprate 500 mg TID, as guided by specific clinical criteria for dose escalation. Upon completion of 12 weeks of treatment, participants were eligible to receive telotristat etiprate in the optional Open-label Extension Period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urinary 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (HIAA) Levels</title>
        <description>Urinary 5-HIAA (u5-HIAA) is a standard test used in clinical practice to assess the neuroendocrine tumor (NET) activity and is collected as a 24-hour urine specimen. The change from baseline value for the Extension Period was calculated as the difference between mean change in 5-HIAA of the post-baseline interval (Weeks 20 to 21) and baseline. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline for the Extension Period was defined as non-missing assessment in Run-in period prior to the first dose of study drug.</description>
