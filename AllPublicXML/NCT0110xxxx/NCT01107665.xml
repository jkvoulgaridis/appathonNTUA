  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II single-arm, open-label, clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety
      of pazopanib in combination with paclitaxel as first line therapy for subjects with
      unresectable Stage III and Stage IV melanoma. Previous cytokine therapy is permitted.
      Subjects must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST). Subjects who are not candidates for curative intent treatments are eligible for
      this study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment on study will be administered in 4-week cycles. Paclitaxel will be administered
      intravenously at a starting dose of 80mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest.
      Pazopanib will be administered orally, in a continuous regimen, with a starting dose of 800mg
      daily.

      Approximately 60 eligible subjects will be enrolled over a 24 month period. 21 subjects will
      be entered into the first stage of a 2-stage Simon Minimax design. If there are 3 or more
      responses, 39 additional subjects will be enrolled in Stage 2. The minimum number of
      responses required to move to the second stage, &gt; 3, were noted after the first 9 patients on
      treatment, and the study then proceeded towards the goal of accruing 60 total patients.
      Subjects are permitted to receive supportive care throughout the study including transfusion
      of blood and blood products, treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheal agents,
      analgesics, erythropoietin, filgrastim (Neupogen), or bisphosphonates, when appropriate.
      Subjects should continue treatment on study until objective disease progression is documented
      according to RECIST or withdrawal from the study for other reasons. Subjects discontinuing
      treatment with paclitaxel prior to disease progression should continue treatment with
      pazopanib. Subjects discontinuing both agents prior to progressive disease (PD) will be
      followed for tumor assessment until PD, or until the initiation of a subsequent anti-cancer
      therapy in the absence of documented PD, or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects may
      continue treatment beyond the time of RECIST-defined progression at the discretion of the
      investigator if the subject is perceived to be experiencing clinical benefit. Overall
      survival will be assessed for 2 years from first study treatment.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Progression-free Survival at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the percentage of subjects who are free of RECIST-defined objective disease progression at 6 months after study treatment start. Subjects in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population who discontinue the study prior to 6 months will be included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. Progression is defined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving either a complete or partial tumor response per RECIST criteria. The response rate will be calculated from the review of best response which records confirmed cases of PR and CR only. Confirmation will occur at least 4 weeks after the initial response. Stable disease (SD) will also be defined by 8 weeks or greater and will be summarized by less than 6 months vs. equal or greater than 6 months. Subjects in the ITT population with unknown or missing response will be treated as non-responders, i.e. they will be included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0): Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Reponse (ORR) = CR + PR.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Response (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving either a complete (CR), partial tumor (PR) or stable disease (SD) response per RECIST criteria. Confirmation will occur at least 4 weeks after the initial response for partial and complete responders. Stable disease will also be defined by 8 weeks or greater.
Subjects in the ITT population with unknown or missing response will be treated as non-responders, i.e. they will be included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0): Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD or the persistence of one ore more non-target lesions; Clinical Benefit Rate = (SD+PR+CR).</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first documented evidence of response (CR/PR) until the first documented sign of disease progression or death, assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response analyses will be restricted to the subgroup of the population who experience a response during the study. Duration of response will be defined as the time from first documented evidence of response (CR/PR) until the first documented sign of disease progression or death, if sooner. For subjects who do not progress or die, duration of response will be censored on the date of last assessment.
Duration of response will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Other Safety Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline until date of first documented progression, until initiation of a subsequent anti-cancer therapy, until death, whichever came first, assessed until death, the patient withdraws consent, or the study ends, up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>AEs and toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute-common toxicity criteria (NCI-CTC), Version 3.0. Summaries of the number of toxicity grades for both laboratory and non-laboratory data will be presented. If the AE is listed in the NCI-CTC, the maximum grade will be summarized. Otherwise, the maximum intensity will be summarized. AEs will be coded using the standard dictionary (MedDRA), and grouped by system organ class. They will be summarized by frequency and proportion of total subjects, by system organ class and preferred term. Separate summaries will be given for all AEs, for drug-related AEs, for SAEs, and for AEs leading to withdrawal from the study treatment. The incidence of deaths will also be reported.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Categorical statistical analysis will be performed to determine the relationship between PD and pharmacokinetic (PK) markers and outcomes. Univariate summary statistics will be calculated, such as the sample median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum observations. The dichotomized variables were tabulated as high and low levels or positive and negative expression. Changes over time in continuously distributed biomarker levels will be investigated with the sign's test because of the heavy degree of skewness observed in some of the marginal distributions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study-specific
             procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow up.
             Procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management (e.g., blood
             count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be
             utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as
             specified in the protocol. Note: It is not necessary that informed consent be obtained
             within the protocol-specified screening window.

          2. Histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma with 1) unresectable Stage III disease, or
             2) Stage IV disease by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria.

          3. Must have measurable disease [i.e. with at least one measurable lesion, per RECIST]. A
             measurable lesion is defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least
             one dimension with the longest diameter ≥20mm using conventional techniques or ≥10mm
             with spiral CT scan.

             Note: Subjects should be excluded if all baseline measurable lesions are within
             previously irradiated areas. Subjects participating in the exploratory analysis shall
             not have the biopsied lesion(s) as the only sites of measurable disease.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          5. Age 18 years old or older

          6. A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

             Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),
             including any female who has had:

               -  A hysterectomy

               -  A bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy)

               -  A bilateral tubal ligation

               -  Is post-menopausal

             Subjects not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total
             cessation of menses for ≥1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in
             questionable cases, have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value &gt;40
             milliinternational unit (mIU)/mL and an estradiol value &lt;40pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L).

             Subjects must discontinue HRT prior to study enrollment due to the potential for
             inhibition of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins.
             For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT and
             determination of menopausal status; length of this interval depends on the type and
             dosage of HRT. If a female subject is determined not to be post-menopausal, they must
             use adequate contraception, as defined immediately below.

             Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy
             test within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to
             the first dose as possible, and agrees to use adequate contraception. Acceptable
             contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both the product
             label and the instructions of the physician, are as follow:

               -  An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.

               -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is
                  the sole sexual partner for that female.

               -  Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to
                  investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days
                  after the last dose of investigational product.

               -  Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or
                  film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide).

             Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug drug interactions.

             Female subjects who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose
             of study drug and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for
             14 days following the last dose of study drug.

             A male with a female partner of childbearing potential is eligible to enter and
             participate in the study if he uses a barrier method of contraception or abstinence
             during the study.

          7. Adequate organ system functions as defined below:

             System:Laboratory Values

                  pressure assessment must be less or equal 150 systolic and 90 diastolic mmHg in
                  order for a subject to be eligible for the study.

              15. Prior major surgery or trauma within 14 days of the first dose of study drug
                  and/or presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer.

              16. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis

              17. Hemoptysis within 6 weeks of first dose of study drug.

              18. Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or other
                  conditions that could interfere with subject's safety, obtaining informed consent
                  or compliance to the study.

              19. Use of any prohibited medications within 14 days of the first dose of study
                  medication.

              20. Radiation therapy within 28 days of the first dose of study drug.

              21. Any ongoing toxicity from prior anti-cancer therapy that is &gt;Grade 1 and/or that
                  is progressing in severity.

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>This is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving either a complete or partial tumor response per RECIST criteria. The response rate will be calculated from the review of best response which records confirmed cases of PR and CR only. Confirmation will occur at least 4 weeks after the initial response. Stable disease (SD) will also be defined by 8 weeks or greater and will be summarized by less than 6 months vs. equal or greater than 6 months. Subjects in the ITT population with unknown or missing response will be treated as non-responders, i.e. they will be included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0): Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Reponse (ORR) = CR + PR.</description>
