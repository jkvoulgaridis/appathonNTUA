  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common human cancer in the US and affect over 1
      million people. There is no effective drug to prevent basal cell carcinomas of the skin.

      We hope to learn if an oral anti-fungal drug, itraconazole, might inhibit a marker of
      proliferation and a biomarker (tumor signaling pathway) of BCC development.

      Itraconazole is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin, and
      has been used for the past 25 years with relatively few side effects. It has been shown in
      mice to reduce a BCC biomarker and to reduce growth of BCCs.

      Thus, it may reduce BCC growth in humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with at least one BCC tumor measuring 4 mm or greater in diameter will be
      enrolled onto 1 of 2 treatment cohorts to receive oral itraconazole.

        -  Cohort A - 400 mg itraconazole (as 200 mg twice daily for 30 days), stratified by:

             -  Cohort A1 - Participants are vismodegib-naive.

             -  Cohort A2 - Participants had received prior vismodegib treatment.

        -  Cohort B - 200 mg itraconazole (as 100 mg twice daily, for up to 4 months). The
           objective of this cohort is to assess the anti-cancer efficacy of lower-dose extended
           treatment.

        -  Control Group - Tumors from untreated participants.

    <measure>Ki67 Tumor Proliferation Biomarker</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in Ki67 tumor proliferation biomarker was assessed at baseline and after 1 month of treatment, for Cohort A1 (vismodegib-naïve participants receiving 400 mg as 200 mg twice daily) vs control patients. The outcome is expressed as the % change from baseline of cells with a positive signal after staining for Ki67.
Paired analysis of tumors shows percent change between baseline (prior to treatment) and post itraconazole treatment in individual patients, &amp; is reported as the mean of the changes observed for those lesions for which both baseline and treated valued are available.
Unpaired analysis shows percent change between individual tumors from control patients and itraconazole treated patients, and is reported as the change in mean of the group of baseline basal cell carcinoma (BCC) lesion measurements and the group of treated BCC lesion measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of GLI1 Tumor Biomarker</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor biomarker GLI1 (glioma-associated oncogene 1), part of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway, was assessed in vismodegib-naïve participants at baseline and after 1 month of treatment by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The relative expression of the biomarker was measured as the fold increase of GLI1 expression compared to that of housekeeping gene hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), and the outcome was assessed as the percent change from the mean of the pre-treatment measurements to the mean of the post-treatment measurements. A negative mean indicates an overall reduction in GLI1 expression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor Size</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor size was assessed by caliper measurement of the longest perpendicular diameters before and after itraconazole treatment, and determination of tumor area by multiplication of the measurements for each tumor. The outcome is expressed as the mean percent change in tumor area from baseline, with standard deviation. A negative value indicates a reduction in size.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment period: 1 month (Cohort A) or 2.3 months (mean for Cohort B)</time_frame>
    <description>The following criteria for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) tumor response were used.
Complete response (CR) means no visible evidence of any lesion consistent with BCC
Partial response (PR) means less than CR, but there was a visible decrease in BCC tumor size
No response (NR) / Stable Disease (SD) means no visible decrease in BCC tumor size
Progressive disease (PD) means an increase in size or number of BCC tumor lesions
Treatment assessment was conducted on the basis of lesion photographs by a dermatologist investigator who was blinded to the assigned treatment.</description>

        <description>Percent change in Ki67 tumor proliferation biomarker was assessed at baseline and after 1 month of treatment, for Cohort A1 (vismodegib-naïve participants receiving 400 mg as 200 mg twice daily) vs control patients. The outcome is expressed as the % change from baseline of cells with a positive signal after staining for Ki67.
Paired analysis of tumors shows percent change between baseline (prior to treatment) and post itraconazole treatment in individual patients, &amp; is reported as the mean of the changes observed for those lesions for which both baseline and treated valued are available.
Unpaired analysis shows percent change between individual tumors from control patients and itraconazole treated patients, and is reported as the change in mean of the group of baseline basal cell carcinoma (BCC) lesion measurements and the group of treated BCC lesion measurements.</description>

        <title>Change of GLI1 Tumor Biomarker</title>
        <description>Tumor biomarker GLI1 (glioma-associated oncogene 1), part of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway, was assessed in vismodegib-naïve participants at baseline and after 1 month of treatment by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The relative expression of the biomarker was measured as the fold increase of GLI1 expression compared to that of housekeeping gene hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), and the outcome was assessed as the percent change from the mean of the pre-treatment measurements to the mean of the post-treatment measurements. A negative mean indicates an overall reduction in GLI1 expression.</description>

Complete response (CR) means no visible evidence of any lesion consistent with BCC
Partial response (PR) means less than CR, but there was a visible decrease in BCC tumor size
No response (NR) / Stable Disease (SD) means no visible decrease in BCC tumor size
Progressive disease (PD) means an increase in size or number of BCC tumor lesions
Treatment assessment was conducted on the basis of lesion photographs by a dermatologist investigator who was blinded to the assigned treatment.</description>
