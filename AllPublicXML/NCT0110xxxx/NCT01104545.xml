  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if MK-3614, given as single doses, is safe and well tolerated in
      healthy males and male participants with mild to moderate hypertension.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to three planned panels of either 8 healthy participants (Panels A and B) or 8
      participants with mild to moderate hypertension (Panel C) will be enrolled. In Panels A and
      B, 8 participants will alternately receive single rising doses of MK-3614 or placebo. All
      doses will be administered in the fasted state, except Panel A, Period 3 in which a standard
      high-fat breakfast provided approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing. Panel A will begin
      first. At least 3 days will elapse before participants in the alternate panel (Panel B) will
      receive the next higher dose. In Panel C, 8 mild to moderate hypertensive male participants
      will receive single rising doses of MK-8892 or placebo. For all panels, there will be at
      least 7 days washout between treatment periods for any given participant. Participants may
      only be enrolled in one panel of the study. All participants in periods of all panels (with
      exception of 0.25 mg fasted/fed periods) will be randomly assigned to either study drug or
      placebo, i.e., a participant could be assigned to receive study drug in one period and
      placebo in another. As per the protocol allocation plan, the same participants will receive
      0.25 mg MK-3612 in a fasted and fed state.

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, regardless of whether or not it was considered related to the medicinal product. The percentage of participants that reported at least 1 AE was summarized. AEs are reported by the dose taken at the time of the event.</description>

          <description>Blood was drawn at predose (baseline) and 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours postdose. The change in cyclic GMP at 24 hours postdose was summarized. Due to change in number of blood draws and total blood volume restrictions, data for GMP were only collected for first 2 periods of each panel.
