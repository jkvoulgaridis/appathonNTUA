  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and beneficial effects of elagolix (NBI-56418)
      compared to placebo and leuprorelin (an approved endometriosis therapy) over a three month
      period followed by an additional three months of treatment on elagolix.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study followed a parallel-group design in which participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to
      one of the following treatment groups for the first 12 weeks of dosing: 150 mg elagolix once
      daily (q.d.); 250 mg elagolix q.d.; placebo; or leuprorelin acetate depot injection 3.75 mg
      (monthly). Blinding was achieved using a double-dummy design. Following 12 weeks of dosing,
      participants continued in the study for an additional 12 weeks; participants randomized to
      elagolix continued to receive their assigned dose and participants randomized to placebo or
      leuprorelin acetate were re-randomized to receive one of the two doses of elagolix (150 mg
      q.d. or 250 mg q.d.) for 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion. Six weeks after the last dose of
      the study drug at the end of Week 24, a follow-up visit was performed (end of Week 30).

      There was no pre-specified primary efficacy end point as there was no single key efficacy
      outcome measure in this exploratory Phase 2 study. For purposes of results reported here,
      Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Numerical Rating Score (NRS) for Endometriosis Pain
      is designated as the primary outcome measure.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their pelvic pain not related to menses and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time every day in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
0 = No pelvic pain
1 = Mild pelvic pain; subject could not do some of the things she usually does
2 = Moderate pelvic pain; subject could not do many of the things she usually does
3 = Severe pelvic pain; subject could not do most or all of the things she usually does.
The monthly mean non-menstrual pelvic pain score is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Dysmenorrhea Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time each day of their period in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
Subject is not having her period
0 = No pain related to period
1 = Mild pain related to period; subject could not do some of the things she usually does
2 = Moderate pain related to period; subject could not do many of the things she usually does
3 = Severe pain related to period; subject could not do most of or all of the things she usually does.
The monthly mean dysmenorrhea score is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Sum of Dysmenorrhea and Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain not related to menses and their impact on daily activities at approximately the same time every day on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) in an e-Diary. The dysmenorrhea scale included an option for participants who were not having their period.
The sum of the dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores on each day were calculated to create a daily total score. On days the participant was not having her period, the dysmenorrhea score was not defined; hence, the total score was equal to the non-menstrual pelvic pain score (range 0 to 3). On days where the participant recorded menstruation the total score ranged from 0 to 6, where higher scores indicate more severe pain. The monthly mean sum of dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image with five response categories for each item (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always)
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions which assess the areas of work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession, treatment, and infertility with the same five response categories plus an additional response category of Not Relevant which was not scored.
The scores associated with each possible outcome category are as follows: never (0), rarely (25), sometimes (50), often (75), and always (100). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>

        <description>The NRS is an 11-point scale used to measure endometriosis pain and was completed at approximately the same time each day using an electronic diary (e-Diary). Participants were instructed to select a single number between 0 (No pain) and 10 (Worst pain ever) that best described their endometriosis pain at its worst over the past day.
The monthly mean NRS is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

        <description>The NRS is an 11-point scale used to measure endometriosis pain and was completed at approximately the same time each day using an electronic diary (e-Diary). Participants were instructed to select a single number between 0 (No pain) and 10 (Worst pain ever) that best described their endometriosis pain at its worst over the past day.
The monthly peak NRS is the maximum of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

        <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time each day of their period in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
Subject is not having her period
0 = No pain related to period
1 = Mild pain related to period; subject could not do some of the things she usually does
2 = Moderate pain related to period; subject could not do many of the things she usually does
3 = Severe pain related to period; subject could not do most of or all of the things she usually does.
The monthly mean dysmenorrhea score is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Sum of Dysmenorrhea and Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain Scores</title>
        <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain not related to menses and their impact on daily activities at approximately the same time every day on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) in an e-Diary. The dysmenorrhea scale included an option for participants who were not having their period.
The sum of the dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores on each day were calculated to create a daily total score. On days the participant was not having her period, the dysmenorrhea score was not defined; hence, the total score was equal to the non-menstrual pelvic pain score (range 0 to 3). On days where the participant recorded menstruation the total score ranged from 0 to 6, where higher scores indicate more severe pain. The monthly mean sum of dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Days of Narcotic Analgesic Use</title>
        <description>The daily use of endometriosis analgesics was reported by participants daily using the e-Diary. Participants reported whether the medication was over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription, and, if prescription, whether the medication was a narcotic.
The percentage of days of narcotic analgesic use is defined as the number of days in the 4 weeks prior to each study visit that the participant reported the use of a narcotic analgesic, divided by the number of study days in the interval that the participant provided an e-Diary report regarding the use of endometriosis analgesics (including a response of &quot;none&quot;).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dyspareunia Component of the Composite Pelvic Signs and Symptoms Score (CPSSS)</title>
        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration.
To assess dyspareunia (painful intercourse) participants were asked to select the best description of pain during sexual intercourse over the past 28 days using the following response categories:
0 = Absent; No discomfort during sexual intercourse.
1 = Mild; I can tolerate the discomfort during sexual intercourse.
2 = Moderate; Intercourse is sometime interrupted due to pain.
3 = Severe; I prefer to avoid intercourse because of pain.
Not applicable. I am not sexually active for reasons other than my endometriosis symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dysmenorrhea Component of the CPSSS</title>
        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration.
To assess dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation), participants were asked to select the best description of painful menstruation over the past 28 days using the following response categories:
0 = Absent; Amenorrhea (no bleeding) or no discomfort.
1 = Mild; Some loss of work efficiency; occasional use of analgesics.
2 = Moderate; In bed part of one day, occasional loss of work; regular use of analgesics.
3 = Severe; In bed ≥ 1 day, incapacitation; requirement for strong analgesics.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 evaluable e-Diary report following randomization (intent-to-treat population). Data collection for this endpoint was added via a protocol amendment; therefore, the analysis only includes the subset of participants affected by the protocol amendment.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image with five response categories for each item (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always)
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions which assess the areas of work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession, treatment, and infertility with the same five response categories plus an additional response category of Not Relevant which was not scored.
The scores associated with each possible outcome category are as follows: never (0), rarely (25), sometimes (50), often (75), and always (100). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
        <population>All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 evaluable e-Diary report following randomization (intent-to-treat population). The analysis includes participants with non-missing data for each dimension at baseline and week 12.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5) at Week 12</title>
          <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image with five response categories for each item (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always)
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions which assess the areas of work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession, treatment, and infertility with the same five response categories plus an additional response category of Not Relevant which was not scored.
The scores associated with each possible outcome category are as follows: never (0), rarely (25), sometimes (50), often (75), and always (100). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 evaluable e-Diary report following randomization (intent-to-treat population). The analysis includes participants with non-missing data for each dimension at baseline and week 12.</population>
