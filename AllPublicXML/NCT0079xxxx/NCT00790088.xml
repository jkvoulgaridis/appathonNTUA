      The aim of the project is to document the international routine practice in sensor usage in
      patients treated with sensor-augmented pump therapy and to assess which variables (e.g.
      training of patients, frequency of sensor usage etc) are associated with an improvement in
      clinical outcome(s) from the start of the sensor use to the end of the follow-up period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pump therapy has been established as &quot;gold standard&quot; for insulin delivery offering
      improvements over multiple daily insulin injections, but there is a proportion of patients
      for whom the Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) has not been completely
      successful therapy leaving some room for improvement of the glucose level of those patients.
      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems represent an important advance in diabetes
      technology that can facilitate optimal glucose control in type 1 diabetes. Numerous
      randomized control trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of real-time CGM in both
      sub-optimally and well-controlled type 1 diabetes. In all these trials, the benefits of CGM
      correlate with frequent sensor wear and more advanced age. In clinical practice, the
      sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP therapy) is indicated for patients who cannot achieve good
      metabolic control on CSII, who have a history of severe hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia
      unawareness, or who desire increased flexibility in their daily lives while maintaining or
      even improving their HbA1c levels.

      This was a post-market release, minimally interventional study. All the study devices and
      related software were CE-marked and commercially available in the countries participating to
      the study. The devices were prescribed and reimbursed, if applicable, according to routine
      practice.

      The gathered information during this study may help to define which patient groups benefit
      the most from the treatment with SAP therapy systems. The real-life results of these
      descriptive analyses will aid improvement of guidelines helping the medical community to
      better choose the right patient population and treatment patterns. Moreover, based on these
      real-life data, hypotheses could be defined when addressing further research questions.

    <description>To calculate the percentage of time that sensors were used during 3 months:
the total number of recorded sensor readings during 3 months was divided by the theoretical number of sensor readings that would be observed if sensor was worn every day of using pump to deliver insulin during the same period (ie, observed readings / (theoretical 288 readings per day x nber of days with insulin use)) and multiplied by 100</description>

    <measure>Fear of Hypoglycemia Survey (HFS-II) - Total Score and Behavior Score</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 6 and after 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>sub-group of patients (adults only in Hungary and Denmark) were asked to answer the fear of hypoglycemia validated questionnaires.
The total HFS-II questionnaire is represented by 33 items. The respondents rank the responses on a 5- point Likert scale where zero is never and four is always.The total HFS-II score ranges from 0 to 132. Lower score at 6 months or 12 months compared to baseline represents a better outcome.
The HFS-II questionnaire is divided into 2 subscales: the behavior and the worry subscales. The behavior score is represented by 15 items and ranges from 0 to 60. Lower score at 6 months or 12 months compared to baseline represents a better outcome.</description>

    <description>sub-group of patients (adults only) were asked to answer the fear of hypoglycemia validated questionnaires. The respondents rank the responses on a 5- point Likert scale where zero is never and four is always. The worry subscale is the mean of 18 items which evaluate the worry score (range from 0 to 72). Lower score at 6 months or 12 months compared to baseline represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status Version (DTSQs)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 3 and after 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A sub-group of patients (adults) were asked to complete the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs) The treatment satisfaction is measured by means of the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, status version (DTSQs, Bradley, 1990). It consists of a six-item scale assessing treatment satisfaction (TS) and two items assessing perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. The DTSQs items are scored on a scale from 6 to 0. The scale total is computed by adding the six items 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, to produce the Treatment Satisfaction scale total, which has a min of 0 and a max of 36. Higher score at 6 month or 12 months compared to baseline represents a better outcome. Items 2 (perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia) and 3 (perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia) are treated individually in data analysis. Lower score at 6 months or 12 months compared to baseline represents a better outcome.</description>

        <description>sub-group of patients (adults only in Hungary and Denmark) were asked to answer the fear of hypoglycemia validated questionnaires.
The total HFS-II questionnaire is represented by 33 items. The respondents rank the responses on a 5- point Likert scale where zero is never and four is always.The total HFS-II score ranges from 0 to 132. Lower score at 6 months or 12 months compared to baseline represents a better outcome.
The HFS-II questionnaire is divided into 2 subscales: the behavior and the worry subscales. The behavior score is represented by 15 items and ranges from 0 to 60. Lower score at 6 months or 12 months compared to baseline represents a better outcome.</description>

        <description>A sub-group of patients (adults) were asked to complete the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs) The treatment satisfaction is measured by means of the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, status version (DTSQs, Bradley, 1990). It consists of a six-item scale assessing treatment satisfaction (TS) and two items assessing perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. The DTSQs items are scored on a scale from 6 to 0. The scale total is computed by adding the six items 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, to produce the Treatment Satisfaction scale total, which has a min of 0 and a max of 36. Higher score at 6 month or 12 months compared to baseline represents a better outcome. Items 2 (perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia) and 3 (perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia) are treated individually in data analysis. Lower score at 6 months or 12 months compared to baseline represents a better outcome.</description>
