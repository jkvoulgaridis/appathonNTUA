  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When implantable cardiac defibrillators are implanted (ICDs), the defibrillation threshold
      (DFT), of the amount of energy required to effectively terminate life-threatening arrhythmias
      is determined. The device is then programmed to discharge a larger amount of energy in order
      to provide a safety margin. In some patients, the DFT is so high, that an adequate safety
      margin is not programmable. Placement of a defibrillation lead in the azygos vein has been
      found to be helpful in these patients. This goal of this trial is to attempt to quantify the
      average reduction in the DFT (if any) that results from the addition of the azygos lead.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing placement of an ICD for the primary or secondary prevention of sudden
      cardiac death will be asked to participate. Patients will undergo implantation of a standard
      right ventricular ICD lead at the time of ICD implantation. In addition, patient will receive
      another high voltage ICD lead placed in the azygos vein as has been previously described in
      the literature (1). After sedating the patient, the DFT will be determined using a binary
      search algorithm. This consists of testing the device at a given output for the first shock
      after inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF). Should the shock fail, external defibrillation
      will be attempted, as is the standard method for performing DFT testing. As per the standard
      method of DFT testing, VF will be induced a second time, with the shock strength dependent on
      the success of the first shock. If the first shock was unsuccessful, the second will be at a
      higher output. If the first shock was successful, the second will be at a lower output. A
      third shock will then be delivered, based on the success or failure of the preceding shock to
      define the DFT. Of note, as the device can be programmed to give multiple shocks for one
      episode, VF will not necessarily need to be induced each time. For example, VF could be
      induced, and the device programmed to give a 20 Joule (J) shock followed by a 23J shock if
      not successful, thus limiting the number of VF inductions required. DFT testing will be done
      using both the standard configuration of high voltage leads as well as using the azygos lead.
      We hypothesize that using the azygos lead will result in a lower DFT.

          <title>Standard Configuration vs. Azygos Coil Configuation</title>
          <description>The DFT with the standard SVC coil vs. DFT with the azygos vein coil in place.
Since all subjects underwent attempted azygos vein implantation, the implantation procedure was the same for the arm in which the standard configuration was tested first and the arm in which the azygos configuration was tested. first. Therefore, the two arms (Standard configuration tested first and Azygos configuration tested first) were combined for the purpose of adverse events.</description>
