  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latinos with diabetes who are attending the Emory Latino Diabetes education program will be
      approached about consenting to have clinical measurements collected to assess changes between
      baseline and monthly follow up sessions. The no-cost educational sessions follow the
      self-care behavior curriculum of the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latinos represent the largest minority group in the United States with a population of 35
      million or 12.5%. National surveys indicate that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 1.9
      times higher in Latinos than non-whites, and that approximately 24% percent of Latinos over
      the age of 45 years have diabetes. In Georgia, Latinos make up approximately 6.5% of the
      population. During 1990 and 2000, the prevalence of diabetes in Fulton and Dekalb counties,
      two of the most populated areas in Georgia and the Atlanta metropolitan area increased by
      30%. Language and cultural barriers represent the two most important obstacles in educating
      and improving the care of Latino patients with diabetes. Less than 5% of physicians, 2% of
      nurses, and 2.5% of dentists in the US speak Spanish.

      The Emory Latino Diabetes education program has been in existence since December 2005. This
      program aims to deliver diabetes education in Spanish to the underserved Latino community in
      Metro Atlanta. Program participants attend an initial 3 hour diabetes education class in
      Spanish. The class curriculum follows the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE)
      seven self-care behaviors: healthy eating, being active, monitoring, medication use,
      problem-solving and healthy coping. Participants are invited to return to a follow-up session
      within 6 months. Follow-up sessions are held in the late afternoon. These sessions are
      discussion-based and include an activity such as salsa lessons and cooking demonstrations.
      Diabetes education classes and follow-up sessions are offered at Grady Memorial Hospital
      (Diabetes Clinic, International Medical Center), Grady North Dekalb Clinic (Chamblee), and
      North Fulton Regional Hospital.

      Participants complete a questionnaire assessing behaviors and social and demographic
      characteristics of the Latino community being served. Hemoglobin A1C, blood pressure, weight,
      body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference will be measured at the beginning of each
      class. This study will analyze and publish data collected from individuals who are attending
      the educational sessions. Additionally, the researchers will collect retrospective data from
      past participants in the program.

    <measure>Barriers to Health Care</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To examine barriers to health care among Latinos with Diabetes in the population served participants will be asked qualitative questions about what type of health insurance they have and if they have a physician that they see.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Glucose Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Montly Follow-up Visits (up to 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood glucose levels are measured in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). Normal fasting levels are between 70 and 99 mg/dL and diabetes is indicated when fasting glucose levels are greater than 125 mg/dL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hemoglobin A1C</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Montly Follow-up Visits (up to 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The hemoglobin A1c test result is reported as a percentage. Higher percentages indicate higher blood glucose levels in the previous three months. A normal HbA1c level is below 5.7 percent.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Waist Circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Montly Follow-up Visits (up to 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference is measured in centimeters (cm).</description>

    <measure>Change in Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Montly Follow-up Visits (up to 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.</description>

    <measure>Change in Systolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Montly Follow-up Visits (up to 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be measured using blood pressure monitor. Normal systolic blood pressure is less than 120 millimeter of mercury (mm/Hg) and high blood pressure is typically diagnosed at measurements of 130 mm/Hg and higher.</description>

    <measure>Change in Diastolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Montly Follow-up Visits (up to 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be measured using blood pressure monitor. Normal diastolic blood pressure is less than 80 mm/Hg and high blood pressure is typically diagnosed at measurements of 80 mm/Hg and higher.</description>
