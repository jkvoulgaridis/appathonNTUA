      This is an open-label extension study for patients who participated in the BPS-MR-PAH-201
      study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study for patients who participated in the BPS-MR-PAH-201 study and
      have volunteered to continue treatment for PAH with BPS-MR tablets. Each patient will return
      to the clinic following enrollment in the study at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually
      thereafter for assessment.

      Currently enrolled patients may be invited to participate in an optional four times daily
      (QID) dosing substudy of BPS-MR with total daily dose of BPS-MR achieved previously in the
      main study. Patients will return to the clinic for baseline visit, week 12, and then will
      follow the visit schedule provided to them in BPS-MR-PAH-202 main study.

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 months</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) is defined as an event not present prior to the initiation of the treatments or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the treatments. AEs occurring more than 3 days after the last day study drug is taken in the study will not be included in the statistical analyses or summaries (except for subjects with adverse events leading to study drug withdrawn). Only treatment-emergent adverse events occurring during the treatment period of the BPS-MR-PAH-202 study will be summarized. Any adverse event starting prior to the first dose of study drug will be excluded from the summary analyses and only presented in the data listings. A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Six Minutes Walk Distance (6MWD) at End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 56 months</time_frame>
    <description>The area used for the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) was pre-measured at a minimum of 30 meters in length and at least 2 to 3 meters in width. There were no turns or significant curves to the 6-minute walk area. The length was marked with gradations to ensure the accurate measurement of the distance walked. The area was well ventilated with air temperature controlled at 20 to 23°C. Intermittent rest periods were allowed if the participant could no longer continue. If the participant needed to rest briefly, he/she could stand or sit and then begin again when rested but the clock continued to run. At the end of 6 minutes, the tester called &quot;stop&quot; while simultaneously stopping the watch and then measured the distance walked. For the purposes of the 6MWT if a participant was assessed at Baseline using oxygen therapy, then all future 6MWT were conducted in the same manner. All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Borg Dyspnea Score at End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 56 months</time_frame>
    <description>The modified 0-10 category-ratio Borg scale consists of an 11-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea experienced during the 6MWT. Scores range from 0 (for the best condition) and 10 (for the worst condition) with nonlinear spacing of verbal descriptors of severity corresponding to specific numbers. The participant chose the number or the verbal descriptor to reflect presumed ratio properties of sensation or symptom intensity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing evaluation preceding the first dose of study drug in study BPS-MR-PAH-201. Only participants with both a measurement at baseline and at the given visit are presented. All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants That Experienced Clinical Worsening During the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of Participants that experienced Clinical Worsening in the opinion of the Investigator. Clinical Worsening was defined as any of these events following the Baseline visit: Death, Transplantation or atrial septostomy, Clinical deterioration as defined by: Hospitalization as a result of PAH symptoms or Initiation of any new PAH specific therapy (e.g. ERA, PDE-5 inhibitor, prostanoid). All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Change in WHO Functional Class</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 56 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in participant clinical status was recorded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class. A change from lower to higher functional class (i.e. 'III to IV' or 'II to III') was considered as a deterioration. A change from higher to lower functional class (i.e. 'III to II' or 'II to I') was considered as an improvement. All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>

AEs occurring more than 3 days after the last day study drug is taken in the study will not be included in the statistical analyses or summaries (except for subjects with adverse events leading to study drug withdrawn). Only treatment-emergent adverse events occurring during the treatment period of the BPS-MR-PAH-202 study will be summarized. Any adverse event starting prior to the first dose of study drug will be excluded from the summary analyses and only presented in the data listings.

        <description>The area used for the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) was pre-measured at a minimum of 30 meters in length and at least 2 to 3 meters in width. There were no turns or significant curves to the 6-minute walk area. The length was marked with gradations to ensure the accurate measurement of the distance walked. The area was well ventilated with air temperature controlled at 20 to 23°C. Intermittent rest periods were allowed if the participant could no longer continue. If the participant needed to rest briefly, he/she could stand or sit and then begin again when rested but the clock continued to run. At the end of 6 minutes, the tester called &quot;stop&quot; while simultaneously stopping the watch and then measured the distance walked. For the purposes of the 6MWT if a participant was assessed at Baseline using oxygen therapy, then all future 6MWT were conducted in the same manner. All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>

        <description>The modified 0-10 category-ratio Borg scale consists of an 11-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea experienced during the 6MWT. Scores range from 0 (for the best condition) and 10 (for the worst condition) with nonlinear spacing of verbal descriptors of severity corresponding to specific numbers. The participant chose the number or the verbal descriptor to reflect presumed ratio properties of sensation or symptom intensity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing evaluation preceding the first dose of study drug in study BPS-MR-PAH-201. Only participants with both a measurement at baseline and at the given visit are presented. All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With a Change in WHO Functional Class</title>
          <description>Change from Baseline in participant clinical status was recorded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class. A change from lower to higher functional class (i.e. 'III to IV' or 'II to III') was considered as a deterioration. A change from higher to lower functional class (i.e. 'III to II' or 'II to I') was considered as an improvement. All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>
