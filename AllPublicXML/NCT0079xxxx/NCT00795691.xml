    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet compared to
      a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet on glucose control in patients who have Type 2 Diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is not only a risk factor for type 2 diabetes but it also frequently increases the
      need for insulin requirement in people with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese.
      However, since insulin is a lipogenic hormone, insulin or sulfonylurea therapy that increases
      circulating insulin levels often results in additional weight gain. Controlled-carbohydrate
      &quot;ketogenic&quot; diets have been popular as an alternative way of losing weight, but little is
      known about the safety and efficacy of using a ketogenic approach in the management of
      overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The proposed study will randomize a group of 126 overweight or obese (BMI &gt; 25 and &lt; 40)
      adults with type 2 diabetes to either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat weight loss diet. The
      primary study endpoint will be six and twelve month changes in glycemic control as measured
      by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints include adiposity (BMI, body composition and
      fat distribution); blood glucose patterns (from self-monitoring records); change in
      antidiabetic medications (potential decrease in number and dosage), lipids, insulin
      sensitivity from a meal tolerance test, other metabolic markers (C-reactive protein, leptin)
      and participants' lifestyle (physical activity and diet) and perceptions of satiety, quality
      of life, mood, and well-being.

    <time_frame>6 months into treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary intake is assessed using the Dietary History Questionnaire (DHQ), a web-based food frequency questionnaire. Participants select the serving size and frequency of intake for the foods listed. The items listed and serving size choices are derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Calculations of total energy (calories) consumed are based on the nutrient values from NHANES. It is anticipated that a decrease in calorie intake would result in body weight reduction which normally correlates to increased blood glucose control. Likewise, an increase in calories generally result in body weight increase which correlates to decreased blood glucose control.</description>

    <description>Physical activity was assessed using the Modifiable Physical activity Questionnaire (MAQ) with the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall interview. Participants were asked to provide information about the frequency, duration and intensity of various physical activities. MAQ responses and 7-day recall data were coded and entered into software program, which was designed to calculate average daily energy expenditure. Participants were instructed to avoid changing physical activity while in the study because change in physical activity could confound assessment of the dietary questions. An increase in physical activity could increase loss of body weight and reduction in blood HbA1c. A decrease in physical activity could increase body weight and increase HbA1c.</description>

    <description>Quality of Life is assessed using the Diabetes Quality of Life (DQOL) questionnaire. The DQOL questionnaire contains 62 items which participants rank from 1(very satisfied) to 5 (very dissatisfied). The score gives an indication of participants' satisfaction with treatment in terms of level of well-being and disability. The total score ranges from 0 to 310. The score is negatively correlated to Quality of Life with higher scores indicating higher dissatisfaction and therefore, lower perceived Quality of Life. It is expected that reduction in the blood HbA1c level will be associated with an increase in the Diabetes Quality of Life (i.e. a decrease in DQOL score), and an increase in the HbA1c level will correlate to a lower Diabetes Quality of Life (i.e. an increase in DQOL score).</description>

    <description>The low-carbohydrate diet was based on the Atkins weight loss diet. The daily intake goals were to restrict intake of carbohydrate to 20-25 grams for the first 2-week phase. If body weight decreased, the daily goal for carbohydrate was increased by 5 grams. If body weight increased, the daily goal for carbohydrate intake was decreased by 5 grams. The minimum goal for carbohydrate intake was 20 grams per day and the maximum goal was 50 grams per day.</description>
