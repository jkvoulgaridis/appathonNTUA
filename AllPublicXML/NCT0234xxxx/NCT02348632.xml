    <time_frame>Start of randomized withdrawal phase to end of randomized withdrawal (2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score during the 2-week randomized withdrawal period. The beginning of the randomized withdrawal period represents efficacy baseline. A negative change from baseline represents improvement in excessive sleepiness.
The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Each activity is scored on a scale ranging from 0-3, with 0 = would never fall asleep, and 3 = high chance of falling asleep. The total score ranges from 0-24, with a higher number representing an increased propensity for sleepiness. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for the analysis of ESS scores. This analysis included treatment group and randomization stratification factor (narcolepsy vs. OSA) as fixed effects. The ESS score at the beginning of the randomized withdrawal period was used as the covariate. The response variable was the change in ESS score from the beginning to the end of 2- week randomized withdrawal period.</description>

        <title>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score</title>
        <description>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score during the 2-week randomized withdrawal period. The beginning of the randomized withdrawal period represents efficacy baseline. A negative change from baseline represents improvement in excessive sleepiness.
The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Each activity is scored on a scale ranging from 0-3, with 0 = would never fall asleep, and 3 = high chance of falling asleep. The total score ranges from 0-24, with a higher number representing an increased propensity for sleepiness. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for the analysis of ESS scores. This analysis included treatment group and randomization stratification factor (narcolepsy vs. OSA) as fixed effects. The ESS score at the beginning of the randomized withdrawal period was used as the covariate. The response variable was the change in ESS score from the beginning to the end of 2- week randomized withdrawal period.</description>
