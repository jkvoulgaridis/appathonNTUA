  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is growing rapidly among people dying from
      end-stage heart failure who are unable to get a heart transplant. These patients elect to
      live out the remainder of their lives dependent on a partial artificial heartâ€”so-called
      destination therapy (DT). Although patients may live longer with a DT LVAD, it poses many
      risks, including stroke, serious infection, and bleeding. Most of these patients have other
      medical problems that are not fixed by the DT LVAD. Patients must be connected to electricity
      at all times. A caregiver is required, which often places stress on loved ones. Therefore,
      the decision whether or not to get a DT LVAD is often an extremely difficult one.
      Unfortunately, our research shows problems with the way this medical decision is currently
      being made in hospitals across the United States. Hospitals that offer DT LVAD treatment do
      not follow a standard process. The forms, pamphlets, websites, and videos used to help
      patients and families are biased and too difficult for most people to understand. Lastly,
      this is an emotional and even scary decision for most patients and their families, but the
      process does not help them deal with these feelings.

      Using feedback from patients, caregivers, clinicians, the study team made a paper and video
      decision aid to help people who are offered DT LVAD make this most difficult of decisions.
      Unlike the information that is now available, our decision aid focuses on options, fears, and
      the needs of caregivers, is balanced, and is paired with training for doctors and nurses on
      how to best talk about DT LVAD. The investigators now propose to test the effectiveness and
      implementation of this intervention. The investigators will apply the Reach, Effectiveness,
      Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) evaluative framework to a stepped-wedge,
      cluster-randomized, controlled trial across 6 medical centers.

      Aim 1. Evaluate the Reach and Effectiveness of the DT LVAD shared decision support
      intervention to improve patient and caregiver experiences.

      Hypothesis 1a: The intervention will reach 90% of eligible patients. Hypothesis 1b:
      Post-implementation, patients and caregivers will have improved decision quality (greater
      knowledge and higher value-treatment concordance).

      Aim 2. Assess the Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of the DT LVAD shared decision
      support intervention across multiple providers and settings.

      Hypothesis 2: The intervention will be: adopted by key personnel; implemented consistently;
      and maintained after trial completion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to test the effectiveness and implementation of a shared decision
      support intervention for DT LVAD. Six DT LVAD programs from across the U.S. will participate
      in a stepped-wedge randomized study design. In this design, each site participates in both
      the control and intervention phase with the timing of the transition randomly assigned. Sites
      all begin in the control phase, where usual care consists of the current education, decision
      making, and informed consent process. When sites reach their randomly assigned time to
      transition to the intervention, their coordinators and key staff will participate in
      communication training and decision coaching. The pamphlet and video decision aid will be
      formally integrated into the existing education, decision making, and informed consent
      process. In both pre- and post-phases, the investigators will enroll patients and caregivers
      and survey them prior to their DT LVAD decision (baseline) and then at 1 month and 6 months
      after to determine the interventions effect on decision quality and a host of secondary
      outcomes. These patient- and caregiver-centered outcomes will be compared within each
      hospital before and after implementation to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.
      The investigators will also survey clinicians before, during, and after implementation of the
      shared decision support intervention. The implementation will be guided using the well-known
      RE-AIM evaluative framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance).
      Formal study of the implementation will promote widespread dissemination of this DT LVAD
      shared decision support.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effectiveness of Intervention: Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 1 (enrollment), Baseline 2 (post-education: average 3 days after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness: Assessed based on if the decision support intervention led to a quality decision. Decision quality is defined as &quot;the extent to which the implemented decision reflects the considered preferences of a well-informed patient.&quot; By this definition, a decision is &quot;a quality decision&quot; if the treatment chosen is concordant with a knowledgeable patient's values. Decision quality measures consist of 2 domains: knowledge and values.
This is part one of the decision quality measure:
-Knowledge: DT LVAD knowledge score improvement from Baseline 1 (enrollment) to Baseline 2 (post-education), measured by percentage of score improvement (scale of 0-100%).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adoption of Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of intervention phase start</time_frame>
    <description>Adoption: The absolute number of settings who are willing to initiate a program. We will assess the number of sites who agreed to be part of the study and who initiate intervention at intervention period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Implementation of Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 2 (post-education: average 3 days after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Implementation: The extent to which the intervention is implemented as intended. We will assess implementation by surveying the consistency of decision aid delivery by the sites to the enrolled patients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maintenance of Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after study enrollment end date</time_frame>
    <description>Maintenance: Assessing whether sites decide at the conclusion of the study to maintain, modify, or discontinue a program. We will assess maintenance by counting the number of sites who continue the intervention after the study enrollment period has ended.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of Intervention: Values-Choice Concordance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 1 (enrollment) and 1 Month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness: Assessed based on if the decision support intervention led to a quality decision (see &quot;Knowledge&quot; outcome measure for full description). This is part two of the decision quality measure:
-Values: Concordance between patients' and caregivers' stated values and their treatment choice at 1-Month. Values measured on a Likert scale of 1-10, with 1 being &quot;Do everything I can to live longer, even if that means having major surgery and being dependent on a machine&quot; and 10 being &quot;Live with whatever time I have left, without going through major surgery or being dependent on a machine&quot;; correlated with patient-reported treatment decision of accepted or declined DT LVAD. Measured by kendall's tau correlation coefficient, which ranges 1 to -1, score closer to 1 or -1 shows greater values-choice concordance (a correlation coefficient of 0 means no concordance). Confidence intervals obtained from the distribution after 500 bootstrap samples (2.5, 97.5 percentiles).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Occurred from June 2015-Jan 2017 in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. Patients were identified by the study team when a destination therapy left ventricular assist device evaluation was initiated; caregivers were identified by the medical team or patient. Recruitment and data collection were identical across control and intervention arms.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study had a stepped-wedge design. All 6 sites started in the control phase, and then were transitioned to the intervention phase over pre-determined and randomly assigned time points (all sites ended in intervention). Participant assignment to control or intervention was determined by phase the site was in at time of participant enrollment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Effectiveness: Assessed based on if the decision support intervention led to a quality decision. Decision quality is defined as &quot;the extent to which the implemented decision reflects the considered preferences of a well-informed patient.&quot; By this definition, a decision is &quot;a quality decision&quot; if the treatment chosen is concordant with a knowledgeable patient's values. Decision quality measures consist of 2 domains: knowledge and values.

          <description>PEACE Illness Acceptance Measure (patients only): 2 part measure: part 1 measures illness acceptances (questions 1-5 of 12-items), scoring 5-20 with higher score indicating greater acceptance of illness; part 2 measures struggle with illness (questions 6-12 of 12-items), scoring 7-28 with higher score indicating greater struggle with illness.</description>
          <population>PEACE Illness Acceptance Measure was collected for patient participants only; does not apply to the &quot;Caregiver&quot; arm. Those patients who agreed to medical record review only (n=7 control, n=8 intervention) were not included in PEACE Measure analysis, as this data was collected in surveys.</population>

        <description>Effectiveness: Assessed based on if the decision support intervention led to a quality decision (see &quot;Knowledge&quot; outcome measure for full description). This is part two of the decision quality measure:
-Values: Concordance between patients' and caregivers' stated values and their treatment choice at 1-Month. Values measured on a Likert scale of 1-10, with 1 being &quot;Do everything I can to live longer, even if that means having major surgery and being dependent on a machine&quot; and 10 being &quot;Live with whatever time I have left, without going through major surgery or being dependent on a machine&quot;; correlated with patient-reported treatment decision of accepted or declined DT LVAD. Measured by kendall's tau correlation coefficient, which ranges 1 to -1, score closer to 1 or -1 shows greater values-choice concordance (a correlation coefficient of 0 means no concordance).
