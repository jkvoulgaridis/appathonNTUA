  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of concomitant administration of
      prednisolone during use of clomiphene citrate (CC) for induction of ovulation in infertile
      lean women having CC resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

      Women will be randomly divided into two groups; CC-Prednisolone group and CC-placebo group.
      Women in the CC-Prednisolone group will receive CC (150 mg/day for 5 consecutive days from
      day 2 of the cycle) and prednisolone tablet (5 mg/day for 10 consecutive days from day 2 of
      the cycle). Women in the CC-placebo group will receive CC alone (150 mg/day for 5 consecutive
      days from day 2 of the cycle) and folic acid tablet (0.5 mg/day for 10 consecutive days from
      day 2 of the cycle). Transvaginal sonography (TVS) scan will be performed regularly for
      monitoring of follicular growth (folliculometry); starting from day 10 of the stimulation
      cycle and repeated every 2-3 days. When there will be at least one follicle ≥ 18 mm in
      diameter, final oocyte maturation will be induced by intramuscular administration of 10000 IU
      of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and timed intercourse will be advised. If there will be
      no follicle ≥ 12 mm by day 16 of the cycle, monitoring of follicular growth will be
      discontinued and the cycle will be presumed to be anovulatory. Ovulation will be documented
      by TVS scan one week after triggering of oocyte maturation and will be confirmed by assessing
      the mid-luteal serum progesterone level. Each woman will be subjected to ovarian stimulation
      for a maximum of 3 consecutive cycles except if she gets pregnant in the first or second
      cycle
