      U.S. Army Medical Research &amp; Materiel Command Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research
      Center (TATRC) is sponsoring the HF2 (Healthy Families, Healthy Forces) Study. This is a
      randomized trial comparing two different interventions for sustainable weight loss.
      Specifically, the investigators will compare a &quot;current best practice (CBP)&quot; intervention
      that includes standard dietary advice with a new, &quot;Healthy Weight for Living (HWL)&quot;
      intervention that includes recommendations to eat a diet rich in protein, dietary fiber, low
      glycemic index carbohydrates and low calorie foods. The objective of this study is to compare
      the CBP and HWL interventions when delivered to adult dependents of active duty (AD) military
      personnel and measure weight loss effects in both the adult dependents and the AD military
      personnel they live with.

      This is a randomized trial comparing two different interventions for sustainable weight loss.
      Specifically researchers will compare a current best practice (CBP) intervention that
      includes standard dietary advice with a new Healthy Weight for Living (HWL) intervention that
      includes recommendations to eat a diet rich in protein, dietary fiber and low glycemic index
      carbohydrates. The population will be adult dependents of Active Duty (AD) military personnel
      or retired military personnel (direct intervention participants) and the AD or retired
      military personnel they live with (indirect intervention participants). The primary outcome
      will be weight change from baseline to 1 year in the adult dependents. The objective of this
      study is to compare the CBP and HWL interventions when delivered to adult dependents of AD or
      retired military personnel and measure weight loss effects in both the adult dependents and
      the AD or retired military personnel they live with. The working hypothesis is that that the
      HWL intervention will result in significantly greater weight loss over 1 year than the CBP
      intervention in an intent-to-treat analysis in adult dependents, and that the greater weight
      loss in HWL will be associated with greater management of hunger and greater adherence to the
      goal of reducing energy intake. Weight change up until the 18-24 month period will be
      measured as a secondary outcome in a cohort of participants who will reach the 18-24 month
      milestone in the study on or prior to December, 2018. A per protocol analysis will also be
      applied for comparison of the two weight loss arms. (In addition, weight change will be
      measured in the participants' AD or retired military personnel partner to test the hypothesis
      that there is a ripple effect of benefits from the interventions associated with effects in
      the primary recipients.) The original study plan was to examine weight change over 2 years
      but due to slower recruiting than anticipated the hypotheses were revised to allow for 1 year
      to be the primary outcome, with secondary outcomes in the subgroup followed until 18-24
      months.

      The researchers plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the study objectives with
      the following technical objectives:

        1. Conduct a randomized trial comparing the HWL intervention to the CBP intervention over 1
           year in adult dependents of AD or retired military personnel. The primary outcome will
           be weight change from baseline to 1 year. The working hypothesis is that randomization
           to the HWL intervention will result in significantly greater weight loss over 1 year
           than randomization to the CBP intervention, and that greater weight loss in the HWL
           intervention will be associated with greater adherence to the goals of reducing energy
           intake and hunger.

        2. Compare the change in weight loss of participants in the HWL intervention to the CBP
           intervention over the 18-24 month timepoints in the subgroup of participants who will
           reach the 18-24 month milestone on or prior to December, 2018. The working hypothesis is
           that randomization to the HWL intervention will result in significantly improved weight
           loss retention compared to randomization to the CBP intervention.

        3. Examine the effects of the interventions delivered to adult dependents of AD or retired
           military personnel on the weight of AD or retired military personnel themselves. The
           working hypothesis, based on preliminary data, is that there will be a &quot;ripple&quot; effect
           of program benefits from intervention participants to the AD or retired military
           personnel they live with; specifically, overweight and obese AD or retired military
           personnel will lose more weight if their partner is randomized to the HWL intervention
           compared to the CBP intervention, because the weight loss of AD or retired military
           personnel indirectly exposed to the intervention will be proportional to the weight loss
           of their adult dependent who is directly exposed.

        4. Compare the effects of the two interventions on changes in cardiometabolic risk factors.
           The working hypothesis is that there will be significantly greater improvements between
           baseline and 1 year in key cardiometabolic risk factors in adult dependents enrolled in
           the HWL intervention compared to the CBP intervention, and differences between groups
           will be predicted by differences in weight loss. For a select subgroup of participants
           who reach the 18-24 month timepoint on or prior to December 2018, the working hypothesis
           is that there will be significantly greater improvements in between baseline and 2 years
           in key cardiometabolic risk factors in adult dependents enrolled in the HWL compared to
           the CBP intervention.

    <description>The 7-Day Stanford Physical Activity Recall estimates an individual's time spent in sleep and physical activity for the 7 days prior to the interview. Energy expenditure based on time spent in sleep and physical activities can be estimated. Sub-scores of energy expenditure for each of the following activities are calculated, summed, and averaged to estimate energy expenditure as kilocalories per day: sleep, moderate physical activity, hard physical activity, and very hard physical activity. Higher scores indicate greater physical activity per day. Metabolic equivalent (MET) value for each activity is provided: 1 MET for sleep, 4 METs for moderate activity, 6 METs for hard activity, and 10 METs for very hard activity. Time spent in each activity over 7 days is multiplied by the appropriate MET value. Plausible minimum and maximum values are not provided.</description>

    <measure>quality of life as measured by the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, Short Form (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 12 months - 18/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 measures eight aspects of health: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. Perceived change in health is also assessed. Each of the subscales (8 aspects of health and perceived change) has a score range of 0 - 100. The composite score also has a score range of 0 - 100. Higher scores indicate more favorable health states. Each item is on a Likert scale, which is either 3 points (1 - 3) or 5 points (1 - 5). The protocol provides a transformed score for response to each item, and the transformed scores of the 9 subscales are averaged to derive a composite score between 0 and 100.</description>

    <measure>Duke Social Support and Stress Scale (DUSOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 12 months - 18/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DUSOCS measures perceived levels of social support and stress experienced from family and non-family social ties. There are six subscales: Family Support, Non-Family Support, Social Support (composite of Family and Non-Family Support), Family Stress, Non-Family Stress, and Social Stress (composite of Family and Non-Family Stress). The score range is 0 - 100 for each subscale. Higher scores on the Support and Stress scales indicate higher levels of perceived social support and stress, respectively. For each subscale, responses are summed up as raw scores. The raw scores are divided by the appropriate factors and multiplied by 100, resulting in a scaled score between 0 and 100. Calculation for Social Support involves summing up items related to Family Support and Non-Family Support and hence provides a composite score for the two sources of social support. Similarly, calculation for Social Stress involves summing up items related to Family Stress and Non-Family Stress.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 12 months - 18/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS measures how different situations can affect emotions and perceived stress. The score range is 0 - 40. Higher scores indicate higher levels of perceived stress. There are 10 items, each of which is on a 5-point Likert scale (0 - 4). Four of the items require reverse coding. The score is determined by summing up responses to the 10 items.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 12 months - 18/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI measures sleep quality and disturbance over the course of one month. There are seven subscales: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, 4. habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The scoring range of each subscale is 0 - 3. The scoring range of the Global PSQI (the composite score of the seven subscales) is 0 - 21. For both the subscales and Global PSQI, higher scores indicate greater difficulties with sleeping. Subscales 1, 3, and 6 each consist of only one item, and no scoring calculations are applied. Subscales 2, 5, and 7 have multiple items that are summed up as raw scores, and the protocol provides the corresponding transformed scores. Subscale 4 calculates habitual sleep efficiency (Number of hours slept/Number of hours spent in bed x 100%) and assigns a transformed score. Global PSQI is the sum of the seven transformed scores.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline to 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 12 months - 18/24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF measures four domains of health: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Each measured domain has a score range of 0 - 100. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life with respect to each domain of health. There are 26 items, 24 of which are used for calculations (7 items for physical health, 6 items for psychological health, 3 items for social relationships, and 8 items for environment). Each item is on a 5-point Likert scale (1 - 5), and three negatively phrased items require reverse coding. The point values are summed up as raw scores, and the protocol provides the transformed score for each raw score.</description>

    <description>HWL is a behavioral intervention designed to effectively facilitate hunger suppression with several concurrent approaches. Hunger suppression is a core behavioral goal of the intervention, and strategies will be used to support that goal, for example increasing meal frequency and encouraging the use of highly satiating low-energy foods to reduce hunger acutely. A unique combination of healthy dietary goals will be recommended that support hunger suppression and/or maintenance of satiety: high total dietary fiber, moderately high protein, moderately low glycemic load (GL) and low energy density.</description>
