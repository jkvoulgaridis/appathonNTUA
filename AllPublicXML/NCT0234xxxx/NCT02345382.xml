    <measure>Number of Subjects With Leukemia Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first subject until 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Bone marrow aspirates / biopsies / peripheral whole blood were taken and assessed for leukemia response evaluation. Assessment of response was made based on the revised recommendations of the International Working Group (Cheson 2003 criteria). Criteria proposed by Cheson 2003 for leukemia: complete remission (CR), morphological CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), no response / treatment failure, relapse from CR, CRi, or PR.</description>

    <time_frame>From start of study drug administration up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug administration (approximately 2.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in subject who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs that started or worsened after first administration of study medication up to 30 days after end of treatment with study medication were considered to be treatment emergent (TE). A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly and another medical important serious event as judged by investigator. SAEs that started or worsened after study drug treatment were recorded as TESAEs.</description>
