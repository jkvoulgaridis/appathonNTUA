    <textblock>
      CC5013-MM024 is a multicenter, open-label, Extended Access Program (EAP) of lenalidomide plus
      low dose dexamethasone regimen in Chinese subjects with relapsed or refractory MM who
      participated in Study CC-5013-MM-021. For subjects who remained progression free under Rd
      treatment of Study CC-5013-MM-02 1, this LAP offers the option to continue lenalidomide
      treatment for subjects who have shown therapeutic benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After subjects who are still on treatment have completed at least 1 year of therapy in Study
      CC-5013-MM-021 (from the start date of lenalidomide treatment), the EAP will allow consented
      subjects who (1) have remained progression free under Rd treatment in Study CC-SO I3-MM-02 I
      to roll over to the Treatment Phase of the LAP to continue Rd treatment, and (2) have
      discontinued Rd therapy and are currently in the Long-Term Follow-up Phase in Study
      CC-5013-MM-021 to roll over to the Safety Follow-up Phase of the EAP for survival and SPM
      outcomes. The maximum duration of this LAP program is at least 5 years from the time the last
      on-study

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the electronic case report form (eCRF) rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. An overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE, or abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an AE. If an overdose is associated with an AE, the overdose and adverse event should be reported as separate terms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who discontinued treatment but remained for long-term follow-up in the
        CC-5013-MM-021 study are required to sign an informed consent document (ICD) to roll over
        to the Safety Follow-up Phase of the Extended Access Program (EAP). These subjects do not
        require screening for eligibility but must agree to be followed for survival and Second
        Primary Malignancy (SPM) at a minimum of every 4 months (Â± 7 days) intervals for at least 5
        years from the time the last on-study subject enrolled in Study CC-5013-MM-021.

        Subjects who are consented for the Treatment Phase of the EAP must meet the following
        criteria to continue the same therapy as they received in the Study CC-5013-MM-021:

          1. Completed at least 1year of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) treatment
             and remained progression free under Rd treatment in Study CC-5013-MM-021 at the time
             of screening visit of this EAP.

          2. Able to adhere study visit schedule, compliance with study drug and other protocol
             requirements in Study CC-5013-MM-024.

          3. Consented to the EAP protocol.

          4. Must agree to comply with all Pregnancy Prevention requirements.

          5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)1:

               -  Must agree to use, and be able to comply with, at least 2 forms of reliable
                  contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual
                  intercourse without interruption, from transferring/rolling over from the
                  CC-5013-MM-021 study, at the screening visit for eligibility, throughout study
                  drug therapy (including dose interruptions) and for 28 days after the end of
                  study drug therapy, even if she has amenorrhea. This applies even if the subject
                  practices complete and continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis.

               -  Must agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum
                  sensitivity of 25 IU/mL (i.e., negative pregnancy test) at screening for
                  eligibility and then every 28 days while on study. For any FCBP, pregnancy
                  testing must continue at the same frequency as during the MM-021 study. If
                  regular or no menstrual cycles, she must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing
                  during the course of the study (every 28 days), during dose interruptions, at
                  study discontinuation and 28 days following study drug discontinuation. If
                  menstrual cycles are irregular, pregnancy testing must occur every 14 days while
                  on study, at study discontinuation and at 14 and 28 days following study drug
                  discontinuation. This requirement also applies to females of childbearing
                  potential who practice complete and continued sexual abstinence.

               -  Must agree not to breastfeed during study drug therapy and for at least 28 days
                  following study drug discontinuation.

          6. Male subjects:

               -  Must agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a FCBP, even if they have
                  had a vasectomy, throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption and
                  at least 28 days following study drug discontinuation.

               -  Must agree to not donate semen or sperm during study drug therapy and for at
                  least 28 days following study drug discontinuation.

        Subjects who have a positive finding of pregnancy testing at screening will not be eligible
        for the Treatment Phase of the EAP but will be consented for the Safety Follow-up Phase in
        the EAP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will not continue treatment at the discretion of the physician if any of the
             following criteria occurred during treatment in the CC-5013-MM-021 study or during the
             Screening Phase.

        All subjects that are not eligible to continue treatment will enter the Safety Follow-up
        Phase:

          1. Serious hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to lenalidomide or dexamethasone.

          2. Serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would
             prevent the subject from signing the informed consent document.

          3. Any other condition, including the presence of serious laboratory abnormalities, which
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Previously discontinued lenalidomide treatment due to toxicity.

          5. Newly diagnosed malignancy other than Multiple Myeloma (MM), except the following:

               -  Basal cell carcinoma of the skin

               -  Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

               -  Carcinoma in situ of the cervix

               -  Carcinoma in situ of the breast

               -  Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (T1a or T1b using the tumor,
                  nodes, metastasis [TNM] clinical staging system) or prostate cancer that is
                  curative
