  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIIa, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group multicenter
      study evaluating once daily FF/UMEC/VI (100 microgram [mcg]/62.5 mcg/25 mcg) inhalation
      powder versus twice daily budesonide/formoterol (400 mcg/12 mcg). The primary purpose of this
      study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function and health status for subjects treated
      with FF/UMEC/VI compared with budesonide/formoterol for 24 weeks. Once-daily 'closed' triple
      therapy of a Inhaled Corticosteroid/ Long-acting Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists/ Long Acting
      Beta-Agonist (ICS/LAMA/LABA) combination FF/UMEC/VI (100 mcg/62.5 mcg/25 mcg) in a single
      device is being developed with the aim of providing a new treatment option for the management
      of advanced (GOLD Group D) COPD which will reduce the exacerbation frequency, allow for a
      reduced burden of polypharmacy, convenience, and increase the potential for improvement in
      lung function, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and symptom control over established
      dual/monotherapies.

      Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria and who have successfully completed all
      protocol procedures at the Screening Visit will enter the two-week run-in period. Following
      the run-in period, eligible subjects will be randomised (1:1) to one of the following
      double-blind treatment groups: FF/UMEC/VI 100 mcg/62.5 mcg/25 mcg via the ELLIPTA™ dry powder
      inhaler (DPI) once daily in the morning and placebo via reservoir inhaler twice daily OR
      Budesonide/formoterol 400 mcg/12 mcg via reservoir inhaler twice daily and placebo via the
      ELLIPTA DPI once daily in the morning.

      The target enrollment is 1800 randomised subjects at approximately 200 study centers
      globally. The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 27 weeks,
      consisting of a 2-week run-in period, 24-week treatment period and a 1-week follow-up period.
      Subjects will run-in on their existing COPD medications for 2 weeks and in addition will be
      provided with short acting albuterol/salbutamol to be used on an as-needed basis (rescue
      medication) throughout the study. Subjects will discontinue all existing COPD medications
      during the randomised treatment period but may continue their study supplied rescue
      albuterol/salbutamol. A sub-set of approximately 400 subjects will remain on blinded study
      treatment for up to a total of 52 weeks to provide additional long term safety data.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 at Week 24 was defined as the FEV1 values obtained prior to morning dose of the study treatment. Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose (0 minutes) on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the pre-dose measurement at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) method including covariates of treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, visit, baseline, baseline by visit and treatment by visit interactions. ITT Population comprised of all randomized subjects excluding those who were randomized in error. Only participants with analyzable data at the given time point were analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD; SGRQ) Total Score for COPD Participants at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ-C is a disease-specific questionnaire designed to measure the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on a COPD participant's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SGRQ-C total score was converted to SGRQ total score (ranging from 0-100) according to manual. In addition to an overall summary (total) score, scores for the individual domains of Symptoms, Activity, and Impacts (each ranging from 0-100) are produced. A decrease in score indicated improvement in quality of life. The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for this instrument is a 4-point improvement (decrease from Baseline). Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as total score at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. The analysis for SGRQ total score was performed using a MMRM method including covariates of treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, visit, baseline, baseline by visit and treatment by visit interactions</description>

    <measure>Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score Expressed as Least Square Mean at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The TDI measures change in the participant's dyspnoea from Baseline. The scores in both indexes depend on ratings for three different categories: functional impairment; magnitude of task; and magnitude of effort. Each of these scales had a possible score ranging from -6 (major deterioration) to +6 (major improvement). TDI focal score was calculated as the sum of the three individual scores and then divided by 2 (so the range of the TDI focal score is -9 to +9). TDI was measured at Week 4 and Week 24. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, visit, BDI focal score, BDI focal score by visit and treatment by visit interactions.</description>

             For this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the
             subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview
             with the subject or from the subject's medical records.; Double barrier method: condom
             and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal

             FEV1 &lt;50% predicted normal OR a post-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt;80% predicted normal and a
             documented history of &gt;=2 moderate exacerbations or one severe (hospitalized)
             exacerbation in the previous 12 months. Subjects must also have a measured post
             albuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;0.70 at screening. Note: Percent predicted

             Initiative reference equations. Note: A documented history of a COPD exacerbation
             (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record of worsening COPD symptoms
             that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (for a moderate
             exacerbation) or hospitalization (for a severe exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics
             alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless the use was associated with
             treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or
             sputum purulence (colour). Subject verbal reports are not acceptable.

          -  Existing COPD maintenance treatment: Subject must be receiving daily maintenance
             treatment for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to Screening. Note: Subjects

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant
             during the study.

          -  Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of
             asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD). Alpha1-antitrypsin
             deficiency: Subjects with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of
             COPD.

          -  Other respiratory disorders: Subjects with active tuberculosis, lung cancer,
             significant bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension,
             interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases.

          -  Lung resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior
             to Screening.

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: immune suppression (e.g. Human immunodeficiency virus
             [HIV], Lupus) or other risk factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders
             affecting control of the upper airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia
             Gravis). Subjects at potentially high risk (e.g. very low Body mass index [BMI],
             severely malnourished, or very low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of
             the investigator.

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening and at least 30 days following the last dose of
             oral/systemic corticosteroids (if applicable). In addition, any subject that
             experiences pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run-in
             period will be excluded.

          -  Respiratory tract infection that has not resolved at least 7 days prior to Screening.

          -  Abnormal Chest X-ray (CXR): Chest X-ray (posteroanterior and lateral) reveals evidence
             of pneumonia or a clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the
             presence of COPD, or another condition that would hinder the ability to detect an
             infiltrate on CXR (e.g. significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All
             subjects will have a CXR at Screening Visit 1) (or historical radiograph or Computed
             Tomography [CT] scan obtained within 3 months prior to screening) that will be
             over-read by a central vendor. Note: Subjects who have experienced pneumonia and/or
             moderate or severe COPD exacerbation within 3 months of screening must provide a post
             pneumonia/exacerbation CXR to be over-read by the central vendor or have a CXR
             conducted at Screening. For sites in Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 3
             months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic
             CXR will need to be obtained from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS).

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. For subjects taking part in the
             physical activity monitor subset: Orthopaedic, neurological or other complaints that
             significantly impair normal biomechanical movement patterns and limit the ability to
             walk/cycle, as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, esophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice,
             cirrhosis, known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones). Note: Chronic stable hepatitis B and C are acceptable if the
             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at
             Screening (Visit 1) would be excluded: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the
             last 6 months; Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention
             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Heart failure

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding:
             Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent
             cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The Principal
             Investigator (PI) will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG
             finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be
             at undue risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant
             finding that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead
             tracing that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following: Atrial
             fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 Beats Per Minute (BPM); sustained
             or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type
             II and third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted);
             QT interval corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;=500 milliseconds
             (msec) in subjects with QRS &lt;120 msec and QTcF &gt;=530 msec in subjects with QRS &gt;=120
             msec.

          -  Contraindications: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid,
             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or
             magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 5 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen
             therapy &gt;3litres/minute (L/min) (Oxygen use &lt;=3L/min flow is not exclusionary.)

          -  Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable to withhold their
             albuterol/salbutamol for the 4-hour period required prior to spirometry testing at
             each study visit.

          -  Pulmonary rehabilitation: Subjects who have participated in the acute phase of a
             Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program within 4 weeks prior to Screening or subjects who
             plan to enter the acute phase of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program during the study.
             Subjects who are in the maintenance phase of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program are
             not excluded.

          -  Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug
             abuse within the last 2 years.

          -  Non-compliance: Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study
             procedures. Any infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit
             compliance for scheduled visits.

          -  Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease,
             intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the
             validity of informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Affiliation with investigator site: study investigators, sub-investigators, study
             coordinators, employees of a participating investigator or study site, or immediate
             family members of the aforementioned that is involved with this study.

          -  Inability to read: In the opinion of the investigator, any subject who is unable to
             read and/or would not be able to complete study related materials.

          -  Medication prior to screening: No use of the following medications within the
             following time intervals prior to Screening or during the study. Long term antibiotic
             therapy: Subjects receiving antibiotics for long term therapy are not eligible for the
             study (Antibiotics are allowed for the short term treatment of an exacerbation or for
             short term treatment of other acute infections); Systemic, Oral, parenteral
             corticosteroids: 30 days (Except during the study oral/systemic corticosteroids may be
             used to treat COPD exacerbations/pneumonia). Intra-articular injections are allowed.
             Any other investigational drug: 30 days or 5 half lives whichever is longer.

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 2121 participants were screened in this study and 1811 were randomized following 2-week run-in. Of those, 1 participant was randomized in error and did not receive randomized treatment. This was followed by a 24-week treatment and 1-week follow-up periods. A sub-set of 430 participants continued in a blinded study treatment for 52 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 24</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 at Week 24 was defined as the FEV1 values obtained prior to morning dose of the study treatment. Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose (0 minutes) on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the pre-dose measurement at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) method including covariates of treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, visit, baseline, baseline by visit and treatment by visit interactions. ITT Population comprised of all randomized subjects excluding those who were randomized in error. Only participants with analyzable data at the given time point were analyzed.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 52</title>
          <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 at Week 52 was defined as the FEV1 values obtained prior to morning dose of the study treatment. Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose (0 minutes) on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the pre-dose measurement at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) method including covariates of treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, visit, baseline, baseline by visit and treatment by visit interactions. Extension Population: all participants in the ITT Population who were enrolled into the subset of participants with extension to 52 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD; SGRQ) Total Score for COPD Participants at Week 24</title>
        <description>The SGRQ-C is a disease-specific questionnaire designed to measure the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on a COPD participant's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SGRQ-C total score was converted to SGRQ total score (ranging from 0-100) according to manual. In addition to an overall summary (total) score, scores for the individual domains of Symptoms, Activity, and Impacts (each ranging from 0-100) are produced. A decrease in score indicated improvement in quality of life. The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for this instrument is a 4-point improvement (decrease from Baseline). Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as total score at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. The analysis for SGRQ total score was performed using a MMRM method including covariates of treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, visit, baseline, baseline by visit and treatment by visit interactions</description>

        <description>The TDI measures change in the participant's dyspnoea from Baseline. The scores in both indexes depend on ratings for three different categories: functional impairment; magnitude of task; and magnitude of effort. Each of these scales had a possible score ranging from -6 (major deterioration) to +6 (major improvement). TDI focal score was calculated as the sum of the three individual scores and then divided by 2 (so the range of the TDI focal score is -9 to +9). TDI was measured at Week 4 and Week 24. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, visit, BDI focal score, BDI focal score by visit and treatment by visit interactions.</description>

          <title>Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score Expressed as Least Square Mean at Week 52</title>
          <description>The TDI measures change in the participant's dyspnoea from Baseline. The scores in both indexes depend on ratings for three different categories: functional impairment; magnitude of task; and magnitude of effort. Each of these scales had a possible score ranging from -6 (major deterioration) to +6 (major improvement). TDI focal score was calculated as the sum of the three individual scores and then divided by 2 (so the range of the TDI focal score is -9 to +9). TDI was measured at Weeks 4, 24 and 52. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, visit, BDI focal score, BDI focal score by visit and treatment by visit interactions</description>

        <description>The mean annual moderate and severe COPD exacerbations during the treatment (trt) period (per participant [par.] per year) was assessed. The event rate for exacerbations was calculated as the number of events x 1000 divided by the total participant exposure during the time-period of interest. An exacerbation of COPD, is defined as the worsening of two or more major symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume, sputum purulence [color]) for at least two consecutive days; or the worsening of any one major symptom together with any one of the minor symptoms (sore throat, cold, fever without other cause, increased cough, increased wheeze) for at least two consecutive days. Analysis performed using a generalised linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution and covariates of treatment group, exacerbation history (0, 1, &gt;=2 moderate/severe), smoking status (screening), geographical region and post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 (day 1).</description>

        <title>Assessment of Respiratory Symptoms by Change From Baseline in 4-weekly Mean Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT)-RS Scores up to Week 24</title>
        <description>The EXACT-PRO is a 14 item instrument designed to capture information on the occurrence, frequency, severity, and duration of exacerbations of disease in participants with COPD. EXACT-RS consists of 11 items from the 14 item EXACT-PRO instrument and has a scoring range of 0-40. Three subscales are used to describe different symptoms; dyspnoea (range 0-17), cough and sputum (range 0-11) and chest symptoms (range 0-12). Baseline was defined as the mean value during the period between Visits 1 and 2. Mean scores were calculated for each four weekly period and change from Baseline was calculated as four weekly score minus the Baseline value. Four weekly intervals were analyzed using a MMRM method with covariates of treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, time period, baseline, baseline by time period and treatment by time period interactions. Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title).</description>

        <title>Assessment of Respiratory Symptoms by Change From Baseline in 4-weekly Mean EXACT-RS Scores up to Week 52</title>
        <description>The EXACT-PRO is a 14 item instrument designed to capture information on the occurrence, frequency, severity, and duration of exacerbations of disease in participants with COPD. EXACT-RS consists of 11 items from the 14 item EXACT-PRO instrument and has a scoring range of 0-40. Three subscales are used to describe different symptoms; dyspnoea (range 0-17), cough and sputum (range 0-11) and chest symptoms (range 0-12). Baseline was defined as the mean value during the period between Visits 1 and 2. Mean scores were calculated for each four weekly period and change from Baseline was calculated as four weekly score minus the Baseline value. Four weekly intervals were analyzed using a MMRM method with covariates of treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, time period, baseline, baseline by time period and treatment by time period interactions. Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title).</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. These included an exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition. A SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; or all events of possible drug-induced liver injury. Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory test results were also recorded as an AE or SAE. COPD exacerbations were an expected disease-related outcome and were not to be recorded as an AE, unless they met the definition of an SAE. Participants were not to be withdrawn from the study due to COPD exacerbations and their evaluation was an efficacy endpoint.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Any On-treatment CV Events (Including Supraventricular Arrhythmia and Non Fatal Myocardial Infarction) in the Extension Part of the Study</title>
          <description>Cardiovascular safety was monitored via AE reporting with categorization and analysis of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) including cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac failure, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and central nervous system hemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions. In addition, ECGs and vital signs were measured in all subjects and24-hour Holter monitoring was performed in a predefined subset. Pre-specified MACE analysis was conducted based on adjudicated CV deaths and investigator-reported non-fatal AEs. Number of participants with any of the following MACE events were to be included per the broad and narrow analyses: Broad MACE criteria (ischemic heart disease standardized MedDRA query [SMQ; myocardial infarction SMQ and other ischemic diseases]) and narrow MACE criteria (myocardial infarction [acute myocardial infarction]</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Heart Rate at Week 24</title>
        <description>A single 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and rhythm strip were recorded after measurement of vital signs and spirometry. Recordings were made at Screening (Visit 1) and approximately 15-45 minutes after dosing on treatment Week 4 and Week 24 or IP Discontinuation Visit. Change from Baseline in ECG heart rate was summarized for each post-Baseline assessment up to Week 24. Change from Baseline was calculated as the individual post-Baseline value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. Baseline value is defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat). All ECG measurements were made with the participants in a supine position having rested in this position for approximately 5 minutes before each reading.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in QTcF and PR Interval at Week 52</title>
          <description>Single 12-lead ECG and rhythm strip were recorded after measurement of vital signs and spirometry. Recordings were made at Screening (Visit 1) and approximately 15-45 minutes after dosing on treatment Week 4, Week 24 and Week 52 or IP Discontinuation Visit. Change from Baseline in ECG QTcF and PR interval was summarized for each post-Baseline assessment up to Week 24. Change from Baseline was calculated as the individual post-Baseline value at Week 52 minus the Baseline value. Baseline value is defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title).</description>

A single set of blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) measurements were collected taken after the participant had rested for 5 minutes in the sitting position. Change from Baseline values for systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) at Week 24 were summarised and these data were analyzed using MMRM analysis. Baseline was defined as the values from most recent assessment prior to randomization which records both systolic and diastolic BP (generally Screening but could be a test repeat).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressures (BP) at Week 52</title>
        <description>Vital signs were obtained at the Screening Visit and prior to taking the morning dose of study treatment and prior to conducting spirometry at Week 4, Week 24, and Week 52 or at the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit. A single set of blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) measurements were taken after the participant had rested for 5 minutes in the sitting position. Change from Baseline values for systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) at Week 52 were summarised and these data were analyzed using MMRM analysis. Baseline was defined as the values from most recent assessment prior to randomization which records both systolic and diastolic BP (generally Screening but could be a test repeat).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Basophils, Eosinophils, Monocytes, Neutrophils, Leukocytes, Lymphocytes, and Platelets at Week 24</title>
        <description>Hematology laboratory assessments included basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, total neutrophil, leukocytes, and platelets; parameters were measured at Baseline (BL), Week 12 and Week 24. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-dose value at Week 24. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a repeat test). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title). The maximum post-Baseline values have also been presented.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Basophils, Eosinophils, Monocytes, Neutrophils, Leukocytes, Lymphocytes, and Platelets at Week 24</title>
          <description>Hematology laboratory assessments included basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, total neutrophil, leukocytes, and platelets; parameters were measured at Baseline (BL), Week 12 and Week 24. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-dose value at Week 24. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a repeat test). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title). The maximum post-Baseline values have also been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Basophils, Eosinophils, Monocytes, Neutrophils, Leukocytes, Lymphocytes, and Platelets at Week 52</title>
        <description>Hematology laboratory assessments included Basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes,neutrophils, total neutrophil, leukocytes, and platelets; parameters were measured at Baseline (BL), Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52 for the extension part of the study. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-dose value at Week 52. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title). The maximum post-Baseline values have also been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Erythrocytes at Week 24</title>
        <description>Hematology laboratory assessments included erythrocytes and was measured at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-dose value at Week 24. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title). The maximum post-Baseline values have also been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematocrit at Week 24</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of hematocrit (proportion of red blood cells in blood) at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title). The maximum post-Baseline values have also been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Albumin and Protein at Week 52</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of albumin and protein at Baseline, Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52 for the extension part of the study. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value at Week 52 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title). The maximum post-Baseline values have also been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and Creatine Kinase at Week 52</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of ALP, ALT, AST, CK, and GGT at Baseline, Week 12, Week 24 and Week 52 for the extension part of the study. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value at Week 52 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title). The maximum post-Baseline values have also been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Glucose, Calcium, Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Chloride, Phosphate, Potassium, Sodium, and Urea at Week 24</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of Glucose, calcium, CO2, chloride, phophate, potassium, sodium, and urea at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title). The maximum post-Baseline values have also been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Glucose, Calcium, CO2, Chloride, Magnesium, Phosphate, Potassium, Sodium, and Urea at Week 52</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of Glucose, calcium, CO2, chloride, magnesium, phophate, potassium, sodium, and urea at Baseline, Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52 for the extension part of the study. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value at Week 52 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title). The maximum post-Baseline values have also been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bilirubin, Creatinine, and Urate at Week 24</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of bilirubin, creatinine, and urate at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat). Only participants with data available at the analysis time point were analyzed (represented as n=X, X in category title). The maximum post-Baseline values have also been presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of bilirubin, creatinine, and urate at Baseline, Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52 of the extension part of the study. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value at Week 52 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as the most recent individual value prior to randomization (generally Screening but could be a test repeat).</description>
