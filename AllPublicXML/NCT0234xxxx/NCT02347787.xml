  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of community
      health worker (CHW) vs. usual clinician support in helping chronically-ill patients with low
      socioeconomic status to improve their health outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community Health Workers (CHWs) have the potential to improve chronic disease outcomes among
      patients with low socioeconomic status (SES). Yet, widespread use of CHWs has been hampered
      by lack of standardized, scalable and evidence-based models. Our community-academic-health
      system team used participatory action research with low-SES patients to design IMPaCT
      (Individualized Management for Patient-Centered Targets). A randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      of 446 hospitalized patients with varied diseases demonstrated that a 2-week dose of IMPaCT
      improved access to care, mental health, activation, and quality of communication, while
      reducing recurrent hospital readmissions. We have adapted IMPaCT for use among low-SES
      primary care patients with multiple chronic conditions.

      This RCT is designed to evaluate the newly adapted IMPaCT model in 3 primary care settings -
      academic, federally qualified health center, and VA. Upon enrollment in the trial, patients
      will collaboratively set a chronic disease management goal with their primary care provider.
      Patients will then be randomized to collaborative goal-setting versus goal-setting augmented
      by 6 months of support from an IMPaCT CHW. Follow-up will be conducted at 6- and 9- months
      post-enrollment.

      The study design is a single-blinded, 2- armed, multi-site randomized controlled trial
      involving three clinic sites and 444 patients.

    <measure>Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) Physical Component Score (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The main dependent variable is mean change in standardized score for SF-12 PCS. The SF-12 is a survey designed for use with patients with multiple chronic conditions. This 12-item scale can be used to assess the physical and mental health of respondents. 10 of the 12 questions are answered on a 5 point likert scale and 2 are answered on a 3 point likert scale. The questions are then scored and weighted into 2 subscales, physical health and mental health. Respondents can have a score that ranges from 0-100 with 100 being the best score and indicating high physical or mental health. A 3 point change in SF-12 score reflects a meaningful difference. We measure the between-arm difference in mean change in SF-12 PCS between baseline and 6-month follow-up assessment.</description>

    <measure>Qualitative Assessment of Intervention and Mechanisms Affecting Achievement of Primary Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>At 6-months post-enrollment, a trained qualitative interviewer on our study team will conduct an in-depth qualitative semi-structured interview with 40 intervention arm patients and their CHWs. Qualitative interviews will be audio-taped and transcribed. Patients will be purposively sampled across each study site in order to be able to make comparisons between those who achieved a minimally important improvement in the primary outcome and those who did not. These interviews will be guided by the Integrative Behavior Model (IBM). UPDATE: After beginning interviews, our team decided that 26 interviews was sufficient to reach thematic saturation.</description>

          <description>Prior to randomization, patients in this arm will already have set a chronic disease management goal with their primary care provider (who will have received training in collaborative goal-setting). After randomization, patients in the CHW arm will receive the IMPaCT intervention.
IMPaCT: The IMPaCT intervention has three stages:
Goal-setting: CHWs will help patients to deconstruct the chronic disease management goal they set with their PCP into patient-driven short-term goals and action plans.
Tailored Support: CHWs will conduct weekly follow-up for 6 months through either telephone or home visit in order to support the achievement of patients’ short-term goals.
Connection with longitudinal support: IMPaCT CHWs will also facilitate a weekly patient support group.</description>

          <description>This scale asks 8 questions relating to a person's passion and perseverance. Each question is graded on a five point likert scale where respondents rate statements as being somewhere from 'Not like me at all' to 'Very much like me'. Scores from each of the 8 questions are averaged for a total grit score with 5 being high grit (high passion/perseverance) and 1 being low grit.</description>

For each question, the participant is asked to rate a statement on a scale of 1-6 (Strongly agree, agree, slightly agree, slightly disagree, disagree, strongly disagree). Scores are then averaged to get a final score between 1 and 6.
Some of the questions can be combined to create subscores for avoidance and anxiety. Higher scores on these dimensions reflect greater avoidance or anxiety. Greater attachment security is defined by lower scores on both scales.</description>

          <description>The SF-12 is a survey designed for use with patients with multiple chronic conditions. This 12-item scale can be used to assess the physical and mental health of respondents. 10 of the 12 questions are answered on a 5 point likert scale and 2 are answered on a 3 point likert scale. The questions are then scored and weighted into 2 subscales, physical health and mental health. Respondents can have a score that ranges from 0-100 with 100 being the best score and indicating high physical or mental health. A 3 point change in SF-12 score reflects a meaningful difference.</description>

          <description>The PAM is a 13-item survey that assesses a person’s underlying knowledge, skills, and confidence integral to managing his or her own health and healthcare. Respondents are asked to strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree with each statement. Responses are then scored into a 100 point scale where higher scores indicate increased patient activation (higher knowledge, skills, and confidence for managing their own health/healthcare).</description>

          <description>The PSS measures how much stress a person attributes to various situations in their life. While the PSS is a 10 point scale, a short form of 4 questions was used for this study. Each question on the scale is rated from Never (0) to Very Often (4). Scores are then summed. For the 4 question short form there is a range of scores between 0 and 16 with 16 being the highest level of stress and 0 being no stress.</description>

          <title>Single Item Literacy Screener (SILS)</title>
          <description>This single item screener assesses how much assistance respondents need in reading health-related materials. This is scored as a 5 point likert scale with a range of 1 - 5. A lower score on this scale indicates high health literacy (never or rarely needing assistance reading health-related materials). A higher score indicates low health literacy (often or always needing assistance reading health-related materials).</description>

        <title>Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) Physical Component Score (PCS)</title>
        <description>The main dependent variable is mean change in standardized score for SF-12 PCS. The SF-12 is a survey designed for use with patients with multiple chronic conditions. This 12-item scale can be used to assess the physical and mental health of respondents. 10 of the 12 questions are answered on a 5 point likert scale and 2 are answered on a 3 point likert scale. The questions are then scored and weighted into 2 subscales, physical health and mental health. Respondents can have a score that ranges from 0-100 with 100 being the best score and indicating high physical or mental health. A 3 point change in SF-12 score reflects a meaningful difference. We measure the between-arm difference in mean change in SF-12 PCS between baseline and 6-month follow-up assessment.</description>

        <title>Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) - Mental Component Summary (MCS)</title>
        <description>The SF-12 is a survey designed for use with patients with multiple chronic conditions. This 12-item scale can be used to assess the physical and mental health of respondents. 10 of the 12 questions are answered on a 5 point likert scale and 2 are answered on a 3 point likert scale. The questions are then scored and weighted into 2 subscales, physical health and mental health. Respondents can have a score that ranges from 0-100 with 100 being the best score and indicating high physical or mental health. A 3 point change in SF-12 score reflects a meaningful difference. We will assess this outcome using the SF-12 Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. The MCS reliably detects differences in mental health over time. We will measure the between-arm difference in mean change in SF-12 MCS score between baseline, 6- and 9- month follow-up.</description>

Goal-setting: CHWs will help patients to deconstruct the chronic disease management goal they set with their PCP into patient-driven short-term goals and action plans.
Tailored Support: CHWs will conduct weekly follow-up for 6 months through either telephone or home visit in order to support the achievement of patients’ short-term goals.
Connection with longitudinal support: IMPaCT CHWs will also facilitate a weekly patient support group.</description>

          <title>Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) - Mental Component Summary (MCS)</title>
          <description>The SF-12 is a survey designed for use with patients with multiple chronic conditions. This 12-item scale can be used to assess the physical and mental health of respondents. 10 of the 12 questions are answered on a 5 point likert scale and 2 are answered on a 3 point likert scale. The questions are then scored and weighted into 2 subscales, physical health and mental health. Respondents can have a score that ranges from 0-100 with 100 being the best score and indicating high physical or mental health. A 3 point change in SF-12 score reflects a meaningful difference. We will assess this outcome using the SF-12 Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. The MCS reliably detects differences in mental health over time. We will measure the between-arm difference in mean change in SF-12 MCS score between baseline, 6- and 9- month follow-up.</description>

            <description>Prior to randomization, patients in this arm will already have set a chronic disease management goal with their primary care provider (who will have received training in collaborative goal-setting). After randomization, patients in the CHW arm will receive the IMPaCT intervention.
IMPaCT: The IMPaCT intervention has three stages:
Goal-setting: CHWs will help patients to deconstruct the chronic disease management goal they set with their PCP into patient-driven short-term goals and action plans.
Tailored Support: CHWs will conduct weekly follow-up for 6 months through either telephone or home visit in order to support the achievement of patients’ short-term goals.

          <description>We will assess this outcome using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Patient-Centered Medical Home (CAHPS PCMH) survey. This survey assesses the quality of patient-centered primary care and can be used by any practice (not just PCMH practices). We will measure the CAHPS PCMH domains pertaining to Self-Management Support and Comprehensiveness of Care. We will measure the number of patients who gave the highest rating of care for the supportiveness of disease self-management question at 6 and 9 months post-enrollment.</description>

            <description>Prior to randomization, patients in this arm will already have set a chronic disease management goal with their primary care provider (who will have received training in collaborative goal-setting). After randomization, patients in the CHW arm will receive the IMPaCT intervention.
IMPaCT: The IMPaCT intervention has three stages:
Goal-setting: CHWs will help patients to deconstruct the chronic disease management goal they set with their PCP into patient-driven short-term goals and action plans.
Tailored Support: CHWs will conduct weekly follow-up for 6 months through either telephone or home visit in order to support the achievement of patients’ short-term goals.
Connection with longitudinal support: IMPaCT CHWs will also facilitate a weekly patient support group.</description>
