      This study will enroll people with SCI who have spasticity and some ability to walk. The goal
      is to understand if standing on a platform and receiving WBV results in decreased spasticity
      and improved walking ability. Published article is available (PMID: 29959653)

      Phase 1 of this study has been successfully completed. The results of Phase 1 indicate that a
      single session of WBV lasting for a total of 6 minutes (delivered in eight 45-sec bouts) at a
      high-frequency (50Hz) was associated with the largest decrease in spasticity (as measured by
      the pendulum test). The goal for Phase 2 is to determine whether longer doses of WBV result
      in greater reductions in spasticity as well as improvements in walking ability. Two different
      doses of WBV, a short dose and a long dose, will be tested.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: have spinal cord injury of at least 6 months duration; be between the
        ages of 16 - 72 years old; be able to sit at the edge of the mat without the assistance of
        another person; be able to tolerate standing; have at least mild spasticity affecting the
        lower extremity muscles; be able to understand and provide own consent; you may participate
        if you use prescription medications, including baclofen pump for control of spasticity, as
        the dosage is stable; obtain medical clearance for standing if you have been injured more
        than 1 year and are not regularly walking or standing.

        Exclusion Criteria: progressive or potentially progressive spinal lesions, including
        degenerative, or progressive vascular disorders of the spine and/or spinal cord; neurologic
        level below spinal level T12; history of cardiovascular irregularities; problems following
        instructions; orthopedic problems that would limit your participation in the protocol (e.g.
        knee or hip flexion contractures of greater than 10 degrees)
