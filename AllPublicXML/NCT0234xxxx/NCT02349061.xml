    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab as measured by a
      reduction in disease activity for subjects with active Active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
      (SLE - chronic disorder of connective tissue in which there can be skin rash, arthritis,
      kidney problems, and anemia, among other problems).

      A multicenter (more than one medical research center involved in study), randomized (study
      drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the Investigator nor the participant know
      about the study drug), placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study of ustekinumab in
      participants with active systemic lupus erythematosus. Participants will be screened to
      achieve all inclusion criteria and none exclusion criteria and will then receive either
      ustekinumab or placebo along with concomitant background medicine. Participants will be
      primarily assessed for response using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Response Index 2000
      (SRI-4). Participants' safety will be assessed throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI-4) Composite Response (CR) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SRI-4 response was defined as greater than or equal to 4-point reduction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) total score, no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A and no more than 1 new BILAG B domain score and no worsening (less than 10 percent increase) from baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA). Composite response is defined as SRI-4 response in participants who do not meet treatment failure criteria. SLEDAI-2K assessment consists of 24 items with total score of 0 to 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity. BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system: A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected. The PGA assess disease activity on a visual analogue scale = from very well (0)-very poor (10).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI 2K) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SLEDAI-2K is an established, validated SLE activity index. It is based on the presence of 24 features in 9 organ systems and measures disease activity in SLE patients in the previous 30 days. It is weighted according to the feature. Features are scored by the assessing physician if present within the last 30 days with more severe features having higher scores, and then simply added to determine the total SLEDAI 2K score, which ranges from 0 to 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PGA was recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0.0 to 10.0 centimeter [cm]). The scale for the physician's assessment ranges for 'no lupus activity' (0.0) to 'extremely active lupus' (10.0).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With BILAG-based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>BICLA response defined as participants meeting following criteria: 1. BILAG improvement (all BILAG A scores at baseline improved to either B, C or D and all BILAG B scores at baseline improved to C or D and no worsening in disease activity defined as no new BILAG A scores and &lt;= 1 new BILAG B score) and 2. no worsening of total SLEDAI-2K from baseline 3. &lt; 1 cm increase in PGA and 4. no treatment failure criteria met. BILAG: assesses disease extent, severity (range: A [severe] to E [no disease]). SLEDAI-2K: assesses improvement in disease activity (range: 0 to 105; higher score = higher severity). PGA: assesses worsening in participant's general health status (0.0= 'no lupus activity' to 10.0 = 'extremely active lupus').</description>

        <description>SRI-4 response was defined as greater than or equal to 4-point reduction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) total score, no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A and no more than 1 new BILAG B domain score and no worsening (less than 10 percent increase) from baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA). Composite response is defined as SRI-4 response in participants who do not meet treatment failure criteria. SLEDAI-2K assessment consists of 24 items with total score of 0 to 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity. BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system: A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected. The PGA assess disease activity on a visual analogue scale = from very well (0)-very poor (10).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI 2K) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The SLEDAI-2K is an established, validated SLE activity index. It is based on the presence of 24 features in 9 organ systems and measures disease activity in SLE patients in the previous 30 days. It is weighted according to the feature. Features are scored by the assessing physician if present within the last 30 days with more severe features having higher scores, and then simply added to determine the total SLEDAI 2K score, which ranges from 0 to 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.</description>

        <population>FAS included all the randomized participants who received at least 1 dose (partial or complete, IV or SC) of ustekinumab or placebo. Here, ‘N’ (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>
