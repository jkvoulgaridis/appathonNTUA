      This Phase 1 clinical study is designed to examine the safety and feasibility of using
      anti-CD3/CD28 activated marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) as treatment of relapse after
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for patients with hematologic
      malignancies with bone marrow involvement of their relapsed disease. These MILs will be
      derived from the bone marrow of the relapsed patient who had previously received
      post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis
      (PTCy-MILs). A bone marrow aspiration will be performed on the patient to collect ~200ml of
      marrow for ex vivo expansion. During this expansion process, T cells will be activated and
      expanded by co-stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies covalently attached
      to super-paramagnetic microbeads. Patients will be treated with salvage therapy while this ex
      vivo expansion is ongoing. After the simultaneous salvage therapy and ex vivo expansion, the
      activated PTCy-MILs will be reinfused. Patients will be monitored with the primary objective
      being the feasibility of expanding to targeted dose levels activated PTCy-MILs that do not
      cause grade III-IV acute GVHD within the first 90 days after PTCy-MIL infusion.

      Primary Objectives:

        1. Feasibility of generating activated PTCy-MILs in patients with relapsed disease
           involving the bone marrow.

        2. Toxicity of PTCy-MILs, specifically the rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD within the first
           90 days after PTCy-MIL infusion.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Determination of an optimal safe dose for PTCy-MILs.

        2. Immunologic characterization of the PTCy-MIL product before and after expansion.

        3. Immune reconstitution after treatment with PTCy-MILs.

        4. Incidence and severity of chronic GVHD.

        5. Clinical responses (complete remissions, partial remissions, stable disease) as measured
           by criteria specific for the particular disease type.

        6. Progression-free and overall survival.

    <description>Feasibility is measured as the number of participants who achieve: 1) The successful obtaining of PTCy-MILs; 2) The expansion of PTCy-MILs to at least 70% of the assigned dose level; 3) Successful infusion of PTCy-MILs; 4) The absence of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) for 90 days after PTCy-MILs infusion. Acute GVHD is defined by the Modified Keystone Criteria.</description>
