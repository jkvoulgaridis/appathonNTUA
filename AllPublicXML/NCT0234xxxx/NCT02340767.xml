  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine whether clinicians who use a diagnostic device treat suspicious
      occlusal carious lesions (SOCL) surgically more often, with the same frequency, or less
      frequently, than dentists not relying on a diagnostic device. The study will also determine
      -- among those SOCLs that are opened -- whether the proportion of lesions that extend into
      the dentin when dentists are using a diagnostic device is more than, the same, or less than
      when no device is used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of this study is to assess the contributions of diagnostic devices in
      clinicians' decision-making processes surrounding suspicious occlusal carious lesions (SOCL),
      an assessment that has not yet been attempted, despite the growing popularity of these
      devices. SOCLs can be defined as occlusal surface areas where visual, tactile, and
      radiographic signs are insufficient to definitively diagnose caries but where some of these
      signs are present.This study examines the use of two diagnostic devices on dental
      practitioners' identification and treatment of SOCLs.

      During a four-week pre-intervention period, 90 clinicians will collect and record descriptive
      and treatment information for the SOCLs they identify. Clinicians will then be randomized
      into one of 3 study arms: no diagnostic device, DIAGNOdent®, and Spectra®, and will collect
      and record similar information as the pre-intervention period for another six weeks,
      enrolling an additional 20 SOCLs. They will also complete diagnostic vignettes at the
      beginning and end of the study, as well as a post-study questionnaire on the utility of the
      devices, if assigned to a device arm. Analyses will examine differences in proportion of
      SOCLs treated surgically in the groups with and without the diagnostic device; and, for those
      treated surgically, differences in the proportions of SOCLs with extension into dentin.
      Differences in pre- and post-study responses on the vignettes will suggest which components
      of the decision-making process involved in SOCL identification and management have been
      modified by use of the diagnostic devices.

        <description>Clinicians' likelihood of treating surgical lesions depicted with brown verses black, smooth verses rough, shiny verses matte, in patients with high verses low caries risk, by post-intervention phases.

        <title>Number of Clinicians in Likelihood of Surgically Treating Lesions in Online Vignettes That Display Two Levels of Four Cues (Color, Surface Smoothness, Surface Luster, and Caries Risk) in Pre-intervention</title>
        <description>Clinicians' likelihood of treating surgical lesions depicted with brown verses black, smooth verses rough, shiny verses matte, in patients with high verses low caries risk, by post-intervention phases. The outcome measure will be to see what cues were used or treatment decisions in the pre-intervention phase. Please note that more than one cue could be chosen, so values may add to more than 100 percent of participants.</description>
