      This phase I clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety of autologous Mesenchymal Stem
      Cells (MSC) injected intracavernously.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cellgram-ED is autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ex vivo expanded for
      approximately 30 days. Ten patients (Diabetes -associated ED; 5 patients, Postprostatectomy;
      5patients) will be injected Cellgram-ED directly into the intracavernous. Patient will be
      evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of MSC.

    <description>Analyze the laboratory, vital sign, physical exam results from baseline to end of the study for investigate adverse reactions and view safety.
An SAE suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side-effect, or precaution. With respect to human clinical experience, this includes any event that:
Results in death. Is life-threatening.* Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Other medically important condition
Life-threatening in the definition of a SAE or adverse reaction refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.</description>

    <measure>Penile Doppler Sonography, PDS</measure>
    <time_frame>month 6, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change From Baseline in Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and End diastolic velocity (EDV), Evaluate Erection rigidity During the test.
The normal maximum systolic blood flow of the cavernosal artery after injection of vasodilators is 30 cm / s or more.
PDS results are obtained 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min and 30 min after intracavernosal injection.
The peak systolic velocity (PSV) is assessed as follows:
&gt;25 cm/s is considered to be normal, 20-25 cm/s is considered to be mild ED, 12-20 cm/s is considered to be moderate ED, &lt;12 cm/s is considered to be severe arteriogenic impotence.
The end diastolic velocity (EDV) is assessed as follows:
5 cm/s is considered to be a normal value, &gt;5 cm/s is considered to indicate a veno-occlusive disorder.</description>
