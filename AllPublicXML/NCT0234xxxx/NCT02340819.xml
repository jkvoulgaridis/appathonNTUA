  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an investigational
      treatment (teduglutide) in Japanese patients with PN-dependent SBS. This study will also look
      at how teduglutide moves through the body (pharmacokinetics).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        This study has 3 stages, consisting of an optimization/stabilization period (Stage 1), a
        24-week treatment period in which all patients will receive teduglutide (Stage 2), and a
        long-term extension (Stage 3).

        During the long-term extension (Stage 3), patients will continue to receive teduglutide for
        up to an additional 24 months or until teduglutide is commercially available, whichever
        comes earlier.
