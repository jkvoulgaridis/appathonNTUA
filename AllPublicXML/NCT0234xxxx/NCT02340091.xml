  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HA IDF plus (with
      lidocaine) injected in the nasolabial fold compared to HA IDF (without lidocaine).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to confirm the superiority of HA IDF II plus (with lidocaine)
      injected in the nasolabial fold compared to HA IDF II (without lidocaine) in the improvement
      of local pain and evaluate the wrinkle-correcting effect, GAI and safety.
