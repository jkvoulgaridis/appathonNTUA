      The study is designed as a three arm randomized Phase III, multicenter trial comparing two
      calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free strategies for Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) prophylaxis
      to standard tacrolimus and methotrexate (Tac/Mtx) in patients with hematologic malignancies
      undergoing myeloablative conditioning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a complication that affects many hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors; it occurs when the new cells from a transplant attack
      the recipient's body. The current standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen for patients with
      hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT involves a combination of immunosuppressive agents
      given for the first 6 months after transplant. Often, patients develop GVHD and continue on
      these agents for much longer periods. The combination of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus
      and cyclosporine A) with methotrexate (MTX) is the most common GVHD prophylaxis used
      worldwide in the context of myeloablative conditioning transplants. This regimen demonstrates
      better control of acute GVHD, but is less effective against chronic GVHD. Management of
      chronic GVHD remains a challenge and it has become a significant health problem in transplant
      survivors with more frequent use of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Additionally,
      several issues arise with the standard approach including various toxicity symptoms and side
      effects, increased risk of thrombotic microangiopathy due to CNI, no prevention of other
      infectious diseases, and no prevention for disease relapse.

      This standard strategy of Tac/MTX will be used as a control in comparison to two other
      treatment plans both utilizing CNI-free methods: CD34 selected T-cell depletion in peripheral
      blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts, and infusion of bone marrow (BM) grafts followed by
      post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Study participants will be randomized to one of
      these three treatment arms.

Subsequent dosing will be based on blood levels, with a target of 5-15 ng/ml. If patients are on medications which alter the metabolism of tacrolimus (e.g. azoles), the initial starting dose and subsequent doses should be altered as per institutional practices. Tacrolimus taper can be initiated at a minimum of 90 days post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD. The rate of tapering will be done according institutional practices but patients should be off tacrolimus by Day 180 post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD.</description>

The Day +1 dose of methotrexate should be given at least 24 hours after the hematopoietic stem cell infusion. Dose reduction of MTX due to worsening creatinine clearance after initiation of conditioning regimen, high serum levels or development of oral mucositis is allowed according to institutional practices.

             less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow. Patients with CMML must have a WBC count ≤
             10,000 cells/µL and &lt; 5% blasts in the marrow. Patients with ≥ 5% blasts due to a
             regenerating marrow must contact the protocol chairs for review.

          3. Planned myeloablative conditioning regimen

          4. Patients must have a related or unrelated donor as follows:

               1. Related donor must be an 8/8 match for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, and
                  -C at intermediate (or higher) resolution, and -DRB1 at high resolution using
                  DNA-based typing. Pediatric related donors must weigh ≥ 25.0 kg., must have
                  adequate peripheral venous catheter access for leukapheresis or must agree to
                  placement of a central catheter, must be willing to (1) donate bone marrow and
                  (2) receive G-CSF followed by donation of peripheral blood stem cells (product to
                  be determined by randomization post enrollment) and must meet institutional
                  criteria for donation.

               2. Unrelated donor must be an 8/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 at high
                  resolution using DNA-based typing. Unrelated donor must be medically eligible to

                  any known preferences or contraindications to donate bone marrow or peripheral
                  blood stem cells. (Selection of unrelated donors is to be performed according to
                  institutional practice. It is recommended that the time from collection to
                  initiation of the cell processing be considered when prioritizing donors, as data
                  shows better results for CD34 selection when cell processing begins within 36
                  hours of the end of collection)
