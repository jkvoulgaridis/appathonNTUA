    <textblock>
      A Phase 1b study for participants with Stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to
      participate in 1 of 2 portions of this study. The first portion is Dose Escalation in which
      participants are tested with PEGPH20 at various doses (1.6, 3.0, 2.2 and 2.8
      micrograms/kilogram (ug/kg)) in addition to dosing with the standard dose of docetaxel (PDoc)
      of 75 milligrams/meter squared (mg/m^2) once every 21-day cycle. Based on observations on the
      safety and tolerability of study treatment from dose escalation cohorts dosed to date (1.6
      and 3.0 ug/kg of PEGPH20), two additional dose levels will be tested, 2.2 and 2.8 ug/kg. Up
      to 30 additional participants may be enrolled to test these dose levels. The second portion
      of Phase 1b is Cohort Expansion in which the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PDoc
      identified in dose escalation is administered every 21 days to approximately 50 participants
      with high hyaluronan (HA-high) prospectively measured in their tumor tissue.

    <intervention_model_description>The study was planned to include a Dose Escalation portion utilizing a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Participants were enrolled sequentially into their assigned dose cohort. The Treatment Period consisted of 21-day treatment cycles with administration of PEGPH20 on Day 1 (doses tested were 1.6, 3.0, and 2.2 ug/kg) and docetaxel (standard dosing 75 mg/m^2 for all participants) on Day 2 of each cycle.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Throughout the Treatment Period, the assessment of safety was based on AEs, including deaths, non-serious AEs, and serious adverse events, AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, and results of vital sign measurements and clinical laboratory assessments (including hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation parameters, and urinalysis). Additionally, thromboembolic (TE) events were deemed by the Sponsor as AEs of special interest. AEs and laboratory values were graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03.</description>

Additionally, thromboembolic (TE) events were deemed by the Sponsor as AEs of special interest.

          <description>Blood samples were collected from all participants per protocol and analyzed for plasma PEGPH20 concentration using a validated ECL immunoassay. Plasma docetaxel concentrations were analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography with LS-MS/MS. The following blood draw schedule was used, PEGPH20: C1D1 (predose, 15 min, 1, 2 to 4, and 24 hr postdose), C2 and all subsequent Cycles (predose, 1 hr postdose). Docetaxel: C1D2 (30 min after the start of the 1-hr infusion, 30 min post completion of the infusion, 4 to 6 and 24 hr post infusion), C1D3 (24 hr post infusion), C2D2 and C3D2 (30 min after the start of the 1-hour infusion, 30 min post completion of the infusion).</description>
