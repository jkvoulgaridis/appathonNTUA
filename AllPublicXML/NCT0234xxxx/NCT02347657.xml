    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicenter

      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter
      study in people with CF who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. This study is
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX-661 in combination with Ivacaftor (IVA,
      VX-770). The active treatment regimen comprised of a morning dose of a fixed-dose combination
      (FDC) tablet of 100 milligram (mg) VX-661/150 mg IVA once daily (qd) and an evening dose of
      IVA 150 mg to be taken approximately 12 hours after the morning dose. The placebo regimen was
      visually matched tablets to be taken with the same schedule as the active treatment.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>AE: any untoward medical occurrence in a participant during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency after the informed consent form is signed. AE includes serious as well as non-serious AEs. SAE (subset of AE): medical event or condition, which falls into any of the following categories, regardless of its relationship to the study drug: death, life threatening adverse experience, inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, persistent/significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event. Any AE that increased in severity or newly developed at or after initial dosing of study drug to Week 28 was considered treatment-emergent.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least One Pulmonary Exacerbation Pulmonary Exacerbation Through Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a new event or change in antibiotic therapy for greater than or equal to 4 sinopulmonary signs/symptoms. Time to event data was not collected and instead, Number of Subjects with first event were collected and are reported. Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation was planned to be estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates. However, due to less than 50% of events, time-to-first event data was not estimated. Instead, number of participants with at least one pulmonary exacerbation event were collected and are reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>BMI was defined as weight in kg divided by height in m^2. z-score is a statistical measure to describe whether a mean was above or below the standard. BMI, adjusted for age and sex, was analyzed as BMI-for-age z-score (BMI z-score).</description>
