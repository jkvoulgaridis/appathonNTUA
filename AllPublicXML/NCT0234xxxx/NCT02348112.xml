  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this postmarket study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the Altis
      Single Sling (SIS) to an FDA cleared transobturator and/or retropubic sling through 36
      months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, post-market, multi-center, cohort assessment comparing Altis SIS
      (n=178) and transobturator and/or retropubic slings (n=178) in the treatment of stress
      urinary incontinence at up to 40 U.S. and international sites. Subjects will be followed for
      a total of 36 months with scheduled visits at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. The study
      population will consist of adult female subjects with stress incontinence who are clinically
      indicated for surgical intervention with a mesh sling.

    <description>Altis is a minimally invasive, adjustable incontinence sling that is placed through a single incision in the vaginal wall and anchored inside the body. The sling has an integrated tensioning system eliminating the need for additional skin exits.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transobturator or Retropubic Sling</intervention_name>
    <description>Both transobturator and retropubic slings are a hammock-like mesh placed underneath the urethra to provide support. A single incision is made in the vaginal wall and two incisions in the abdomen. Tensioning of the sling is achieved by pulling the sling through the abdominal incisions.</description>
