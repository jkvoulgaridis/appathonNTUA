  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LILA study is a pilot randomized parallel-group trial of a group-based yoga therapy
      program versus physical conditionin control program for treatment of urinary incontinence in
      ambulatory middle-aged and older women. Women aged 50 years and older who meet the criteria
      for frequency of incontinence episodes, are not using other clinical treatments for
      incontinence, and meet minimum physical mobility requirements and other eligibility criteria
      will be recruited from the general San Francisco Bay Area.

    <measure>Total Incontinence Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the frequency of urinary incontinence episodes of any type. Analysis of covariance models were developed to examine change in incontinence frequency over 3 months. Results were summarized using least square mean estimates of changes in incontinence frequency in each group, as well as estimates of between-group difference in change in outcomes. Main efficacy analyses included all participants regardless of drop-out or adherence, consistent with an intention-to-treat principle. To address the potential for bias stemming from missing bladder diary data for up to 16% of participants who dropped out of interventions early, a multiple imputation procedure (SAS PROC MI, SAS Institute, Inc.) was used to impute values for data missing at follow-up. Imputation models included outcomes, randomization group, and baseline values.</description>

             floor exercises

          -  Report conditions that, in the judgment of the investigators, render potential
             participants unlikely to follow the protocol, including plans to move, substance
             abuse, significant psychiatric problems, or dementia

          -  Participation in another research study that involves investigational drugs or devices

        <title>Total Incontinence Frequency</title>
        <description>Change in the frequency of urinary incontinence episodes of any type. Analysis of covariance models were developed to examine change in incontinence frequency over 3 months. Results were summarized using least square mean estimates of changes in incontinence frequency in each group, as well as estimates of between-group difference in change in outcomes. Main efficacy analyses included all participants regardless of drop-out or adherence, consistent with an intention-to-treat principle. To address the potential for bias stemming from missing bladder diary data for up to 16% of participants who dropped out of interventions early, a multiple imputation procedure (SAS PROC MI, SAS Institute, Inc.) was used to impute values for data missing at follow-up. Imputation models included outcomes, randomization group, and baseline values.</description>

        <title>Urogenital Distress Inventory-6</title>
        <description>Change in the questionnaire score for Urogenital Distress Inventory-6. Range 0-100, with higher scores mean worse function.
Analysis of covariance models were developed to examine change in quality of life outcomes over 3 months. Results were summarized using least square mean estimates of changes in quality of life outcomes in each group, as well as estimates of between-group difference in change in outcomes. Main efficacy analyses included all participants regardless of drop-out or adherence, consistent with an intention-to-treat principle. To address the potential for bias stemming from missing bladder diary data for up to 16% of participants who dropped out of interventions early, a multiple imputation procedure (SAS PROC MI, SAS Institute, Inc.) was used to impute values for data missing at follow-up. Imputation models included outcomes, randomization group, and baseline values.</description>
