  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of renal function on the plasma,
      urine, and dialysate pharmacokinetic profile of MK-6183 (CB-238,618) in humans. The study
      will also assess the safety profile and tolerability of MK-6183 in healthy participants,
      participants with varying degrees of renal impairment (RI), or participants with end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD), based on estimated glomerular filtration
      rate (eGFR).

             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, oncologic,
             musculoskeletal, or psychiatric) or any other condition, including clinically
             significant anemia, which in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the

             medication in this study) are allowed

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination, medical history, 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, or laboratory values, as judged by the

             laboratory values consistent with their disease and approved by the investigator

          -  Evidence of clinically significant hepatic impairment including alanine
             aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt;1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or
             bilirubin &gt;1 × ULN

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL, unless considered stable and not clinically significant in the

             defined as starting a new drug or changing dosage within 14 days prior to
             administration of study medication, except for drugs administered in relationship to
             HD

          -  Participants with fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating renal function (assessment of
             the stability of the subject's renal function will be determined by the investigator)

          -  Participant has a currently functioning renal transplant and/or has been on
             significant immunosuppressant therapy, as determined by the investigator, within the
             last 6 months

Blood samples for Group E were collected both prior to and during HD (Period 1) and after HD (Period 2) [data from Periods 1 and 2 were analyzed separately]. In Period 1, HD commenced 3.5 hours post-dose (HD duration was 3.5 to 4 hours) and sample collection continued until 48 hours post-dose. The specific time frame of plasma sample collection for Group E: Period 1 was pre-dose, 0.5 hours post-dose, EOI, 1.5 hours post-dose, 2 hours post-dose, 3 hours post-dose (pre-HD), 3.5 hours post-dose with HD, 5 hours post-dose with HD, pre-end of HD, 30 min post-HD, 1 hour post-HD, 2 hours post-HD, 12 hours post-dose, 24 hours post-dose, and 48 hours post-dose. For statistical analyses, Group A is the reference and least squares (LS) mean ratios for tests (Groups B to E) are calculated as test/reference; Group E: Period 1 and Group E: Period 2 were also compared.</description>
          <population>All participants who received MK-6183 and had viable results are included. One participant from Group E: Period 1 and 1 participant from Group E: Period 2 were excluded due to implausible concentration values.</population>

        <description>CL is a measure of the clearance of drug from plasma via metabolism and excretion. Blood samples for Group E were collected both prior to and during HD (Period 1) and after HD (Period 2) [data from Periods 1 and 2 were analyzed separately]. In Period 1, HD commenced 3.5 hours post-dose (HD duration was 3.5 to 4 hours) and sample collection continued until 48 hours post-dose. The specific time frame of plasma sample collection for Group E: Period 1 was pre-dose, 0.5 hours post-dose, EOI, 1.5 hours post-dose, 2 hours post-dose, 3 hours post-dose (pre-HD), 3.5 hours post-dose with HD, 5 hours post-dose with HD, pre-end of HD, 30 min post-HD, 1 hour post-HD, 2 hours post-HD, 12 hours post-dose, 24 hours post-dose, and 48 hours post-dose.</description>
