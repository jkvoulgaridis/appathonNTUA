    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of depatuxizumab mafodotin
      (ABT-414) alone or with temozolomide versus temozolomide or lomustine alone in adult
      participants with recurrent glioblastoma. The study also included a substudy to evaluate
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ABT-414 in a pediatric population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives were to assess whether depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414) alone or in
      combination with temozolomide (TMZ) improved overall survival (OS), progression-free survival
      (PFS), tumor response, quality of life, neurological deterioration-free survival (NDFS), and
      steroid use compared to standard treatment with lomustine single agent or TMZ re-challenge in
      adult subjects ≥ 18 years of age with centrally-confirmed recurrent epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR)-amplified glioblastoma. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of
      depatuxizumab mafodotin in children &lt;18 years of age was evaluated in a pediatric substudy.
      The EMEA-001732-PIP02-15 pediatric investigation plan was withdrawn on 07 July 2019 due to
      the discontinuation of the depatuxizumab mafodotin research program.

          <description>The pediatric data collection for this study was still ongoing when INTELLANCE-1 (NCT02573324; EudraCT number 2015-001166-26) interim efficacy results overall indicated no survival benefit to adding depatuxizumab mafodotin to standard radiotherapy/ temozolomide therapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. Based on the INTELLANCE-1 results, AbbVie decided to stop further enrollment of pediatric participants into the pediatric substudy and to stop the collection of efficacy data. Because of this decision not to summarize except for safety data, pediatric time to progression data analysis was not summarized due to the small number of pediatric participants enrolled in the study.</description>
