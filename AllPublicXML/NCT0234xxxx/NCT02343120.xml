        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged ≥ 18 years, voluntarily consented to the study.

          2. WHO classification defined B-lymphoid malignancy, with the exception of Burkitt
             lymphoma/leukemia, plasma cell myeloma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic
             lymphoma, and plasmablastic lymphoma.

          3. Requirement for treatment in the opinion of the investigator.

          4. Disease which has relapsed, or is refractory, following at least one line of therapy,
             with no therapy of higher priority available.

          5. ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          6. Adequate hematologic function, as defined by neutrophils ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L and platelets
             ≥ 50 x 10^9/L; patients with neutrophils &lt; 1.0 x 10^9/L due to marrow infiltration are

             months prior to first dose of study drug.

             weeks, monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks.

          6. Not recovered from toxicity of any prior chemotherapy to grade ≤ 1.

             squamous cell carcinoma of skin; (3) previous malignancy confined and treated locally
             (surgery or other modality) with curative intent.

          8. Uncontrolled systemic infection requiring parenteral anti-microbial therapy.

          9. Major surgery in the past 4 weeks.

         10. Known HIV, or active hep B or hep C infection (detected positive by PCR).

         11. Cardiovascular disease resulting in New York Heart Association function status of ≥ 3.

         12. Significant active renal, neurologic, psychiatric, hepatic or endocrinologic disease
             that in the investigator's opinion would adversely impact on his/her participating in
             the study.

         13. Inability to comply with study procedures.
