  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to better understand the comprehensive integration of both
      clinical and genetic factors that will help to identify mothers who could be at an increased
      risk of poor response to opioid substitution and infants at risk of significant neonatal
      abstinence syndrome (NAS).

      One of the greatest impacts on maternal/infant health in the United States today is mother's
      who have opioid use disorder also known as OUD. This study will look at how in-utero
      buprenorphine also known as subutex, effects both mother/fetus in prenatal stages with MRI's,
      blood draws, and a series of assessments. After the neonate is born, there will be follow-up
      with that baby for up to 2 years with another neonatal MRI, blood draws and infant/child
      assessments. Planning to enroll 200 mothers who have opioid use disorder and 100 mothers with
      no previous opioid use.
