  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases risk for catastrophic pregnancy complications,
      growth retardation, other adverse fetal and infant health problems, and later-in-life chronic
      conditions among exposed offspring. The most effective intervention for reducing smoking
      during pregnancy is financial incentives whereby participants earn incentives (e.g., gift
      cards, cash) contingent on objective evidence of smoking abstinence. However, financial
      incentives-based interventions are typically delivered in relatively intense protocols
      requiring frequent clinic visits, which limits the geographical range over which services can
      be delivered and potentially denies treatment to those residing in remote or otherwise
      difficult to reach settings.

      The present study will examine the feasibility, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of a
      smartphone-based financial incentives intervention whereby smoking monitoring and delivery of
      incentives are completed remotely using a mobile app (to be designed by DynamiCare Health,
      Inc.). Eligible participants who complete the informed consent process will be randomized to
      one of two conditions: an incentives condition wherein women will receive financial
      incentives contingent on the remote submission of breath and saliva specimens indicating
      abstinence from recent smoking (described below), or a best practices control condition in
      which women will receive usual care for smoking cessation that is provided at their
      obstetrical clinics, as well as three brief educational sessions and referral to the Vermont
      (or other state) pregnancy-specific quit line by our research staff.

      For inclusion in the study, women must meet the following criteria: (a) &gt; 18 years of age,
      (b) report being smokers at the time they learned of the current pregnancy, (c) report
      smoking in the 7 days prior to completing their phone eligibility screening, (c) &lt; 25 weeks
      pregnant, (d) speak English, (e) own a smartphone (Android or iOS; 81.8% of pregnant women in
      wave 1 [2013-2014] of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health [PATH] reported owning
      a smartphone). Exclusion criteria include: (a) current or prior mental or medical condition
      that may interfere with study participation (assessed via self-report during phone
      eligibility screening), (b) smoke marijuana more than once each week and not willing to quit
      (marijuana smoking can inflate breath CO), (c) exposed to unavoidable occupational sources of
      CO (e.g., car mechanic), and (d) self-report currently being maintained on opioid maintenance
      therapy (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine).

      Participants randomized to the incentives condition will select a quit date (either the first
      or second Monday following their enrollment), and will submit videos of themselves blowing
      into a breath CO monitor twice daily during week 1. They will receive incentives for every
      sample where expired breath CO is &lt; 6 ppm. Beginning in week 2 and extending through week 6,
      participants will submit videos twice per week (Monday/Thursday) for which they will receive
      incentives for providing videos of themselves completing saliva cotinine tests indicating
      smoking abstinence. From week 7 until delivery, participants will submit videos once per week
      and will continue to receive incentives for saliva cotinine tests indicating no smoking.
      During the postpartum period, women will submit videos twice weekly for the first 4 weeks and
      once weekly from weeks 5-12. Women will receiving incentives for negative breath and saliva
      samples, and the value of incentives will increase with each consecutive sample indicating
      smoking abstinence. Participants will not receive incentives for missed samples or samples
      that indicate smoking, and the incentive schedule will be reset at its starting value.
      However two consecutive negative samples following a missed or positive sample will restore
      the incentive to its prior value.

      Women in both conditions will complete seven formal assessments of their smoking status
      during their participation along with a treatment acceptability questionnaire and
      semi-structured interview on barriers and facilitators of treatment engagement.

      We conducted a power analysis to estimate the number of participants required to detect
      treatment effects assuming late-pregnancy abstinence rates of approximately 40% vs. &lt; 10%
      (incentives vs. best practices, respectively), and 24-week postpartum abstinence rates of
      approximately 20% vs. &lt; 5%. The proposed sample size of 76 per treatment condition will
      result in at least 80% power to detect a difference between the two treatment conditions in
      abstinence rates of 40% vs. 10 % at late-pregnancy or 20% vs. 5% at 24-weeks postpartum
      assessments using a chi-square test and significance level of 0.05.

    <intervention_model_description>We are proposing a two condition, parallel groups, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a mobile-phone-based financial incentives intervention targeting economically disadvantaged pregnant cigarette smokers. The experimental group will receive electronic vouchers contingent on the remote submission of breath carbon monoxide (CO) samples indicating smoking abstinence whereas the control group will receive best practices for promoting smoking cessation. The use of a best practices control group reflects a real-world comparison condition in that all women will receive the treatment that practitioners in the community are instructed to provide (i.e., the 5As plus quit-line referral) thereby enhancing the ecological validity of the study, while also minimizing between-subject variability in the extent of participants' exposure to these practices by implementing these treatment components ourselves.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Best Practices- The 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines for smoking cessation recommends that pregnant smokers be provided with the 5As. Research staff will implement the 5As at three assessments that take place during pregnancy.
Best Practices + Financial Incentive- Women assigned to this condition will receive the best practices treatment described above plus the remote incentives intervention.
Beginning on the quit date and extending for one week, participants will be required to submit twice daily CO samples. All samples &lt; 6 ppm will be considered negative and those &gt; 6 ppm will be considered positive. Participants will earn incentives for breath tests indicating smoking abstinence, and incentive values will increase with each consecutive negative sample. Following the initial quit week, the schedule of monitoring will be reduced and incentives will be contingent on submitting a negative saliva cotinine test.</description>
