    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, parallel-group, 2-part study to evaluate
      the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK and safety and tolerability of a single oral dose
      of risdiplam compared to matched healthy participants with normal hepatic function.
