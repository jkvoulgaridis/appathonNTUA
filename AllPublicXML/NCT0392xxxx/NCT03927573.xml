      This dose-escalating phase I trial assesses for the first time the safety, the side effects
      and the harmlessness, as well as the therapeutical benefit of the new study drug GEM3PSCA in
      patients with prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) expressing cancer types which failed to
      respond to standard therapy.
