      This is a Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel group
      study to be conducted in up to approximately 340 subjects â‰¥6 months of age with MC. Subjects
      or their caregivers will apply SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel once daily for a minimum of 4 weeks
      and up to 12 weeks to all lesions identified at Baseline and new treatable lesions that arise
      during the course of the study.

      This is a Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel group
      study to be conducted in approximately 340 subjects with MC. After obtaining informed
      consent/assent, subjects who satisfy entry criteria will be randomized 2:1 (active:vehicle).
      Subjects receiving current treatment for MC at the time of the Screening Visit will enter a
      wash out period of up to 14 days prior to randomization.

      Subjects or their caregivers will apply SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel once daily for a minimum of
      4 weeks and up to 12 weeks to all lesions identified at Baseline and new treatable lesions
      that arise during the course of the study. Subjects or their caregivers will continue to
      treat the area until the next scheduled visit even if the lesion(s) clear. If the
      investigator determines all lesions are cleared at a clinic visit, the treatment may stop.
      Subjects will visit the clinic at Screening/Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12. In
      addition, subjects will be seen in the clinic for a safety follow-up at Week 24.
