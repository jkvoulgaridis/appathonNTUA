    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical study aimed to compare the outcomes of the laser-assisted frenectomy
      with and without topical hyaluronic acid application to evaluate the effect of HA on
      secondary wound healing after frenectomy surgery.

      The study included a total of sytemically healthy 40 patients , with high labial frenulum
      attachment requiring frenectomy. Following laser-assisted frenectomy operation HA gel was
      applied to the wound surface in the test group, and no application was made to the control
      group The HA application was made topically to completely cover the surgical area on days 3,
      7, and 14 postoperatively. Photographs of the operation area were taken on days 3, 7, and 14.
      The changes in the area measurements between the digital images according to the healing
      periods were calculated on a computer. according to Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to
      evaluate Patient comfort and pain levels.

      the aim of this study was to clinically evaluate the effect on secondary wound healing of the
      topical application of hyaluronic acid to the surgical field after frenectomy operation
      performed with laser, through evaluation of the amount of reduction of the wound site and
      postoperative pain levels.The study included a total of 40 patients who had maxillary high
      labial frenulum attachment and were planned to undergo frenectomy and met the study inclusion
      criteria. All the patients were informed about oral hygiene control and attention was paid
      that optimal oral hygiene was maintained throughout the study. Phase I periodontal treatment
      was applied to patients where necessary. The area measurements of the wound site formed after
      frenectomy was taken immediately after the frenectomy and on days 3, 7, and 21
      postoperatively. HA gel was applied topically after the frenectomy operation to the test
      group and not to the control group. All the surgical procedures were performed by the same
      surgeon.

    <description>IMAGEJ software was used for the evaluation of the photographs and measurement of the area. The area unit measurements are determined by the operator and for this study, the unit was determined as mm2. To measure the area in the program, the relevant photograph was uploaded to the photograph file and the area to be measured was drawn with the computer mouse. After setting unit calibration, the area measurement was made automatically and the numerical value obtained was recorded in the Excel program.</description>

    <description>Preoperatively all patients gargled for 1 min with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash. Local anaesthesia was applied to the area where the surgical procedure was to be applied. Then the frenectomy operation was performed with a continuous 970nm wavelength of the diode laser at power setting of 1,5W for approximately 60 seconds from the base to the apex of the frenum, thereby excising it. No bleeding was observed after the frenectomy performed with laser. Then, commercially available Hiyaluronic acid was topically applied to the relevant area to completely cover the surgical field to the test group. Following the frenectomy performed with laser, no application was made to the control group patients.</description>
