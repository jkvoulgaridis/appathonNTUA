  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer of Mismatch Repair-deficient (dMMR)/ Microsatellite Instability-high
      (MSI-H) accounts for approximately 15% of all colorectal cancer patients, with a higher
      proportion in right colon cancer. Previous studies have found that colon cancer patients with
      dMMR/MSI-H cannot benefit from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. Once patients
      have distant metastases, they are not sensitive to traditional palliative chemotherapy, and
      the prognosis is significantly worse than that of mismatch repair-proficient
      (pMMR)/microsatellite stability (MSS). A phase II clinical study of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy
      based on mismatch repair (MMR) status published in 《N Engl J Med》 showed that the objective
      response rate (ORR) of advanced colorectal cancer patients with dMMR received anti-PD-1 is
      40%, and a longer response time can be obtained compared to conventional chemotherapy.

      Anti-PD-1 neoadjuvant therapy has proven to be safe and feasible in lung cancer, bladder
      cancer and malignant melanoma, and can achieve more than 40% of major pathological response.
      However, there are no reports of anti-PD-1 neoadjuvant therapy for the dMMR/MSI-H colorectal
      cancer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to find the best multidisciplinary treatment for
      resectable colorectal cancer patient with the dMMR/MSI-H phenotype and to explore whether
      cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors combined with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) could
      further improve efficacy.
