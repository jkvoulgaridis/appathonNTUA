    <textblock>
      Background:

      Treatments for structural heart and valve disease are quickly changing. But treatment could
      be improved. Researchers want to gather data from people with this disease. They want to find
      problems and seek new ways to make treatments better.

      Objective:

      To find people with structural heart and valve disease with common features to study. To find
      flaws and patterns in procedures related to this disease. To share findings with other
      researchers.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who are receiving care from the structural heart and valve program
      at the participating NHLBI structural heart disease network sites that are part of the study

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with their consent. This will occur when they give their
      standard consent for medical care.

      Participants will have their data collected in the course of standard medical care. Data
      include:

      Demographic data

      Protected health data

      Personally identifiable data

      Medical records

      Medical images. These could include X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans.

      The study could find something that would impact participants care. If this is the case,
      their doctors will be told.

      Participants data may be shared with other researchers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical care is evolving rapidly for patients considered for treatment of structural heart
      and valve disease. Despite technical advances, many shortcomings remain. This research
      protocol allows researchers to pool medical records and imaging studies to identify problems
      and seek new solutions.

      All patients considered for treatment at participating NHLBI structural heart and valve
      centers are invited to allow researchers to access their medical records repeatedly,
      including the results of medical procedures and imaging studies such as catheterization, CT,
      echocardiography, and MRI. These records, which include patient identity, will be sent to a
      central NHLBI database and kept confidential. Results will be used in medical publications
      but patient identity will be hidden.
