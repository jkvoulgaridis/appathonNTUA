    <description>Participants will undergo intralesional injections of up to 4 cc of 10^6 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL of T-VEC. Dose is dependent on the diameter of the lesions to be injected (volume injected is related to diameter of lesion(s) at time point 0). Three weeks later and every other week thereafter, the participants will be injected with up to 4 cc of 10^8 PFU/mL, with dose dependent on the diameter of the lesion(s) to be injected. Participants may be treated for up to 12 months.</description>
