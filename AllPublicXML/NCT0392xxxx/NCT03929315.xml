  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One lung ventilation (OLV) in neonates and children is an advanced skill that is necessary
      for delivery of safe and quality anesthetic care. The current model of training for OLV in
      the paediatric patient is composed of the apprenticeship model. Trainees learn the techniques
      of doing the procedure when they encounter a case that allows for it. The model of training
      is often inadequate for mastery of skills such as OLV as children in this population often
      have severe debilitating disease often requiring the most experienced anesthesiologist to
      perform OLV. This limits the training exposure of anesthesia trainees.

      Each participant will be subjected to three learning sessions on a 6 year old
      tracheo-bronchial model. Learning will either be spaced (1 week between learning/testing
      sessions) or non-spaced (30 minutes between learning/testing sessions). They will have 20
      minutes to practice on this model before they are asked to perform the OLV on a younger
      tracheo-bronchial model (2 yrs, 3 months, 6 weeks). After each testing session, the
      participants will be provided with feedback. After all learning/testing sessions take place,
      the participants will be asked to complete a retention test on the 6 week old model six weeks
      after their last session.
