  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to examine whether a single session of training in
      regulation of craving (ROC-T) affects alcohol drinking. The study will consist of (1) a basic
      screening (phone and/or online) and an in-person visit, to determine eligibility and conduct
      pre-intervention baseline assessments; (2) a training (ROC-T) visit, (3) a post-intervention
      assessment visit, and (4) 1-2 phone/online follow-up assessments.

      The study will take up to 10 hours of the participants' time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the efficacy of such training by randomizing 120
      individuals who report alcohol drinking to the following conditions: (1) a brief training in
      cognitive regulation and (2) a control or no-training condition. Training will be delivered
      in a computerized session (approximately 60 minutes). If randomized into the cognitive
      regulation training, subjects will be trained to use a cognitive strategy while viewing
      images of alcoholic drinks. The strategy would be to follow instructions to think about the
      adverse outcomes associated with continued alcohol drinking. If randomized into the control
      condition, participants will only view non-alcohol-related images with no use of strategy.
      After all the training sessions are completed, participants will complete several follow-ups.
      The investigators will evaluate the effects of training on alcohol drinking pre- and
      post-training.

    <description>Participants will be asked to report their craving regulation (if any) since the intervention. In order to assess the level of craving regulation the participants will answer several questions in our craving regulation questionnaire. This assessment will include questions about the number of attempts at craving regulation, the number of times the participant intended to regulate craving, one's confidence in one's ability to regulate craving, the level of motivation to regulate drinking before each drinking episode, and the participant's intention to regulate drinking in the future. Finally, participants will be asked how many times they were thinking of negative consequences in general and while experiencing alcohol craving.</description>

    <description>In the CRAVING REGULATION condition, participants will first read a brief essay about the adverse consequences of drinking alcohol. Then, participants may complete a comprehension check consisting of questions to ensure that they understood and encoded the content of the essays. Participants will be trained to use the information to inform the strategy they will use in the regulation of craving training (ROC-T). A single trial in the regulation of craving training will have two possible instructions: (a) STRATEGY: implement the strategy (&quot;bring to mind the negative facts from the essay&quot;) and (b) LOOK: to merely observe the image and allow natural responses to come. Participants will follow the instructions; followed by an alcohol-related picture, a brief delay, and will then rate their craving. Participants will then be instructed to use this strategy in daily life situations when they might drink.</description>

    <description>In the CONTROL condition, participants will first read a brief essay about a non-alcohol-related topic (e.g., color perception). Then, participants will complete a comprehension check consisting of questions to ensure that they understood and encoded the content of the essays. Participants will view images of objects that are unrelated to alcohol. Furthermore, participants in the control condition will not practice any strategy in the regulation of craving task (ROC-T). That is, in the CONTROL condition, participants would merely observe the image and allow natural responses to come (i.e., LOOK instruction) and rate how colorful is each item (this controls for task time and experiment setting).</description>
