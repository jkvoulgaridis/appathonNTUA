  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-101
      in combination with other anticancer therapies when administered to patients with advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ORIC-101 is a small molecule GR antagonist being developed for the treatment of patients with
      solid tumor malignancies. Mechanistically, ORIC-101 inhibits GR transcriptional activity and
      blocks the pro-survival signals mediated by the activated nuclear receptor.

      This is an open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, dose-finding study to assess the safety and
      preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-101 in combination with anticancer therapy in patients
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will begin with dose finding in
      combination initially with nab-paclitaxel; additional dose-finding cohorts with other
      anticancer therapies may be evaluated through protocol amendment(s).

      The study will first evaluate intermittent administration (5 days on, 2 days off for 21 days)
      of ORIC-101 followed by continuous administration (daily for 21 days) in combination with
      nab-paclitaxel using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design.

      Dose expansion may further evaluate the safety of ORIC-101 at a dose selected from dose
      escalation.
