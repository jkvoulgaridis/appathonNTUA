  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a multilayer skin dressing (Mepilex) placed on the sacrum
      or a fluid filled pad (LiquiCell) on risk factors for pressure injuries under conditions
      consistent with military long-distance transport or prolonged field care. Participants will
      be assigned to one of six groups - air transport, air transport on a spinal immobilization
      surface with or without Mepilex or on a field stretcher with or without LiquiCell.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combat casualties undergoing long distance aeromedical evacuation (AE), particularly
      casualties who are immobilized because of possible spine injuries, and casualties who
      required prolonged field care are at increased risk for pressure injuries. The risk factors
      pressure and shear are potentially modifiable via solutions appropriate for these austere
      conditions. Two interventions (Mepilex and LiquiCell) will be evaluated under conditions
      simulating military medical transport on a standard stretcher or with spinal immobilization
      in a vacuum spine board (VSB) or on a military stretcher used under field conditions. Mepilex
      is a multi-layer dressing that can be placed on the skin (sacrum/buttocks) and LiquiCell is a
      pad filled with pockets of fluid that is placed under the back and buttocks. The effect of
      these interventions compared to not using them will be studied under the three conditions
      with or without the intervention (Mepilex or LiquiCell) using measures obtained on the lower
      back/sacrum including skin interface pressure, oxygen, moisture, and temperature and a
      cytokine indicating possible tissue damage.

    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion - approximately 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Skin cytokine (IL-1) and total protein will be obtained using a small strip of specialized tape placed on the sacrum/buttocks. After 1-minute application the tape is removed and analyzed for quantity of interleukin-1 (indicator of skin irritation)</description>

    <measure>Change in Transcutaneous tissue oxygen (TcPO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured continuously during the baseline (sidelying), supine (120 minutes) and post-sidelying (15 minutes) periods</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue oxygen is measured continuously on the sacrum using a noninvasive sensor and on the midsternum (midchest) as a control</description>

    <measure>Change in Skin Moisture (epidermal and subepidermal)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before lying down) and after 120 minutes supine</time_frame>
    <description>Two components of skin moisture will be measured on the sacrum using the Delfin MoistureMeter. The epidermal moisture, which reflects perspiration and subepidermal moisture , which reflects water content of the tissues. The values range from 1-80, with higher numbers reflecting increased moisture.</description>

    <measure>Change in Skin Temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured continuously during the baseline (sidelying), supine (120 minutes) and post-sidelying (15 minutes) periods</time_frame>
    <description>Skin temperature will be measured continuously on the sacrum using a laser doppler probe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Skin interface pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuously during the supine phase of the study (120 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The pressure between the support surface and the skin will be measured continuously during the supine position using the X Sensor system. This system measures force/unit area (e.g., pressure). The peak and average pressure on the sacrum/buttocks will be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pressure-Discomfort (Category Partitioning Scale-50)</measure>
    <time_frame>The score will be obtained at baseline and every 30 minutes in the supine position (total 5 measurements).</time_frame>
    <description>This scale asks the participant to describe in verbal terms the pressure intensity or discomfort associated with the stimulus (i.e., sacral/buttocks pressure or discomfort). The participant can then fine tune their assessment using a numeric score. The final score is an analog. The score ranges from 0-52, with higher scores indicating higher pressure or more severe discomfort. The investigator will ask the participant to limit their evaluation to the pressure/discomfort sensed on the sacrum/buttocks, but the investigator will also ask the participants to identify on their body where they are experiencing the most pressure/discomfort.</description>

    <description>LiquiCell is a thin layer of low-viscosity fluid contained in a series of bursa-like pouches. Baffles within each pouch channel the liquid to disperse pressure and the volume of liquid in the pouch is so small that there is no pressure-build up. LiquiCell is available commercially as a 36 X 18-inch mattress overlay (LiquiCell Shear Reducing Mattress Overlay) with a soft pliable top and a non-slip bottom. The overlay is positioned from the shoulders to below the hips to minimize shear.</description>
