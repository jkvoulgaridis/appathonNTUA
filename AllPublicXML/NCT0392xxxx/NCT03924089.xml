  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition in hemodialysis patients is frequent and it is associated with a reduction in
      muscular mass, strength, functional capacity and quality of life, with an increment in
      inflammatory and oxidative markers, and with a dysregulation of circulating miRNAs and its
      target genes.

      Animal and human studies have reported that some dietary components (macronutrients,
      micronutrients and other bioactive substances) might restore these altered features.

      Thus, we hypothesized that the intake of an oral nutritional supplement (ONS) specifically
      developed for malnourished hemodialysis patients enriched with functional nutrients (extra
      virgin olive oil, omega 3 fatty acids, whey protein, antioxidants, carnitine, and with or
      without probiotics) vs. individualized diet recommendations might:

        -  Improve nutritional status (visceral proteins, muscular mass), functional capacity and
           quality of life.

        -  Reduce inflammatory and oxidative markers, and modulate the circulating levels of some
           miRNAs and the expression of its target genes on cells. miRNAs may be useful biomarkers
           to check the response to a nutritional intervention in malnourished hemodialysis
           patients.

      The present study is a randomized, multicenter, parallel-group trial with 3 groups, open to
      the intake of ONS or individualized diet recommendations, but double-blind to the intake of
      probiotics. Inclusion criteria comprised adult subjects (&gt;18 y/o) undergoing hemodialysis
      more than 6 months previous at inclusion and at least one of these caloric malnutrition
      criteria: a) involuntary weight loss &gt;5% in 3 months or &gt;10% in 6 months; b) serum albumin &lt;
      3.5 g/dl or prealbumin &lt;28 mg/dl; c) body mass index (BMI) &lt; 23 kg/m2; d) muscular mass loss
      &gt;5% in 3 months or &gt;10% in 6 months.

      The study duration is 6 months, and comprises 4 visits (screening, basal, 3 months and 6
      months). A nutritional examination that included anthropometric measurements, handgrip
      strength measured by a hand dynamometer, body composition assessed by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis (BIA) and a 5 days dietary record; quality of life evaluation by the &quot;12-item short
      form health survey&quot;; the presence of symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale); assessment of functional status by the &quot;Barthel&quot; test, the &quot;Short Physical
      Performance Battery&quot; and the &quot;International Physical Activity Questionnaire&quot;; and blood and
      stool samples will be obtained for each participant in each study visit (except screening
      visit).

      Hypothesis:

      The intake of an oral nutritional supplement (ONS) specifically developed for malnourished
      hemodialysis patients enriched with functional nutrients (extra virgin olive oil, omega 3
      fatty acids, whey protein, antioxidants, carnitine, and with or without probiotics) vs.
      individualized diet recommendations might:

        -  Improve nutritional status (visceral proteins, muscular mass), functional capacity and
           quality of life.

        -  Reduce inflammatory and oxidative markers, and modulate the circulating levels of some
           miRNAs and the expression of its target genes on cells. miRNAs may be useful biomarkers
           to check the response to a nutritional intervention in undernourished hemodialysis
           patients.

      Aims:

      To evaluate:

        -  The clinical response after the nutritional intervention:

             1. Nutritional status: anthropometric measurements, handgrip strength measured by a
                jamar hand dynamometer, body composition assessed by bioelectrical impedance
                analysis (BIA), and a 5 days dietary record.

             2. Functional status assessed by the &quot;Barthel&quot; test, the &quot;Short Physical Performance
                Battery&quot; and the &quot;International Physical Activity Questionnaire&quot;.

             3. Quality of life assessed by the &quot;12-item short form health survey&quot;, and the
                presence of symptoms of depression and anxiety by the &quot;Hospital Anxiety and
                Depression Scale&quot;.

        -  The physiological response after the nutritional intervention:

             1. Inflammatory markers.

             2. Oxidative markers.

             3. Gut microbiota.

             4. Circulating miRNAs and the expression of its target genes on cells.

      Study design:

        -  Randomized, multicenter, parallel-group trial with 3 groups, open to the intake of ONS
           or diet, but double-blind to the intake of probiotics.

        -  Study centers:

             1. Hospital Regional Universitario de Málaga (Spain).

             2. Hospital San Cecilio. Granada (Spain).

             3. Hospital Rey Juan Carlos. Móstoles, Madrid (Spain).

        -  One-hundred and twenty patients will be included. Eligible subjects will be invited to
           participate, and written informed consent will be obtained before the inclusion.
           Participants will be randomly assigned to one of these three groups:

             1. ONS with probiotics. Dietary and physical activity recommendations.

             2. ONS without probiotics. Dietary and physical activity recommendations.

             3. Dietary and physical activity recommendations.

        -  The study duration is 6 months, and comprises 4 visits (screening, basal, 3 months and 6
           months). Recruitment period: 12 months.

        -  Inclusion criteria: adult subjects (&gt;18 y/o) undergoing hemodialysis more than 6 months
           previous at inclusion and at least one of these caloric malnutrition criteria: a)
           involuntary weight loss &gt;5% in 3 months or &gt;10% in 6 months; b) serum albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dl
           or prealbumin &lt;28 mg/dl; c) body mass index (BMI) &lt; 23 kg/m2; d) muscular mass loss &gt;5%
           in 3 months or &gt;10% in 6 months.

        -  A nutritional examination that included anthropometric measurements, handgrip strength
           measured by a jamar hand dynamometer, body composition assessed by bioelectrical
           impedance analysis (BIA) and a 5 days dietary record; quality of life evaluation by the
           &quot;12-item short form health survey&quot;; the presence of symptoms of depression and anxiety
           (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); assessment of functional status by the
           &quot;Barthel&quot; test, the &quot;Short Physical Performance Battery&quot; and the &quot;International Physical
           Activity Questionnaire&quot;; and blood and stool samples will be obtained for each
           participant in each study visit (except screening visit).

Specifically, it measures self-care, sphincter management, transfers and locomotion. The score ranges between 0 and 100 points. Scores of 0-20 indicate &quot;total&quot; dependency, 21-60 indicate &quot;severe&quot; dependency, 61-90 indicate &quot;moderate&quot; dependency, 91-99 indicates &quot;slight&quot; dependency, and 100 indicates independency.</description>

    <description>Symptoms of depression and anxiety assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). This questionnaire comprises two sub-scales, each one range from 0 to 21 points; one assesses the symptoms of depression, and the other one the symptoms of anxiety. At each sub-scale, a score below 7 is considered normal range, between 8 and 10 means probable presence of depression or anxiety respectively, and more than 11 suggests the presence of depression or anxiety respectively.</description>
