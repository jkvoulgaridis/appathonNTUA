  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMAB807 is a human monoclonal antibody targeting the key bone resorption mediator RANKL. The
      drug is administered via subcutaneous injection once six months and is approved for various
      indications, including the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at
      increased/high risk of fracture. This phase 1 clincical study investigates the
      pharmacokinetics, safety and immnogenicity of CMAB807,compared to prolia®, in healthy Chinese
      male subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 single center, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group clinical trial.
      The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetics similarity of single and subcutaneous
      injection of CMAB807 injection or Prolia® in health volunteers. The secondary objectives are
      to assess the clinical safety and immnogenicity similarity of single and subcutaneous
      injection of CMAB807 or Prolia® in healty volunteers. Meanwhile, exploring the
      pharmacodynamic similarities of CMAB807 and Prolia®.

      Subjects will receive a single 60mg of CMAB807 or Prolia® through subcutaneous injection.
