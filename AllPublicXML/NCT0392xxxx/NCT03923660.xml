  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) based on concentric exercise training has become an integral
      component in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
      improving functional capacities while diminishing symptoms and improving quality of life.

      However, the response to concentric exercise training is heterogeneous from one COPD patient
      to another. The inability of some COPD patients to achieve the exercise intensities required
      to stress limb muscles due to severe ventilatory limitation could partially explain their
      poor response to training.

      Endurance exercise with eccentric muscle contractions could be an interesting alternative to
      concentric exercise because it produces greater muscle force through its lower metabolic
      cost. Eccentric exercise could allow patients with severe airflow limitation to perform
      prolonged exercise sessions with sufficient intensity to improve muscle function.

      Nevertheless, a recent study performed in healthy young subjects reported that eccentric
      exercise induced a more hyperpneic breathing pattern (i.e., lower tidal volume and higher
      breathing frequency) that concentric for a given minute ventilation.

      The main objective of CONvEX study is to compare ventilatory adaptation between two
      modalities of exercise performed on cycle ergometer (concentric versus eccentric) in severe
      COPD patients.
