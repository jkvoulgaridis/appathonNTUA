      This single arm therapeutic exploratory study of digoxin in patients with advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer investigates whether cardiac glycosides are able to disrupt CTC
      clusters in breast cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are considered to be precursors of metastasis in various
      cancer types and are found in the blood of cancer patients as single CTCs and CTC clusters,
      with the latter featuring a higher ability to seed metastasis.

      CTC cluster share several properties that commonly feature stem cell biology which drive
      metastases formation. Preclinical data shows that CTC clusters can be disaggregated into
      single cells by the treatment with cardiac glycosides such as digoxin. This single arm
      therapeutic exploratory study of digoxin in patients with advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer investigates whether cardiac glycosides are able to disrupt CTC clusters in breast
      cancer patients.

      Patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer in whom CTC clusters could be identified
      will receive an individualized daily maintenance dose of digoxin adapted to their kidney
      function. Blood samples for analyses of digoxin serum level and mean CTC cluster size will be
      drawn at specified time points.

    <description>Patients will receive a daily maintenance dose of digoxin. The daily dose of digoxin will be calculated according to the renal function and the target serum digoxin concentration and applied in an adjusted regimen based on the availability of 0.125 mg and 0.25 mg pills in the morning (before 10 am). Blood samples for analyses of mean CTC cluster size will be drawn at screening, on day 0 (2 hrs after first oral intake), on day 3 and on day 7. Depending on the digoxin serum level maintenance therapy with digoxin will be continued up to 3 weeks if the digoxin serum level on day 7 or day 14 is below 0.70 ng/ml. For the third week of maintenance therapy individual dose adjustments will be carried out as needed.</description>
