  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is common in surgical patients. Many studies have shown a clear association
      between malnutrition and poor surgical outcomes. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a nutrition
      intervention that is given by vein and can be safely provided to malnourished patients. It
      contains carbohydrates, fats, and protein just like you would normally in your diet.
      Pre-operative PN is able to improve outcomes in surgical patients. However, pre-operative PN
      has traditionally required hospital admission which results in increased length of stay,
      hospital cost, and hospital-acquired infection. Moreover, in hospital pre-operative PN may
      not be feasible or prioritized when access to inpatient surgery beds is limited. Outpatient
      PN provides the opportunity to solve this problem. The feasibility and impact of outpatient
      PN in malnourished patients undergoing major surgery have not previously been studied. This
      study aims to evaluate the feasibility of outpatient pre-operative PN and its effect on
      patient's outcomes.

    <description>Quality of life evaluated by Short Form (SF)-12 questionnaire A mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12) are calculated by summation of mental and physical questions, respectively. The score range from 0-100, which the higher score means the better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Nutrition status evaluated by patient-generated subjective global assessment
Patient-generated subjective global assessment divides a patient into 3 groups:
A = well-nourished B = moderately malnourished or suspected malnutrition C = severely malnourished The total score is also calculated by summation of scores from weight, food intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, activity, metabolic demand, and physical examination. It ranges from 0-55, which the lower score means the better nutrition status.</description>
