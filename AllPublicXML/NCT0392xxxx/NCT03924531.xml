  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence is a major problem for the approximately one-third of Americans over the age of 20
      who suffer from Hypertension (HTN). Hypertension can be controlled through medication
      adherence and lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise). However, nearly 50% of those with
      HTN report poor adherence to their antihypertensive medications, lifestyle changes, or both
      as primary reasons for failing to control their blood pressure. Currently, behavioral
      interventions are limited to providing education or reminding individuals to take better care
      of themselves by starting and adhering to proper diet and exercise program. Given the lack of
      adherence reported, education and reminders alone may not be sufficient to promote health
      behavior change. Interventions that appeal to individual's internal drive may be more
      effective, given that behavior adoption and maintenance are usually associated with intrinsic
      motivation and volition. Mindfulness practice is an intervention that shows promise in
      changing lifestyle behaviors. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of UCLA's
      Mindful Awareness Program (UCLAMAP) on promoting self-management behaviors, specifically
      adherence to medication, diet, and exercise for those individuals with HTN. We will randomize
      52 individuals with HTN who have difficulty with adherence to antihypertensive medications
      and lifestyle changes to the intervention group or the attention-control group. The
      intervention includes six sessions of the mindfulness training through UCLA's Mindful
      Awareness Research Center (MARC).
