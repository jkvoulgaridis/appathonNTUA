  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Efficacy and safety of Non-anesthesiologist administered propofol (NAAP) for
      gastrointestinal endoscopy have been widely documented although there is not information
      which has evaluated the outcomes of colonoscopy it self when the endoscopist has to fulfill
      the additional task of supervising the sedation.

      Objective: To determine the equivalence of adenoma detection rate (ADR) in colorectal cancer
      (CRC) screening colonoscopies performed with NAAP and performed with monitored anesthesia
      care (MAC).

      Method: Single blind non-randomized controlled equivalence trial. Patients: Adults between 50
      - 69 years old from National CRC screening program (CRCSP). Intervention: The patients are
      blindly assigned to undergo either colonoscopy with NAAP or MAC according to the arrival of
      fecal occult blood test, patient's suitability for colonoscopy date and availability of
      places at endoscopy schedule (with NAAP or MAC).

    <description>The nurse begins with fentanyl infusion in bolus: 75 μg (1.5 ml) and initial propofol dose (10mg/ml) in bolus of 0.5 - 2.5 mg/Kg followed by a maintenance dose of 20 - 60ml/h through Target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump. In this way, we get a target level sedation between 1 - 3, according to Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAAS).
The role of the nurse, directed by an endoscopist, it is exclusively the administration of intravenous drugs and the patient monitorship throughout the procedure.</description>
