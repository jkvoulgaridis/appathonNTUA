  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Itch is the commonest skin-related symptom. There is increasing evidence that itch can be
      influenced by visual cues. The impact of colors on itch has not yet been studied.

      This study investigates Itch modification by color viewing and whether patients can match or
      counteract their itch with a color.

    <description>Patients relate their itch to a color of the Manchester Color Wheel (MCW) and choose a color of the MCW aimed at counteracting their itch. They complete the ItchyQoL (German version), which is a standard tool to assess itch-related quality of life. Then patients look at their &quot;antipruritic&quot; monochrome color for five minutes on a lap-top screen. Itch intensity (0-10 NRS) will be assessed at baseline and again after the patients looked at this color for 5 minutes.</description>
