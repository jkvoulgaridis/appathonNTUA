  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: While office BP measurements were traditionally used to detect, diagnose and
      manage hypertension(HT), studies had convincingly showed that out-of-office blood pressure,
      including home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      (ABPM), was superior in predicting cardiovascular outcomes and death. Furthermore, some
      countries' guidelines suggested the use of validated automatic blood pressure machines
      (called automated office blood pressure monitoring (AOBP)) to screen for HT and record BP in
      routine HT clinical management. With difference between guidelines and various available BP
      measurement methods, it is not known how primary care doctors, who play the key role to
      detect and treat HT, are measuring BP in their daily practice.

      Method: All doctors registered in the primary care directory will be mailed a questionnaire.
      Those who do not respond would be mailing for maximally 3 times, 2 weeks apart to enhance
      response rate. It is estimated that around 1500-2000 doctors will be eligible.
