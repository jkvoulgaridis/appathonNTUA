  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-center study. Bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with
      CA-CRE will be compared to those from hospitalized patients with healthcare-associated CRE
      (HA-CRE). In addition, community spread of CRE will be determined.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are discharged home from the hospital and meet criteria for possible CA-CRE will
      be recruited. These index participants will be interviewed to determine the epidemiologic
      network, and will be mailed a monthly BioWipe kit to screen for ongoing CRE intestinal
      carriage. Contacts of the index participant will also be approached and mailed a BioWipe kit
      to screen for the presence of CRE and/or carbapenemase gene(s) that were present in the index
      patient. If this initial sample is negative, the contact is not further interviewed or
      tested. If the initial screening is positive for the carbapenemase gene of interest, then the
      contact will be asked to answer the same questions as the index patient and will receive a
      monthly BioWipe kit. For each positive contact, a second-generation network of contacts will
      be constructed, who in turn will be approached for screening.

      An additional subset of participants, those with CDC-defined CRE isolated during
      hospitalization who are not discharged home will also be included. All CRE isolates that are
      isolated from the patient as part of routine clinical care will be sub-cultured and shipped
      to the central research laboratory. A limited data set will be collected.

    <description>In community contacts of patients discharged from the hospital after CRE diagnosis, the presence or absence of CRE in stool samples will be determined by culture. Then, the total number of community contacts with CRE-positive stool cultures will be divided by the total number of tested community contacts to derive the proportion of community contacts with stool cultures positive for CRE.</description>
