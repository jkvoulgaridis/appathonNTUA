  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence called
      golden-angle radial compressed sensing and parallel imaging (GRASP) as a noninvasive and fast
      way to measure the wash-in contrast (dye) in the breast. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and
      radio waves to create images of structures in the body. The goal is to determine if benign
      and malignant breast lesions have different patterns of contrast wash in.

      This study will ask woman planning to undergo a clinical breast MRI with contrast (dye) as
      part of their standard care.
