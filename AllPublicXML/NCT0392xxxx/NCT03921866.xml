      What are the real-world treatment patterns, patients' characteristics, clinical outcomes and
      healthcare resource utilisation associated with palbociclib treatment in the 3 years
      following initiation in United Kingdom patients with hormone receptor-positive, human
      epidermal growth factor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer treated as part of the IPP?

      Hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC) represents the largest therapeutic subtype
      of the disease, accounting for 60 to 65% of all malignant neoplasms of the breast.
      Palbociclib (Ibrance®) is a small-molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6
      (CDK4/6) which in clinical trial settings has been shown to increase progression-free
      survival (PFS) for patients with HR+, human epidermal growth factor 2-negative (HER2-)
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Palbociclib first received a European Union (EU) marketing
      authorisation in September 2016, to be commercialised as Ibrance® by Pfizer. Palbociclib was
      recommended for use with an aromatase inhibitor in patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced
      and MBC in the National Health Service (NHS) in England by the National Institute for Health
      and Care Excellence (NICE) in November 2017 and by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) in
      December 2017. In order to provide access to palbociclib in the United Kingdom (UK) during
      the NICE/SMC appraisal period, the Ibrance® Patient Program (IPP) was initiated and run by
      Pfizer between April 2017 until a positive NICE/SMC appraisal in November 2017 (for England
      and Wales) or December 2017 (for Scotland).

      Pfizer are interested in the opportunity to collect data from patients who received
      palbociclib as part of the UK IPP, to better understand patients' characteristics in a
      routine care setting, treatment persistence and dose management, clinical outcomes, and
      healthcare resource utilisation. This study will provide real-world evidence on patients'
      clinical progression and experience of treatment with palbociclib in routine clinical
      settings in a UK context.

      Research question:

      What are the real-world treatment patterns, patients' characteristics, clinical outcomes and
      healthcare resource utilisation associated with palbociclib treatment in the 3 years
      following initiation in United Kingdom patients with HR+/HER2- MBC treated as part of the
      IPP?
