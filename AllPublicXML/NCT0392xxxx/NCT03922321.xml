        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of Graves' disease with hyperthyroidism associated with active,
             moderate to severe GO with a Clinical Activity Score (CAS) ≥ 4 for the most severely
             affected eye at Screening (on the 7-item scale) and Baseline (on the 10-item scale).

          3. Onset of active GO within 9 months of screening.

          4. Moderate-to-severe active GO (not sight-threatening but has an appreciable impact on
             daily life), usually associated with one or more of the following: lid retraction ≥ 2
             mm, moderate or severe soft tissue involvement, proptosis ≥ 3 mm above normal for race
             and gender, and/or inconstant or constant diplopia.

          5. Other, more specific inclusion criteria are defined in the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of any steroid (intravenous [IV] or oral) with a cumulative dose equivalent to ≥ 1
             g of methylprednisolone for the treatment of GO within 3 weeks prior to Screening.

          2. Use of rituximab, tocilizumab, or any monoclonal antibody for immunomodulation within
             the past 9 months prior to Baseline.

          3. Total IgG level &lt; 6g/L at Screening.

          4. Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1500 cells/mm3 at Screening.

          5. Participants with decreased best corrected visual acuity due to optic neuropathy as
             defined by a decrease in vision of 2 lines on the Snellen chart, new visual field
             defect, or color defect secondary to optic nerve involvement within the last 6 months
             at Screening.

          6. Previous orbital irradiation or surgery for GO.

          7. Other, more specific exclusion criteria are defined in the protocol
