  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to detect the whole genome hydroxymethylation of peripheral blood
      ct DNA in normal population, patients with p0~pI esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and
      pII~pIV esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by using DNA methylation detection technology. To
      compare the differences in genomic methylation levels between different groups, to find out
      the methylolation site system associated with early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and
      to verify the genes related to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by ctDNA methylolation.
      Application of basicization in early screening of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

      The aim of this study was to detect the whole genome hydroxymethylation of peripheral blood
      ct DNA in normal population, patients with p0~pI esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and
      pII~pIV esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by using DNA methylation detection technology. The
      differences in genomic methylation levels between different groups were compared to identify
      the methylolation site system associated with early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Then,
      using the genomic methylolation technique, 5hmC-DNA enrichment was performed on the
      peripheral venous blood samples of the experimental group before surgery and the peripheral
      venous blood samples of the control group, respectively, and then the high abundance and high
      significance were selected. The 5hmC-DNA fragment was verified by PCR amplification. The
      genes related to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were verified by ctDNA methylolation.
      Finally, the methylolation genes related to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were
      identified, and the application of DNA methylation in early screening of esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma was explored.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by pathological cytology and
             histology.

          2. Clinically judged patients with p0~pIV initial treatment.（1 Variable risk factors are
             overeating food (habits) and family history. 2 Among all the patients, the ratio of
             male to female is 3:1, and the age is between 50 and 70 years old. In addition to
             eating too hot food, other eating habits (such as eating fresh fruits and vegetables,
             eating preserved food, etc.) are consistent, other factors (such as BMI, smoking,
             drinking, etc.) as much as possible. 3 In order to rule out the interference of other
             diseases, each sample needs to be determined to have no history of other diseases
             (such as neurodegenerative diseases, leukemia).）

          3. The normal population comes from the healthy population of Nanfang Hospital Health
             Center of Southern Medical University.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Preoperative patients have received relevant treatment, such as radiotherapy and
             chemotherapy;

          2. The subject has other diseases, such as tumors in other parts;

          3. Patients do not meet the age;

          4. There is no guarantee that other eating habits (such as eating fresh fruits and
             vegetables, not eating preserved foods) and other factors (such as BMI, smoking,
             drinking, etc.) are basically the same.
