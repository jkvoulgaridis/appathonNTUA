      This study aims to compare the effects of concentric and eccentric isokinetic exercises on
      proprioception and muscle architecture in patients with knee osteoarthritis. 69 patients will
      be included in this study. Patients will be divided into three groups; concentric exercise
      group (n:23), eccentric exercise group (n:23) and control group (n:23). A conventional
      physiotherapy program and a standard therapeutic exercise program will be applied to all
      subjects. In addition to these exercise and physiotherapy programme, concentric and eccentric
      exercise groups will perform the exercises related to their groups. All three groups will
      participate in this program for a total of 18 sessions 3 times a week for 6 weeks. All groups
      will be subject to re-evaluation after 6 weeks.

    <measure>Ultrasonographic assessment of quadriceps and hamstring muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasonographic evaluation is an outcome measure to evaluate muscle structure. In our study ultrasonographic evaluation will be performed to determine the muscle structure (muscle thickness(mm), fascicle length(mm), pennation angle(degree)) of quadriceps and hamstring muscles. Muscle thickness will be defined as the distance between the deeper and upper aponeurosis. The pennation angle will be calculated as the angle of insertion of muscle fascicles into the deep aponeurosis. Fascicle length will be defined as the length of the fascicular path between the superficial and deep aponeurosis.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index (score range 0-100) include 3 subscales and will be used to evaluate knee pain(score range 0-20), stiffness (score range 0-8), and functional limitation (score range -68). Womac is comprised of 24 items ( pain-5 items, stiffness-2 items, physical function-17 items). All items are scored on a scale of 0-4. Lower scores indicate lower disability.</description>

    <measure>Pain assessment: VAS (Visual analog scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is used to measure the psycometric pain severity in some conditions and activities. A VAS is usually a 100 mm long horizontal line. The scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (line's left, score-0), &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; (line's right, score-100). the score is determined by measuring the distance between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TUG test is used to measure functional mobility. It gives an idea about patients walking ability, fall risk and balance. The patient is asked to get up, walk 3 meters and sit down again.Timing begins when the patient rise from the chair and stops when the patient sit down.</description>

It covers eight domains of health outcomes, including physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning,role-emotional, mental health. Sf-12 physical and mental component summary scales are scored. Lower SF-12 score indicated poorer physical and mental health.</description>
