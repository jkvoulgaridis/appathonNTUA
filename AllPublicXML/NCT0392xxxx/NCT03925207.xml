  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrobulbar block is used to provide perioperative analgesia and anesthesia for orbital ball
      implants after enucleation surgery in the investigator's hospital. Retrobulbar block alone
      can provide quicker recovery, decreased time to discharge, opioid sparing, reduced costs.
      However, patients undergoing orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery with retrobulbar
      block alone suffered more preoperative and intraoperative anxiety，postoperative pain, and
      postoperative nausea and vomiting. General anesthesia alone is administered to patients
      undergoing orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery and opioids are used in adjunct
      with general anesthesia to suppress pain and hemodynamic stress associated with surgical
      trauma. GA only associated with more systemic opioids, short-term cognitive impairment,
      somnolence, and postoperative nausea and vomiting that can increase patient morbidity and
      delay discharge. Opioids, however, can result in adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting,
      pruritus, sedation. As a result of this growing demand of efficient and effective anesthesia
      management for orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery is becoming increasingly
      important. Numerous studies have reported benefits of an retrobulbar block for orbital ball
      implants after enucleation surgery, including quicker recovery and decreased time to
      discharge, decreased pain scores, opioid sparing, reduced costs, less intraoperative
      hemodynamic variability, improved patient satisfaction, and, in some cases, reduced GA-
      and/or opioid-related side effects. A recent systematic review examining all modes of
      postoperative pain management following orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery
      concluded that retrobulbar block are superior to all other forms of postoperative pain
      control.

      This retrospective review examined postoperative outcomes for orbital ball implants after
      enucleation surgery patients who underwent surgery with general anesthesia (GA), single-shot
      retrobulbar block, or retrobulbar block combined with GA. The primary outcome included
      postoperative pain upon arrival at and discharge from the PACU, analgesic consumption and
      rescue analgesia. Secondary outcomes was time to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit
      (PACU) as well as GA and opioid-related side effects and retrobulbar block- associated
      neurological complications. The investigators speculated that patients who received an
      retrobulbar block before GA had less postoperative pain, and reduced analgesic requirements
      when compared with patients who received GA Only or retrobulbar block alone.
