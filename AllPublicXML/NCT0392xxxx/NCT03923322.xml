  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a follow-up larger RCT on
      the efficacy of Botanical Tincture to relieve abdominal pain in people with Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome Constipation Predominant (IBS-C).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The randomized pilot trial will address subject recruitment, retention, and subject
      compliance with protocol. A secondary is to learn if people with IBS-C are able to tolerate
      Botanical Tincture and the effect of taking Botanical Tincture on abdominal pain, bloating,
      and bowel movements.

    <description>The 12-week study includes a 2-week screening, 8-week treatment, and 2-week withdrawal periods. A 2-week screening period will be used to establish the presence and persistence of trial entry criteria and train patients in the mode of data collection. Participants randomly assigned to the Botanical Tincture arm at Week 2 will take 2.5 ml by mouth once a day at any time during the day that they choose. Participants who received Botanical Tincture during the study will be followed by a 2-week randomized withdrawal design to address the need for maintenance treatment to prevent sign or symptom recurrence. The participant will be randomly reassigned to receive either Botanical Tincture or placebo at a dosage of 2.5 ml once a day by mouth at any time during the day that they prefer.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients meeting ROME IV criteria for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome that
             requires that patients have had recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day per
             week during the previous 3 months that is associated with 2 or more of the following :

          -  Related to defecation (may be increased or unchanged by defecation)

          -  Associated with a change in stool frequency

          -  Associated with a change in stool form or appearance

          -  Abdominal Pain Intensity: average of worst daily (in past 24 hours) abdominal pain
             score of &gt;= 3 on a 0 to 10 point scale over last week

          -  Stool Frequency: &lt; or = to 3 Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement(CSBM) in the previous
             week

          -  Reported bloating rating &gt; or = 2 on 5-point scale [0 (absent) - 4 (very severe)] in
             previous week

          -  English speakers, as all surveys are in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the trial drugs

          -  History of eating disorders

          -  Patients with a history of diseases with abdominal symptoms that can resemble IBS

          -  Presence of any other known acute or chronic gastrointestinal disorder

          -  History of abdominal surgery (cholecystectomy and appendectomy can be tolerated when
             performed at least one year previously)

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Current or past history of alcohol dependence

          -  Based on lack of adequate scientific evidence to predict drug-drug interaction in
             vivo, current use of strong inhibitors or inducers for CYP enzymes and participants
             are instructed not to take any medications that are strong inhibitors or inducers for
             CYP enzymes during the course of the study

          -  Vulnerable Subjects. The study will not include vulnerable subjects (such as, those
             with limited autonomy or those in subordinate hierarchical positions). Children,
             pregnant women, nursing home residents or other institutionalized persons, students,
             employees, fetuses, prisoners, and persons with decisional incapacity will not be
