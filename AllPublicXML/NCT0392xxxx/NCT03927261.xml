  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, nonrandomized, investigator-initiated Phase 1/1b safety and
      tolerability study. The safety and tolerability of PRGN-3006 T cells will be assessed
      following intravenous administration of escalating doses in patients with relapsed or
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

      This study will enroll in two phases: an initial dose escalation phase followed by a dose
      expansion phase.
