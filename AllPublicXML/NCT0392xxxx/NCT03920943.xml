    <textblock>
      Evaluate the reliability and validity of temperature measurements using an existing, Health
      Canada-approved, non-invasive temporal artery thermometer, and comparing results to an
      established, invasive gold standard (esophageal probe), in order to assess reliability of
      this non-invasive method to measure core body temperature in the setting of patients
      undergoing inter-facility patient transport by land, rotor-wing, and fixed-wing transport
      vehicles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interfacility patient transport can put the patient at risk a drop in body temperature. This
      drop can harmful to patients with particular illnesses (trauma, stroke, post cardiac arrest),
      and the very young or old. Measuring temperature and preventing temperature drops are
      challenging in the transport setting. The temporal artery thermometer (TAT) is widely
      available, easy to use, non-invasive way to measure body temperature. TAT is believed to be a
      good tool for paramedics to measure body temperature in the transport setting. However, the
      evidence on reliability and validity of TAT-derived temperature measurements is lacking
      because the TAT has not been evaluated in the transport setting. The goal of this study is to
      evaluate the reliability of the TAT device and compare measures of temperature with an
      established standard in a broad range of patients undergoing interfacility transport by land
      ambulance, and rotor- and fixed-wing aircraft.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing emergent or urgent interfacility patient transport by Ornge in Ontario, Canada. The study will include all patients, regardless of age, who are intubated and mechanically ventilated, and transported for emergent or urgent indications.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Paramedics will measure core temperature at least 5 minutes after invasive monitoring device insertion, prior to departure from the sending facility, once the transport vehicle in is motion for at least 10 minutes, and at 1 hour intervals thereafter (if transport time exceeds 1 hour). The invasive device will be placed by one paramedic, with the result recorded by the transport monitor. The other paramedic will simultaneously use the TAT to take the temperatures, documenting the results in the electronic patient care record.</description>

    <description>As part of the standard of care, flight paramedics will insert an esophageal or rectal temperature probe in patients meeting including criteria to enable continuous temperature monitoring. Paramedics will measure core temperature on at least two occasions, the first measurements made at least 5 minutes after insertion of the temperature probe, and also prior to departure from the sending facility.</description>

    <description>The study intervention will involve paramedics using the TAT device to measure temperature non-invasively,the first measurements made at least 5 minutes after insertion of the temperature probe (control measurement #1), and also prior to departure from the sending facility (control measurement #2). Once the patient is in the transport vehicle and the vehicle in motion for at least 10 minutes, the paramedics will measure the patient's temperature non-invasively using the TAT. If the transport time exceeds 1 hour, additional measurements taken at 1 hour intervals for the duration of transport (up to a total of 8 hours).</description>
