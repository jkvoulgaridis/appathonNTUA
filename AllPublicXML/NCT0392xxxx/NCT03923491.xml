    <textblock>
      U.S. children eat too little fruits and vegetables and whole grains, and too many energy
      dense foods, dietary behaviors associated with increased morbidity from cardiovascular
      diseases. Parents play a key role in shaping their child's diet and best practices suggest
      that parents should involve children in food preparation, offer, model and encourage a
      variety of healthy foods. In addition, while parents help to shape food preferences, not all
      children respond in the same way and certain appetitive traits, such as satiety
      responsiveness (sensitivity to internal satiety signals), food responsiveness (sensitivity to
      external food cues), and enjoyment of food may help explain some of these differences. Prior
      interventions among preschool aged children to improve their diet have not used a holistic
      approach that fully targets the home food environment, by focusing on food quality, food
      preparation, and positive feeding practices while acknowledging a child's appetitive traits.
      This proposal will build upon pre-pilot work to develop and pilot-test the feasibility,
      acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a novel home-based intervention. The proposed
      6-month intervention, will include 3 monthly home visits by a community health worker (CHW)
      trained in motivational interviewing, that include in-home cooking demos. In between visits,
      parents will receive tailored text-messages 2x/wk. and monthly mailed tailored materials.
      During the last 3 months CHW phone calls will replace the home visits. The intervention will
      be tailored for individual families based on the child's appetitive traits. The proposed
      research will lay the groundwork for a larger trial to support, motivate, and empower
      low-income parents to prepare healthy meals and use healthy feeding practices, which will
      improve children's diets and ultimately their health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical need for primary prevention interventions to help parents shape
      children's dietary behaviors early in life. These interventions need to be convenient for
      busy, working families and tailored to children's needs and the family environment. Although
      there have been several interventions among preschool aged children to improve dietary
      behaviors, none have used a holistic approach that fully targets the home food environment,
      by focusing on food quality, food preparation, and positive feeding practices while
      acknowledging a child's appetitive traits. The proposed research will develop and pilot-test
      the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a novel home-based intervention to
      improve the diet quality and family food environment of high-risk preschool age, low-income,
      ethnically diverse children. This research will build upon previous research including a
      pre-pilot intervention with 15 mother-child dyads which included two home visits: the first
      visit included a meal-recording and the second included a motivational interviewing (MI)
      session using coded video clips from the meal-recording as feedback on the parents' feeding
      practices. All families were retained and significant improvements in several parental
      feeding practices were found. Based on lessons learned in the pre-pilot, the proposed 6-month
      intervention will include home visits by a community health worker (CHW) trained in MI,
      enhanced by adding several innovative components. The home visits will include in-home
      cooking demonstrations; tailored text-messages, mailed materials and CHW phone calls. The
      intervention will be tailored for families based on the child's appetitive traits and eating
      behaviors. These strategies are expected to increase parental knowledge, self-efficacy, and
      motivation for serving easy, inexpensive healthy foods in the home, leading to increased
      child exposure to more healthy and varied foods, improvements in parental feeding practices,
      and ultimately, improvements in child diet quality. The specific aims are as follows:

      Aim 1: To conduct focus groups with 40 ethnically diverse low-income parents of preschoolers
      (2-5 years) to inform the adaptation and development of the enhanced intervention.

      Aim 2: To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial with 60 parent-child pairs (30
      intervention/30 control) from ethnically diverse, low-income families with preschoolers to:

      Aim 2.1 Determine the feasibility and acceptability of the enhanced intervention.

      Aim 2.2 Determine the preliminary efficacy of the enhanced intervention on changes in
      children's diet quality (primary outcome) and parental feeding practices and availability of
      healthy foods in the home (secondary outcomes) and calculate effect sizes for a future
      randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be feasible and acceptable to
      parents and that parent-child pairs randomized to the intervention condition will demonstrate
      greater improvements in the outcomes after six months compared to the comparison condition
      (attention control of a school readiness intervention).

      Exploratory aim: Explore how parents' skills, self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation are
      related to changes in children's diet quality and parental feeding practices.

    <description>Healthy Eating Index Change Scores. HEI-2015 scores will be calculated from twenty four hour recall data (two of them). HEI was designed to measure diet quality in terms of how well diets conform to the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The total HEI score represents the sum of 12 components scores (maximum component score shown in parentheses), including total fruit (5), whole fruit (5), total vegetables (5), green and beans (includes dark green vegetables and cooked, dried beans and peas because intakes of these types of vegetables are furthest from the amounts recommended in the USDA Food Patterns) (5), whole grain (10), dairy (10), total protein food (5), seafood and plant proteins (5), fatty acids (10), refined grains (10), sodium (10) and empty calories (20). Total HEI scores can have a maximum value of 100 which indicates high diet quality.</description>

    <time_frame>Changes in Home Food Inventory Scores between baseline and study completion at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Home Food Inventory Change Scores. Home food inventory (HFI) will be used to assess a wide range of commonly available foods in the home environment. A total healthy food availability score will be created from the following items (fruit- frozen, canned, fresh or dried, vegetables-frozen, fresh or canned, milk, water, whole grains, legumes) with a higher score representing more availability of healthy foods. Scores can range from 0-11. An unhealthy food score will also be created from the following items (Chips, Cakes/Cookies, Candy, Pastries, Juice, Soda, Sports drinks, Sweetened Beverages)- scores can range from 0-8 with higher scores representing availability of unhealthy foods.</description>

    <description>The experimental arm will receive three home over the first three months of the intervention.Visits will be conducted by a community health worker (CHW) trained in Motivational Interviewing. The home visits will include video-feedback on a meal; in-home cooking demonstrations; tailored text-messages, and mailed materials. During the last three months of the intervention, CHW will conduct monthly phone calls, together with mailed materials and text messages. The intervention will be tailored for families based on the child's appetitive traits and eating behaviors.</description>

    <description>The Reading and Readiness group will receive information on school readiness promotion. Materials will be adapted and delivered by the community health worker (CHW) with a similar dose and schedule as the intervention group (three home visits and three phone calls). During the home visits, the CHW will show a video that models early childhood caregiver-child activities and demonstrates simple methods to interact with their children. They will also send a video of themselves reading with a child, receive text-messages based on these materials as well as the print materials during the last three months of the intervention.</description>
