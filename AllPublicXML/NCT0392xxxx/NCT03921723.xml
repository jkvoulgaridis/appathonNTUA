  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, single dose, non-randomized, sequential, fixed-sequence
      study, which will evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of dolutegravir (DTG) in healthy adult
      subjects. The study will contain 6 periods with five prototype liquid formulations for
      evaluation in fasted state. In period 1, 2 and 3 single reference dose of 2 dispersible
      tablets of 5 milligram DTG will be administered and at least 2 liquid prototype DTG
      formulations (containing a target total dose of 10mg DTG). There will be a wash-out period of
      7 days between each period. In period 4 through 6, there would be options to evaluate
      additional prototype liquid formulations. The total duration of study will be up to 17 weeks.
      DTG has been found to be safe and effective in adults infected with human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV), and DTG liquid formulation are being developed for the treatment of HIV-infected
      pediatric subjects who weigh less than 25 kilograms (Kgs). Approximately 18 subjects will be
      enrolled in this study.
