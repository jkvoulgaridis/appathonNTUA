    <textblock>
      This is a randomized multi-arm trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of thoracic radiation
      therapy followed by either durvalumab as monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab or
      olaparib in participants with Extensive-Stage Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC) who
      have completed a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and achieved ongoing complete
      response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD).
