  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test if high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy is noninferior to NIV for preventing
      postextubation respiratory failure and reintubation in patients with hypercapnic COPD,
      investigators plan to conduct the participants level, 1:1 randomized trial at the respiratory
      ICU. Participants were randomized to undergo either high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy or
      noninvasive mechanical ventilation after extubation. Primary outcomes were reintubation and
      postextubation respiratory failure within 72 hours. Secondary outcomes included length of
      RICU stay after extubation and mortality; partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide.

    <description>High-flowoxygenwas applied immediately after extubation through specific nasal cannula. Flow was initially set at 10 L/min and titrated upwards in 5-L/min steps until patients experienced discomfort.Temperature was initially set to 37°C, unless reported too hot by patients, and FIO2 was regularly adjusted to the target peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SPO2) of greater than 92%. After 24 hours, high-flow was stopped and, if necessary, patients received conventional oxygen therapy.</description>

    <description>Full face mask NIV was continuously delivered immediately after extubation for a scheduled period of 24 hours after extubation. Afterward, NIV was withdrawn and oxygen was administered by Venturi mask.Both PEEP and inspiratory pressure supportwere adjusted to target a respiratory rate of 25/min and adequate gas exchange (arterial oxygen saturation [SaO2] 92%, with pH of 7.35). The FIO2 was adjusted to maintain SPO2 at less than 92%. Sedatives to increase tolerance to NIV were not allowed.</description>
