  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to include 100 local participants over the next 5 years in a two-stage
      sequential randomized interventional study of intralesional Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Bacillus
      Calmette Guerin (BCG) to assess the utility of treating cutaneous metastatic melanoma (CMM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first stage of the study, all consenting CMM patients will be randomized and will
      receive 4 treatments of either intralesional IL-2 or intralesional IL-2 and BCG. We
      hypothesize that patients with MM (stage 3C or 4a with a minimum of 4 lesions) that receive
      combination therapy (IL-2/BCG) in the first stage of treatment will have a higher complete
      response (iCR) rate compared to IL-2 therapy alone.

      Response to stage-one treatment will be monitored and patient response to treatment will be
      determined and reported according to Immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours
      (iRECIST) guidelines. Based on response to stage-one treatment, patients will be placed into
      a response group before entering stage two. For stage two of the trial, patients will be
      randomized again, and placed into a treatment group; Il-2, IL-2 and BCG, BCG, or Discontinue
      Treatment. Response to treatment will be monitored and patient response to treatment will be
      determined and reported according to iRECIST guidelines.

      All patients will have lesions biopsied following standard surgical practice techniques and
      will provide urine and blood for analysis. Tissue samples will be assessed for immune system
      activity and transcriptome analysis, and urine and blood will be assessed for immune cell
      populations and markers. All patients will be followed for 5 years post treatment, and
      patient disease and survival status will be recorded according to iRECIST.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized to first stage treatment and allocated to 1) IL-2 or 2) IL-2/BCG treatment. First stage treatment patients receive 4 treatments of 1) IL-2 or 2) IL-2 and BCG. Patient response will be determined for treatment groups following iRECIST guidelines as; 1) complete responder, 2) partial responder, or 3) stable disease. In second stage treatment, patients who completely respond to first stage treatment will be randomized to 1) discontinue treatment and followed every 3 mos for 2 yrs and then every 6 mos from yrs 3-5, or 2) will receive 2 additional treatments and then followed every 3 mos for 2 yrs and then every 6 mos from yrs 3-5. Patients that do not completely respond to first stage treatment, will be re-staged using a PET/CT scan. Patients not requiring escalation to systemic therapy will be randomized and advance to second stage treatment (IL-2, IL-2 and BCG, or BCG).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the achievement of a superior response rate in patients receiving combination IL-2/BCG treatment compared to patients receiving IL-2 alone. Patient response to treatment will be monitored and patients will be categorized as 1) complete responders, 2) partial responders or 3) stable disease. Data will be analyzed by one-way ANOVA to compare proportion outcomes amongst treatment and response groups.</description>
