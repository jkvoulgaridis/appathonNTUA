  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, non-randomised, dose-escalation single agent study with
      expansion cohorts for dose confirmation/safety and preliminary efficacy of MCLA-145 in
      advanced or metastatic malignancies
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Design: This open label, multicenter, first in human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1
      is a dose escalation to find the recommended dose for the expansion.

      Part 2 is a dose expansion to confirm the dose of MCLA-145 through further evaluation of
      safety, tolerability, Pk, preliminary antitumor activity, and functional target engagement.

      The study includes three periods: Screening( up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study
      drug); Treatment( first dose of study drug with treatment cycles of 28 days); and Follow-up (
      30 days and 90 days after the last dose) including survival follow-up checks every 2 months
      up to 12 months after the last dose.

    <description>In Part 1, the dose escalation phase, patients with advanced or recurrent/metastatic solid tumors or B-cell lymphomas will receive escalating doses of MCLA-145 ( every 2 weeks ) until MTD or RDE is reached. In Part 2, the expansion phase, participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors will receive intravenous infusion of MCLA-145 at the recommended phase II dose every 2 weeks. The duration of each treatment cycle is 28 days</description>
