    <textblock>
      This trial studies how changes in microRNAs may correlate with sepsis outcomes. Sepsis is a
      type of severe infection of the blood stream, and its diagnosis may be obscured by many other
      conditions such as surgery, trauma, and cancer. MicroRNAs are biomarkers found in the blood
      and tissue. Blood samples may help correlate changes in microRNA expression to patient
      reactions to a sepsis infection.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine whether the cellular and viral micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) changes in plasma
      and peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMNCs) correlate with the diagnosis and outcome of
      sepsis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To distinguish systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) without infection from
      sepsis and septic shock.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A: Patients undergo blood specimen collection at baseline (before surgery), the day
      after surgery, either the day of hospital discharge or the day of sepsis diagnosis, and 6
      days after the baseline blood draw if still hospitalized.

      GROUP B: Patients undergo blood specimen collection at baseline (day of sepsis diagnosis),
      the day after baseline, and on day 7 from baseline if still hospitalized.

    <description>For each of the cellular and viral miRNAs, samples from patients with sepsis versus (vs.) patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) without sepsis vs. patients presenting for pre-op evaluation (reference group without SIRS or sepsis) will be compared by one-way analysis of variance. Will compare the miRNA expression intergroup differences.</description>
