  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard psychological therapy for psychosis (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) is made up of
      different 'ingredients', also called treatment components. In therapy, different treatment
      components can be included or excluded depending on the needs of the individual. In this
      study, the investigators want to find out if standard psychological therapy for psychosis can
      be improved by including new treatment components. Therefore, participants in this study will
      be offered psychological therapy for psychosis with new treatment components included or
      standard psychological therapy for psychosis without new treatment components included. Which
      of these two options participants are offered will be decided by chance, and during the study
      neither the study participants nor the researcher will know which of these two variations of
      psychological therapy are given. Researchers call this a randomized double-blind study. The
      investigators are aiming to use the results from this study to guide the improvement of
      psychological therapies for psychosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with psychosis often experience delusions, hallucinations and disorganised
      thinking. Clinicians call these 'positive symptoms' as they are seen as an addition to
      regular functioning. Psychosis can also lead to loss of some functions such as lower
      motivation and decreased interest in activities; these are called 'negative symptoms'. Even
      though most people receive medication for psychosis, psychological therapies such as
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) are also important in terms of managing
      symptoms and increasing well-being. Standard CBTp is made up of different treatment
      components and in therapy, different treatment components can be included or excluded
      depending on the needs of the individual. In this study the investigators are looking to
      identify treatment components that are beneficial to CBTp. In particular, the aim is to test
      whether adding some newly developed treatment components to CBTp can lead to additional
      benefits to patients, in terms of reducing unhelpful thinking styles. This will be done
      through a double-blind randomized case-series design, where participants will either receive
      standard CBTp or standard CBTp with added treatment components.

      Four weeks before the intervention starts, throughout therapy, as well as four weeks after
      therapy, participants will complete weekly questionnaires to assess symptoms and thinking
      patterns. This will allow the researcher to measure weekly changes before, during and after
      the therapy. Additional questionnaires and interviews as well as computer tasks will also be
      completed before the therapy starts (baseline), mid-therapy and post-therapy to gain more
      insight into changes in mood, quality of life, thinking patterns and symptoms. In addition,
      to study the long-term effect of the intervention, participants will be asked to complete a
      follow-up assessment session 12 weeks after the therapy is completed. Participants and
      clinicians will also be given the opportunity to give feedback on their experience of having
      received/delivered the therapy. This will be done through an interview with the researcher,
      and will give us further insight into how future therapies for psychosis might be improved,
      both from a clinician and patient perspective.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Session by session change in positive symptoms as measured by the The Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS, Haddock et al.,1999).</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered weekly 4 weeks prior to therapy start, weekly after each therapy session (maximum 20 sessions) and weekly for 4 weeks after therapy intervention has been completed as well as 12 weeks follow-up after intervention completion.</time_frame>
    <description>The PSYRATS is a widely used measure including 17 items assessing different dimensions of delusions and auditory hallucinations that include distress, loudness, conviction, frequency, disruption to life and preoccupation. Each dimension is rated on a 0-4 point scale, with scores on the auditory hallucination subscale (11 items) ranging from 0-44 and scores on the delusion subscale (6 items) ranging from 0-24. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Session by session change in cognitive biases measured by Davos Assessment of Cognitive Biases Scales (DACOBS: van der Gaag et al., 2013).</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed weekly for 4 weeks prior to therapy start, weekly after each therapy session (maximum 20 sessions) and weekly for 4 weeks after therapy intervention has been completed.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of 42 statements relating to seven (six-item) subscales; 1) Jumping to conclusions bias 2) Belief inflexibility bias 3) Attention to threat bias 4) External attribution bias 5) Social cognition problems 6) Subjective cognitive problems and 7) Safety behaviours. Respondents score each statement using a 7-point rating scale, ranging from 'totally disagree' (1) to 'totally agree' (7). For the session-by session data, the subscales Jumping to conclusions, Belief Inflexibility Bias and External Attribution bias subscales will be administered. Each cognitive bias subscale obtains a score from 7-42, with a higher score indicating higher propensity towards a cognitive bias.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Jumping to conclusions task (Garety et al., 1991; Moritz et al., 2010).</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at 6 study assessment points: Pre-baseline (4 weeks prior to therapy start), Baseline (pre-therapy start), Post therapy session 8, Post-Therapy completion (maximun 20 sessions), as well as weeks 4 and 12 post therapy completion.</time_frame>
    <description>A computerised task where participants are presented with two lakes of coloured fish in opposing ratios (e.g. Lake A 80% red 20% green, Lake B 80% green 20% red). The participant is told that the fisherman will fish from one of these lakes only (but which lake is unknown). After each &quot;catch&quot; the participant is asked to make 2 judgements: 1) probability that the fish is caught from lake A or B and 2) Whether they are ready to make a decision on what lake the fish is caught from. This task measures participants tendency to jump to conclusions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence (BADE) task (Woodward et al., 2006)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at 6 study assessment points: Pre-baseline (4 weeks prior to therapy start), Baseline (pre-therapy start), Post therapy session 8, Post-Therapy completion (maximun 20 sessions), as well as weeks 4 and 12 post therapy completion.</time_frame>
    <description>A computerised version of the BADE task will be employed. In this task, participants will be presented a series of with delusion-neutral scenarios. For each scenario they will be asked to rate the plausibility of 4 interpretations each scenario will have a one &quot;true&quot; interpretation two &quot;lure&quot; interpretation and one &quot;absurd&quot; interpretation. After making their ratings, participants will be presented with additional scenario descriptions, which will provide further information, and participants will be allowed to adjust their ratings if necessary</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMI; Ritsher et al., 2003)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at 6 study assessment points: Pre-baseline (4 weeks prior to therapy start), Baseline (pre-therapy start), Post therapy session 8, Post-Therapy completion (maximun 20 sessions), as well as weeks 4 and 12 post therapy completion.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 29-item questionnaire that assesses subjective levels of self-stigma. Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they agree with a set of statements on a 1-4 point scale scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (4). Items add up to 5 subscales, including: alienation, stereotype endorsement, discrimination experience, social withdrawal and stigma resistance. Scores for subscales and total scores are calculated by adding the item scores and dividing by total number of answered items, with higher scores indicating higher internalized stigma.</description>
