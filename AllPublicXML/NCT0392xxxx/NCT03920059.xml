    <description>MMF will be prescribed at a starting dose of 1.5 g/day and increased to 2 g/day at week 4 (if body weight ≥ 45 kg) and continue the same dose until week 24. After week 24, MMF will be lowered to 1.5 g/day.</description>

    <description>MMF will be prescribed at a starting dose of 1.5 g/day. MPA-C0 (trough) level will be measured weekly and MMF dose will be increased by 500 mg/day every week until the MPA-C0 level ≥ 3 mg/L or the MMF dosage is 3000 mg/day. After achieving the targeted MPA-C0 level, the MMF dose adjustment will be allowed only if the MPA-C0 levels are lower than 3 mg/L for two consecutive monitoring visits. After week 12, MMF will be maintained at the same dose until week 48</description>
