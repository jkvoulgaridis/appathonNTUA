    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical research study is to demonstrate performance of the
      normalized TB specific lymphocyte response in identifying patients with active TB disease.
      The secondary exploratory objective is to demonstrate that active TB cannot be identified
      using an antigen-to-mitogen ratio derived from an ELISA-based IGRA.

      The target number of subjects is 100 active TB and 100 active TB excluded . This study will
      enroll up to 680 subjects (based on previous enrolment rates of approximately 300-350
      subjects enrolled for 50 active TB and 50 active TB excluded).

      Study Duration: 6 months

      All subjects enrolled in this study will be men or women, aged 18 years or older.
