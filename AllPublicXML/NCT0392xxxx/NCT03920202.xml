      Data assessing the long-term bowel dysfunction following low anterior resection is still
      lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate late functional results of patients who
      underwent rectal resection for rectal cancer. This included calculating LARS and Wexner score
      and identifying possible risk factors of late postoperative bowel disorders.

      For the last almost 30 years, the gold standard treatment for RC is low anterior resection
      (LAR) with total mesorectal excision (TME). Unfortunately, up to 80 % of patients undergoing
      LAR will suffer of bowel dysfunction including faecal urgency, frequent bowel movements,
      tenesmus or so called Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS). Simply it has been defined as
      &quot;disordered bowel function after rectal resection, leading to a detriment in quality of
      life&quot;. Same year LARS score was developed. This tool is easy to use and has been
      internationally and in Lithuania validated. Wexner score is another tool for evaluation of
      faecal continence.

      There are only five studies investigating long-term results after rectal surgery and
      influence it has on patients' daily life. In one study 47 of 51 patients experienced LARS
      following ultra-low anterior resection after average 6.5 years. Another study recently
      reported major LARS in 46% of the patients with the mean median follow-up of 14.6 years.
      Others showed that 47.5% of patients still experience LARS symptoms at a follow-up period of
      13.7 years. Just recently published study assessed bowel function 12 years in patients
      undergoing rectal resection with or without preventing ileostomy. Authors found that 63 (72%)
      patients of 87 experienced LARS symptoms with more than a half complaining of major LARS.
      Moreover, just last year a study published showing that 73% of patients had LARS at first
      follow up 5 years after the surgery. During the second visit (another 5 years later) same
      numbers were seen.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate late functional results of patients who underwent
      rectal resection for rectal cancer. This included calculating LARS and Wexner score and
      identifying possible risk factors of late postoperative bowel disorders.

    <description>Bowel function following low anterior resection surgery for rectal cancer will be assessed using Low anterior resection syndrome score (LARS score - simple 5 question questionnaire). LARS score is a tool consisting of five items, which are as follows: incontinence due to flatus (score range from 0 to 7), incontinence due to liquid stools (score range from 0 to 3), frequency of bowel movements (score range from 0 to 5), clustering (score range from 0 to 11) and urgency (score range from 0 to 16). The severity of each item is calculated on a scale ranging from 0 to 42, with a score of 0-20 (no LARS), 21-29 (minor LARS) and 30-42 (major LARS).</description>

        From 2007 through 2012, we identified a study population of 92 patients with biopsy proven,
        rectal cancer without distant metastasis located up to 15 cm from anal verge and undergoing
        low anterior resection with partial or total mesorectal excision. Preoperative staging was
        performed based on a digital rectal examination, chest and abdominal computer tomography
        scan (CT), pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and colonoscopy with a biopsy.
