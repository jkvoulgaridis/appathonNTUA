      The overall goal of this study is to determine if implementation of a package of
      interventions that includes DBS-based VL monitoring, coupled with an evidence-based
      intervention to improve ART adherence using cognitive-behavioral principles and genotyping
      for those with persistent viremia decreases 12-month virologic failure rates among
      HIV-infected adolescents compared with standard of care (SOC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, UNAIDS set ambitious goals to achieve 90% virologic suppression rates among
      individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). In Zimbabwe, this is an ambitious target,
      particularly among adolescents; less than 5% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
      individuals received HIV viral load (VL) testing in 2015, as reported by Ministry of Health
      and Child Care in Zimbabwe and treatment failure rates among adolescents range between 25-37%
      (Makadzange et al., 2015). Adolescents failing ART also have high rates of drug resistance.
      Scalable strategies to facilitate improved VL monitoring, adherence support, and genotyping
      for those with persistent viremia are urgently needed. We have shown that dried blood spot
      (DBS) samples can be used for routine VL monitoring on existing technologies (Makadzange et
      al., 2017) We have also adapted an evidence-based, widely-used, cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) adherence intervention (Life-Steps) for use in Zimbabwe and have identified a low-cost
      genotyping strategy that can facilitate detection of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) using
      already existing real-time polymerase chain reaction technology. Our primary study objective
      is to determine if implementation of a package of care that includes DBS-based VL monitoring,
      coupled with an evidence-based intervention to improve ART adherence using
      cognitive-behavioral principles as well as genotyping for individuals with persistent viremia
      decreases 12-month virologic failure rates among HIV-infected adolescents compared with
      standard of care (SOC). We hypothesize that our proposed package of care will result in a
      decrease in virologic failure rates among adolescents. We will also adapt and integrate Nzira
      Itsva for Adolescents (NI), a cultural adaptation of Life-Steps, into routine care as an
      adherence support intervention for HIV-infected adolescents, and implement a novel, low-cost
      genotyping assay using Pan-Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA) of viral
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) as a point mutation assay for the detection of drug resistance in
      parallel with Sanger sequencing. Process and cost data will be collected for subsequent
      cost-analysis. The proposed intervention will be a two-arm, cluster-randomized trial in
      Mashonaland West and Matabeleland North provinces of Zimbabwe. The units of randomization
      will be public and largely rural clinics within the provinces, with sites randomized to the
      intervention or to the SOC. The study is anticipated to show that the use of DBS in routine
      monitoring of adolescents is feasible, and to show that CBT, if incorporated into routine
      counselling activities, can complement VL monitoring and genotyping to reduce treatment
      failure rates and preserve therapeutic options for infected adolescents. The results of this
      study will have important implications in Zimbabwe and other low-income countries in
      sub-Saharan Africa with a large proportion of HIV-infected adolescents. The study will
      include young adolescents aged 10- &lt;14years, as well as older adolescents aged 15-19 years
      and therefore provide data that will guide implementation of strategies for virologic success
      in the growing number of perinatally-infected children who are surviving on ART into
      adolescence, as well as for behaviorally-infected adolescents. The study will be performed
      within 44 clinics in Matabeleland North and Mashonaland West provinces, and will recruit 828
      adolescents. We have assembled a multidisciplinary consortium with the expertise to conduct
      this study. The consortium includes public health practitioners, a biostatistician, basic
      scientists with extensive experience in virology and development of novel technologies, HIV
      clinicians with experience in implementation science, global mental health, and behavioral
      psychology experts. The consortium will work in partnership with the Ministry of Health (MOH)
      to implement this protocol and ensure its success.
