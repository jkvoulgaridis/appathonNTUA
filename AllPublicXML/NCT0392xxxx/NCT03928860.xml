  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of one session OMT on arterial
      circulation in patients with PAD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      15 patients with PAD were included in the study. The OMT circulation model was applied to the
      participants for one session. Before and after the application, femoral artery diameter and
      flow rate in the patients were evaluated by doppler ultrasound

    <description>Femoral artery diameter evaluated by radiologist. The femoral artery diameter unit is in mm (millimeters).
In the evaluation, the wall contour characteristics of the vessel to be examined were evaluated and the diameter was measured. Color doppler examination was performed to determine whether the vessel contained color filling, patency, flow direction and turbulence.
Peak systolic and end diastolic flow rates and flow pattern and flow rate were measured by spectral examination.</description>

    <description>OMT Session Patients with PAD will be received 30 minutes of osteopathic manual treatment for one session. During application, the patient was in the supine position. OMT treatment session include, sub occipital release technique, supraclavicular release technique, sternal mobilization, omentum minus release, liver pumping, diaphragmatic mobilization, grand manevra technique, hip mobilization, knee mobilization and ankle mobilization. Each technique was applied for 3 minutes to patients.
