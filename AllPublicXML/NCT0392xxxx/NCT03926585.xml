  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Variations in the deiodinase 2 gene and monocarboxylate transporter 10 gene is
      associated with improvement in quality of life after initiation of combination therapy with
      L-Thyroxine and Liothyronine in patients with persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite
      conventional L-thyroxine mono-therapy.

      Purpose: To re-test this hypothesis in patients with continued perceived effect of
      Liothyronine treatment at least one year after initiation in a patient population more
      representing of daily clinical practice. The study will help determine whether testing of
      specific gene variations might predict longtime effect of combination therapy.

        Patients in this study have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and have had persistent
        hypothyroid symptoms despite L-thyroxine mono-therapy. They have all been referred to the
        department of endocrinology and have been examined by a trained endocrinologist. All
        patients have at least one year before the study initiated combination therapy with
        L-thyroxine and Liothyronine.
