  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of acute kidney injury (AKI) during septic shock is frequent and is
      associated with a high mortality rate. The reason of this increased mortality despite the use
      of renal replacement therapy is still unknown. The deleterious effects of uremic toxins
      (solutes accumulating with the loss of kidney function) has risen for the last decade in
      chronic kidney disease patients. Among those solutes, indoxyl sulfate (IS) is associated with
      the development of cardiovascular complications and impairment of immune response. The role
      of uremic toxins and particularly IS in the prognostic of septic kidney injury is unknown.
      The investigators propose to analyze the relation between the serum concentration of IS and
      the mortality of patients hospitalized for a septic shock who developed an AKI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During chronic kidney disease the uremic toxins have been widely described as potential
      harmful solutes targeting the cardiovascular system, immunologic system, endothelium and bone
      metabolism. However, nothing is known about the potential accumulation and pejorative effects
      of those uremic toxins during AKI (Acute Kidney Injury). The objective of this study is to
      explore the role of the uremic toxins and specially IS (Indoxyl Sulfate) in the mortality of
      patients hospitalized for a septic shock and AKI. This study will also describe for the first
      time the kinetic of the blood concentration of different uremic toxins and their relation
      with the mortality and the kidney function.
