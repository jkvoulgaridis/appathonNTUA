      obesity and or obesity and sarcopenia.

      Detailed Description:

      The national epidemic of obesity is also affecting older adults, and is associated with an
      increased risk of disability, nursing home placement and early mortality. The overarching
      goal of this study is to conduct a program of pilot research aimed at evaluating the effect
      of a intensive lifestyle intervention on cognitive functioning in order adults with obesity
      and or obesity and sarcopenia. While some degree of cognitive decline is common during the
      normal aging process, epidemiological evidence suggests that obesity can promote its
      acceleration. It is unclear the effect that intensive lifestyle changes could have on
      cognitive functioning in older adults with obesity.

      Study Timeline:

      May 2019 to May 2021

      Goal: Conduct a study to evaluate the effects that intensive lifestyle program has on
      cognitive functioning in older adults with obesity and or obesity and sarcopenia.

      Participation Duration: Participants will meet weekly for 17 weeks. Cognitive assessments
      will take place at baseline and 17 weeks.
