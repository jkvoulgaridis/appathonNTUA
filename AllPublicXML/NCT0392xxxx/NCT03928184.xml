    <textblock>
      This phase 3 study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
      lorecivivint injected intra-articularly (IA) into the target knee (most painful) joint of
      moderately to severely symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) subjects at a single dose of 0.07 mg
      lorecivivint per 2 mL injection. This study will utilize radiographs and patient reported
      outcomes (PROs) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorecivivint.

The Patient Global Assessment is an 11-point [0-10] Numeric Rating Scale [NRS] on which the subjects will rate how they feel their target knee OA is doing, considering all the ways in which their target knee OA may affect them. The NRS is anchored by descriptors at each end (&quot;Very Good&quot; on the left and &quot;Very Bad&quot; on the right).</description>

    <description>Evaluate change from baseline in HRQOL as assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health). Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. A score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
