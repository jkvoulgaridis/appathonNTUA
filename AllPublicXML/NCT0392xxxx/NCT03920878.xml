      Goals of the study are to evaluate how peri-operative versus intra-operative anti-VEGF
      intravitreous injections affect visual acuity (BCVA) in patients with persistent diabetic
      macular edema who are undergoing cataract surgery; and to evaluate how peri-operative versus
      intra-operative anti-VEGF intravitreous injections affect OCT CSF thickness and total number
      of postoperative injections in patients with diabetic macular edema who are undergoing
      cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Along with age, diabetes is a major risk factor for cataract formation, which can lead to
      significant vision loss and disability without medical intervention. Unfortunately, diabetic
      patients, particularly those with diabetic macular edema (DME), experience poorer visual
      outcomes after undergoing cataract surgery compared to non-diabetics. Reasons for this is
      multifactorial but includes an increased risk in the development of post-operative cystoid
      macular edema, and exacerbation of baseline DME. This poses a significant challenge in
      managing concomitant DME and visually-significant cataracts.

      Goals of the study are to evaluate how peri-operative versus intra-operative anti-VEGF
      intravitreous injections affect visual acuity (BCVA) in patients with persistent diabetic
      macular edema who are undergoing cataract surgery; and to evaluate how peri-operative versus
      intra-operative anti-VEGF intravitreous injections affect OCT CSF thickness and total number
      of postoperative injections in patients with diabetic macular edema who are undergoing
      cataract surgery.

    <description>BCVA is a measurement of the best vision correction that can be achieved, such as glasses, as measured on the standard Snellen eye chart. For example, if uncorrected eyesight is 20/200, but patient can see 20/20 with glasses, the BCVA is 20/20.</description>

    <description>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an important imaging modality in the evaluation and management of retinal diseases. Change in central subfield (CSF) thickness will be measured and recorded.</description>
