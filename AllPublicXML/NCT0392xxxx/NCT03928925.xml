  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complications are common during tracheal intubations performed outside of the operating room.
      Successful intubation on the first attempt has been associated with a lower rate of
      procedural complications, but the proportion of critically ill patients intubated on the
      first attempt during tracheal intubations outside of the operating room is less than 90%. The
      bougie, a thin semi-rigid tube that can be placed into the trachea, allowing a Seldinger-like
      technique of intubating a patient's airway, has been traditionally reserved for difficult or
      failed airways. However, a recent single center trial of adult patients intubated in an
      emergency department demonstrated that use of the bougie on the first attempt improved
      intubation success, compared to use of a traditional stylet.

      Theinvestigators propose a multi-center randomized trial to compare first-attempt bougie use
      versus endotracheal tube with stylet use for tracheal intubation of critically ill adults in
      the ED and ICU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BOUGIE trial is a prospective, parallel group, pragmatic, randomized trial comparing the
      effect of bougie use versus endotracheal tube with stylet use on the incidence of successful
      intubation on the first attempt among adults undergoing urgent or emergent tracheal
      intubation.

      Patients admitted to the study units who are deemed by their clinical team to require
      intubation and fulfill inclusion criteria without meeting exclusion criteria will be
      randomized 1:1 to use of a bougie or use of an endotracheal tube and stylet on the first
      attempt at intubation. All other decisions regarding airway management, including the choice
      to use a bougie or endotracheal tube and stylet on subsequent attempts, will remain at the
      discretion of the treating provider.

      The trial will enroll 1,106 patients. Conduct of the trial will be overseen by a Data Safety
      Monitoring Board. An interim analysis will be performed after the enrollment of 553 patients.
      The analysis of the trial will be conducted in accordance with a pre-specified statistical
      analysis plan, which will be submitted for publication or made publicly available prior to
      the conclusion of enrollment.

      The primary outcome is successful intubation on the first attempt

      The secondary outcome is severe hypoxemia (lowest arterial oxygen saturation between
      induction and two minutes following intubation of less than 80%)

    <description>The primary outcome is successful intubation on the first attempt. Successful intubation on the first attempt is defined as placement of an endotracheal tube in the trachea (confirmed by standard means including capnography) following: (1) a single insertion of a laryngoscope blade into the mouth and (2) EITHER a single insertion of a bougie into the mouth followed by a single insertion of an endotracheal tube into the mouth OR a single insertion of an endotracheal tube with stylet into the mouth.</description>

    <description>For patients randomized to use of a bougie, the operator will use a bougie on the first attempt at intubation. If successful, an assistant will load an endotracheal tube over the bougie, and the operator (without removing the laryngoscope from the mouth) will guide the tube through the vocal cords to the desired depth in the trachea.
If the bougie is not successfully placed in the trachea or the endotracheal tube cannot be successfully advanced over the bougie on the first attempt at intubation, the operator may use any approach during subsequent attempts at tracheal intubation.</description>

    <description>For patients randomized to use of an endotracheal tube with stylet, the operator will use an endotracheal tube containing a removeable, malleable stylet, on the first attempt at intubation.
Manipulation of the shape/curve of the endotracheal tube with stylet is at the discretion of the operator, however a &quot;straight-to-cuff&quot; shape and a bend angle of 25° to 35° is encouraged. The stylet will be left in place until the tube is advanced to the trachea.
If the endotracheal tube with stylet is not successfully placed in the trachea on the first attempt at intubation, the operator may use any approach during subsequent attempts at tracheal intubation.</description>
