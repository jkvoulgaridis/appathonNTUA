  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 2 study of KN026 in subjects with HER2 expressing
      gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer to evaluate efficacy and safety. The subjects will
      receive KN026 10 mg/kg QW or 20 mg/kg Q2W or 30mg/kg Q3W until progressive disease,
      unacceptable toxicity or death.

      The study consists of two arms as HER2 overexpression arm and HER2 expression arm and both
      arms will receive KN026 treatment.
