  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the effect of exposure of cesarean section (CS) delivered
      neonates to a natural condition of birth, i.e. to the microbiota of the birth canal, on the
      acquisition of microbial genes during development of the microbiome at multiple body sites,
      immune system maturation and allergy risk in childhood
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our primary outcome is to examine if exposure to the maternal vaginal and fecal microbiota
      directly after birth will halfen the cumulative incidence of Immunoglubulin E
      (IgE)-associated allergic disease at 2 years of age in CS delivered infants, compared with
      non-treated CS-delivered infants.

      Our secondary outcomes are to compare the community structure of microbes from mothers and
      their infants and immunological programming of infants delivered via scheduled CS, with or
      without exposure to the maternal vaginal and fecal microbiota, from birth until two years of
      age. The primary and secondary outcomes will also be compared with a reference group of
      vaginally delivered infants. Sex differences in the incidence and prevalence of allergic
      diseases have been described. The anticipated benefit of the intervention can be implemented
      in clinical practice regardless of sex, so that improved conditions for good health are
      created.

    <description>A piece of gauze soaked with saline (0.9%) will be placed in the birth canal 2 hours before the CS by the study midwife, using sterile glows. Before the CS procedure begins, the gauze will be removed from the vagina and then immediately &quot;contaminated&quot; by a swab carrying maternal fecal microbiota. The swab is contaminated by introducing it 3 cm into the anal canal and by rotating it for 10-20 s.
Immediately after birth, the study midwife will swab the neonate with the gauze in multiple body sites by a standardized manner and then swab maternal breasts and chest skin. The neonate will then be placed on the maternal chest to initiate breast-feeding.</description>

    <description>See above - the gauze will be exchanged to a clean gauze (soaked with saline). Immediately after birth, the study midwife will swab the neonate with the gauze in multiple body sites by a standardized manner and then swab maternal breasts and chest skin. The neonate will then be placed on the maternal chest to initiate breast-feeding.</description>

          -  Infants of mothers with pre-eclampsia or complicated pregnancies, mothers &lt;18 years or
             &gt;40 years of age, genital herpes simplex, genital warts, HIV, Hepatitis B or
             complications during delivery, infants delivered prior to 37 weeks of gestation.
             Additional exclusion criteria for mothers in the CS group: Mothers positive to Group B
             Streptococcus, Group A Streptococcus, bacterial vaginosis, vaginal pH &gt; 4 at the time
             of birth. Mothers with fecal samples positive for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter
             or Yersinia.
