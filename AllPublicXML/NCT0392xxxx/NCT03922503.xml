      to assess the effectiveness of advanced PRF in combination of Demineralized freeze-dried bone
      allograft (DFDBA) as compared to collagen membrane in combination with Demineralized
      freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) treatment of non-contained periodontal intraosseous
      defects in stage III periodontitis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of intraosseous periodontal defects represents a clinical challenge; these defects
      have been detected through clinical and radiographic examination in 18- 51 % of patients with
      periodontitis. They are often associated with persistent deep pockets and bleeding following
      conventional periodontal treatment. Complex regenerative periodontal therapy is advocated for
      management of these defects. The outcomes of regenerative periodontal therapy are positively
      correlated with the morphology of osseous defects. Non-contained defects are prevalent
      clinically and have been reported to have a low regenerative potential.

Would you advice others with the surgery?
To what extent are you satisfied with the results?</description>
