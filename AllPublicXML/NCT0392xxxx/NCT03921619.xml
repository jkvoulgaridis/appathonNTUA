  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder slings are commonly worn after shoulder surgery. In geriatric patients, painstaking
      care is taken to reduce any factors that may increase the chance of experiencing a fall.
      Currently, it is not understood if wearing a sling affects someone's general gait and
      balance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following many shoulder operations, patients are immobilized in an bulky sling with
      non-weight bearing restrictions for periods of up to 6 weeks. This is necessary to allow for
      soft tissue healing particularly following repair of rotator cuff tears and shoulder
      replacement surgeries, two common procedures performed in the elderly population. Previous
      studies have shown that natural arm swing plays an essential role in maintaining balance and
      normal gait patterns. Decreased functional mobility and gait impairment has been shown to
      increase the risk of falls, mortality, and morbidity in an elderly population. However,
      following upper extremity surgery requiring the use of a sling, targeted therapy for gait and
      balance training is rarely prescribed. Consequently, the investigators wish to assess whether
      or not sling use impacts functional mobility test scores in an elderly population. The aim of
      this project is to maximize perioperative functionality in these patients in efforts to
      prevent any unanticipated secondary injury.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be asked to perform two balance assessments (Tinetti Balance Scale, Get Up and Go Test) while: 1) not wearing a sling; and 2) wearing a sling on the dominant arm. Additional data will be collected regarding patient frailty with the Edmonton Frail Scale, as well as data regarding sling use and falls in the form of a questionnaire.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Performance-oriented mobility assessment: Components are balance &amp; gait. Patient will be seated in a hard, armless chair and be assessed for balance with all of the following: sitting balance, rising from chair, attempting to rise, immediate standing balance (first 5 sec), standing balance, balance while being nudged, balance with eyes closed, turning 360 degrees, and sitting down. Scored out of 16. The gait portion assesses hesitancy, step length &amp; height, foot clearance, step symmetry, step continuity, path, trunk, and walking time. Scored out of 12. Total score out of 28.
If score is ≤18, risk of falls is high. If score is 19-23, risk of falls is moderate. If score is ≥24, risk of falls is low.</description>

    <description>Global assessment of patient vulnerability: Domains to be assessed are cognition (clock drawing), general health status (hospitalizations in last year &amp; describing own health), functional independence (how many ADL's require help), social support, medication use (5 or more on a regular basis, adherence to regimen), nutrition (weight loss), mood, continence, and functional performance (timed rising from chair and walking). Scored out of 17, higher scores associated with higher frailty.
Scoring : 0 - 5 = Not Frail; 6 - 7 = Vulnerable; 8 - 9 = Mild Frailty; 10-11 = Moderate Frailty; 12-17 = Severe Frailty;</description>
