    <textblock>
      A trial to assess cumulative incidence of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in infants
      (by three months of age) born to mothers receiving a single-dose of 2 grams of oral
      azithromycin during labour (or immediately prior to delivery in the case of caesarean
      section), compared to infants whose mothers received placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PreYIAL is a Phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled two arm trial of a
      single 2g dose of azithromycin or placebo, administered to women who have been admitted for
      delivery of their baby (either following onset of labour or for caesarean section).

      The trial includes an estimated 2110 mothers/infant pairs (1055 per arm), with 12 months of
      follow-up for the mother/infant pair.

      A swab-study within the main study involves 940 of the mother/infant pairs enrolled and
      involves follow-up for bacterial carriage outcomes, for 12 months.These swab-study
      participants will also be included in assessments of the infant and maternal microbiome.
