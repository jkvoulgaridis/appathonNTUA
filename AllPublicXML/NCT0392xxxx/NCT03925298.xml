    <textblock>
      Elevated level of serum troponin (T-I) has been regarded as a prognostic biomarker of poor
      outcome in acute ischemic stroke. However, its role in outcome in thrombolysed ischemic
      stroke patients remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of T-I as a
      predictive biomarker of short-term outcome in thrombolysed ischemic stroke participants.

      Elevated level of serum troponin (T-I) has been regarded as a prognostic biomarker of poor
      outcome in acute ischemic stroke. However, its role in outcome in thrombolysed ischemic
      stroke patients remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of T-I as a
      predictive biomarker of short-term outcome in thrombolysed ischemic stroke patients. Methods:
      This study included 72 acute ischemic stroke participants were treated with intravenous
      thrombolytic therapy. All participants were subjected to general and neurological evaluation
      including assessment of stroke severity using National Institute of Health Stroke Scale
      (NIHSS) at admission and investigations including measurement of serum level of T-I on
      admission. Outcome was assessed three months after stroke onset using NIHSS and modified
      Rankin scale (mRS).

      Serum troponin I (T-I) was collected at hospital admission at the emergency department,
      before any treatment. Serum samples from patients were drawn using standard venipuncture
      techniques. Blood samples were left to clot for 4 hours at room temperature, then centrifuged
      to obtain the serum which was stored frozen at (-20C). Serum T-I levels were quantified in an
      enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay technology (ELISA) following manufacturer's instructions
      (ALPCO, 26G Keewaydin Drive, Salem NH03079, USA). Upper reference limit for apparently
      healthy individuals is &lt;0.01μg/l.

        Eighty one thrombolysed ischemic stroke patients were enrolled in this study. Participants
        who did not complete the study (9 Participants were lost during follow up) were eliminated.
        So the study included seventy two Participants (34 males and 38 females) who fulfilled the
        inclusion and exclusion criteria.
