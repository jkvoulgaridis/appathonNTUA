  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the Singapore population, being the 2nd most
      commonly diagnosed cancer amongst males and 3rd most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst
      females. Pulmonologists, oncologists and thoracic surgeons are often consulted for the
      evaluation of imaging-identified pulmonary nodules. These may have been identified either
      incidentally or through screening. The majority of these are indeterminate and definitive
      investigation with biopsy or resection is invasive and not without risk. Hence, current
      consensus guidelines adopt a largely expectant strategy in the management of these
      indeterminate pulmonary nodules.

      There is substantial evidence that lung cancer in Asians may be unique with multiple driver
      mutations, lower age of presentation and may be independent of tobacco exposure. In addition,
      there are guidelines that recommend that the management of lung nodules in Asia should
      account for these differences. However, the evidence for alternative recommendations is
      lacking.

      The aim of the study will be to identify radiological and clinical predictors that can
      improve the diagnosis of lung nodules. These predictors may help build a model for lung
      nodule evaluation and surveillance.

      Prospective database of subjects meeting all of the following inclusion criteria to
      participate in this study.

        1. Evidence of lung nodule on chest radiograph or Computed Tomography regardless of
           underlying aetiology

        2. Age Â³ 21 years old

        3. Ability to provide informed consent This study will collect existing or prospective data
           that is part of standard clinical care from the electronic medical record of patients

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

           Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the Singapore population, being the 2nd
           most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst males and 3rd most commonly diagnosed cancer
           amongst females. Pulmonologists, oncologists and thoracic surgeons are often consulted
           for the evaluation of imaging-identified pulmonary nodules. These may have been
           identified either incidentally or through screening. The majority of these are
           indeterminate and definitive investigation with biopsy or resection is invasive and not
           without risk. Hence, current consensus guidelines adopt a largely expectant strategy in
           the management of these indeterminate pulmonary nodules.

           There is substantial evidence that lung cancer in Asians may be unique with multiple
           driver mutations, lower age of presentation and may be independent of tobacco exposure.
           In addition, there are guidelines that recommend that the management of lung nodules in
           Asia should account for these differences. However, the evidence for alternative
           recommendations is lacking.

        2. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES

           The aim of the study will be to identify radiological and clinical predictors that can
           improve the diagnosis of lung nodules. These predictors may help build a model for lung
           nodule evaluation and surveillance.

        3. EXPECTED RISKS AND BENEFITS

           There are likely to be no benefits to subjects. They will not be subject to any novel
           therapy and their clinical/radiological data will only be collected.

           Risks are minimal because patients are subject to only standard diagnostic work-up and
           existing clinical data collected. There will be no new additional interventions,
           consultations or hospital visits. They will be asked to complete validated quality of
           life surveys that will be included into the clinical record.

        4. STUDY POPULATION

           4.1. List the number and nature of subjects to be enrolled.

           Patients will only be enrolled from those who present to Singapore General Hospital,
           National Cancer Centre, National Heart Centre, Changi General Hospital and Sengkang
           General Hospital (either in an ambulatory or inpatient setting). There is no exclusion
           of women or minorities. Children are excluded because lung nodule detection in them is
           rare and the pathological processes, as well as clinical considerations are different.

           4.2. Criteria for Recruitment and Recruitment Process

           Subjects will be recruited if they already have radiographic evidence of a lung nodule.

           4.3. Inclusion Criteria

           The subject must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in this
           study.

             1. Evidence of lung nodule on chest radiograph or Computed Tomography regardless of
                underlying aetiology

             2. Age &gt; 21 years old

             3. Ability to provide informed consent
