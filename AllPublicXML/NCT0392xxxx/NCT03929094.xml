      This is a single arm, open-label Phase II clinical trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety
      of the Combination of Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

    <textblock>
      While GT (Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel) is one of the preferred regimens for metastatic
      pancreatic cancer, we have yet to determine the optimum number of cycles for GT treatment
      regimen. In this single arm, open-label clinical trial, metastatic pancreatic cancer patients
      will be received nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m^2 (iv, 30 minutes) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2 for 3
      weeks, followed by one week without treatment. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks until the
      disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity, death or begin a novel therapeutic.

      The safety and efficacy of each group will be assessed through ORR, PFS, OS and adverse
      effects as graded by CTC-AE 5.0.
