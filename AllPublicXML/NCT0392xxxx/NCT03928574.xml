  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For superficial surgery of anteromedial and posteromedial surfaces of the upper arm, the
      medial brachial cutaneous nerve (MBCN) and the intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN) must be
      selectively blocked, in addition to an axillary brachial plexus block. We compared efficacy
      of ultrasound-guided (USG) versus conventional block of the MBCN and the ICBN.

      The primary objective of our study was to compare the effectiveness of conventional and USG
      blocks of the MBCN and the ICBN in the axillary fossa. Our hypothesis was that the proportion
      of patients with complete anesthesia in the entire posteromedial and anteromedial surface of
      the arm would be greater if a USG technique were used, compared with a conventional
      technique. The secondary objectives were onset time of complete anesthesia, volume of local
      anesthetic used for the procedure, tourniquet tolerance during surgery, and ultrasound
      visibility of MBCN and ICBN.
