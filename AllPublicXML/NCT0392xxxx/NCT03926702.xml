  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to assess the utility of a new positron emission tomography (PET)
      radiopharmaceutical to image tau, [18F] JNJ067, invented by Janssen Pharmaceutical companies
      of Johnson &amp; Johnson. To date, the radiopharmaceutical has been used in a small group of
      patients and controls (&lt;20). The study plans to expand the range and number of subjects, to
      examine a total of 18 participants including controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) and other dementias. All patients will be recruited from the University of California,
      San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center (MAC) and controls will be recruited from the
      University of California, Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS). Patients will undergo a
      multidisciplinary clinical evaluation for diagnosis and a cognitive assessment at the MAC;
      controls will undergo the usual BACS cognitive assessment performed on the Berkeley campus.
      Following these evaluations UCSF subjects will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scanning at the UCSF Neuroimaging Center and blood sampling for genetic testing also at UCSF,
      and BACS subjects will undergo an MRI at the University of California Berkeley 3T Brain
      Imaging Center (in Li Ka Shing hall on the Berkeley campus) and blood sampling for genetic
      testing at the time of the PET scan.

      All subjects will come to Lawrence Berkeley National Law (LBNL) where they will have, on the
      same day, a C-11 Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) PET scan to measure brain amyloid, and an F-18
      JNJ067 PET scan to measure brain tau. These scans will be examined and analyzed by LBNL
      staff, and data will be processed to examine basic questions about the quantitative behavior
      of JNJ067. Scan results will not be returned to control subjects, but physicians at UCSF will
      receive scan results on MAC patients and will share results with participants.

      As part of this protocol, the investigators also plan to share the acquired data widely. All
      data will be de-identified. Data will be shared with the inventors (Janssen/Johnson &amp;
      Johnson) as well as other scientists worldwide. As this is a new radio tracer, the
      investigators anticipate that there will be interest in seeing the actual data to answer
      questions about uptake and application of the method in future studies in many different
      laboratories. Shared data will include PET scans, MRI scans, genetic testing, and
      neuropsychological results.
