      The Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter is a device intended for the localized infusion of
      therapeutic agents into the pulmonary artery and peripheral vasculature.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter has been designed to administer therapeutic agents in the
      peripheral vasculature. Because of the unique design of the catheter, with its six expandable
      infusion limbs, the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter has the ability to: 1. Create a much larger
      central channel for blood flow, thereby utilizing the body's own endogenous fibrinolytic
      agents to lyse the clot, and 2. Greatly enhance the radial dispersion of a
      catheter-administered thrombolytic agent throughout the thrombus. Expansion of the multiple
      arms of the basket in the infusion catheter causes fissuring of the clot. The net result is
      that a greater surface area of clot is exposed to both endogenous and exogenously
      administered lytic agents, thereby promoting clot dissolution.

    <description>Major Bleeding as defined by International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH), within 72 hours of initiation of r-tPA administration. Bleeding criteria are as follows: Major Bleeding in Non-Surgical Patients
Fatal bleeding; and/or
Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome; and/or
Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or more or leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells.</description>
