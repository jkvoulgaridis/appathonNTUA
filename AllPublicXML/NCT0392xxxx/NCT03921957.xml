      Purpose :

      Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is among the most common cancers in the werstern world.
      Patients with stage I have the most satisfactory outcomes. The gold standard for treatment is
      still surgery, but this approach has recently been challenged by hypofractionnated
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Therefore, for patients who are not eligible for
      surgery due to their significant co-morbidity, or for those who refuse surgical resection,
      stereotactic radiotherapy is an efficient practical alternative. SBRT is well tolerated and
      efficient, in fact local control rate at 3 years reaches more than 90%. Most of guidelines
      recommand a dose between 48 and 60 Gy delivered in 3 at 8 fractions and 3 weeks. Biological
      effect depends on the dose distribution in time and decreases when the number of fractions or
      length of radiation treatment increase. Decreasing the length of treatment and the interval
      between fractions may improve efficiency of treatment and local control rate. Moreover, it
      may improve quality of life of patients. Nevertheless, an evaluation of safety of such
      shorter treatment course, with a phase I-II clinical study is needed.

    <description>The minimal tolerated length of treatment level is determined according to a 3x3 modified Fibonacci method and 4 schedule levels will be explored. The dose of radiation is 60 Gy in 8 fractions of 7,5 Gy.
The first treatment schedule level consists of delivering 3 fractions the first week, 2 fractions the second week and 3 fractions the third week. The second treatment schedule level consists of delivering 3 fractions the first week, 3 fractions the second week and 2 fractions the third week. The third treatment schedule level consists of delivering 4 fractions the first week, 2 fractions the second week and 2 fractions the third week. Finally, the fourth treatment schedule level consists of delivering 4 fractions the first week and 4 fractions the second week (duration of the treatment : 2weeks).</description>
