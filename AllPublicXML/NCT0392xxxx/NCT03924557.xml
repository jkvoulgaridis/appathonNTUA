  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients often require administration of multiple supportive care pharmacotherapies
      while receiving chemotherapy regardless the type of cancer. Supportive care therapies are
      commonly prescribed to nearly all cancer patients and could include antiemetics
      (ondansetron), pain management (opiates), GI protection (PPIs), antidepressants (select
      SSRIs), anticoagulation (warfarin) and antifungal prophylaxis (voriconazole). These are all
      are associated with known pharmacogenetic interactions, which in some cases render the drugs
      ineffective or toxic. This could result in negative impacts on quality of life in patients
      who are already undergoing complicated and costly anticancer regimens. Pharmacogenetic-guided
      therapy based on an individual patient's genetic profile could potentially target symptoms
      for which an individual is uniquely susceptible, guiding use of medications that are most
      likely to be effective, thereby reducing unnecessary physical complications and financial
      strain. It is hypothesized that patients in the genotype intervention arm will report lower
      scores for overall symptom distress as compared to patients in the delayed genotype
      intervention arm following initiation of chemotherapy.

      This is a single center, pilot randomized pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) of 500 cancer
      patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for newly diagnosed or recurrent cancers. Patients
      will be randomized to genotyping intervention vs delayed genotyping intervention supportive
      care. Supportive care regimens may include therapies for antiemesis (ondansetron), pain
      management (opiates), GI protection (PPIs), antidepressants (select SSRIs), and antifungal
      prophylaxis (voriconazole), and warfarin depending on their chemotherapy regimen.

      For those randomized to the genotype intervention group, genotype results will be returned in
      the EHR pre-emptively and supportive care will be prescribed based on genotype results. For
      those randomized to the delayed genotype intervention group, supportive care will be
      prescribed based on usual clinical practice. Both groups will be followed for 3 months and
      undergo assessments with the MDASI questionnaire four times (pre-chemotherapy, and 2 weeks, 4
      weeks and 12 weeks post initiation of chemotherapy.

      Records for patients receiving outpatient care at the UF Health Cancer Center clinic at the
      Medical Plaza will be screened based on inclusion / exclusion criteria for participation in
      this study. Those that meet criteria will be offered participation. Participation is expected
      to last approximately 12 weeks and the study will be open for 30-36 months.

    <description>The M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) is a multisymptom patient-reported outcome measure. Participants are asked to recall symptom interference and severity during the past 24 hours and rate the symptom using a numeric rating scale, 0-10. For the symptom interference questions, 10 means interfered completely and 0 is did not interfere. For the symptom severity questions, 10 means as bad as you can imagine and 0 is not present. The MDASI questionnaire will evaluate symptom distress and core symptoms of patients at four separate time points.</description>
