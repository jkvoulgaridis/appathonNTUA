  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim was to assess the ability of bovine colostrum concentrate to reduce the incidence of
      late-onset sepsis episodes and necrotizing enterocolitis in artificially fed preterm neonates
      and its effect on T regulatory cells. And to evaluate the effect of bovine colostrum
      concentrate on feeding tolerance, growth, hospital stay and mortality in preterm neonates.

      The study was interventional, double blinded and randomized trial ، performed on preterm
      neonates( &lt;34 week) admitted on Ain ShamsUniversity (ASU) neonatal intensive care units
      (NICU) after considering exclusion criteria.

      The enrolled patients was subdivided into two groups; group A are infants with non bovine
      colstrum and group B with bovine colostrum All infants received the standard neonatal care
      and underwent follow-up from birth until reach 37 week corrected gestational age, discharge
      or death whichever came first.

      I. Data Collection: Careful history taking

        1. Antenatal history including: rupture of membrane, Chorioamnionitis, history of urinary
           tract infection.

        2. Natal history including: mode of delivery, place of delivery, the need for
           resuscitation, recorded Apgar score at 1minute and 5 minutes.

        3. Postnatal history including: age of admission in neonatal intensive care unit, symptoms
           suggest infection.

      II. Thorough clinical assessment:

        1. Weight and Occiptofrontal circumference (twice weekly).

        2. Complete examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal and neurological
           examination.

      III. Laboratory investigations:

        1. Complete blood picture, C-reactive protein on admission and repeated twice weekly

        2. Blood culture before starting treatment and with any suspected sepsis.

        3. In first 24 hours and the end of second week : Collecting peripheral blood mononuclear
           cells to be analyzed for cellular parameters by flow cytometry (CD4 T cells, CD25 L,
           FOXP3). Three subsets of CD4+ T cells will be defined according to CD25 staining: CD25-
           , CD25 low, and CD25 high. Cells expressing CD25 high will be chosen and gated for the
           detection of FOXP3+ T cells.

      IV. Radiological investigations:

      Chest X-ray (It was done on admission and repeated when needed). Abdominal X-ray (when
      necrotizing enterocolitis is suspected). Abdominal ultrasound (when necrotizing enterocolitis
      is suspected).

      V. Follow-up and end-point of the study:

      All infant underwent follow-up from birth until reach 37 week corrected gestational age,
      discharge or death whichever came first.NPO for more than 24 hours

      The following primary outcome data was recorded:

        -  Clinical examination and laboratory investigations when clinically indicated for
           evidence of sepsis.

        -  Clinical examination and radiological investigations when clinically indicated for
           evidence of NEC.

      A secondary outcome measure includes weight increment per kg per week, duration of
      hospitalization, mortality if any, monitoring adverse effects of treatment (if any); such as
      emesis, increased gastric residuals, increased abdominal girth, diarrhea, skin rash. Long
      term outcome includes necrotizing enterocolitis, and intracranial hemorrhage.
