  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional treatment options for localized prostate cancer include prostatectomy,
      radiotherapy and active surveillance. However, prostatectomy and radiotherapy carry certain
      degree of morbidity, including the risks of urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and
      injury to the structures in the proximity. Active surveillance carries the risk of disease
      progression and psychological distress to the patients. Focal therapy employs the concept of
      only destroying the significant lesion, resulting in disease cure and improved functional
      outcome. Among the different options of focal therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound
      (HIFU) is one of the most commonly employed energy sources. It exerts its effect through
      thermal and mechanical destruction of cancer tissue. This study aims at assess the
      effectiveness of such treatment in prostate cancer management.

      In this study, investigators evaluate the early oncological outcome and objective functional
      outcome of patients undergoing HIFU for the treatment of localized intermediate risk prostate
      cancer.
