      This is an exploratory Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamic effects of RVT-1201 in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

      Study participation for each patient will last approximately 3 months and will consist of a
      screening period (up to 28 days in duration), a baseline period (day 1, pre-dose), a 6-week
      treatment period, and a 2-week follow-up period.

      The study will enroll approximately 36 patients at approximately 20 centers across the United
      States and Canada.

    <intervention_model_description>Following screening assessments, PAH patients who meet all entrance criteria will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments in a ratio of 2:1:
Arm 1 (n=24) - RVT-1201 Treatment: RVT-1201 immediate-release tablets will be administered orally, at a dose of 600 mg twice daily (BID), for a total of 6 weeks in addition to the patient's current standard of care (SOC) medication(s) for PAH.
Arm 2 (n=12) - Placebo Treatment: Matching placebo tablets will be administered orally, at a dose of 600 mg twice daily (BID), for a total of 6 weeks in addition to the patient's current SOC medication(s) for PAH.
Participants will be followed in face-to-face visits with trial personnel every 2 weeks for 8 weeks (6 weeks of treatment plus a 2-week follow-up), with an additional phone call at Week 1, to assess drug effects and monitor safety during their treatments.</intervention_model_description>
