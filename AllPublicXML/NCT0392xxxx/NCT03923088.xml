  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental anxiety is fear associated with the thought of visiting the dentist for preventive
      care and dental procedures. Children with dental anxiety characterized by crying before
      dental checkup, tachycardia and aggressively clinging to the accompanying parent. It has been
      cited as the fifthmost common cause of anxiety by Agras et al. Dental anxiety may have major
      and long-lasting implications for the child and their family. Cohen et al reported that
      dental anxiety affects an individual's life in multiple ways. The physiological impacts
      included signs and symptoms of the fright response and feelings of exhaustion after a dental
      appointment, while the cognitive impacts included an array of negative thoughts, beliefs, and
      fears. Dental anxiety in children could remain a problem in adulthood if not handled properly
      thus it will affect oral health and psycho-social condition. This research is conducted to
      deliver different concepts in psychological and behavioral techniques in management of
      anxious pediatric dental patients.

    <description>This involves tensing specific muscle groups for 5-7 seconds, followed by 20 seconds of relaxation. The method can be demonstrated chairside, and should be practiced and rehearsed by the patient at home. Four major muscle groups are commonly tensed and relaxed. These are: 1) feet, calves, thighs, and buttocks; 2) hands, forearms, and biceps; 3) chest, stomach, and lower back; and 4) head, face, throat, and shoulders</description>

    <description>audiovisual distraction not only leads to full involvement of scenes (visual and auditory), but it also induces a positive emotional reaction resulting in a relaxed experience.</description>
