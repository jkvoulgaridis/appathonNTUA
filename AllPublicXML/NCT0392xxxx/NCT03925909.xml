  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-diabetes is characterized by high plasma concentration of glucose and glycated hemoglobin
      and is the main risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. Several studies show that
      the intestinal microbiota is intimately linked to cardio-metabolic factors (type 2 diabetes,
      insulin resistance) when in situations of dysbiosis. Food is a key element for a healthy
      microbiota, focusing on the consumption of polyphenols that modulate the intestinal
      environment through its alteration and production of short chain fatty acids, and can thus be
      a way of reversing situations such as pre- diabetes and insulin resistance. The objective of
      the study will be to investigate whether chronic supplementation of eriocitrin alters the
      intestinal microbiota of pre-diabetic and insulin resistant individuals, reversing these
      situations. This will be done by supplementation of eriocitrin-containing capsules with
      different dosages in pre-diabetic and insulin resistant individuals. There will be 12 weeks
      of intervention, with faecal collections, anthropometric and dietary evaluation, and then
      will be made microbiological analysis to identify the intestinal microbiota and biochemical
      analysis before and after the intervention. For statistical analysis, normality and
      homogeneity test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levine test respectively), T-test to compare
      baseline time between groups and repeated-measures ANOVA (two-way) were used to compare
      changes within and between groups.

      Individuals of both sexes between 30 and 60 years of age who present fasting glycemia between
      100 mg / dL (5,6 mmol / L) and 125 mg / dL (6,9 mmol / L) 50, or concentration of glycated
      hemoglobin between 5.7% (39 mmol / mole) and 6.4% (47 mmol / mole) 50, or glycemic
      concentrations in the oral glucose tolerance test between 140mg / dL (7.8 mmol / L) to 199mg
      / dL (11.0 mmol / L) 50. The study will also include insulin-resistant individuals: insulin
      above 25 uU / mL, or who present HOMA-IR score above 2.7.

      Individuals using supplements (vitamins, bioflavonoids), pregnant women and those who
      practice intense physical exercise (&gt; 10h / week) will be excluded from the study.

      The primary endpoint will be alteration of the microbiota with possible improvement of the
      glycemic profile, leading to the reversal of pre-diabetes and insulin resistance.
