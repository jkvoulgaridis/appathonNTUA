      This is a randomised, active-comparator, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre phase IV
      exploratory study to characterise changes in airway inflammation, symptoms, lung function,
      and reliever use in asthma patients using SABA (salbutamol) or anti inflammatory reliever
      (Symbicort®) as reliever medication in addition to Symbicort® as daily asthma controller.
      Eligible patients diagnosed with asthma at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit (Visit
      1) and fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will
      continue into the run-in period. At Visit 2, patients will be assessed for randomisation
      criteria and, if met, will be randomised to receive either Symbicort® as maintenance and
      reliever treatment or Symbicort® as maintenance treatment and salbutamol as reliever
      treatment in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation will be stratified by the patient's ongoing dose (low
      or medium) of corticosteroids/long-acting β2-agonist (ICS/LABA) at study entry.

      This is a randomised, active-comparator, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre phase IV
      exploratory study to characterise changes in airway inflammation, symptoms, lung function,
      and reliever use in asthma patients using SABA (salbutamol) or anti inflammatory reliever
      (Symbicort®) as reliever medication in addition to Symbicort® as daily asthma controller.
      Eligible patients diagnosed with asthma at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit (Visit
      1) and fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will
      continue into the run-in period. During the run-in period, patients will take their
      maintenance medication (ie,Symbicort® [100/6 or 200/6 μg, × 2 BID]) and reliever salbutamol
      [100 μg, PRN]) using the connected inhalers. At Visit 2, patients will be assessed for
      randomisation criteria and, if met, will be randomised to receive either Symbicort® as
      maintenance and reliever treatment or Symbicort® as maintenance treatment and salbutamol as
      reliever treatment in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation will be stratified by the patient's ongoing
      dose (low or medium) of inhaled (ICS/LABA) at study entry. This study will include a minimum
      of 4 clinic visits. Patients will be requested to come to the study site for 4 additional
      Event Visits (E1 to E4) at approximately 4-day intervals beginning after the first visit if
      they experience any one of the following 3 criteria: a) A severe exacerbation defined as use
      of systemic steroids for at least 3 days, emergency room visit, or inpatient hospitalisation
      due to asthma, b) Symptom worsening criteria based on CompEx evaluation - an asthma worsening
      identified by a combination of deteriorations in at least 2 variables (decrease in PEF of at
      least 15% compared with baseline, an increase of reliever medication of at least 1.5
      occasions compared with baseline, or an increase in asthma symptoms of at least 1 compare
      with baseline or the absolute max score [=3]) at least 2 consecutive days, or c) A single day
      (in 24 hours) with 6 or more occasions of reliever medication use.

      The duration of participation in the study will be 26 to 28 weeks (maximum) for each
      individual patient, including a 2-week run-in period, followed by a 24-week randomised
      treatment period and an additional follow-up period if the Event Visits fall within the final
      2 weeks of the treatment period. The study plans to randomise a minimum of 60 patients to a
      maximum of 80 patients to achieve at least 54 patients completing the study. The study will
      be conducted at no less than 2 sites in the United Kingdom (UK). The estimated study duration
      is approximately 17 months.

          9. Male and/or female

         10. Negative pregnancy test (urine) for female patients of childbearing potential at Visit

                  assessments and completing the asthma symptom diary during the run-in period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant disease or disorder, or evidence of drug/substance abuse which in the
             Investigator's opinion would pose a risk to patient safety, interfere with the conduct
             of study, have an impact on the study results, or make it undesirable for the patient
             to participate in the study.

          2. Any asthma worsening requiring change in asthma treatment other than the patient's
             prescribed reliever medication (Symbicort® as Maintenance and Reliever Therapy [SMART]
             therapy, SABA, and/or short-acting anticholinergic agent) within 30 days prior to

          7. A severe asthma exacerbation (defined by an exacerbation resulting in ≥3 days of oral
             corticosteroids [or one depot intramuscular injection of a glucocorticosteroid], an
             urgent care or emergency room visit that results in systemic corticosteroids, or an
             inpatient hospitalisation due to asthma) within 30 days prior to screening.

          8. Any disease state or procedure that may necessitate the use of oral/systemic
             corticosteroids during the treatment period, other than asthma.

          9. Malignancy: a current malignancy or previous history of cancer in remission for less
             than 12 months prior to Visit 1 (patients that had localised carcinoma of the skin
             which was resected for cure will not be excluded).

             opinion could compromise the safety of the patient.

         11. Other concurrent medical conditions: patients who have known, pre-existing, clinically
             significant endocrine, autoimmune, metabolic, neurological, renal, gastrointestinal,
             hepatic, haematological or any other system abnormalities that are uncontrolled with
             standard treatment.

         12. Current smokers. Previous smokers are allowed to be included provided that they
             stopped smoking &gt;12 months prior to Visit 1 AND have a smoking history of ≤10 pack
             years.

         13. Alcohol/substance abuse: a history (or suspected history) of alcohol misuse or
             substance abuse within 2 years prior to Visit 1.

         14. Participation in another clinical study with any marketed or investigational biologic
             drug within 4 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Visit 1.

         15. Participation in another clinical study with a non-biologic investigational product or
             new formulation of a marketed non-biologic drug during the last 30 days prior to Visit
             1.

         16. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the study drugs or any of the excipients of
             the products.

         17. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca
             staff and/or staff at the study site).

         18. Previous randomisation in the present study.

         19. For women only - currently pregnant (confirmed with positive pregnancy test),
             breast-feeding or planned pregnancy during the study. Fertile women not using
             acceptable contraceptive measures, as judged by the Investigator. Periodic abstinence,
             spermicides only, and the lactational amenorrhoea method are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

         20. Planned hospitalisation during the study that would interfere with study objectives as
             judged by the Investigator.
