  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced LVH and HFpEF will be randomly assigned in open-label fashion to
      receive LCZ696 titrated to 200 mg twice daily or valsartan titrated to 160 mg twice daily,
      and will be treated for 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has a signiﬁcant morbidity and
      mortality, and therapies that have proven effective in HF with reduced EF have not been shown
      to improve long-term prognosis in HFpEF. Inhibition of circulating neprilysin could augment
      deficient NP-receptor GC signaling and therefore be beneficial in HFpEF, as suggested by the
      decrease in NP following administration of valsartan/sacubitril in the phase 2 (PARAMOUNT
      study). Use of valsartan/sacubitril is currently being tested in the multicenter PARAGON-HF
      trial with HFpEF patients. The investigators suppose the best candidates for LCZ696 therapy
      will be patients with HFpEF and advanced concentric LV hypertrophy and obesity, i.e. having
      the lowest BNP bioavailability.

The questionnaire is comprised of 21 important physical, emotional and socioeconomic ways heart failure can adversely affect a patient's life. After receiving brief standardized instructions, the patient marks a 0 (zero) to 5 scale to indicate how much each itemized adverse of heart failure has prevented the patient from living as he or she wanted to live during the past 4 weeks. The questionnaire is simply scored by summation of all 21 responses. Score ranges from 0 (best quality of life) to 105 (worst quality of life).</description>
