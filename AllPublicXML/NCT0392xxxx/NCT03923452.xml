  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a viable
      community program for enhancing wellbeing among older adult immigrants from low income
      neighborhoods. Half of the sample will be randomized to receive the 9-week mindfulness
      program and the other half will be randomized to a wait list control condition. Primary
      outcomes of interest will include perceived stress and self-report depressive symptoms.
      Secondary outcomes will include trait mindfulness and self-care, optimism, expectations
      regarding aging, social connection, and attentional skills. Participants will also be invited
      to engage in a 30-minute interview to discuss their lived experience as an immigrant in
      Canada and their experience in the MBSR program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults aged 65 years and older are the fastest growing segment of the Canadian population. In
      the 2006 Census, 43% of older adults in Ontario identified as being a Canadian immigrant, a
      statistic which continues to grow in the context of an aging population. Aging is commonly
      associated with declines in physical and cognitive capacity, which is significantly
      accelerated by chronic perceived stress. Lower income older adults are particularly
      vulnerable to accelerated aging and disease onset due to the stress of economic insecurity.
      In 2012,4 the highest chronic low-income rates in Canada were reported among immigrants 65
      years of age and older. Accordingly, it is important to investigate programs that can support
      the wellbeing of aging Canadian immigrants.

      Within the one-year tenure of the RBC grant, the principal investigator (PI) and her research
      team will conduct a one-factor between-subjects design with two conditions - a
      mindfulness-based intervention and a waitlist control - to examine the benefits of
      mindfulness training on indices of wellbeing, including perceived stress, social engagement,
      quality of life, and self-reported emotional health. It is hypothesized that mindfulness
      training will enhance indices of wellbeing compared with wait-list control. Employing a
      mixed-methods approach, participants will also engage in a qualitative interviews to provide
      insight into the lived experience and how mindfulness may serve Canadian immigrants living
      with economic insecurity.

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days (pre-post testing)</time_frame>
    <description>the PSS is a 14-item questionnaire that measures general perceived stress. Total Scores range from 0-56, with higher scores denoting greater perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>Center for epidemiological studies - depression (CES-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days (pre-post testing)</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D is a self-report measure of depressive symptoms. Total score ranges from 0-60, with greater scores denoting greater endorsement of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>current2 days (pre-post testing)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item instrument that measures physical, emotional, and overall health. The scale contains 8 parameters of health status: physical functioning, role limitation due to physical and emotional problems, social functioning, mental health, pain, vitality, and general health perception. Items are aggregated to create two component scores: physical and mental component summary scores, with higher scores indicating better subjective health. The scoring and score transformation will be done via the QualityMetric's Health Outcomesâ„¢ Scoring Software.</description>

    <description>The FFMQ is a 33-item self-report measure, that measures mindfulness characteristics including the ability to observe, describe, act with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting. &quot;. Subscale scores range from 8 to 40 for the observing, describing, acting with awareness, and non-judging facets, or 7 to 35 for the non-reacting facet, resulting in an overall FFMQ score range of 39 to 195. Higher scores indicate greater levels of TM.</description>

    <description>Mindfulness-based stress reduction is a manualized mindfulness training protocol that has been researched for over 20 years. The original protocol will be used, with the exception of the prescribed home practice duration (i.e. 30 mins of practice). Rather, the program will be modified to set up participants for success by providing them with instruction to &quot;build&quot; on their meditation practice, beginning with 8 minutes a day.</description>
