  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ophthalmic changes during long-lasting sleep apnea are lacking in description and
      assessment. The investigators intend to observe patients for a long time and observe if the
      changes in eye tissues are progressing over the years in easily recognizable patterns.

    <measure>Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quality assessed with the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) comparing the score at baseline with during 10 years of observation. The questionnaire are composed of 30 questions that can be answered from 1 to 4 points (where 1 means extreme difficulty of doing an activity and 4 - no difficulties). Five subscales are given such as: General Productivity (8 questions -1 - 4, 8 - 11), Social Outcome (2 questions - 12, 13), Activity Level (9 questions - 5, 14 - 16, 22 - 26), Vigilance (7 questions - 6, 7, 17 - 21), Intimate Relationships and Sexual Activity (4 questions - 27 - 30). To obtain a Total Score: Calculate the mean of the subscale scores and multiply that mean by the number of subscales for which there is a score. The potential range of scores for the Total Score is 5 - 20.</description>

    <description>Quality assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale comparing the score at baseline with during 10 years of observation. The questionnaire are composed of 8 questions describing activities during which patient can feel sleepy, each scored from 0 (zero probability to falling asleep) to 3 (very likely that patient will fall asleep).</description>

The questionnaire are composed of 10 questions composed in seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
