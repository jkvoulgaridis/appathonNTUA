  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficiency of early treatment for ASD children 5 years
      after initial treatment.

      The early treatment implemented was 12 hours per week of ESDM versus treatment as usual
      during 2 years. This was done as an RCT, called IDEA. Children will now be included in IDEA-2
      SCOLA, a three year follow up study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      180 children with ASD, younger than 3 years old, were included in the IDEA RCT. Children were
      allocated to the ESDM treatment group or the treatment as usual group. The aim of IDEA-2 is
      to follow-up this population for 3 years after the initial 2 years of intervention, that is,
      5 years after initial inclusion to IDEA.

      Investigators hypothesize that children who received ESDM 12 hours per week will have a
      significant decrease of autism symptoms and will have a better scholastic level 5 years after
      initial inclusion to IDEA.

    <description>Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule is a semi-structured, standardized, observational tool, which measures core autism symptoms, that is to say reciprocal sociocommunicative interaction, and repetitive and restrictive behaviors. This assessment will be administered by an assessor blind to the allocation group.</description>

    <description>The WISC-IV, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and Adolescents - 4th Edition - measures total IQ as well as 4 indices: verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, processing speed and working memory. It is for children aged 6 to 16 and lasts 60 to 90 minutes.
The WPPSI-R or the Revised Wechsler Primary and Preschool Intelligence Scale is a psychometric test for very young children, for children from 2 to 6 years old The scores of standard items are between 7 and 13 for the average, if they are less than 4, the child is very deficient in this item.

In the field of communication: items range from 1 to 67.Depending on the standard score obtained, five adaptive levels can be defined:top, moderately High, adequate, moderately low, low Daily adaptive skills measured by the composite score from the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales ( VABS) 3 years after the beginning of the follow-up study ( i.e. 5 years after initial inclusion to IDEA</description>

    <description>Children below the age of 3 in this group received 2 years of ESDM intervention for 12 hours per week, and then treatment as usual for the 3 following years.
What is called &quot;treatment as usual&quot; is what the community can usually offer. That is what the control group in IDEA received.
In IDEA-2, both control and interventional group of IDEA will receive treatment as usual during 3 years.
Treatment as usual comprises of different types of interventions, such as speech pathology therapy, occupational therapy and other types of therapy more or less specific to ASD in the community.</description>

    <description>The intervention was ESDM, delivered by professionals, one therapist per child, 12 hours per week during 2 years.
Then, they will receive the treatment as usual during 3 years in this current follow-up study.
Precise description of the 2 years ESDM treatment can be found in the published protocol of IDEA.
What is called &quot;treatment as usual&quot; is what the community can usually offer. That is what the control group in IDEA received.
In IDEA-2, both control and interventional group of IDEA will receive treatment as usual during 3 years.
Treatment as usual comprises of different types of interventions, such as speech pathology therapy, occupational therapy and other types of therapy more or less specific to ASD in the community.
All the interventions received by the children will be monitored in IDEA-2. All different treatment approaches will be quantified (type, frequency, intensity and duration).</description>
