  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the feasibility of providing 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring in community pharmacies. The investigators hypothesize it will be
      feasible for community pharmacies to provide the service to assist medical providers in the
      diagnosing and management of high blood pressure. The investigators will also survey
      participants regarding their experience with the service as well as conduct interviews with
      participating pharmacists and medical providers to understand their views and opinions on the
      feasibility of the service.
