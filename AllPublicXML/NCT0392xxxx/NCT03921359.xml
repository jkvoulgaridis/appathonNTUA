    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to investigate the effects of 8-week SMARTfit training versus
      conventional physical training on motor function, cognition and brain functional connectivity
      in individuals with PD. The investigators hypothesize that clinical and physical performance
      will improve after SMARTfit training more than after conventional physical training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although Parkinson's disease (PD) has been mainly viewed as a movement disorder, the
      pathophysiology of declined motor function incorporates impairments of multiple systems,
      including sensory, motor and cognitive pathways. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that
      cognitive function may play an essential role in motor function for individuals with PD.
      Cognitive dysfunction involving set-shifting and attentional control has been found to be
      associated with movement slowness in performing a finger sequence task and freezing of gait.
      Furthermore, a recent rodent model indicates that cognitive dysfunction may occur prior to
      the onset of motor symptoms. Similarly human studies show that 25-30% individuals with PD
      exhibit cognitive impairments at the time of diagnosis. The overall evidence suggests that
      cognitive dysfunction may contribute to degraded motor function in PD. Interestingly, several
      studies demonstrate that aerobic exercise and resistance training can improve cognitive
      function in individuals with PD, indicating a tight interplay between motor and cognitive
      function. Targeting cognitive function by incorporating cognitive training into physical
      rehabilitation may be important for people with PD. Although there is mounting evidence for
      the benefits of physical exercise in PD, few studies investigate whether combining cognitive
      training with physical exercise can provide additional benefits than physical exercise alone.
      Thus, the purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the effect of SMARTfit training, a
      novel technology that provides an opportunity to combine physical training with cognitive
      training, in individuals with PD. The hypothesis is that SMARTfit training will promote
      greater motor and cognition improvements than conventional physical training. To test the
      above hypothesis, ten individuals with mild PD will receive both SMARTfit training and
      conventional physical training in a counterbalanced order with a washout period. For each
      training program, participants will receive a 1-hour training session 3 times per week for 8
      weeks. The changes in disease biomarkers before and after training will also be explored.

    <description>The mPPT is a 9-item test that assesses multiple dimensions of physical function (basic and complex activities of daily living) with different levels of difficulty. Participants will be asked to complete functional tasks (i.e. writing a sentence, simulated eating, lift a book and put it on a shelf, turning 360 degrees, 50-foot walking test, stair climbing etc.). Total score ranges from 0 to 36, with a higher score indicating better physical function.</description>

    <description>The UPDRS is an assessment of Parkinson's disease severity and progress. The UPDRS has four sections. The first section assesses mental, mood, and behavioral changes. The second section assesses historical activities of daily living. The third section is the motor examination portion of the UPDRS and includes evaluations of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, gait, and postural instability. The fourth section evaluates complications of therapy including motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Total score ranges from 0 to 260, with a higher score indicating greater disease severity.</description>

    <description>The SEE is to capture an individual's confidence in their ability to continue exercising in the face of barriers to exercise. The SEE consists of 9 items describing potential barriers to participation in exercise (e.g., &quot;too busy with other activities,&quot; &quot;did not enjoy exercise,&quot; &quot;felt pain with exercise,&quot; &quot;bored by the exercise&quot;). For each item, participants circled a number from 0 (&quot;not confident&quot;) to 10 (&quot;very confident&quot;) that best described their belief that they could exercise 3 times a week for 20 minutes. Total score ranges from 0 to 90, with a higher score indicating higher self-efficacy for exercise.</description>

    <description>The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the participant is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. The test can provide information about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, as well as executive functioning.</description>

    <description>The PDCRS is is a valid, reliable and useful neuropsychological battery designed to cover the full spectrum of cognitive defects associated with PD. The PDCRS includes 10 'subcortical-type' items (attention, working memory, Stroop test, four verbal fluencies, immediate and delayed verbal memory, clock drawing), and two 'cortical-type' items (naming, copy of a clock). Total score ranges from 0 to 204, subcortical score from 0 to 174, and cortical score from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating a better functioning.</description>
