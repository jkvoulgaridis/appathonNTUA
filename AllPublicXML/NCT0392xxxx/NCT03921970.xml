  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery has been widely used in the treatment of obesity in recent years. It has
      been shown to be effective in reaching the ideal weight and reducing obesity-induced
      comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is defined as the first-step bariatric
      surgery for patients in the high surgical risk group. It has been shown that the laparoscopic
      approach has lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays, and earlier mobilization
      compared to open surgery. However, postoperative pain management is very important because it
      might cause major morbidity, especially pulmonary complications in the early postoperative
      period. The ultrasound (US) guided erector spina plane (ESP) block is a novel interfacial
      plan block defined by Forero et al. at 2016. ESP block provides thoracic analgesia at T5
      level and abdominal analgesia at T7-9 level. In the literature, there is not still any
      randomized study evaluating ESP block efficiency for postoperative analgesia management after
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery.

      Prospective, Randomized Study Bariatric surgery has been widely used in the treatment of
      obesity in recent years. It has been shown to be effective in reaching the ideal weight and
      reducing obesity-induced comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is defined as
      the first-step bariatric surgery for patients in the high surgical risk group. It has been
      shown that the laparoscopic approach has lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays,
      and earlier mobilization compared to open surgery. However, postoperative pain management is
      very important because it might cause major morbidity, especially pulmonary complications in
      the early postoperative period.

      General recommendations for bariatric surgery include multimodal analgesia without sedatives,
      local analgesic infiltration, and early mobilization. Opioid analgesics are often preferred
      for pain management because of their strong analgesic potentials. However, opioids have
      undesirable adverse effects such as sedation, dizziness, constipation, nausea, vomiting,
      physical dependence and addiction, hyperalgesia, immunologic and hormonal dysfunction, muscle
      rigidity, tolerance, and respiratory depression. The morbidly obese patients treated with
      opioids experience increased risk for adverse effects such as atelectasis, which causes
      postoperative pulmonary complications, and obstructive sleep apnea, which causes hypoxemia,
      postoperative ileus and longer hospital stay due to nausea and vomiting. For this reason, in
      2006, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) suggested minimizing or avoiding
      opioids during perioperative and/or postoperative pain management to the bariatric patients.
      Therefore, ASA recommends the use of multimodal analgesia including local anesthesia,
      regional anesthesia and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

      The ultrasound (US) guided erector spina plane (ESP) block is a novel interfacial plan block
      defined by Forero et al. at 2016. ESP block provides thoracic analgesia at T5 level and
      abdominal analgesia at T7-9 level. The ESP block contains a local anesthetic injection into
      the deep fascia of erector spinae. This area is away from the pleural and neurological
      structures and thus minimizes the risk of complications due to injury. Visualization of
      sonoanatomy with US is easy, and the spread of local anesthesic agents can be easily seen
      under the erector spinae muscle. Thus, analgesia occurs in several dermatomes with
      cephalad-caudad way. Cadaveric studies have shown that the injection spreads to the ventral
      and dorsal roots of the spinal nerves and creates sensory blockade in both posterior and
      anterolateral thorax. In the literature, it has been reported that ESP block provides
      effective analgesia after ventral hernia repair surgery in a randomized controlled study. In
      some case series and case reports it has been reported that ESP block provides effective
      analgesia after abdominal and bariatric surgeries. In the literature, there is not still any
      randomized study evaluating ESP block efficiency for postoperative analgesia management after
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of US-guided ESP block for postoperative
      analgesia management following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The primary aim is to compare
      postoperative opioid consumption and the secondary aim is to evaluate postoperative pain
      scores (VAS), adverse effects related with opioids (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).

    <intervention_model_description>Fourty patients aged 18-65 years old with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I-II and scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy under general anesthesia will be included in this prospective randomized study. Patients with a history of bleeding diathesis, receiving anticoagulant treatment, known local anesthetics and opioid allergy, infection of the skin at the site of the needle puncture, pregnancy or lactation, and patients who do not accept the procedure will be excluded from the study. Randomization will be achieved using a randomizing computer program. Patients will be randomly divided into two groups (Group ESP = ESP group, Group C = Control group) including 20 patients each, before entering the operating room.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>ESP block (Group ESP) will be performed in the preoperative block room. US probe will be placed longitudinally 2-3 cm lateral to the T7 transvers process. From superior to inferior; trapezius (upper), rhomboideus major (middle), erector spinae (lower) muscles will be visualized on the hyperechoic transverse process. The 22G, 50 mm block needle (Braun Stimuplex Ultra 360, Germany) will be inserted in a cranio caudal direction and then for correction of the needle 5 ml normal saline solution will be enjected into the erector spina muscle fascia (figure). Following confirmation of the correct position of the needle, a dose of 20 ml %0.25 bupivacaine was administered. The same procedure will be performed at the other site (totally 40 ml %0.25 bupivacaine).</description>
