  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the satiating effects of different canned tuna
      preserved in olive oil enriched with soluble fiber or polyphenols on overweight subjects (BMI
      ≥25 and &lt;30 kg / m2).

      Some studies have shown the contribution of high-fiber foods in the reduction of the
      cardiovascular risk.

      A randomized, cross-over and double-blind pilot study with 3 study arms is being performed to
      evaluate the satiating properties of different canned tuna preserved in olive oil enriched
      with soluble fiber or polyphenols on overweight subjects.

      The investigators included 12 participants (6 men and 6 women) between 18 and 55 years (BMI
      ≥25 and &lt;30 kg / m2). All volunteers will be randomized into 3 study groups, and participants
      will receive the 3 different study products in order during the 3 experimental phases.

    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). 100mm horizontal line anchored at each end with the extremes of the subjective feeling to be quantified. Subjects are instructed to rate the sensation being experienced according to how they define the line.
e.g., &quot;not at all hungry&quot; (0mm) and &quot;as hungry as I have ever felt&quot; (100mm). Multiple measures are taken at repeated time intervals described below.</description>
