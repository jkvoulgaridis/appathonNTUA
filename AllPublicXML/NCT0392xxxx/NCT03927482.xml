  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this fast-track STTR, Phase 1 will develop and test a mobile phone app among 40 adult
      community college students. The app is designed to reduce risky drinking behaviors and
      improve user safety. In Phase 2 the app (&quot;CARES&quot;) will be tested with 200 adult community
      college students who drink alcohol. Participants will be randomly assigned to the &quot;CARES&quot; app
      or an alcohol education control condition and will use the app for 12 weeks. Six month
      outcomes will assess changes in drinking related behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This STTR builds on our successful pilot that developed a text message-delivered alcohol
      intervention for, and in collaboration with CCS. Phase I will develop and test a smart phone
      application (the &quot;Cares&quot; app) incorporating the text message program with additional features
      and functionality requested by students in the pilot trial (Aim 1.1). After obtaining user
      feedback (Aim 1.2) programming will be completed in both iOS and Android languages. To ensure
      that the College Alcohol Risk Education System (CARES) is well positioned to get into the
      community college marketplace, it is critical to demonstrate efficacy. Phase 2 will conduct
      an efficacy trial of CARES compared to a competing alcohol education program that would be
      feasible for most community colleges to adopt, thus providing a real-world comparison with
      data suitable to support future efforts toward commercialization. This study will also
      identify the types of individuals for whom CARES is more/less effective and identify how it
      might be improved.

    <description>Check Your Drinking is an online alcohol assessment that provides normative feedback on the user's drinking habits relative to his/her peers. Alcohol interventions that provide normative feedback are rated by the NIAAA Alcohol Intervention Matrix as effective and low cost, and with few administrative or structural barriers to implementation thus making it suitable for community colleges.</description>
