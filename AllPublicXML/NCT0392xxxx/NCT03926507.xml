  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well F18 fluciclovine positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in assessing tumor volume and radiation therapy response
      in patients with glioblastoma undergoing surgery. Radioactive imaging agents, such as F18
      fluciclovine, used during PET/CT scan may help measure tumor size compared to standard of
      care magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents in patients receiving radiation
      therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare fluciclovine F18 (F18 fluciclovine) PET CT for tumor volume assessment compared
      to T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1 post contrast magnetic resonance
      (MR) brain imaging.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess changes in F18 fluciclovine defined disease with surgery and radiation.

      II. To assess the relationship between post-radiation enhancing brain tissue and F18
      fluciclovine activity.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the association between results from pathology and F18 fluciclovine, T2 FLAIR,
      and T1 post-contrast MR brain imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluciclovine F18 intravenously (IV) and undergo 4 PET/CT scans over 10
      minutes paired with standard of care MRI within 14 days prior to initial maximal tumor
      resection, within 7 days prior to initiation of radiation therapy, 28 days after the
      completion of radiation therapy, and 6 months after the completion of radiation therapy.

      After completion of study, patients will be followed up at 3 and 6 months.

The three volumes measured (amino acid hypermetabolic volume [AHV], T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR] and T1 contrast [T1C]) will be compared to each other for each patient, and plotted as boxplots, both raw (as mL) and as normalized values (to the T1C volume) to facilitate comparisons between patients.</description>
