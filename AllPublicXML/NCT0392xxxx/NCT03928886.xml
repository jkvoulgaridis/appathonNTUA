  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Senographe Pristina is a new mammography system (hardware and software) designed to improve
      patient experience, patient throughput, and radiographer experience while maintaining the
      imaging capabilities and image quality of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and digital
      breast tomosynthesis (DBT) breast imaging. The purpose of this study is to assess patient
      experience as it relates to discomfort when patient-assisted compression is compared against
      the standard compression mode of Senographe Pristina in asymptomatic adult women undergoing
      screening FFDM mammography.

      The technical/clinical quality assessment of mammograms is essential to ensure that high
      quality images are consistently used in a breast cancer screening program. Advances in
      mammography equipment may improve the image quality. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize
      that the introduction of Senographe Pristina may have an effect on the technical/clinical
      quality of screening mammograms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leading authorities on breast cancer recommend regular screening mammography for women aged
      40 years and older as a means of early detection for breast cancer, which can lead to
      increased survival rates and more treatment options. Numerous randomized trials have
      demonstrated that regular mammographic screening reduces breast cancer mortality, with more
      than 40% reduction in breast cancer deaths. Amidst the success of screening mammography,
      clinicians struggle to maintain patient participation in regular screening programs. Notably,
      a systematic review by Whelehan, et al. concluded that pain experienced during screening
      mammography (e.g. compression pain) contributed to reduced rates of repeat participation in
      regular screening programs.

      Adequate breast compression during mammography creates uniform thickness and flattens
      tissues, which is necessary to obtain sufficient image quality and reduce radiation dose.
      Various methods are being investigated to maintain sufficient compression while reducing pain
      associated with mammography. Specifically, studies have shown that a personalized approach to
      compression can significantly reduce pain intensity and discomfort experienced by patients
      while maintaining diagnostic image quality.

      Patient-controlled compression allows the patient to control the amount of compression force
      during mammography and is a personalized approach that has demonstrated successful pain
      reduction in mammography. GE Healthcare's Senographe Pristina, an innovative mammography
      platform that provides both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging
      capabilities, offers standard and patient-controlled compression modes. The study described
      herein is being conducted to compare discomfort experienced by asymptomatic women undergoing
      full-field digital (FFDM) 2D screening mammography with standard and patient-controlled
      compression modes of Senographe Pristina. Results from this study may be used to support
      future regulatory submissions.

      The population of this study will consist of adult asymptomatic women presenting for
      screening FFDM. Eligible patients will be enrolled and will undergo bilateral two-view (CC
      and MLO) imaging with Senographe Pristina.

      Each subject will use both standard and patient-assisted compression modes, with one mode
      randomly assigned to the right breast and the other mode assigned to the left breast.
      Immediately following image acquisition (i.e. during decompression), subjects will be asked
      to rate their level of discomfort using a validated 11-point pain rating scale (numeric
      rating scale). Additional data collected from each subject will include demographic and
      clinical history information, breast thickness, radiation dose, compression force, and
      overall patient experience feedback.

      Pain scores will be summarized with descriptive statistics and other endpoint data will be
      analyzed using general statistical methods. Pain results will be compared according to
      compression mode and multivariate analysis will be performed to assess the potential effect
      of other variables. The technical/clinical quality assessment of mammograms is essential to
      ensure that high quality images are consistently used in a breast cancer screening program.
      Poor image quality may lead to missed diagnoses and compromised detection of breast cancers.
      In this sense, it has been reported that high image quality leads to higher detection rates
      and fewer interval cancers.

      In order to assess the technical/clinical quality of screening mammograms, the PGMI (perfect,
      good, moderately good, and inadequate) system will be used. With this system the
      investigators routinely evaluate the technical/clinical quality of screening mammograms in
      our center. A random sample of 500 women with two (2) Medio Lateral Oblique (MLO) and two (2)
      Cranial Caudal (CC) views produced with Senographe Pristina (291 with patient-assisted
      compression and 291 with standard compression mode) will be assessed by three highly trained
      radiologists. Technical/clinical image quality will be compared according to compression mode
      and multivariate analysis will be performed to assess the potential effect of other
      variables. Additionally, the investigators will compare the technical/clinical image quality
      of mammograms produced by Senographe Pristina with the image quality observed in the previous
      routine evaluations performed in our center.

    <intervention_model_description>Each subject will undergo her regularly scheduled full-field digital mammography imaging exam per standard practices at the investigational site. Study-related compressions will consist of the first and second CC and MLO compressions performed on each breast during each subject's exam. Both the laterality (right/left breast) to which compression modes are assigned and the mode of compression to start with will be randomized across all subjects. Hence, approximately one quarter of women will use patient-assisted compression as first option on the right breast, another quarter will use patient-assisted compression as first option on the left breast, a third quarter will use standard compression as first option on the right breast and the last quarter will use standard compression as first option on the left breast. The randomization schedule will be generated by Epidemiology and Evaluation Department of the Hospital and provided to the study staff prior to start of enrollment.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Subject-provided pain scores using an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) of patient-assisted compression and standard compression will be used as a measure of discomfort. A total of six (6) pain scores will be obtained from each subject, consisting of two (2) baseline pain scores (right/left breast) collected previous to the image acquisition, two (2) patient-assisted compression scores (CC and MLO) and two (2) standard compression scores (CC and MLO). Immediately following image acquisition (i.e. during decompression of the breast), study staff will ask the subject to provide a verbal score, indicating her level of pain for the given compression. A validated 11-point NRS will be used for each assessment, where a score of 0 will indicate no pain and 10 will indicate the worst pain. Pain scores will be documented on Case Report Form (CRFs) by the study staff</description>

    <description>Senographe Pristina is a commercial mammography medical device consisting of the Senographe Pristina FFDM system (2D) and Senographe Pristina DBT option (3D). Senographe Pristina includes the hardware and software components required for multi-modality functioning and is designed to improve patient experience, patient throughput, and radiographer experience. The system offers two compression modes - standard mode and the optional patient-assisted compression. The patient-assisted compression feature enables the patient to personally refine breast compression using a hand-held remote control after the compression has been initiated by the operator, which is required to ensure proper breast positioning.</description>
