  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigatiors aimed to conduct a well-designed RCT to firstly focus on GDM women
      controlled with only diet and exercise, and provide an optimize process on their timing and
      mode of delivery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GDM is a common complication of pregnancy and even mildly hyperglycemia could significantly
      affect fetal growth. Optimal delivery timing in women with GDM remains controversial. This
      decision process involves balancing the potential for complications that are caused by
      increased interventions with the benefit of avoidance of future adverse outcomes. Thus, the
      aim of the present trial is to explore the best management on the timing of delivery of
      pregnant women with GDM that controlled with only diet and exercise, which can both decrease
      the risk of macrosomia and the risk of cesarean delivery.

    <description>Women randomized to the &quot;old guideline group&quot; will be followed up once-weekly by electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and biophysical profile until 40 weeks 0 days (unless a medical indication arises), when induction of labor was then offered.</description>

    <description>Women randomized to &quot;new procedure group&quot; will first undergo fetal weight ultrasound estimation at 38 weeks 0 days to 38 weeks 6 days of gestation, if the fetus is estimated to be LGA/macrosomia by ultrasound, women should have an elective induction of labor immediately (at 38 weeks 0 days to 38 weeks 6 days of gestation). On the contrary, if the fetus is estimated to be normal size, the pregnant women were then given a cervical assessment. If the Bishop score ≥6, women will have at least weekly follow-up visits with their doctors and unless a medical indication is present, continue pregnancy and have selective induction at 40 weeks 0 days of gestation. Whereas, if the Bishop score &lt;6, women will be followed up until 41 weeks 0 days of gestation with a close assessment of fetal wellbeing through the cardiotocographic trace. And women who will not deliver by this gestational age will be admitted for labor induction. Certainly, medical indication should warrant delivery without delay.</description>
