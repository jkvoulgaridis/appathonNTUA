  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adapted athletic activity has shown benefits in patients with certain chronic diseases,
      including improving fatigue and pain in patients with cancer, and improving the symptoms of
      severe depression.

      Among Patients Living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV), sport appears to be less
      common than for people who do not live with HIV. In fact, 44% of PLHIV in a Swiss cohort
      (10,500 patients) were inactive in 2014, whereas this percentage was 26% in the general
      population in Switzerland. We did not find any French data on the prevalence of sports
      activity among PLHIV.

      The benefits of sport in PLHIV are numerous: meta-analyzes on interventional studies of
      aerobic and resistance exercises show a significant improvement in maximum oxygen
      consumption, muscle strength, percentage of body fat, quality of life and symptoms of
      depression. An improvement in cognitive function was noted in a randomized study. An Iranian
      randomized study of 2017 showed an improvement in the CD4 count, after 8 weeks of resistive
      exercise, but two meta-analyzes of 2016 and 2017 did not find a significant change in CD4 or
      viral load with physical exercise.

      On the other hand, several studies have shown that sports practice improves self-esteem. In
      addition, an Australian randomized study in 2006 showed an improvement in self-efficacy in
      PLHIVs after a six-month exercise (aerobic and resistance) program. Furthermore, self-esteem
      (defined as positive self-esteem) is a factor facilitating adherence to antiretroviral
      therapy.

      The objective of this descriptive study is to evaluate the prevalence of sports activity in a
      French adult population infected with HIV and to seek an association with self-esteem. In
      addition, the investigators will look for an association between sport and fatigue, pain,
      sleep, lymphocyte T CD4 cell levels, viral load.

        The study population will consist of all HIV-infected patients followed in one of the
        COREVIH centers of Pays de la Loire participating in this study. Participation in the study
        will be offered to patients during a usual visit as part of the follow-up of their
        pathology. The annual number of patients in 2017 being 4300, it is estimated that the
        number of patients included will be between 1000 and 2000 over 6 months of inclusion with a
        response rate of at least 50%.
