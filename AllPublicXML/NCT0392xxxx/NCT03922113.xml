    <textblock>
      Final objective of critical care is no longer only survival. The role of medical and
      paramedical teams should also be to restore functional capacities, autonomy and quality of
      life. What has been call &quot;intensive care unit - acquired weakness&quot; (ICU-AW) is associated to
      acute and long term increased mortality, prolonged ICU and hospital stay, prolonged duration
      of mechanical ventilation, altered quality of life in survivors and increased health-related
      costs. In order to target efficient secondary prevention and early rehabilitation, prompt
      identification of muscle weakness is crucial. Several methods, aiming to assess muscle mass,
      muscle strength or physical function, are described. Manual muscle testing using the Medical
      Research Council (MRC) scale is still the most commonly utilized tool to diagnose ICU-AW (MRC
      &lt;48/60). Dynamometry is an objective alternative and one of the most accurate clinimetric
      tool to assess muscle strength. Literature is overflowing with insufficiently standardized
      dynamometry data. Using the investigator's published standardized protocol of quadriceps
      strength (QS) assessment, this observational study aim to describe physical performances of
      CC patients and thus to define the weakest ones, by comparing them to surgical and healthy
      subjects.

    <measure>Change in Quadriceps strength</measure>
    <time_frame>For critically ill patients: T0 (as soon as they were collaborative in ICU) and M1 (at one month following discharge), for surgical patients at T0 (day before surgery) and at M1 (one month following discharge), for healthy subjects: T0</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal isometric voluntary quadriceps contraction is assessed using a hand-held dynamometer (MicroFet2Â®, Hoggan Health Industries, West Jordan, UT, USA) with a curved transducer pad. The highly standardized protocol is detailed in a previously published validation study (Rousseau et al, Acta Anaesthesiologica Belgica 2018). Measurements are performed at bedside with patient lying on supine position. The dominant limb is tested (kicking leg). The best performance out of 3 measurements is considered for the analysis. Muscle strength is expressed in Newton (N). Relative strength, normalized according to actual body weight, is expressed in N/kg.</description>

    <description>Manual evaluation of muscle strength. This scale grades muscle power on a scale of 0 to 5 in relation to the maximum expected for that muscle. Grade 0 = no movement is observed, grade 5= muscle contracts normally against full resistance. Six muscles groups are tested at both sides of the body: shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, wrist extension, hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion. Maximal total score is 60.</description>

    <description>This test measures strength and functional outcomes, by ranking 4 components: assistance (sit and stand), cadence (steps/min), shoulder flexion strength and knee extension strength. Maximal score is 10.</description>

    <description>This score assesses functional independence by ranking patient's independence in the following areas: feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, bowel control, bladder control, toilet use, transfers, mobility in level surfaces and stairs. Maximal total score is 100 = totally independent).</description>
