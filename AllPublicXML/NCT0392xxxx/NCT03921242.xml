  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proposal for a retrospective observational study of the safety of metformin use in
      patients with chronic kidney disease, compared to other commonly used diabetes drugs. It will
      be conducted using retrospective data from the New York City CDRN, Medicare administrate
      files, and New York State Medicaid administrative files, which will be linked and then
      deidentified prior to analysis.

      Specific aims are as follows:

      Aim 1. For patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus(T2DM) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD),
      compare metformin to alternative non-insulin diabetes drugs (sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors,
      GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT-2 inhibitors)) with respect to the key safety outcome of
      severe hypoglycemia. The primary hypothesis is that metformin will be superior to
      sulfonylurea in terms of severe hypoglycemia rates, and non-inferior to DPP-4 inhibitors.
      Secondary outcomes will include hospitalization for acidosis, hospitalization for
      hyperglycemia, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and heart
      failure emergency room visit.

      Aim 2. For patients with T2DM and CKD, compare metformin to alternative non-insulin diabetes
      drugs with respect to HbA1c reduction. The primary hypothesis is that metformin will be
      superior to DPP-4 inhibitors and non-inferior to sulfonylureas for HbA1c reduction (i.e.,
      improvement in blood sugar). Secondary outcomes will include change in body-mass index (BMI)
      and kidney function, non-persistence to treatment, and progression to insulin use.

      Aim 3. Examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects on hypoglycemia risk and HbA1c response
      across patient subgroups. The primary hypothesis is that metformin's advantages will be more
      pronounced in more severe CKD.
