      This is a multicentric study. All patients with TET (thymic epithelial tumors) of any
      histological type will participate in the study. This is an open-label phase 2 study that
      will follow a Green-Dahlberg 2-stage design whose objective is to evaluate the activity and
      safety of the combination of ramucirumab (10 mg / kg) + carboplatin (AUC 5) and paclitaxel
      (200 mg / m2) in patients with relapsed and / or metastatic thymic carcinoma/ thymoma B3, in
      the first line (RELEVENT trial).

      Clinical and quality of life data will be collected for all treated patient. Based on the
      histological evaluation performed by each participating center, patients will be screened for
      inclusion in one of the three studies, based on the following criteria:

        -  TOPS studies only: all patients with A, AB, B1, B2, B3 without areas of carcinoma
           histology that do not have a fresh tissue sample and screen failures of the RELEVENT and
           BIOTET study;

        -  BIOTET only: all patients with A, AB, B1, B2, B3 without areas of histology of the
           carcinoma that have a fresh tissue sample;

        -  RELEVENT only: all patients with thymoma B3 and areas of carcinoma and patients with
           thymic carcinoma who do not have a fresh tissue sample;

        -  RELEVENT and BIOTET: all patients with thymoma B3 and areas of carcinoma and patients
           with thymic carcinoma who meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria and for whom a fresh
           tissue sample is available.Finally, the RELEVENT and BIOTET study patients will continue
           the observational follow-up of the TOPS study, once the clinical and biological study
           procedures have been completed.

      All patients, regardless of histological status, will be invited to participate in the
      clinical follow up observational and collection of PROMIS 29 in scope of the prospective TET
      study (TOPS).

      Patients with thymic carcinoma or thymoma B3 with areas of carcinoma will receive a
      centralized pathological review of the tumour block or slides and will be screened to
      participate in the Phase II RELEVENT pharmacological study.Histological diagnosis will be
      confirmed before screening.
