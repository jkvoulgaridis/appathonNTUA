  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goals of this project are to support the research training of undergraduate medical
      students at the University of Sherbrooke and promote planning of health services a better
      knowledge of the prevalence, social, and geographic distribution of public health issues in
      the Estrie administrative region, the Saguenay regional county municipality in Quebec and the
      city of Moncton, New-Brunswick.

      To meet the objectives of the project, a population-based prospective study linked to the
      Quebec and New Brunswick public health surveys is proposed. The Estrie administrative region,
      the Saguenay regional county municipality and the city of Moncton will be targeted.

      Monitoring and data collection will be provided by 3rd year undergraduate medical students at
      University of Sherbrooke through telephone interviews.

      The research themes will be proposed by various researchers affiliated with the University of
      Sherbrooke. They will be selected by an internal scientific committee and included in the
      questionnaires administered by the students.
