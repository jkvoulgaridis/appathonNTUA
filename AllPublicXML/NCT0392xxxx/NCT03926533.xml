  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although more than 50% of survivors of critical illness experience one or more post-intensive
      care syndrome (PICS) problems, there are still no validated interventions for the management
      of PICS. The long-term goal of this study is to develop and refine in-person and telehealth
      strategies for the delivery of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) recovery care for the treatment of
      PICS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives in this application are to (a) examine the feasibility of providing
      telehealth ICU recovery care and (b) determine if ICU recovery care is effective. The central
      hypothesis is that ICU recovery care improves cognitive, mental health, and physical function
      of ICU survivors by application of a patient-centered survivorship care plan with targeted
      interventions to address patient-specific cognitive, mental health, and physical
      dysfunctions. The rationale for this project is that a determination of the feasibility of
      telehealth and effectiveness of ICU recovery care in general is likely to offer a strong
      scientific framework informing the development of new implementation strategies. We will test
      the central hypotheses by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Test that telehealth ICU recovery
      care is feasible, and 2) Test the hypothesis that telehealth ICU recovery care compared to
      standard of care conditions will be more effective for improvement in cognitive, mental
      health, physical, and global function at 6 months following hospital discharge. To address
      these aims, we will enroll patients treated for septic shock and acute respiratory distress
      syndrome in the medical and surgical ICUs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Study
      patients will be randomized 1:1 to either the telehealth ICU recovery care or standard of
      care groups. We will conduct telehealth ICU recovery care from the Vanderbilt ICU Recovery
      Center. This ICU survivor clinic relies on the expertise of clinicians from critical care
      medicine, nursing, pharmacy, neuropsychology, rehabilitation, and case management to assess
      and manage PICS. Telehealth feasibility measures include appropriateness, acceptability, and
      implementability. Following telehealth clinic participation at 3 weeks and 3 months after
      hospital discharge, we will assess participants for cognitive, mental health, physical, and
      global quality of life outcomes using trained, blinded research personnel at 6 months
      following hospital discharge. We incorporated PROMIS patient-centered outcome measures into
      each patient outcome category. This research is significant because it is expected to provide
      scientific justification for the continued development and implementation of ICU recovery
      care programs. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to improve the quality of life
      for millions of ICU survivors and their family members.

    <measure>cognitive impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MOCA-Blind is a 13-item widely used measure in research to evaluate for cognitive impairment. The MOCA-Blind assesses memory, attention, language, recall, orientation, and abstraction where total test score ranges from 0 (worst) to 22 (best) and a score below 18 is considered abnormal. The PROMIS Cognitive Function Short-Form v2.0 is an 8-item patient-reported outcome measure that assesses patient-perceived changes in mental acuity, verbal and nonverbal memory, concentration, and verbal fluency. Raw scores are converted to a T-score which rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 (+/-10). Higher T-scores indicates higher function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>depression</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured using the PROMIS Depression v1.0, an 8-item self-report of negative mood, views of self, social cognition, and decreased positive affect and engagement. Subjects rate each item from 1 (never) to 5 (always) to indicate the degree to which they have experienced the symptom in the past 7 days. Raw scores for PROMIS Depression are converted to a T-score which rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 (+/-10). Higher T-scores indicate greater depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>physical impairments</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Physical Function v2.0, a 20-item self-report of physical capability rather than actual performance of physical activities (e.g., dexterity, mobility). Subjects rate each item from 1 (unable to do) to 5 (without any difficulty) for their current capability. Raw scores are converted to a T-score which rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 (+/-10). Higher T-scores indicate better function. Respiratory function will be measured using the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), a 40-item self-report questionnaire evaluating pulmonary function, symptoms, and the impact on daily life. Scores range from 0 (no impairment) to 80 (maximum health impairment).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>QOL</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Global Short Form v1.1, a 10-item self-reported measure of health-related quality of life. Subjects rate each item from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) for their current health and quality of life with the exception of question #10 which rates pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Raw scores are converted to a T-score which rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 (+/-10). Higher T-scores indicate better health-related quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be measured using the PROMIS Anxiety v1.0, an 8-item self-report of fear, anxious misery, hyperarousal, and somatic symptoms. Similar to depression, subjects rate each item from 1 (never) to 5 (always) to indicate the degree to which they have experienced the symptom in the past 7 days. Raw scores for PROMIS Anxiety are converted to a T-score which rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 (+/-10). Higher T-scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD symptoms will be measured using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptoms will be measured using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), a 20-item brief screening tool assessing symptoms of PTSD associated with pre-specified traumatic event (i.e., critical illness), corresponds to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and has excellent reliability and sensitivity. Subjects rate each item from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) to indicate the degree to which they have been bothered by a particular symptom over the past month. The total possible score ranges from 0-80 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms and a cut-off of 50 optimal for indicating a probable diagnosis of PTSD.</description>

    <description>Components of the ICU RC telehealth visit will be structured parallel to what is done during a typical in-person clinic visit. The telehealth intervention consists of 5 chronological components conducted during two 1.5 hour telehealth clinic visits (the same time required for an in-person visit). Upon completion of the pre-intervention baseline assessment, the study coordinator will contact patients randomized to the intervention arm to schedule the first telehealth visit. Study visits will occur at 3 weeks and 3 months following hospital discharge.</description>

Patients will be directed to use the information provided in the PICS guide for ICU survivors to connect with resources.</description>
