      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MynxGrip, in hemostasis of common femoral artery
      puncture site, compared with manual compression hemostasis in patients who have undergone
      diagnostic or interventional endovascular procedures utilizing a 5F, 6F or 7F procedural
      sheath.
