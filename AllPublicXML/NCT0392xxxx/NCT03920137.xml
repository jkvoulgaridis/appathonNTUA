      This study will look at the effectiveness of a new treatment protocol for anxious and
      depressed smokers. Participants with clinically significant anxiety or depression will
      receive either the standard smoking cessation treatment or the Unified Protocol for Smoking
      Cessation Treatment. This study will demonstrate that a single treatment protocol can
      effectively address both smoking and the complex emotional comorbidities that are widespread
      in smokers will provide a novel, impactful, and highly disseminable treatment option missing
      from today's smoking cessation arsenal.

      The present proposal aims to develop a new and efficient treatment for smokers with
      clinically significant anxiety or depression. In Phase I, the investigators will complete the
      development of a new treatment protocol (Unified Protocol for Smoking Cessation Treatment;
      UP-ST) that integrates current best practices of cognitive behavioral smoking cessation
      treatments and nicotine replacement therapy with the recently developed UP treatment protocol
      that has been shown to effectively treat both anxiety disorders and depression and to impact
      specific mechanisms (e.g., neuroticism) that are relevant to both smoking and
      anxiety/depression remission. In Phase II, 60 smokers with clinically significant anxiety or
      depression will be recruited and randomly assigned to either: (1) the UP-ST or (2) standard
      smoking cessation treatment (ST) based on the most recent clinical practice guideline from
      the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The investigators will examine the UP-ST
      relative to ST on smoking, anxiety/depression, and mechanisms of change. Demonstrating that a
      single treatment protocol can effectively address both smoking and the complex emotional
      comorbidities that are widespread in smokers will provide a novel, impactful, and highly
      disseminable treatment option missing from today's smoking cessation arsenal.

    <measure>Short- and long-term point prevalence abstinence (PPA).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>In three separate follow up appointments, one 3 months after the end of treatments, one 6 months after and one 12 months after, The investigators will ask participants various questions about their abstinence. The investigators will measure the length of time between when treatment ends and when/ if they start smoking again. The unit of measure will be length of time in days. The investigators expect that point prevalence abstinence will be higher, both in the short term and long term, in the UP-ST condition than in the ST condition. Similarly, The investigators expect the rate of decline in abstinence over time to be shallower (smaller) in UP-ST than in ST.</description>

    <description>In three separate follow up appointments 3, 6 and 12 months after the end of treatment, The investigators will administer a survey to participants. The survey will assess withdrawal symptoms. Participants will score this condition on a scale from 0-10. 10 meaning extremely severe and 0 meaning not at all. The investigators expect the mean score to be higher in the ST condition than the UP-ST condition at all time points.</description>

    <measure>Time to first smoking lapse and time to relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will ask participants to record the time (in days) of their first (if any) lapse in smoking and their relapse. The investigators will take an average for control and active participants and The investigators expect mean time to first lapse and to relapse to be greater for those in the UP-ST compared to those in the ST condition.</description>

The survey will assess tobacco craving. Participants will score this condition on a scale from 0-10. 10 meaning extremely severe and 0 meaning not at all. The investigators expect the mean score to be higher in the ST condition than the UP-ST condition at all time points.</description>

The survey will assess tobacco dependence. Participants will score this condition on a scale from 0-10. 10 meaning extremely severe and 0 meaning not at all. The investigators expect the mean score to be higher in the ST condition than the UP-ST condition at all time points.</description>

    <description>The intervention will be the UP-ST therapy sessions. Treatment will be delivered using the new UP-ST protocol that will be developed in Phase I by integrating components of smoking cessation treatments (e.g. using the nicotine patch) with the theoretical model and treatment components of the existing UP treatment protocol, which includes both a therapist14 and patient12 manual. The UP-ST will maintain the same focus on transdiagnostic mechanisms of change as in the original UP, but will be adapted to integrate the smoking cessation focus and concurrent use of NRT. Thus, the investigators can successfully adapt and develop the new UP-ST to be delivered in eight 90-minute sessions and will be able to incorporate content from each of the 8 modules of the UP in the new UP-ST protocol.</description>

    <description>The Intervention will be the standard therapy sessions. Participants will receive a standard smoking cessation treatment based on the most recent clinical practice guideline from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence19. The investigative team has considerable expertise in developing and evaluating behavioral and pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation. Treatment will be delivered in eight, 90-minute sessions over an eight-week period.</description>

    <description>Phase 1 analyses will focus primarily on demonstrating feasibility and utility of the new UP-ST intervention. Feasibility will be determined by examining the proportion of individuals who 1) complete each module of the UP-ST treatment, 2) complete a full course of the UP-ST treatment, and by 3) benchmarking participant ratings of treatment credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction with corresponding ratings from our previous clinical trials examining the UP or ST interventions. The investigators will include and examine outcomes on the same measures that will be used in phase 2, but due to the sample size our analyses for Phase 1 will focus on intraindividual effect sizes (with 95% CI) for continuous smoking, anxiety, and depression outcomes</description>
