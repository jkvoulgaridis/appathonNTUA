      This research protocol tests a new technique and devices that we have developed to treat
      functional mitral valve regurgitation, called transcatheter mitral valve cerclage
      annuloplasty, otherwise known as cerclage. Functional mitral valve regurgitation is a
      condition caused by damaged heart muscle involving the left ventricle which results in mitral
      valve leakage. This leakage causes heart failure (breathlessness and lack of energy
      especially when walking or exercising, and hospital admissions for fluid buildup). This is an
      early feasibility study (EFS) evaluation of special devices, permanently implanted in the
      heart, to perform mitral cerclage annuloplasty. Mitral cerclage annuloplasty is a catheter
      procedure performed under X-ray and ultrasound guidance without surgery. The cerclage devices
      compress the mitral valve like a purse-string. The cerclage device has a special feature that
      prevents a coronary artery from getting squeezed as part of this purse-string....

      The protocol has been changed to allow patients who have mitral valve regurgitation despite
      prior Mitra-Clip treatment.

    <description>Cerclage WITHOUT prior Mitra-Clip repair: The Transcatheter Mitral Cerclage Annuloplasty implant is attached to a guidewire and pulled through the internal jugular sheath, along the coronary sinus, through the basal septum, through the tricuspidvalve, and back out of the internal jugular sheath. The position of the TMCA implant is adjusted so that the coronary protection element lies directly over any underlying branc of the left coronary artery.</description>

    <description>The Transcatheter Mitral Cerclage Annuloplasty implant comprises two components, with or without a coronary artery protection element, and the wishbone lock with coronary sinus and RVOT limbs. The procedure is performed from a transjugular venous approach. Coronary guidewires and microcatheters are used to navigate into a coronary vein towards the target capture catheter. The implant is then attached to the back end of the guidewire and pulled out of the internal jugular sheath. The position of the implant is adjusted so that the coronary protection element lies directly over any underlying branch of the left coronary artery. The wishbone lock is then advanced over the two limbs of the implant and the desired tension is titrated to the degree of mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography is performed to confirm there is no coronary compression. Once the desired tension has been achieved, the wishbone lock is locked and the two limbs of the implant are cut with a cutter catheter.</description>
