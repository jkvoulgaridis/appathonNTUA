  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesised that, in individuals being considered for cardiovascular preventative
      therapy, computed tomography coronary angiography guided management will reduce the future
      risk of coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction compared to
      management guided by the current standard of care, a cardiovascular risk score.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of cardiovascular disease is currently guided by probabilistic risk scores that
      both over and under treat individuals, commit most middle-aged people to pharmacotherapy, and
      have little evidence base. It has been demonstrated that use of computed tomography coronary
      angiography (CTCA) is associated with changes in the diagnosis and treatment of patients
      presenting with stable chest pain, and that this leads to a marked reduction in the future
      risk of myocardial infarction. Importantly, the proportionate reduction in coronary events
      was most marked in those with non-anginal chest pain irrespective of their cardiovascular
      risk score which again demonstrated poor discrimination. The research team propose a
      randomised controlled trial of at least 6,000 middle-aged individuals at risk of
      cardiovascular disease that will compare these two strategies of targeting preventative
      therapies: a probabilistic cardiovascular risk score, and screening with CTCA. This trial
      will determine if CTCA guided management will be associated with better targeted
      intervention, prevent over medicating the general population, and result in fewer future
      coronary heart disease events than the current standard of care using a cardiovascular risk
      score.
