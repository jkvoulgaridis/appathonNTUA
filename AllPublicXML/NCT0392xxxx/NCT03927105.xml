    <description>Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS-936558 or MDX1106) is a human monoclonal antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the programmed death-1 (PD-1) cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes.1 Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed death-ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-antigens.</description>
