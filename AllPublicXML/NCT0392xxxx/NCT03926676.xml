      comparing nano hybrid composite blocks grandio blocks (VOCO) with ceramic blocks (Emax) in
      indirect restorations using modified USPH criteria (marginal integrity) to see if there will
      be a significant different between two blocks

      Ceramic restorations are well - thought- out an excellent option to restore posterior teeth
      were esthetics is required and the size of the cavity preparation has surpassed the
      conventional for direct resin composites , Ceramic systems can syndicate esthetics with wear
      resistance , being considered a consistent treatment of choice ,peutzfeld evaluated , the
      failure rate of different restorative materials used in posterior teeth and stated that gold
      inlays didnt present a much lower failure rate than ceramic or composite inlays, consequently
      , the author suggested that other aspects besides longevity , such as esthetics , charge and
      number of visits should also be considered when relating treatment options

      Different ceramic systems for constructing inlays and onlays restorations are available in
      the market, some of the ceramic restorations are made using feldspathic ceramic , the Cerec
      computer aided design/computer -aided manufacturing, CAD/CAM system or the hot-pressed
      leucite -reinforced ceramic fabricated by the conventional lost wax technique , other systems
      that employ alumina are available , there are three types of materials available for the
      dentist (glass ceramics /ceramics)resin hybrid ceramics and composite blocks Advantages of
      ceramic restortations are improved because of their increased translucency and light
      transmission ,Another advantage embraces minimal tooth reduction compared with metal ceramics
      , minimal thermal conductivity , they have desirable properties including their physical and
      mechanical properties , outstanding biocompatbility to periodontal tissues and less
      susceptibility to metal allergies though ceramic blocks will cause wear of opposing natural
      teeth ,expensive , that's why we have to shift to another material resin composite Resin
      composite materials have been quickly developed in the last few years , direct resin
      composite restorations become the gold standard for restoring intra coronal cavities , while
      for the extra coronal cavities , the indirect resin composite onlays be inclined to replace
      metallic restorations in most situations being more esthetics and conservative with lower
      cost.

      One of the break throughs in resin composite technology is the evolution of the new resin
      composite blocks (Grandio blocks ) merits of grandio blocks the highest fillers content ( 86%
      by weight)resembles natural teeth perfectly , excellent physical values for flexural strength
      and abrasion , no firing required (a real one step), can be processed using any conventional
      milling unit , can be polished and repaired optimally , Ideal for grinding even incases with
      thin edges and its based on the nano hybrid technology .
