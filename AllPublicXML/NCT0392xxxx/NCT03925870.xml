  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of KN046 in subjects with advanced unresectable or metastatic esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).

      The study is composed of 3 stages. Stage 1 (Safety run-in period) will enroll approximately 6
      subjects with KN046 3 mg/kg Q2W IV, for at least 4 cycles; thereafter, Scientific Monitoring
      Committee (SMC) will held to review the safety profiling data and decide whether proceed to
      stage 2 (Expansion period). Stage 2 will enroll up to 30 subjects. After completion of the
      enrollment from Stage 2 and all subjects have completed at least two post baseline tumor
      evaluation, an interim analysis will be performed for efficacy evaluation. SMC will
      continuously review the safety and clinical efficacy during the study and at the interim
      analysis and be responsible for the decision of proceeding to Stage 3 (Biomarker enrich
      period).

             subjects with adrenal insufficiency, who may continue corticosteroids at physiologic
             replacement doses, equivalent to &lt; 10 mg prednisone daily, inhaled steroids and
             topical use of steroids);

          -  Vaccination within 28 days of the first administration of trial treatment, except for
             administration of inactivated vaccines (e.g., inactivated influenza vaccines);
