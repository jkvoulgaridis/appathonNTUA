    <measure>Percent Improvement From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.
Percent improvement from baseline was calculated as (value at baseline - value at post-baseline visit) × 100 / (value at baseline).</description>

    <description>A PASI 75 response is a 75% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score. The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.</description>

    <description>A PASI 50 response is a 50% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score. The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.</description>

    <description>A PASI 90 response is a 90% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score. The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 4、8、12、16、24、32、48、50</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe) used to measure the severity of disease (induration, scaling, and erythema). A sPGA response is defined as a sPGA value of clear (score 0) or almost clear (score 1).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Body Surface Area (BSA) Involved With Psoriasis at Week 4、8、12、16、24、32、48、50</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4、8、12、16、24、32、48、50</time_frame>
    <description>A measurement of psoriasis involvement, given as the physician's assessment of the percentage of the participant's total body surface area (BSA) involved with psoriasis. The percent of BSA affected was estimated by assuming that the subject's palm, excluding the fingers and thumb, represented roughly 1% of the body's surface.
Change from baseline is calculated as (value at post-baseline visit - value at baseline).
A decrease from baseline (negative value) indicates improvement.</description>
