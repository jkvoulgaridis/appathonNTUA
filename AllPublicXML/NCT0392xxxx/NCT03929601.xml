    <intervention_model_description>The arm for this study is experimental. It consists of a rituximab dose followed by an abatacept dose. Rituximab will be given by IV infusion over a 3-8 hour period, at a dose of 375mg/m2 on four visits each one week apart, starting at Week 1 of the study. Abatacept will be given by a subcutaneous formulation weekly for 2 years, beginning at Week 16 (Month 4) of the study. Dosing will be determined by weight: Up to 25 kg: 50 mg (0.4 mL); 25 to &lt;50 kg receive 87.5 mg (0.7 mL), and &gt; 50 kg receive 125 mg (1.0 mL).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Presence of previous autoimmune disease within the participant's family will be assessed throughout the course of the study by using participant and/or parent/guardian responses to the Past Medical History Questionnaire. The Past Medical History Questionnaire will utilize a set of fourteen dichotomous questions to determine the presence of previous autoimmune disease within the participant's family. The choices will range from &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If they choose &quot;yes&quot; to one of the answers, the participants will also enter a qualitative free-response to specify which relative has been previously diagnosed (i.e. Parent, Child, Sibling, Half-Sibling, Grandparent, Grandchild, Aunt/Uncle, Cousin, Niece/Nephew). This questionnaire is utilized to obtain medical history; thus, questionnaire outcomes will not be defined as better or worse for the purposes of the assessment. Subscales will not be combined to compute a total score.</description>
