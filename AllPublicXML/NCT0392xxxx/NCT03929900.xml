  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of KNOW-CKD (KoreaN cohort study for Outcome in patients With Chronic Kidney
      Disease) study are 1) to establish a CKD cohort representing Korean CKD population for up to
      10-year follow-up, and 2) to investigate the renal progression, mortality, complications,
      risk factors, role of biochemical parameters and the genetic influence. KNOW-CKD Phase I has
      enrolled 2,238 patients and these patients were divided into four major subgroups depending
      on the specific causes of CKD : glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive
      nephropathy, and polycystic kidney disease. In progress, renal progression, complications,
      and cardiovascular disease of these patients are followed up now.

      Since there was a lack of information related to patients' lifestyle, it is necessary to
      conduct various studies that can be applied to actual clinical status through evaluation of
      nutrition, cognitive functions, and lifestyles of patients with CKD in South Korea. In
      addition, researches for high risk patients including diabetic nephropathy, advanced CKD and
      elderly patients are needed. Thus, KNOW-CKD phase II will enroll the CKD subjects at a more
      advanced-stage, and older patients than KNOW-CKD phase I subjects.

      KNOW-CKD phase II Investigator Group comprises nephrologists, epidemiologists and
      statisticians from multi-centers in South Korea. KNOW-CKD phase II will enroll 1,500
      individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate between 20 and 60mL/min/1.73m2
      (CKD-EPI[Cr] equation) between 2019 and 2021 and follow them until 2016 (for 5~7 years).
      Unlike phase I, patients diagnosed with glomerulonephritis and ADPKD will be excluded in
      Phase II.

      At enrollment and at pre-specified intervals, laboratory tests will be conducted on the
      kidney function, biochemical profiles, and anemia. Nutritional evaluation through skin fold,
      hand grip test, bioelectrical impedence analysis, and 7-point subjective global assessment
      (SGA), food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) will be conducted in a subgroup of patients.
      Information on the medical history, health questionnaires, QOL, K-MoCA will also be
      collected. Web-based case-report forms (CRF) will be used for the systematic management of
      the patient data.
