      The main objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of delivering an mHealth
      tobacco intervention among state quitline enrollees. This will be measured through the
      assessment of interest and willingness to use the video text program, and the ability to
      receive video text messages (i.e., has technology capable of receiving and viewing video
      texts. At the end of the intervention, the team will assess satisfaction and perceived
      helpfulness of the video-text messaging program as an indication of acceptability.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility as measured by interest in using Path2Quit video text program</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6-weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The program will be evaluated as feasible if 50% of those screened are eligible and interested in the video text program AND if 90% of those who are eligible and interested in the video text program will be able to engage in the program (some may need technical assistance).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of intervention in terms of its Satisfaction and perceived helpfulness: 6-Week Follow-Up Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks from end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of intervention measured through a 6-Week Follow-Up Questionnaire assessing satisfaction with Path2Quit and perceived usefulness
Program will be evaluated as 'acceptable' if 80% of those who engage in the video text program and who answer the follow-up survey will rate their satisfaction with program and usefulness of the program at 3 or higher (on 0-7 scale where 3 indicates somewhat satisfied and somewhat useful) AND 80% rate the likelihood that they would recommend to a friend at a 3 or higher (on 0-7 point scale where 3 indicates &quot;yes, I think so&quot;).</description>

    <intervention_name>Path2Quit - culturally specific text message intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>SMS text delivers over 6 weeks with links to 20-120 second video clips from PTF. The message library contains 155 videos and assessment questions. First message is tailored to wake-up times, and the topic of the video (e.g., Never Quit Quitting) accompanies the text. Messages are pushed to participants 1-2 times/day, with 24/7 access to messages pulled from 3 keywords (HELP1, JONES, SLIP). Participants also receive inquiry texts, designed to push videos of interest/relevance to the individual. The cultural adaptations are infused throughout the video segments. Topics include deep structure: race and smoking in general, African American smoking statistics; norms for smoking; concerns about nicotine replacement/medication; family/collectivism; unique stressors; racism/discrimination, depression; co-morbid addiction; neighborhood/environmental influences; menthol cigarettes; race-specific weight issues and concerns; and working as a community against the tobacco industry.</description>
