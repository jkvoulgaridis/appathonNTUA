  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pituitary tumours often live with life-long consequences of their disease.
      Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy and medical therapy. Symptoms associated with
      the tumour and/or its treatment affects several areas of life. The year after pituitary
      surgery constitutes an important time-period with medical evaluations of surgery and
      decisions on hormonal substitution. The development and evaluation of extended patient
      support during this time-point is limited. Care based on person-centredness has exclusively
      been promoted which comprises a care where care providers inquire how patients view their
      health situation and what their needs, resources, and preferences are. Person-centredness
      focuses on preserving patient autonomy, function, and well-being and strives to emphasize
      patient involvement through equalizing power between health care professionals and the
      patient with the main goal of an enhanced health situation. The aim of the study is to
      evaluate if a support within a person-centered care practice one year after surgery increases
      wellbeing for patients with pituitary tumours.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self- perceived psychological wellbeing</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of inclusion until the date of one year follow up after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome is assessed with The Psychological General Well-being scale (PGWB), a questionnaire with 22 items, comprising six subscales: anxiety, depression, positive well-being, self-control, general health and vitality. The Swedish version of the questionnaire is valid. Total score of 132 is an overall score of the values from each item (score 1-6 for each item). Higher value is indicative for better psychological well-being. A sum score for each subscale can be calculated, minimum and maximum score; anxiety (5-30), depression (3-18), positive well-being (4-24), self-control (3-18), general health (3-18) and vitality (4-24).</description>

    <measure>Self-reported health assessed with EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of inclusion until the date of one year follow up after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported health is measured with the EuroQual-5Dimensions-5Levels questionnaire (EQ- 5D- 5L). The questionnaire comprises 1 item per dimension. The dimensions of importance for health which are included are; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Patients rate each item on a scale ranging from 1 (no problems) to 5 (extreme problems/unable to). A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. The questionnaire also includes EQ-VAS, in which the patients grade their current health status on an analogue scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health).</description>

    <measure>Fatigue assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of inclusion until the date of one year follow up after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Within MFI-20 general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation, and mental fatigue comprises five dimensions of fatigue. Fatigue in the preceding seven days is rated on a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;yes, that is accurate to &quot;no, that is not accurate&quot;. Subscale scores range from 4-20, where a high score represents greater fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Quality of care assessed with the Quality from the Patient Perspective questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of inclusion until the date of one year follow up after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome is assessed with the questionnaire Quality from the Patient Perspective. The questionnaire comprises four dimension Identity-oriented approach (13 items) and the sociocultural atmosphere (5 items), medical- technical competence (4 items) and physical-technical condition (3 items). Two kinds of assessments are being made at each item: whether things were being done (perceived reality) and whether the right things were being done (subjective significance). Items are rated on a four-point response scale ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 4 (completely agree). Each item also has a response option of &quot;not applicable&quot;. Subscales can be reported item by item or combined in a subscale score (average of all responses within the subscale).</description>

    <description>General self-efficacy measures confidence in one's ability to handle difficult challenges in life. It includes 10 items, which are rated on a four- point Likert scale giving a summary score of 40 for the total scale (10-40).</description>

    <description>The structure and content of the intervention is constructed on principles for person-centredness. Each patients in the intervention are allocated a hospital-initiated nurse care manager during one year after surgery. Self-management support is primarily conducted between the patient and the nurse care manager. The primary goal of the support is to facilitate patients own resources in managing illness and health education on e.g. physical activity and diet. The support also comprises patient-held documentation and health plan. Other components of the intervention comprise accessibility and continuity which is secured by a structured clinical care pathway with planned care and defined care contacts. The patient has continuous access to the nurse care manager by telephone and face-to-face contact according to a structured follow-up plan. An interdisciplinary team as well as a patient education program constitutes distinct parts of the support during the year after surgery.</description>
