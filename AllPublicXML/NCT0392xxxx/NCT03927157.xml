  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a regional, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel
      group, phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 210 mg Q4W (SC) of
      tezepelumab in adults with severe, uncontrolled asthma on medium to high-dose ICS and at
      least one additional asthma controller medication with or without OCS. Approximately 396
      subjects will be randomized regionally (China/non-China). Subjects will receive tezepelumab,
      or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection at the study site, over a 52-week
      treatment period. The study also includes a post-treatment follow-up period of 12 weeks.

    <measure>Annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AERR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The annualized exacerbation rate is based on exacerbations reported by the investigator in the eCRF over 52 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pre-dose/pre-bronchodilator (pre-BD) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in FEV1 as compared to placebo at Week 52. FEV1 is defined as the volume of air exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced expiration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 years and older (AQLQ(S)+12) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 as compared to placebo at Week 52. The AQLQ(S)+12 is a questionnaire that measures the health-related quality of life experienced by asthma subjects. The total score is defined as the average of all 32 questions in the AQLQ(S)+12 questionnaire. AQLQ(S)+12 is a 7-point scale questionnaire, ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in ACQ-6 as compared to placebo at Week 52. The ACQ-6 captures asthma symptoms and short-acting β2-agonist use via subject-report. Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in weekly mean daily Asthma Symptom Diary score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in Asthma Symptom Diary score as compared to placebo at Week 52. The Asthma Symptom Diary comprises of 10 items (5 items in the morning; 5 items in the evening). Asthma symptoms during night time and daytime are recorded by the patient each morning and evening in the daily diary. A daily ASD score is the mean of the 10 items. Responses for all 10 items are required to calculate the daily ASD score; otherwise, it is treated as missing. For the 7-day average asthma symptom score, scoring is done with no imputation using the mean of at least 4 of the 7 daily ASD scores as a mean weekly item score. The 7-day average ASD score ranges from 0 to 4.</description>

Each timepoint is calculated as weekly means based on daily diary data.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions 5 Levels Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L at Week 52. EQ-5D-5L has two sections. The first section assesses five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Patients rate each of these items from &quot;no problem,&quot; &quot;slight problem&quot; &quot;moderate problem&quot;, &quot;severe problem&quot; and &quot;unable&quot;. A composite health index is defined by combining the levels for each dimension. The second section measures self-rated (global) health status using a vertically oriented visual analogue scale where 100 represents the &quot;best possible health state&quot; and 0 represents the &quot;worst possible health state&quot;. EQ-5D-5L assesses health status in terms of a single index value or health utility score. It allows &quot;weighting&quot; by the patient of particular health states and the generation of patient utilities. Published weights are available for the creation of a single summary health utility score. Overall scores range from 0 to 1, with lower scores representing a higher level of dysfunction.</description>
