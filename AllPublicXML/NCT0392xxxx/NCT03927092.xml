      Multiple Sclerosis Knowledge Questionnaire (MSKQ) is a 25-item self administered
      questionnaire assessing a patient's level of knowledge regarding multiple sclerosis (MS).
      Turkish translation of the questionnaire was prepared and participants in the annual patient
      education seminar in the investigators' university hospital were asked to answer these
      questions before and after the seminar.Their results were analysed to assess their level of
      knowledge about their disease.

      Multiple sclerosis knowledge questionnaire was developed in Italy (1) and was reported to be
      useful in measuring patients' level of knowledge about their disease. The English version of
      the questionnaire was translated into Turkish by three physicians than back translated into
      English by two separate linguists. Initially 5 MS patients were asked to answer this first
      version of the questionnaire and report any difficulties in understanding the items. Their
      feedback was used to give the questionnaire its final shape. For the validation stage,
      patients that were diagnosed as having MS and who attended the annual MS patient education
      seminar were enrolled into the study. They answered the questions twice, before and after the
      seminar. Their answers were analysed to measure their level of knowledge about their disease.
