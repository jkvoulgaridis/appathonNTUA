  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare two different pain management interventions in patients
      undergoing reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. The two interventions are 1) pre-operative
      interscalene nerve block and 2) intraoperative injection of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel,
      Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany NJ). Specifically, the primary aims of this study are to
      compare these two interventions on the following: post-operative opioid consumption, pain
      scores, and patient satisfaction. Additionally, the investigators want to determine if
      psychological factors, catastrophizing and resilience, are associated with post-operative
      pain control and satisfaction. The investigators' hypothesis is that the two interventions
      will have similar pain control efficacy and that the liposomal bupivacaine group will
      experience faster post-operative recovery, earlier discharge, and improved satisfaction. The
      investigators also expect patient catastrophizing and resilience to significantly predict the
      degree of post-operative pain and level of patient satisfaction.

    <time_frame>Catastrophizing will be measured pre-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of patient catastrophizing (measured using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale) on post-operative pain control and satisfaction. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale measures how individuals psychologically respond to pain and hardship, and it ranges from a minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 52. Higher scores on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale indicate more catastrophic thinking. The patients' catastrophizing scores will be correlated with their post-operative pain scores and their satisfaction scores. A correlation closer to -1 or 1 (correlations range from -1 to 1) indicates a stronger relationship between catastrophizing with pain control and satisfaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Resilience will be measured pre-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of patient resilience (measured using the Brief Resilience Scale) on post-operative pain control and satisfaction. The Brief Resilience Scale measures how individuals psychologically respond to pain and hardship, and it ranges from a minimum score of 1 to a maximum score of 5. Higher scores on the Brief Resilience Scale indicate greater resilience. The patients' resilience scores will be correlated with their post-operative pain scores and their satisfaction scores. A correlation closer to -1 or 1 (correlations range from -1 to 1) indicates a stronger relationship between resilience with pain control and satisfaction.</description>
