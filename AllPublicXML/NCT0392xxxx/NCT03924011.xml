  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiodermatitis (RD), an inflammatory skin reaction, occurs in more than 90 percent of cancer
      patients treated with radiotherapy (RT). This is the result of the radiation causing damage
      to the epidermal basal skin stem cells. Based on the severity of the skin symptoms, acute RD
      can be categorized into four grades ranging from red and dry skin to moist desquamation,
      necrosis, and eventually ulceration. Acute RD can be distressing, negatively influencing the
      patients' quality of life (QOL). In cases of severe RD, RT might be interrupted, affecting
      the treatment outcome.

      Currently, there is no generally accepted treatment available for RD. As such, the standard
      skincare treatment is hospital dependent. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) can offer a
      solution, since the therapeutic use of (infra)red light induces photochemical reactions in
      the target cells, stimulating repair and healing processes, and reducing pain and
      inflammation.

      Previous studies using PBMT to prevent RD showed promising results. However, these beneficial
      results need to be validated in a larger breast cancer patient population receiving an
      alternative RT regimen. The study hypothesizes that PBMT is a safe and effective strategy to
      prevent worsening of acute RD grade two or higher in breast cancer patients undergoing RT.
      The primary objective is to measure the degree of acute RD to detect changes during and after
      RT. Second, the patients' QOL and pain will be assessed. Finally, the third objective is to
      evaluate the safety of PBMT.

      The results of this project will support the implementation of PBMT into the standard RD
      skincare program.
