  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motivated by the success of dopaminergic drugs in treating rigidity associated with
      Parkinson's disease, some neurologists have used carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) to attempt to
      improve spasticity in ALS and PLS patients. However, data on the efficacy of
      carbidopa/levodopa is limited. Given the limited data and potential to improve the quality of
      life of these patients, the effectiveness of carbidopa-levodopa in ALS and PLS patients with
      severe spasticity should be studied. The investigators hypothesis is that administration of
      carbidopa-levodopa will improve spasticity in ALS and PLS patients.
