      The purpose of the study is to investigate the use of the investigational agent Axumin
      (fluciclovine-F18) with PET/CT imaging in combination with standard MR imaging to detect
      remaining or recurrent glioma.

      Methods:

      Patients with recurrent high grade glioma diagnosed on MRI and consenting to study protocol
      will undergo 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT imaging. Surgery for recurrent brain tumor will follow
      standard of care treatment including as complete as possible tumor resection followed by
      histopathological analysis. Outcome evaluation will be analysis of tumor histology and
      imaging results, comparison of MRI, MRSI, and 18F-Fluciclovine imaging and relationship of
      imaging findings with histopathology and anatomical location of recurrent tumor.

      Study Objectives

        1. In this study, we will investigate the potential of 18F-fluciclovine to aid the
           visualization of residual or recurrent gliomas as depicted by 18F-Fluciclovine PET
           imaging compared to standard MRI sequences [T1 weighted imaging (T1WI) with contrast,
           diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion weighted imaging (PWI), T2 weighted fluid
           attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR)] using 3D image fusion.

        2. To assess the residual or recurrent of glioma as depicted by 3D short echo time MR
           spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) using metabolic tumor markers such as elevated choline,
           myo-Inositol and lipids and reduced N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) compared to standard MRI
           sequences (T1WI with contrast, PWI, T2 FLAIR) using 3D image fusion before neurosurgical
           intervention.

        3. To spatially register the residual or recurrent glioma as depicted by 18F-Fluciclovine
           PET imaging with MR T1WI, DWI, PWI, and 3D MRSI to a) quantitate (SUVmax, SUVmean,
           ADCmean, rCBV, Cho, NAA, lipids, Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA) and correlate areas of PET+, T1WI+ and
           MRSI+ areas and b) characterize different metabolic profiles measured with MRSI in areas
           of glioma infiltration depicted by PET imaging and MRI.

        4. Biopsy and pathology confirmation of tumor vs treatment-induced necrosis in spatially
           registered areas of interest will be performed.

      Safety analysis Although 18F-Axuminâ„¢ is an FDA approved PET imaging agent for biological
      recurrent prostate cancer with extensive safety and toxicity data already documented, all
      patients will be monitored closely for adverse reactions after administration.

    <intervention_model_description>Subject who agree to participate in this study prior to surgery and sign the consent document, will have the following procedures done:
Axumin (fluciclovine-F18) PET/CT scan will be done to evaluate possible recurrence to help differentiate scar (fake recurrence) from true tumor recurrence, which could be at any time point after initial surgery.
Standard of care imaging surveillance will be done after initial tumor surgery
Standard of care surgery will include the removal of the tumor.
Tumor sample will then be analyzed and compared to the imaging (comparison of MRI, MRSI, and Axumin (fluciclovine-F18) imaging) results to determine an accurate diagnosis and location of tumor in the body.</intervention_model_description>

Different metabolic profiles measured in areas of imaging changes and depicted by PET imaging will be characterized. Biopsy locations from stereotactic MRI data will be co-localized with PET/CT and MRSI to correlate biopsy histopathology with MRI+, MRSI+ and PET+ lesion data.</description>
