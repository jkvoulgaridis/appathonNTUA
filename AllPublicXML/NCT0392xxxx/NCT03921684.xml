  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, prospective, open label, one-center study for evaluation of the addition
      of nivolumab to the chemotherapy phase of the neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced
      rectal cancer patients. Subjects must have received no prior treatment for rectal cancer
      (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery) and no prior treatment with checkpoint inhibitors.

      Eligible subjects will receive chemoradiation for a period of 5 weeks, 6 cycles of
      chemo-immunotherapy (mFOLFOX6 + nivolumab) for a period of 12 weeks, once every 2 weeks, and
      will undergo surgery after 4 weeks.
