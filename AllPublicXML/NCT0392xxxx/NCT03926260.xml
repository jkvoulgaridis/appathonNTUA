  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with locally advanced or metastatic tumors, first-line therapeutic management is
      based on the use of targeted therapies (EGFR, BRAF ALK and ROS1 inhibitors), immunotherapies
      (anti-PD1/ anti-PDL1-antibodies or chemotherapy.

      Despite patient selection based on histo-pathological and molecular criteria, not all
      patients respond to treatment. There are currently no markers to definitively guarantee a
      patient's response.

      An alternative is to identify early patient response to treatment. The investigator
      hypothesize that change in circulating tumor DNA concentration (ctDNA) allow to early
      identify patients' therapeutic response (and non-response) of patients, regardless of the
      type of treatment used in the first line setting.

      The primary objective is to determine whether early evolution (between baseline and week 3)
      of circulating tumor DNA concentration predicts the radiological response to first-line
      treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients, regardless of treatment
