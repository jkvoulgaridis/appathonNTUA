    <textblock>
      For patients with triple negative breast cancer, implementation of genetic testing in
      decision making might impact both risk management for the patient and her family, but also,
      importantly, therapeutic management.

      Identifying genetically predisposed subjects dictates risk-reducing strategies that may imply
      bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and mastectomy or long term medical approaches. In the
      advanced setting, genetic testing can influence decision for medical therapy (e.g. use of
      platinum derivatives, poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARP inhibitors) in breast
      cancer patients with breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation.

      The selection of patients for testing has long relied on the presence of a strong family
      history of breast and ovarian cancer. It is now clear that this criterion will result in
      substantial numbers of those with a BRCA mutation being missed.

      Systematic large-scale genetic testing, simultaneously on germline and somatic tissues, is
      likely to improve decisional algorithms in patients with ovarian cancer. Feasibility of such
      approach in the clinical setting, in terms of a turnaround time compatible with clinical
      needs and sensitivity comparable if not superior to single-gene testing needs to be
      demonstrated before such diagnostic platforms can be routinely implemented in the diagnostic
      workflow. This is the scope of the present study.

      Systematic large-scale genetic testing, simultaneously on germline and somatic tissues, is
      likely to improve decisional algorithms in patients with triple negative breast cancers.

      Feasibility of such approach in the clinical setting, in terms of a turnaround time
      compatible with clinical needs and sensitivity comparable if not superior to single-gene
      testing needs to be demonstrated before such diagnostc platforms can be routinely implemented
      in the diagnostic workflow.

      Two platforms will be used during the course of the study. The Illumina TruSight Cancer Risk
      panel is a commercially validated targeted enrichment panel which targets 94 genes and 284
      SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) associated with a predisposition towards cancer.

      The GermSom panel was developed at European Institute of Oncology (IEO) in collaboration with
      institutions within the Alleanza Contro il Cancro consortium and manufactured by Agilent
      Technologies. It includes 349 genes with an established function in the biology and/or
      pharmacological actionability of multiple solid tumors, including breast cancer. It includes
      all the genomic regions analysed in the Illumina Trusight panel, plus 32 additional regions
      associated with risk of multiple tumors.

      Patients will receive detailed genetic characterization of their germline and their tumor.
      This will provide the best possible characterization of their risk of developing of a
      secondary malignancy and can be exploited to identify families at risk for hereditary cancer
      risk. Patients will also benefit from an increased likelihood of being treated with
      appropriate drugs and of receiving appropriate surgery.
