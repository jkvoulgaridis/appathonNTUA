  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a common spinal deformity in adolescents. Orthopedic brace treatment is the only
      conservative (nonsurgical) treatment effective in limiting the progression of this deformity.
      It is a difficult treatment for young people (discomfort, self-image, limitation in
      activities) who must wear this rigid orthosis between 20-23 hrs / day during the growth
      spurt. Recent studies have shown that the effectiveness of this treatment is related to the
      wearing time of the corset. However, there is a serious problem of compliance to treatment.
      On average, the brace is worn only 12 hrs / day. A negative perception of the patient with
      respect to the brace can lead to treatment failure if the brace is not worn. It is therefore
      essential to understand the impact of the brace on the quality of psychological life, the
      daily activities and the comfort of young patients. Unfortunately, there is no valid
      instrument to evaluate all these dimensions. The objective of this project is to develop a
      questionnaire that can measure the quality of life of patients wearing a brace and validate
      it for its clinical use.

      The investigators have created a questionnaire based on the best knowledge published on the
      subject, opinions of experts in the field and a group of patient partners.

      At the end of this project, a questionnaire will be available for the first time to assess in
      depth the perception that patients have of their braces. It can be used to adjust braces in
      the clinic, as well as to support and encourage compliance to the treatment

      Increase treatment adherence by 50%: 1- by identifying the reasons of non-adherence with
      MOBI, the first bilingual quality of life (QL) measurement questionnaire dedicated to braces,
      2- using for the first time a Multidisciplinary Support Team (MST) for the patient / family.

      The BrAIST study showed an inverse correlation between the duration of brace wear and the
      probability of progression, a wearing time of 0 to 6 hrs / day with a proportion at 59%
      progression ≥50 ° vs 7% for a brace wear&gt; 17 hours. Knowing that the average daily brace wear
      duration measured is much lower than that prescribed, there is a problem of compliance whose
      in which the causes are unknown. Unsuitable questionnaires assessed the QoL of AIS patients
      on TLSO and have reflected the impact of the disease on psychological health, perceptions of
      self-image and daily activities, but do not isolate the factors associated with
      non-compliance to TLSO. In addition, there is no biopsychosocial intervention strategy in
      care settings to improve compliance.

      The investigators have expertise in this field since the investigator have carried out
      cross-cultural adaptation and validation of 2 QL instruments in the AIS. In addition, the
      investigator and his team developed a body diagram to evaluate the comfort of patients under
      brace treatment and correlated with pressure measurements at the skin-brace interface. The
      investigator's also used in a previous RCT thermal sensors to measure the wearing time of the
      braces.

      The investigator's team propose to develop and validate MOBI (My Orthopedic Brace Inventory),
      the first bilingual multidimensional QL questionnaire dedicated to the wearing of the brace
      to measure the physical and functional well-being, emotional and social wellness. We will use
      MOBI to identify the elements associated with non-compliance to TLSO and for the first time
      in the world MST, a multi-disciplinary team (nurse, orthotist, psychologist, social worker)
      to intervene on the 4 identified dimensions, with the assumption that this intervention will
      improve by 50% the wearing time of the brace.

There are 6 sub scales : Emotional well-being (7 items, sub score between 0 and 28, best score is 0); Functional well-being (6 items, subscore between 0 and 24, best score is 0); Physical well-being (4 items, subscore between 0 and 16, best score is 0); Social well-being (6 items, subscore between 0 and 24, best score is 0); Barriers related to Patient (4 items, subscore between 0 and 16, best score is 0); Barriers related to System (3 items, subscore between 0 and 12, best score is 0); Barriers related to Treatment (3 items, subscore between 0 and 12, best score is 0). Total score of the MOBI score is obtained by summing the subscores of all subscales (between 0 and 136, best score is 0).</description>
