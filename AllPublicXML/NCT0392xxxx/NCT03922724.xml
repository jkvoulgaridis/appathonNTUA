  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. Blood cell transplant can cure some people with lymphoma.
      Researchers want to see if they can limit the complications transplant can cause.

      Objective:

      To test if a stem cell transplant can cure or control lymphoma. Also to test if new ways of
      getting a recipient ready for a transplant may result in fewer problems and side effects.

      Eligibility:

      Recipients: People ages 12 and older with peripheral T cell lymphoma that does not respond to
      standard treatments

      Donors: Healthy people ages 18 and older whose relative has lymphoma

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Bone marrow biopsy: A needle inserted into the participant s hip bone will remove marrow.

      Donors will also be screened with:

      X-rays

      Recipients will also be screened with:

      Lying in scanners that take pictures of the body

      Tumor sample

      Donors may donate blood. They will take daily shots for 5 7 days. They will have apheresis: A
      machine will take blood from one arm and take out their stem cells. The blood will be
      returned into the other arm.

      Recipients will be hospitalized at least 2 weeks before transplant. They will get a catheter:
      A plastic tube will be inserted into a vein in the neck or upper chest. They will get
      antibody therapy or chemotherapy.

      Recipients will get the transplant through their catheter.

      Recipients will stay in the hospital several weeks after transplant. They will get blood
      transfusions. They will take drugs including chemotherapy for about 2 months.

      Recipients will have visits 6, 12, 18, 24 months after transplant, then once a year for 5
      years.

      Background:

        -  Mature neoplasms of T and/or natural killer cells, collectively called peripheral T-cell
           lymphomas (PTCL), are often poorly responsive to chemotherapy and therefore associated
           with significant morbidity and mortality.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has the potential to cure PTCL but
           the optimal approach to HCT for these diseases requires ongoing investigation

      Objectives:

        -  For subjects on the reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC arm), to estimate the
           progression free survival

        -  For subjects on the immunosuppression-only conditioning (IOC) arm, because they are high
           risk patients, to preliminarily estimate the proportion who are progression free at one
           year.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients age greater than or equal to 12 years

        -  PTCL that is relapsed or refractory to prior therapy and/or PTCL of a risk score where
           upfront allo HCT in first remission is reasonable (PIT score of intermediate-low risk or
           higher or supported by clinical practice guidelines1)

        -  At least one potentially suitable 7-8/8 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (at HLA
           A, B, C, and DR), or an HLA-haploidentical related donor

        -  Adequate end-organ function

        -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding

      Design:

        -  There will be two arms that vary in conditioning intensity an immunosuppression-only
           conditioning (IOC) arm for high-risk subjects and a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)
           arm for those deemed not high-risk and able to tolerate RIC.

        -  IOC arm: equine anti-thymocyte globulin (e-ATG) 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13,
           pentostatin 4 mg/m2/day IV on days -9 and -5, low-dose cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) orally
           daily on days -9 through -2

        -  RIC arm: e-ATG 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13, pentostatin 4 mg/m2/day IV on days
           -11 and -7, low-dose cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) orally daily on days -11 through - 4;
           busulfan IV, pharmacokinetically dosed, on days -3 and -2.

           --Subjects will be assigned to the IOC arm if there is significant end-organ dysfunction
           present and it is felt that a conditioning regimen that includes busulfan would likely
           be associated with intolerable or life-threatening toxicities for the patient. Patients
           will also be assigned to the IOC arm if they possess a DNA repair defect, telomere
           maintenance defect, or familial cancer predisposition syndrome that necessitates
           limiting chemotherapy as much as possible to prevent future cancer risk.

        -  Peripheral blood stem cells are the preferred graft source, although bone marrow is
           permitted

        -  GVHD prophylaxis: Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) on days +3 and +4 (25
           mg/kg /day on the IOC arm, with the option of 25 mg/kg/day on the RIC arm), sirolimus on
           days +5 through +60, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on days +5 through +25. Patients
           with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) or somatic mutations in the Akt/mTOR pathway
           may receive tacrolimus days +5 through +60 instead of sirolimus.

                       perform pulmonary function tests, there should be no evidence of dyspnea at
                       rest, no requirement for supplemental oxygen, and oxygen saturation &gt;92% on
                       room air. Calculations will be based on the USA-ITS-NIH reference.

                    -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL (unless due to Gilbert s syndrome

                       receiving RIC or IOC. Patients who are above these bilirubin, ALT, or AST
                       thresholds may be eligible for the RIC or IOC arm if evaluated by a
                       hepatologist who deems the liver function test abnormalities to be
                       potentially disease related, either because of direct involvement by PTCL,
                       due to an associated process such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or
                       as sequelae of prior chemotherapy that is thought to improve with time.

                    -  Estimated creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 50 mL/min/1.73
                       m2, calculated using eGFR in the clinical lab for adults and the Schwartz
                       formula for pediatrics.

               5. Adequate central venous access potential

               6. Karnofsky (adults) or Lansky (children) performance status of greater than or
                  equal to 50% or ECOG performance status of 2 or less for the RIC arm and
                  Karnofsky (adults) or Lansky (children) greater than or equal to 30% or ECOG
                  performance status of 3 or less for the IOC arm

               7. Ability of subject or parent/guardian to understand and the willingness to sign a
                  written informed consent document

               8. Not pregnant or breastfeeding.

               9. As therapeutic agents used in this trial may be harmful to a fetus, women of
                  childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
                  or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for at
                  least one year post-allo HCT. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
                  pregnant while she or her partner is participating in the study, she should
                  inform her treating physician immediately.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA-RECIPIENT:

          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents, with the exception of
             virus specific cytotoxic T-cells for the treatment of viral infection/reactivation

          2. Prohibitive allergy to a study drug or to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition of the agents (e-ATG, steroids, cyclophosphamide, busulfan, pentostatin,
             sirolimus, MMF, G-CSF) used in the study

          3. Lack of central venous access potential

          4. Active psychiatric disorder which is deemed by the PI to have significant risk of
             compromising compliance with the transplant protocol or which does not allow for
             appropriate informed consent

        INCLUSION CRITERIA-RELATED DONOR:

        1 Related donor deemed suitable and eligible, and willing to donate, per clinical
        evaluations who are additionally willing to donate blood and/or marrow/peripheral blood
        stem cells for research. Related donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing
        Standard Policies and Procedures for determination of eligibility and suitability for
        clinical donation.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA-RELATED DONOR:

        None

        INCLUSION CRITERIA (UNRELATED DONOR):

        1 Unrelated donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing NMDP Standard Policies and
        Procedures, available at: http://bethematch.org/About-Us/Global-transplantnetwork/
        Standards/, except for the additional requirement of EBV serostatus testing for clinical
        purposes of donor selection. Note that participation in this study is offered to all
        unrelated donors but not required for clinical donation, so it is possible that not all
        unrelated donors will enroll on this study. Unrelated donors only enroll if they contribute
        research specimens, which is optional

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (UNRELATED DONOR):

        1 Unrelated donors: failure to qualify as a National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) donor per
        current NMDP Standards, available at: http://bethematch.org/About-Us/Globaltransplant-
        network/Standards/. Exceptions to donor eligibility (e.g. foreign travel, tattoos) do not
        automatically exclude the donor and will be reviewed by the PI.
