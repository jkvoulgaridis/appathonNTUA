  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is expected that medical personnel is exposed to more work-related psychic stress compared
      to controls and that this burden manifests itself by an increased activity level of the
      resulting in higher cortisol levels and a decreased HRV. In addition, one is interested in
      the stress-response/coping strategies of the individuals and believe that regular physical
      activity might &quot;buffer&quot; the influence of stress on the HPAA-hormones and HRV.

      Background Medical personnel is increasingly exposed to psychological stress e.g. caused by
      work intensification combined with time pressure, fear of job loss, lacking appreciation
      and/or freedom of decision, causing psychopathological or psychosomatic symptoms involving,
      inter alia, the cardiovascular system. The aims of the present study are the investigation of
      the current amount of work-related psychological stress, its perception and underlying
      reasons, as well as applied recovering strategies (e.g. physical activity) in Austrian health
      care professionals and in controls.

      Material and methods In total, 140 female and male participants (70 participants belong to
      medical staff; 70 participants belong to non-medical staff) between the ages of 25-65 years
      will be recruited. The individual stress perception will be evaluated using questionnaires
      (e.g. Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress, TICS; Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI-18, Short Work
      Evaluation). 24h salivary cortisol (at 5 time points) and heart rate variability (HRV)
      measurement will be performed to objectify the influence of stress on the physical body. The
      physical activity level will be tested by performing a cardiopulmonary exercise test (bicycle
      spiroergometry).

      Expected results From the present study the investigators expects insight into: first, the
      individual perception of work-related psychological stress among health care professionals
      compared to the controls; second, the association of occupational stress, HRV and laboratory
      stress parameters and third, the role of a good physical performance on psychological stress
      perception.
