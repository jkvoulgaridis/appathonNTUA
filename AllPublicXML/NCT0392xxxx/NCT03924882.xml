  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death for patients with gynecologic malignancies. In
      most cases, the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage and approximately 75% of patients
      will eventually experience disease recurrence. However, the overall response rates of
      second-line chemotherapy for recurrent ovarian cancer are only 20-27%. Therefore, it is
      important to seek alternative agent that can improve the outcome. Anlotinib is a new, orally
      administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGFR,FGFR,PDGFR,and c-kit,. The
      preclinical studies suggest anlotinib may be effective in other cancers such as ovarian
      cancer. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of the study
      drug anlotinib.

    <description>Objective response rate defined as confirmed complete response or partial response under RECIST 1.1 criteria. CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria are first met.</description>
