    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled Phase I study is intended to
      study the effects of a live-attenuated vaccine against influenza A H1N1. Part 1 of this study
      will enroll 75 participants at a single site. Participants will be randomized in a 2:2:1
      ratio to receive one dose each of either CodaVax-H1N1, FluZone quadrivalent, or placebo. This
      study is conducted during the influenza &quot;off season&quot; in Australia. Part 2 of the study will
      enroll an 50 additional participants randomized to receive either CodaVax-H1N1 at a higher
      dose or placebo (40:10).

             Sponsor), with no significant medical history and no clinically significant abnormal
             findings at screening. Particular attention will be paid to:

               -  A drug history identifying any known drug allergies and the presence of drug
                  abuse;

             contraception from the Screening Visit and up to the Follow-up visit (Day 30 ± 2
             days). Double contraception is defined as a condom AND one other form of the
             following:

               -  Established hormonal contraception (with approved oral, injected or depot

               -  Depot or injectable birth control

               -  Intrauterine device or intrauterine system in place for at least 2 months prior

                  screening visit. i.e., tubal ligation or hysterectomy for women or vasectomy for
                  men (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in
                  semen) provided the male partner is a sole partner; Males must not donate sperm
                  for at least 70 days post-dose of the last study treatment. Male partners of
                  female participants and female partners of male participants must also use
                  contraception, if they are of childbearing potential.

        regular menstrual periods for at least 12 months), confirmed by FSH level meets the
        requirement of post-menopausal women if in doubt. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar,
        ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not considered highly
        effective methods of birth control. Participant abstinence for the duration of the study
        and 1 month after the last study treatment is acceptable.
