      Introduction: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs) located in the jejunum or ileum
      (JI-GIST) are considered of worse prognosis compared to other locations. It has been
      suggested that this dogma should be revised. The aim of this study is to describe the
      characteristics of jejunoileal GISTs and its prognosis; and to compare them with gastric
      GISTs in the era of imatinib.

      Patients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical histories of all the patients
      diagnosed with GISTs between January 2000 and November 2016. Clinical and pathological data,
      as well recurrence, metastatic, disease-free survival (DFS) as overall (OS) rates of patients
      with JI-GIST or gastric GIST (G-GIST) were collected and compared.

        GIST diagnosis was established by an experienced board-certified pathologist who reviewed
        our database prospectively maintained. After revision, we included in the study any kind of
        primary mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract with a histomorphological and
        immunohistochemical (CD117 (+) and/or DOG1 (+)) profile consistent with GIST. The patients
        were divided into two groups: patients with GISTs located in the jejunum or ileum,
        comprising the JI-GIST group; and patients with gastric GISTs, comprising the G-GIST group.
