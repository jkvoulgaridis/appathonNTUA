    <textblock>
      The investigators design a Multi-center randomized, control study to evaluate the therapeutic
      effect of the scalp acupuncture treatment for motor dysfunction in children with cerebral
      palsy by using the following outcomes: motor function, activity of daily living, quality of
      life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a well-recognized neurodevelopmental condition beginning in early
      childhood and persisting throughout the lifetime. Motor disorders are often accompanied by
      disturbances of sensation, cognition, communication, perception, behavior, and seizures The
      activities of daily living and social participation are limited in children with CP due to
      motor dysfunction, this greatly influences the CP patient's quality of life, and return to
      society.

      Western conventional treatment of CP is multi-professional rehabilitation. In China, CP
      rehabilitation mainly develops the clinical mode of combining traditional Chinese medicine
      and western medicine. Acupuncture use as a complementary or alternative therapy has increased
      worldwide and has become widely applied to CP rehabilitation, which confirms that the
      efficacy of acupuncture can have a great impact on CP management. Many studies have shown
      that scalp acupuncture has a remarkable treatment efficacy on motor dysfunction in children
      with CP in China. But, Although acupuncture as a treatment for cp has become widely accepted
      and showed better clinical curative effect than conventional treatments, a Meta-Analysis
      published in 2018 based on clinical randomized controlled trials summarized that the clinical
      curative effect of acupuncture treatment in children with CP remains uncertain due to the
      small number of randomized controlled trials available and the small sample sizes. More
      high-quality and large-scale studies are still needed. The purpose of this study is to
      observe the therapeutic effect of scalp acupuncture treatment for motor dysfunction in
      children with CP by using the international general evaluation scales.

      In this 12-week, assessor-blind, randomized, controlled study of scalp acupuncture as
      additional treatment with the rehabilitation treatment, a total of 76 children with cerebral
      palsy will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to two different groups: 1)
      the treatment group and 2) the control group. The treatment group (n=38) will receive scalp
      acupuncture combined with rehabilitation treatment for 3 times per week for 12 weeks, and the
      control group (n=38) will receive rehabilitation treatment for 3 times per week for 12 weeks.
      Both groups will be evaluated at baseline, week4 (treatment 12), week 8 (treatment 24),
      week12(treatment 36) and week 24(follow-up) using GMFM scale, FMFM scale, PEDI scale and
      CP-QOL scale. The study will be conducted at Children's Hospital of Fudan University.

    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) is a standardized observational instrument designed to assess the gross motor function of children with CP. It is divided into five sections: Lying and Rolling, Sitting, Crawling and Kneeling, Standing, and Walking, Running and Jumping. Each item is on the basis of four levels: 0=does not initiate, 1=initiates, 2=partially completes, 3=completes or NT=not tested. The total score is a summation of the scores in the five areas by the Gross Motor Ability Estimator software (GMAE Version 1.0.)</description>

    <description>The Fine Motor Function Measure (FMFM) assessment scale is used to evaluate the fine motor activities of children with CP, including the upper limb activities and sensory ability. This scale includes five domains, namely audiovisual tracking ability(5 items), upper limb joint's ability(9 items), grasping ability(10 items), operation ability(13 items)and hand-eye coordination(24 items). Each item is on the basis of four levels: 0=does not initiate, 1=initiates, 2=partially completes, 3=completes. The total score(0～100 points) is a summation of the scores in the five areas.</description>

    <description>Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) measures both functional performance and capability within three domains of (1) self-care, (2) mobility, and (3) social function in two categories, that is, the Functional Skills Scale (FSS), Caregiver Assistance Scale (CAS), and Modifications Scale. FSS covers 40 diverse content areas assessed using 197 items scored unable (0) or capable (1). The self‐care domain comprises 73 items. The mobility domain has 59 items. The social function domain has 65 items. CAS It covers 20 diverse content areas assessed using 20 items scored on the following escalating 6‐point scale: independent, supervision, minimal help, moderate help, maximum help, and total help. The items cover the self‐care domain (n = 8), mobility domain (n = 7), and social function domain (n = 5). Modifications Scale measures any environmental or technical modifications needed to enhance the child's function.</description>

    <description>The cerebral palsy quality of life questionnaire for children contains 66 items in seven domains: Social well-being and acceptance (SWB), Functioning (FUN), Participation and physical health (PART), Emotional well-being (EWB), Access to services (ACCESS), Pain and feeling about disability (PAIN), and Family health (FAMILY). Almost all of the items have the following item stem: 'How do you think your child feels about. . .' and a 9-point rating scale, where 1 = very unhappy, 3 = unhappy, 5 = neither happy nor unhappy, 7 = happy, and 9 = very happy.</description>
