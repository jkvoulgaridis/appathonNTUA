  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A systematic collection of retrospective and prospective data based on non-intervention
      patient observation, aimed to assess the risks, course and outcomes of a disease or a group
      of diseases:

        -  the retrospective part: database of patients with cardiovascular risks;

        -  the prospective part: observation of patients in the real medical practice
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research program will have two parts:

      Stage1: identification of patients with moderate, high and very high cardiovascular risks,
      not having diseases of atherosclerotic genesis and requiring lipid-lowering drugs.

      Stage 2: a prospective observation of patients receiving primary medical prophylaxis of CVD
      with atorvastatin

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the influence of routing and extended statin counseling of patients with cardiovascular risk factors on the change in the percentage of patients who achieved target LDL cholesterol level from baseline through 12 months</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the effect of routing and extended statin counseling on changes in treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The method used to measure adherence included the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS - 4).
Morisky Medication Adherence Scale is 4- item self-reported scale measuring medication taking behavior. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-4, in which higher scores reflect better adherence</description>

    <description>To evaluate the impact of extended statin counseling on change of CVD risk factors (lipid levels) in patients with moderate, high and very high risk. Measurement of lipid levels at baseline and after 3,6,12 months</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in blood pressure (mm Hg)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the impact of standard and extended counseling on change of CVD risk factors (blood pressure). Measurement of blood pressure (mm Hg) at baseline and after 3,6,12 months</description>

    <measure>Impact of standard and extended counseling on statin therapy adherence</measure>

    <description>The method used to measure adherence was KAP test. KAP test is the specially designed questionnaire for this study includes 14 questions, in patients with hyperlipidemia. KAP test summary score is an assessment of patients' knowledge about high cholesterol, their attitude to this problem and the application of this knowledge. Higher scores reflect better indicators of knowledge, attitudes and practices</description>
