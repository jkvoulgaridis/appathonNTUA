      The investigators are testing a new, smartphone videogame-based intervention for smoking
      cessation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a novel smartphone videogame, where smokers are required to
      submit breath carbon monoxide samples to demonstrate smoking abstinence, and where they will
      earn game-based rewards contingent on meeting CO goals. Players will be working with teams to
      earn group and social rewards to help advance their game.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusionary criteria: Participants will be required to be of legal smoking age (&gt;19
             in Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey, Utah, and in Onondaga, Nassau and Suffolk Counties in
             New York, &gt; 18 years of age in the remainder of the United States). Participants must
             also report smoking &gt;10 cigarettes per day, report smoking for &gt;2 years, answer 8 or
             higher on a Likert scale asking how much the person wishes to quit smoking right now
             (1 = not at all, 10 =very much), have a smartphone with a data plan and active
             contract extending for at least two months from the enrollment date (i.e., the
             duration of the study), and reside in the U.S. Participants in the study must submit
             an initial CO reading &gt; 10ppm (to prevent nonsmokers from enrolling in the study),
             Literacy will be assessed by having the participant read the first few lines of the
             consent form out loud, and will be an inclusion criterion because elements of &quot;Breathe
             Free&quot; will require reading.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals will be excluded from the study if they report smoking any combustible
             products &gt;2 times per month, report unstable medical/psychiatric conditions that might
             interfere with the study objectives (e.g., asthma), report living with someone who
             smokes in the house, or has a career that results in excessive exposure to CO. All
             excluded participants will be emailed the following smoking cessation information: the
             &quot;Clearing the Air&quot; packet developed by the National Cancer Institute, Smokefree.gov,
             Quitsmokinghelpline.com, and the National Academies Press &quot;Dying to quit.&quot;
