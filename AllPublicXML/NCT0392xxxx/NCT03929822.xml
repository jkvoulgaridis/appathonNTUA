  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM)
      may be able to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in women whose screening mammograms
      had abnormal findings.

    <description>A standard dose of contrast material for other contrast mammography examinations and for body CT scanning, 1.5 ml/kg of Iohexol350 will be injected intravenously (IV) using a power injection (3-4 ml/s) with a maximum does of 150 ml. The IV injection is performed while the patient is in a sitting position. The mammogram will be performed in a standing position.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women called back from a screening mammography by either FFDM or tomosynthesis with
             soft tissue abnormalities including masses, asymmetries, focal asymmetries or
             architectural distortion with or without calcifications. Patients will be questioned
             regarding the possibility of pregnancy and will need a negative pregnancy test prior
             the study intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt;30 years old

          -  Screening mammography with only calcifications abnormalities

          -  Male patients

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients

          -  Patients with any allergy to iodinated contrast

          -  Patients with eGFR &lt; 45

          -  Patients that may be treated with radioactive iodine
