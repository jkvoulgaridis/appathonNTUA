    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of denosumab and to see how well it works in
      treating patients with bone loss who have received a donor stem cell transplant. Patients
      receiving a donor stem cell transplant may experience accelerated bone loss and an increase
      risk of bone fractures, leading to a decrease in satisfaction and quality of life. A type of
      immunotherapy drug called denosumab binds to a protein called RANKL, which may help keep bone
      from breaking down.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab therapy for the treatment of bone loss in
      patients who have received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 2 doses of denosumab subcutaneously (SC) between days 70-130 and days
      250-310 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed up at 6 months.

    <measure>Changes in bone mineral density (BMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at time of enrollment (day 100 post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]), and year post-HSCT</time_frame>
    <description>Day 100 dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan and one year DXA scan will be compared based on the percent change in BMD in the dual femur and/or lumbar spine in allogeneic HSCT patients who have experienced either at least 5% BMD loss between baseline (pre- HSCT) and day + 100 post-HSCT, or who have osteopenia or osteoporosis at either the pre-bone marrow transplant or day + 100 DXA scan.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Slope in bone mineral density (g/cm^2) regressed on time in dual femur and lumbar spine (average of L1-L4)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of enrollment up to 1 year post-HSCT</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis for both the femur and lumbar spine will consist of a regression model of the percent change from enrollment to 1 year post HSCT regressed on the enrollment BMD levels. The analysis model will be fit using Ordinary Least Square methods. A secondary model will include and expand upon a list of covariates to explore the effects of demographic, disease and treatment characteristics on BMD loss and effectiveness of denosumab using an analysis-of-covariance model. Both models will be tested at alpha = 0.05 (two-sided). Residual plots and other diagnostic methods will be used to evaluate compliance with model assumptions and goodness of fit.</description>

    <measure>Percent change in BMD</measure>
