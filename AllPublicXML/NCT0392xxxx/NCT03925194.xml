      OBJECTIVES

      Primary:

      To evaluate efficacy of treatment with anakinra in subjects with CF who are ≥ 12 years of age
      by means of lung clearance index (LCI).

      Secondary To evaluate safety and tolerability of treatment with anakinra as well as to
      investigate further effects of anakinra on lung function and quality of life (QOL) in
      subjects with CF.

                  typical for CF,

          5. Best FEV1 ≥ 70 % pred. in the last 12 months prior to screening,

             prior to the first administration of the IMP of each treatment period (in case of
             medication changes in Period 1 the wash-out may be extended for up to 12 weeks in
             order to fulfill this criterion),

         11. Adequate bone marrow function assessed on the basis of: neutrophils &gt;1.5 x 109/L,
             platelets &gt;100 x 109/L, hemoglobin &gt;9.0 g/dL,

         12. Adequate liver function assessed on the basis of: GGT, ASAT, and ALAT &lt;3 x ULN,
