  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increase the level of serotonin. This study will use
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine how subjects with, and without, irritable
      bowel syndrome patients respond to serotonergic stimulation. Brain activation during
      emotional and arithmetic tasks and during visceral pain will be measured after serotonergic
      stimulation using the oral administration of Escitalopram (10 mg). The investigators will
      further integrate background parameters of the irritable bowel syndrome subjects and healthy
      controls (such as microbiota composition, genetic markers of serotonergic and inflammatory
      pathways, intestinal permeability, state of mood and visceral sensitivity) with the responses
      to the various challenges on the level of functional brain imaging. These responses may
      reveal a 'footprint' of the individual gut-brain axis function. Analyses of these individual
      footprints in multiple subjects with and without irritable bowel syndrome may reveal
      biosignatures characterising certain groups of patients according to specific gut-brain
      signalling response patterns. These biosignatures may be used to develop an individualised
      treatment algorithm for irritable bowel syndrome therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this double-blinded, randomized, cross-over study, irritable bowel syndrome subjects (n =
      40) and healthy controls (n = 20) will perform an emotional and the arithmetic task and
      receive visceral stimuli (by using a barostat) while placed in a functional magnetic
      resonance imaging scanner respectively during two different states, a) after oral
      administration of 10 mg Escitalopram, a well-known drug classified as Selective Serotonin
      Reuptake Inhibitor, packed in a coloured hydroxypropylmethylcellulose capsule, and b) during
      oral administration of a placebo, in a double-blinded randomized cross-over fashion.
      Background characteristics will be collected.
