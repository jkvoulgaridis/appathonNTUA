    <description>The study pharmacist will review the prescribed inhaler for 1) insurance coverage and 2) clinical appropriateness. The pharmacist will conduct a benefits investigation at time of hospital admission. The benefits investigation involves running test claims for inhalers to determine the most cost-effective inhaler for the patient's insurance plan. The study pharmacist will utilize clinical practice guidelines to assess appropriateness of the prescribed inhaler. Based on this review, the study pharmacist will submit a pharmacy consult to the inpatient pharmacist on the patient's healthcare team who will pend the inhaler orders (changing the patient's prescribed inhaler, if necessary) for the prescriber to send to the Meds to Beds discharge pharmacy. The Meds to Beds pharmacist will counsel the patient on inhaler use techniques prior to discharge.</description>
