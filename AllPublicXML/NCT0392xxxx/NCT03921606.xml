  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a general health promotion (GHP) approach
      using information communication technology (ICT) to deliver a brief motivational interviewing
      (MI) to motivate smokers with chronic diseases to quit smoking. Subjects in the intervention
      group will receive a GHP approach using ICT (e.g., WhatsApp/WeChat) to deliver brief MI.
      Subjects in the control group will receive an individual face-to-face generic health advice
      plus a self-help booklet on smoking cessation at the time of recruitment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking exerts harmful effects on nearly every organ of the body and causes 7 million deaths
      worldwide each year. In Hong Kong, despite a decrease in the prevalence of daily cigarette
      smoking from 23.3% in 1982 to 10.0% in 2017, there are still 615,000 daily smokers. The
      evidence has shown that continued smoking in patients with chronic diseases can reduce the
      efÔ¨Åcacy of medical treatments and increase the risk of treatment-related side effects.
      Nevertheless, many smokers with chronic diseases have a long smoking history, a strong
      nicotine dependency, and have not attempted or have no intention to quit. It is essential to
      develop and evaluate a more innovative and effective intervention to enhance the
      acceptability of smoking cessation for smokers with chronic diseases.

      The proposed intervention will aim to facilitate the movement through five stages of change
      (pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance)15 via the (i)
      foot-in-the-door technique and (ii) a brief MI. The World Health Organization defines medical
      and public health practice supported by mobile devices as mobile health, a new strategy to
      promote health.21 Instant messaging, such as WhatsApp/WeChat delivered by mobile devices, is
      widely used for health promotion and treatment compliance.22 One advantage of using
      WhatsApp/WeChat is that it can offer quick, real-time interactions and continuing
      professional advice and support for subjects to manage their health-related lifestyle
      practices. Most importantly, WhatsApp/WeChat is more flexible, efficient and time-saving
      compared to face-to-face meetings to deliver a brief MI as face-to-face meetings would
      require the subjects to return several times for interventions. A systematic review of the
      use of mobile phone-based interventions for smoking cessation showed that smokers who
      received instant messages via mobile phones were more likely to abstain from smoking compared
      to those who used traditional face-to-face cessation services.23 A recent study conducted by
      our team in Hong Kong also showed that the use of WhatsApp for instant messaging was more
      effective in smoking relapse prevention for recent quitters.24 However, we found no reports
      or proposals based on the above conceptual framework and strategies in which ICTs were used
      with smokers who had no intention to quit.

    <description>The experimental group will receive a brief MI via WhatsApp/WeChat on a smartphone during the study period. The brief MI messages will be delivered more intensively as preferred by the subject (usually not less than once every 2 to 3 days and no more than 2 times per day) for the first 6 months. The frequency of delivering the messages via WhatsApp/WeChat will be interactive, depending on the subjects' actions and responses, and may take several sessions of chats within several days or weeks. However, the total time spent by the interventionist will not be more than that for a traditional MI with several long sessions. After 6 months, minimal messages will be provided to the subjects by merely following their progress of behavioural changes and responding to their questions to maintain contact until the 1-year follow-up. The total time spent will be recorded and analysed.</description>

A self-help booklet on smoking cessation published by the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health with Hotline will be also provided in the SOPCs. The subjects in this group will receive the same schedule of follow-ups as in the intervention group, but they will not receive any follow-up booster intervention.</description>
