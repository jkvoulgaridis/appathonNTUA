  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will examine how virtual reality treatment that provides users with the
      alternate perspective of a virtual interpersonal interaction impacts psychological and
      neurobiological markers of social perspective taking in children with a disruptive behavior
      disorder. The investigators anticipate that experiencing a virtual encounter from a
      counterpart's point-of-view improves a child's perspective taking and alters brain function
      related to imagining another person's pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD), collectively known as
      disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs), involve persistent physical or verbal confrontations,
      antisocial behavior, and emotional outbursts. Despite a range of biological and environmental
      risk factors for DBD, social-cognitive impairments are a common link, and improving these
      deficits should be beneficial for all patients with DBD.

      Children and adolescents with DBD have deficits in social perspective taking that contribute
      significantly to these behavior problems. Perspective taking is the ability to perceive the
      world from another person's point of view, including making inferences about the
      capabilities, feelings, and expectations of others. Perspective taking requires substantial
      motivation and cognitive resources and can be difficult to achieve, particularly for
      children. A failure to understand or value another person's perspective inhibits helping
      behavior without clear direct benefits. Perspective taking skills are related to empathic
      concern, which encompasses feelings of sympathy and concern for unfortunate others, and
      theory of mind, the ability to accurately infer others' mental states, such as intentions.
      Negative attribution biases are more likely in individuals with poor theory of mind. Thus,
      improving children's perspective-taking skills should allow them to better understand a
      counterpart's thinking and intentions, increasing empathic concern, and reducing hostile
      attribution biases-and therefore improving the likelihood that prosocial behavior occurs.

      In the brain, perspective taking engages circuitry underlying empathic concern and theory of
      mind. In fMRI studies, imagining pain to the self or other, often in conjunction with images
      depicting painful scenarios, engages the brain's salience network. Dorsal ACC and bilateral
      anterior insula, the regions most commonly activated in response to other's pain, also show
      strong responses to self-perspective pain. However, in youth with DBD, there is a decreased
      response to other-perspective pain in dACC and anterior insula, despite no change or a
      heightened response to self-perspective pain.

      Software interventions have shown some promise to improve perspective taking. In particular,
      VR has exciting therapeutic potential to address perspective-taking deficits because it
      provides naturalistic yet controlled environments in which users can experience interactions
      from multiple viewpoints. VR interventions typically provide better generalization to
      real-world behavioral changes compared to traditional methods. VR has an advantage over
      traditional interventions because it provides an embodied experience that is a middle ground
      between therapy room settings and the real world (e.g., school, home) where problematic
      behaviors occur.

      In this investigation, the investigators will build upon a current VR design using an Oculus
      Quest virtual reality headset. After experiencing virtual interpersonal conflicts in a school
      cafeteria setting, participants will re-experience scenarios in one of two manners: an
      enriched perspective from the virtual counterpart's point-of-view, with internal dialogue and
      background information; or a control perspective, which replays the original point-of-view.
      During this proof-of-concept phase, the primary target is social perspective taking. The
      investigators will assess functional engagement of this target by quantifying (1) the ability
      to recognize and understand the virtual counterpart's perspective; and (2) the neural
      response (in pain circuitry) to pain experienced by the virtual counterpart, a common marker
      for perspective taking that is abnormal in DBD.

    <intervention_model_description>This project will examine how levels of a virtual reality treatment that provides users with the alternate perspective of an interpersonal interaction impacts psychological and neurobiological markers of perspective taking. Following the initial screening visit, participants will be randomly assigned to different VR perspective conditions, stratified by sex, presence/absence of ADHD diagnosis, and ODD/CD diagnosis, via an a priori randomization chart. An equal number of youth will be randomly assigned to either the alternate perspective condition or control condition. Visits 1 and 2 will be identical for both groups. At Visit 3, the initial VR scenarios and assessments will be identical. The participant will then re-experience the VR scenarios depending on their assigned condition. Additional VR assessments and the MRI scan will be identical for both groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change from Pre-intervention on the Virtual Reality Perspective Taking Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>This scale provides a 0-100 score that indicates the degree to which participants understand the perspective of their virtual counterpart, derived from the Perspective Taking subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. A higher change score indicate greater improvement in perspective taking in the virtual environment. The scale will be completed twice on the same day, before and after the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Change from Pre-intervention on the Acknowledgement of Other Perspective Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>This scale allows participants to rate the relative importance of the virtual counterpart's perspective, on a 0-100 scale, with a scenario-specific question. A higher change score indicates greater improvement in acknowledging the virtual counterpart's perspective. The scale will be completed twice on the same day, before and after the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Change from Pre-intervention in brain activity in response to Self Pain vs. Other Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>The fMRI scans will be administered 0-2 weeks prior to the intervention and the day of the intervention (upon completion of the intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will measure the blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula while imagining pain happening to oneself or the virtual counterpart. Perspective taking and empathy are reflected by a similar BOLD response to self and other pain. A greater decrease in the BOLD response to Self vs. Other pain results from a stronger response to other's pain, reflecting improved perspective taking.</description>
