  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite being studied less than half as frequently, autonomic dysfunction is a greater
      priority than walking again in spinal cord injury. One autonomic condition after spinal cord
      injury is orthostatic hypotension, where blood pressure dramatically declines when patients
      assume the upright posture. Orthostatic hypotension is associated with all-cause mortality
      and cardiovascular incidents as well as fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, and it almost
      certainly contributes to an elevated risk of heart disease and stroke in people with spinal
      cord injury. In addition, autonomic dysfunction leads to bladder, bowel, sexual dysfunctions,
      which are major contributors to reduced quality and quantity of life. Unfortunately, the
      available options for treating this condition, are primarily limited to pharmacological
      options, which are not effective and are associated with various side effects. It has been
      recently demonstrated that spinal cord stimulation can modulate autonomic circuits and
      improve autonomic function in people living with spinal cord injury. Neuroanatomically, the
      thoracolumbar sympathetic pathways are the primary spinal cord segments involved in blood
      pressure control. Recently, a pilot study has been published demonstrating that
      transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation of thoracolumbar afferents can improve cardiovascular
      function. However, some studies have shown that lumbosacral transcutaneous spinal cord
      stimulation can also elicit positive cardiovascular effects. Therefore, there is no consensus
      on the optimal strategy in order to deliver transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation to improve
      the function of the autonomic system, and it may be that lumbosacral (i.e. the stimulation
      site being used most commonly for restoring leg function is sufficient). Another key
      knowledge gap in terms of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation is whether or not the
      current is directly or indirectly activating these spinal circuits. Last but not least, the
      effects of epidural spinal cord stimulation on the function of cardiovascular, bladder, bowel
      and sexual system in spinal cord injury have been investigated in no study yet.

      AIMS AND HYPOTHESES:

      Aim 1. To examine the effects of short-term (one session) transcutaneous spinal cord
      stimulation on the frequency and severity of episodes of orthostatic hypotension/autonomic
      dysfunction, and bladder, bowel, and sexual functions. These effects will be compared at two
      sites of stimulation.

      Hypothesis 1.1: Short-term transcutaneous mid-thoracic cord stimulation will mitigate the
      severity and frequency of orthostatic hypotension/autonomic dysfunction.

      Hypothesis 1.2: Lumbosacral transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation will improve bladder,
      bowel, and sexual functions.

      Aim 2. To examine the effects of long-term (one month) transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation
      on the severity and frequency of orthostatic hypotension/autonomic dysfunction.

      Hypothesis 2.1: Long-term stimulation of the mid-thoracic cord will result in sustained
      improvements in mitigated severity and frequency of orthostatic hypotension/autonomic
      dysfunction that is not dependent on active stimulation.

      Hypothesis 2.2: Long-term lumbosacral transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation will result in
      sustained improvements in bowel, bladder, and sexual function that is not dependent on active
      stimulation.

      Aim 3: To examine the effects of short-term (one session) epidural spinal cord stimulation on
      the severity and frequency of orthostatic hypotension/autonomic dysfunction, and bladder,
      bowel, and sexual functions.

      Hypothesis 3.1: Epidural spinal cord stimulation will mitigate the severity and frequency of
      orthostatic hypotension/autonomic dysfunction and improve bladder, bowel, and sexual
      function.

      Hypothesis 3.3: There is no significant difference between immediate effects of lumbosacral
      transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation and epidural spinal cord stimulation on bladder,
      bowel, and sexual function.

      For aim 1, 14 participants with spinal cord injury and no implanted electrodes on the spinal
      cord will be recruited. Participants will randomly receive one-hour stimulation under each of
      the two stimulation conditions in a crossover manner: Mid-thoracic and Lumbosacral. For aim
      2, 28 individuals with spinal cord injury and no implanted electrode will be
      pseudo-randomized (1:1) to one of two stimulation sites. Participants will receive one-hour
      stimulation, five sessions per week for four weeks. Cardiovascular and neurological outcomes
      will be measured before the first stimulation session and after the last stimulation session.
      For aim 3, 4 participants with spinal cord injury with implanted electrodes on the spinal
      cord will be recruited to study the immediate effects of invasive epidural spinal cord
      stimulation.

      All outcomes will be measured in two positions: a) Supine, b) ~ 70° upright tilt-test.
      Additionally, bowel, bladder, and sexual functions in project 2 will be assessed weekly.

      STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION Project 1 and 2: This multi-site open-label exploratory clinical
      trial (phase IIb) on examination of the effects of non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord
      stimulation will take place at the University of Calgary and, UBC, Canada. In a
      pseudo-randomized controlled 2×2 between-subject factorial design.

      Project 3: This is a multi-site open-label case study exploring the effects of invasive
      epidural spinal cord stimulation on a small number of individuals with spinal cord injury who
      underwent epidural implantation in Canada or abroad.

      Duration of study participation for each participant Eligible participants will be enrolled
      into the study. Four visits (1 screening session and 3 assessment + stimulation sessions) for
      project 1 and 21 visits during a month (1 &quot;screening&quot; session, 5 &quot;assessment+ stimulation&quot;,
      and 15 &quot;stimulation only&quot; sessions) for Project 2 will be conducted. Eligible participants
      who are involved in Project 3 will make two separated visits to our laboratory: one screening
      session and one &quot;assessment + stimulation&quot; session.

      Briefly, the study involves the following:

      Project 1, 2, and 3, Visit 1: Screening Phase After providing informed consent, participants
      will be assigned a unique study number and will be then be assessed for study eligibility.
      Baseline assessments at this phase include a tilt-up test (to confirm orthostatic
      hypotension), administration of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, a take-home bladder
      and bowel diary (to monitor bladder incontinence and frequency of bowel movements), as well
      as a take-home Bristol Stool Scale (to monitor constipation). Prior to leaving the site,
      participants will then be equipped with a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor in order
      to establish a baseline parameter of severity and frequency of spontaneous episodes of
      autonomic dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension.

      Project 1, Visits 2- 4 Participants that meet preliminary eligibility requirements will
      undergo baseline measurements including sympathetic skin responses, cerebral blood flow
      measurement, cardiovascular monitoring and blood tests (to measure catecholamine level in
      serum before, during, immediately after tilt up test).

      Participants will complete questionnaires, which will establish baseline parameters for
      self-reported assessments of severity and frequency of autonomic dysfunction, bladder
      incontinence, and neurogenic bowel Score.

      In this randomized crossover study, participants will randomly receive one session of
      mid-thoracic non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, lumbosacral non-invasive
      transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation or field block anesthesia. Cardiovascular and
      neurological outcomes will be measured immediately after stimulation. The stimulation
      sessions will be separated by at least 72 hours to avoid any interference carry-over effects
      at each stimulation site. non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation is approved
      under protocols: UBC-Protocol 06 24 14 ca; UCLA, CA - IRB# 14-000158-CR- 00002.

      Project 2, Visit 1, Screening Phase After providing the informed consent form for this part
      of the study (long-term application of Non-invasive Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation),
      participants will undergo baseline assessment (explained above) to record severity and
      frequency of spontaneous episodes of autonomic dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension.
      participants will be asked to participate in stimulation sessions for four consecutive weeks,
      with five one-hour sessions of stimulation per week.

      Project 2, Visit 2: Baseline measurement and first stimulation session Participants will
      return 72 hours after the screening phase (explained above). All neurological and
      cardiovascular outcomes will be measured before applying the first stimulation session.
      Outcomes will be measured in two positions: a) Supine, b) ~ 70° upright tilt-test, executed
      in a random order. Participants will then be pseudo-randomized (1:1) to one of the
      stimulation conditions: 1) Mid-thoracic or 2) Lumbosacral stimulation to receive 60-minute
      stimulation. Total anticipated time is 3-4 hours including set-up and stimulation.

      Project 2, Visits 3 to 20: Stimulation sessions Participants will return to the clinic 24
      hours after the first stimulation. All stimulation parameters are identical. Total
      anticipated time is 2 hours including set-up and one-hour of stimulation. No cardiovascular
      or neurological outcome will be measured during visits 3 to 20. At the end of 6th, 11th,
      16th, and 21st stimulation sessions, neurological bowel Score and the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment will be performed. Participants will be sent home with bladder, bowel, and sexual
      function assessment questionnaires.

      All visits will include one tilt-up test with no stimulation, and one with the specific
      stimulation for that condition, executed in a random order.

      Project 2, Visit 21: Last stimulation session and post-intervention outcome measurement In
      the last visit, participants will receive the last stimulation session, and the
      cardiovascular and neurological outcome will be measured before and immediately after
      stimulation. Cardiovascular outcomes measured before and after last stimulation session in
      two positions: a) Supine and b) ~ 70° upright tilt-test, executed in a random order.

      Project 3, Visit 2 For invasive epidural spinal cord stimulation, only individuals who have
      previously been implanted with an epidural stimulator will be invited to participate.
      Participants will undergo one &quot;assessment + stimulation&quot; session.The the instructions which
      are approved under protocols UBC-Protocol 06 24 14 ca; Louisville, KY - IRB Number: 14.0738;
      Minnesota, MN - IRB Number: 4697-B, USA Veteran's Affairs: IRB Number: 16-4115 will be
      followed. Outcomes will be measured before and immediately after stimulation. Total
      anticipated time is 3-4 hours including set-up and all assessments which can be completed in
      one day.

           the screening phase, participants will be asked to abstain from drugs that directly
           influence their blood pressure, (e.g., midodrine, fludrocortisone, nifedipine).

      Patients will also be asked to arrive having not exercised vigorously for the past 24 hours
      and to have abstained from caffeine, alcohol, cannabis, and withhold medications for the
      previous 12 hours and to consume a light breakfast. Upon arrival to the laboratory,
      participants were asked to empty their bladders to minimize the influence of reflex
      sympathetic activation on peripheral vascular tone.

      Non-invasive Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation The non-invasive transcutaneous spinal
      cord stimulation will be performed within the scope of the previously approved ethics by UCLA
      (45). A stimulator will be utilized for one hour of stimulation. Transcutaneous stimulation
      will be applied using a self-adhesive cathode electrode with a diameter of 30 mm placed on
      the skin between the TVII and TVIII spinous processes (approximately corresponding to the T8
      spinal segment) at the midline over the vertebral column. For lumbosacral non-invasive
      transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, the cathode will be placed on the skin between the LI
      and LII spinous processes (approximately corresponding to the L2/3 to S4/5) at the midline
      over the vertebral column. Two self-adhesive anode electrodes with a size of 5 × 9 cm will be
      symmetrically located on the skin over the iliac crests. Based on previous works it is expect
      that stimulation will be delivered at 30 Hz as monophasic, 1-ms pulses, to provide afferent
      input to the region of the spinal cord where sympathetic preganglionic neuron cell bodies are
      located (24). The current will be increased from 10 mA until blood pressure is normalized.
      Skin temperature will be monitored in the vicinity of the stimulating electrodes with skin
      temperature probes.

      In invasive epidural spinal cord stimulation, the use of use of stimulator is associated with
      some risks, including lead migration causing changes in stimulation or reduced functional
      benefit, lead breakage, over or under stimulation, battery failure, persistent pain at
      stimulation site, unpleasant sensation or motor disturbance, spinal cord pressure at
      stimulation site, In non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, again, no adverse
      event is expected as only parameters and electrodes approved by Health Canada will be
      utilized in this study. Also, skin temperature for potential irritation will be monitored
      frequently. Stimulation could elicit autonomic dysfunction, however so far autonomic
      dysfunction has not been directly observed in the published non-invasive transcutaneous
      spinal cord stimulation studies. Furthermore, cessation in stimulation immediately reduces
      blood pressure, and blood pressure closely will be measured during procedures. In case of
      adverse events, the participant's primary physician would be notified as needed.

      Subjects who choose to participate in this trial will be required to give a significant
      commitment to this study without the guarantee of any benefit. The risks associated with this
      study are warranted in humans because of the potential direct benefit of the study
      participants and the spinal cord injury community.

      Monitoring during experiment Participants will be continuously monitored for any signs of
      risks or discomfort. As mentioned, cardiovascular signals such as blood pressure and heart
      rate will be measured frequently. For non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation,
      skin temperature will be additionally measured. If adverse events occur the testing session
      will be immediately discontinued. If any complications arise, the experiment will be
      immediately stopped. In addition, the participant's primary care provider will be notified as
      necessary if serious adverse events occur.

      Data from an autonomic assessment of individuals included in ongoing clinical trials at
      Foothills Medical Centre (Calgary) and Vancouver General Hospital (Vancouver) with invasive
      epidural spinal cord stimulation or/and non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation
      after spinal cord injury will be analyzed at Phillips Lab at University of Calgary or within
      ICORD (UBC). Furthermore, individuals who underwent implantation surgery, either at the
      above-mentioned study centers or elsewhere, (i.e. as part of a clinical trial or as treatment
      option), will be assessed and analyzed by Dr. Phillips Lab research team or at ICORD.

      Finally, Dr. Phillips lab research team will examine individuals (healthy or following spinal
      cord injury) using transcutaneous stimulation. No invasive procedure will be carried out. All
      research protocols for the above-mentioned assessments have been previously approved by the
      respective research ethics boards at the University of Louisville, UCLA, the University of
      Minnesota, and UBC: UBC-Protocol 06 24 14 ca; Louisville, KY - IRB Number: 14.0738;
      Minnesota, MN - IRB Number: 4697-B, USA Veteran's Affairs: IRB Number: 16-4115.

Filling will be stopped when the participants have reported a sensation of fullness, at the moment of urine leakage. The bladder outlet obstruction index (BOOI), will be obtained by formulaic calculations: (BOOI = PdetQmax - 2Qmax). Cystometrogram parameters including first sensation, maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), and the presence of detrusor overactivity with or without incontinence will be annotated. Valsalva leak point pressures will be assessed at a minimum volume of 200 mL. Detrusor compliance was calculated using the formula Compliance= Volume at MCC/Pdet at MCC.</description>

    <description>The Electromyography activity of the skeletal muscles will be also recorded from left and right side to confirm that skeletal muscle contractions are not occurring and therefore the pressure responses are not attributed to the skeletal muscle pump of the venous vasculature. Bipolar surface electrodes will be placed bilaterally on large skeletal muscles such as the vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), and medial hamstrings (MH), tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (SOL), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles. EMG has previously been utilized by our team, as approved by the UBC Clinical Research Ethics Board (H12-02945). Measured EMG potentials range between less than 50 μV and up to 30 mV, depending on the muscle under observation. Typical repetition rate of muscle motor unit firing is about 7-20 Hz, depending on the size of the muscle.</description>

    <description>Upon arrival to the laboratory, participants will be asked to empty their bladder to minimize the influence of reflex sympathetic activation on peripheral vascular tone (total duration: 25 min). In the supine position, participants will be instrumented with a single- lead ECG. Beat-to-beat systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MAP) blood pressures will be recorded continuously from the right hand (Finometer; Finapres Medical Systems BV, Arnhem, Netherlands), while discrete blood pressures will be taken every minute from the brachial artery (mmHg). Following instrumentation, baseline recordings will be made during a 10-minute supine rest period. Data acquisition will be performed as detailed above. Participants will then be passively moved to approximately 70° upright stand position by the investigators using the tilt table. This position will be maintained for 15 minutes, during which recordings of heart rate and blood pressure will be continued.</description>

    <time_frame>Project 2 only: before the first stimulation session and after the last stimulation session (one month after the first stimulation session).</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, brachial blood pressure will be measured. The followings will be sampled at 1,000 Hz using an analog-to-digital converter interfaced with data acquisition software on a laptop computer: non-invasive beat-by-beat blood pressure measurement via finger photo plethysmography, electrocardiogram, velocity in the left middle cerebral artery (MCAV) and/or right posterior cerebral artery. These arteries will be insonated using a 2 MHz probe mounted on the temporal bone and a fitted head strap. As described in depth elsewhere, the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery (MCA) velocities will be insonated. Arteries will be confirmed using ipsilateral common carotid artery compression, ensuring an increase in posterior cerebral artery velocity and decrease in the middle cerebral artery velocity.</description>

    <description>The AD HR-QoL Questionnaire is derived from the original version of the autonomic dysreflexia sub-section of the Autonomic Dysfunction Following Spinal Cord Injury (ADFSCI) questionnaire which was much more comprehensive in order to assess autonomic dysreflexia frequency and severity on a daily basis and specifically when the bladder is full. The ADFSCI questionnaire was created for use in clinical practice and research to assess blood pressure instability and was designed using the Delphi technique by an expert panel experienced in spinal cord injury treatment. The ADFSCI questionnaire is a 24-item self-reported questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of demographics, medications, frequency/severity of symptoms during autonomic dysreflexia and hypotensive events.</description>

    <description>The I-QoL Questionnaire is a self-administered, previously validated and reliable disease-specific questionnaire that measures bladder-related QoL in individuals with neurogenic bladder. The questionnaire is formatted as a 22-items divided into 3 sub-scales: 1) avoidance and limiting behaviour (8 items); 2) psycho-social impact (9 items); and 3) social embarrassment (5 items). Scoring is based on a five-point response scale with values ranging from one (extremely) to five (not at all). Scores are then tallied and transformed into a scale score ranging from 0-100 points with higher scores indicating a greater QoL.</description>

    <time_frame>In project 1 and 3: before and after one hour spinal cord stimulation. In project 2: 24 hours before the first stimulation session and after the last stimulation session (session 21, 4 weeks after the first session).</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the MoCA, a standardized cognitive evaluation test. We have utilized this evaluation in our previous studies with spinal cord injury individuals and cognitive deficits related to blood pressure fluctuations. MoCA is a well-accepted general screening tool for individuals with mild cognitive dysfunction. The test assesses eight domains of cognitive functioning, including attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations and orientation. Total scores below 26 (out of a maximum 30) are considered abnormal and suggest presence of cognitive dysfunctions.</description>

    <description>The Bristol Stool Scale is a tool designed to classify faeces into seven categories. The NBD score is a measure of both constipation and fecal incontinence and was developed for and validated in the spinal cord injury population. The NBD score is a 10-item symptom-based score for NBD in individuals with spinal cord injury. The maximum total NBD score is 47 points. The interpretation of the total NBD score is very minor NBD (0-6), minor NBD (7-9), moderate NBD (10-13), and severe NBD (≥14).</description>

    <description>In Project 1, we will measure the immediate effects of one-hour mid-thoracic and/or lumbosacral transcutaneous stimulation on autonomic function.
In mid-thoracic stimulation, the self-adhesive cathode electrode with a diameter of 30 mm will be placed on the skin between the TVII and TVIII spinous processes (approximately corresponding to the T8 spinal segment) at the midline over the vertebral column. For lumbosacral stimulation, the cathode will be placed on the skin between the LI and LII spinous processes (approximately corresponding to the L2/3 to S4/5) at the midline over the vertebral column. Two self-adhesive anode electrodes with a size of 5 × 9 cm will be symmetrically located on the skin over the iliac crests. Before and immediately after the stimulation, the outcomes will be measured in 2 positions, supine and ~ 70° upright (adjusted by tilt-up table).</description>
