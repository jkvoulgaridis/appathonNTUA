      This study seeks to evaluate the clinical value of the personalized therapy model with the
      guidance of Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) after Next Generation Sequencing(NGS), and to track
      patient outcomes.

      This is a study from the real world. Advanced refractory solid tumors patients with no
      standard treatment options have a very poor prognosis. In recent years, the application of s
      Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has rapidly expanded the breadth and depth of understanding
      of the molecular mechanism of tumors, laying a foundation for the development of precision
      medicine for tumors. Researchers can build a molecular phenotype of advanced refractory solid
      tumors by NGS. Some retrospective study shows that Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) therapy model
      brings therapeutic hope. So, investigators hope that this therapy model combined with NGS may
      provide treatment recommendations for advanced refractory solid tumors patients. Those
      recommendations may include some off-label targeted therapies. This study seeks to evaluate
      the clinical value of the personalized therapy model with the guidance of MTB after NGS, and
      to track patient outcomes, including ORR (Objective Response Rate), PFS (Progression Free
      Survival), OS (Overall Survival) and ADR (Adverse Drug Reaction).

        The objective is to describe in a real-world advanced refractory solid tumors population.
        First of all, this study will be carried out as a retrospective, observational review of
        patients who clinically diagnosed as advanced refractory solid tumors received personalized
        therapy with the guidance of MTB (molecular tumor board) after the NGS (next generation
        sequencing). Then, the investigators prospective observation personalized therapy plan
        which the MTB recommends for patients who clinically diagnosed as advanced refractory solid
        tumors according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is equal to or greater than 18 years of age.

          2. Histologic or cytologic confirmation of advanced refractory solid tumors with no
             standard treatment options, including some patients with advanced disease in reduced
             general condition (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 3 and 4).

          3. Patients with measurable or evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria In
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

          4. Patients must be able to provide blood samples or tissue samples for NGS (Next
             Generation Sequencing) testing. The amount of blood and tissue samples should be able
             to meet the requirements of DNA extraction and quality control.

          5. Adequate baseline organ system function.

          6. Patients could receive treatment program from MTB (Molecular Tumor Board).

          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to provide a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1.According to the investigator' judgment, there are serious, uncontrollable risks to
        patients' safety, or associated diseases (such as severe diabetes, thyroid disease,
        infection, spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, neurological or
        psychiatric disorders and so on) that affect the patients completion of the study.
