    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind study in pediatric subjects undergoing inguinal
      herniorrhaphy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 360 subjects will be randomized into one of three age cohorts: Cohort 1 (approximately
      128 adolescents ≥12 to &lt;17 years), Cohort 2 (approximately 128 children ≥6 to &lt;12 years), and
      Cohort 3 (approximately 104 children ≥3 to &lt;6 years). Cohorts 1 and 2 will be conducted in
      two parts: Part A will be dose-ranging and Part B will further evaluate the HTX-011 dose
      identified in Part A.

      All subjects enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive either HTX-011 via
      instillation into the surgical site or bupivacaine HCl 0.25% without epinephrine via
      injection into the surgical site. The study will enroll subjects in a staggered sequence
      (from oldest to youngest) of the 3 age cohorts. An Interim Review Committee will monitor the
      safety of each HTX-011 dose group.

      All subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to surgery. On the day of surgery,
      eligible subjects will undergo open unilateral herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia and
      will receive assigned study drug near the completion of the surgery. Subjects will remain in
      the hospital/research facility for 72 hours after the start of study drug administration to
      undergo postoperative assessments. After 72 hours, subjects can be discharged and will
      undergo follow-up assessments on Days 5, 7 and 28.

          -  Has a medical condition such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, participating
             in the study would pose a health risk to the subject or confound the postoperative
             assessments.

          -  As per subject history and/or medical records, has active infection or is currently
             undergoing treatment for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus

             surgery, or a recent history of alcohol abuse. Note: Subjects with a positive drug
             screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a
             positive drug test (eg, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine for
             attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine for anxiety disorder) may be
             eligible for participation in the study at the discretion of the Sponsor. Subjects
             taking any marijuana (medical or recreational) are not allowed to participate in the
             study.

          -  Previously participated in an HTX-011 study.

          -  Received an investigational product or device in a clinical trial within 30 days or
             within 5 elimination half-lives.
