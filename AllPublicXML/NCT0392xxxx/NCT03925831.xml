  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care has received considerable attention in Taiwan in recent years. The relevant
      research has been widely conducted for palliative care in adult population. However, the
      research in children population is relatively insufficient. In the limited studies, most of
      them are the experiences generated from individual institutions. This study is going to
      retrieve the data from 2008-2017 National Health Insurance Research Database, Cancer Registry
      Database, Death Registry Database and other relevant materials in order to analyze the trends
      of using pediatric palliative care service, the types of services, the timing of initiating
      palliative care, and the preference of using palliative care service among different life
      span in the past decade. In addition, the study will examine the differences of the timing of
      initiating of pediatric palliative care service and the types of diseases among different
      characteristics of children and healthcare providers. And the study will discuss how
      pediatric palliative care services affect medical costs.
