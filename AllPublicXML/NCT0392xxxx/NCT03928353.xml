  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2A, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose, sequential
      group study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of PB2452 vs matching placebo
      with ticagrelor (with or without acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)) pretreatment when various dose
      levels and administration regimens are administered to healthy younger (ages 18 to 50), older
      (ages 50 to 64 years) and elderly (ages 65 to 80 years) male and female subjects.

      Up to 5 dose levels and/or administration regimens will be evaluated in up to 5 cohorts. Each
      cohort will include approximately 8 to 12 subjects randomized in a 3:1 ratio
      (PB2452:placebo).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a Screening period, a Check-in day and Pretreatment Period, an
      on-site Randomization/Treatment day, 3 days on-site for treatment and safety monitoring, a
      Follow-up Visit (Day 7), and a Final Follow-up visit (Day 28). Seven days prior to
      Randomization, subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 will be administered ASA 81 mg orally once daily
      (QD) until the final dose on the morning of Day 1 before receiving study drug. A ticagrelor
      180 mg oral dose will be administered on the morning of Day -2 followed by either 90 mg or
      180 mg every 12 hours until the 5th dose has been administered on the morning of Day 1.

      On Day 1, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      will be randomized in a ratio 3:1 (PB2452:placebo), to receive an IV dose of PB2452 or
      placebo 2 hours following the 5th ticagrelor dose. Subjects may be discharged from the
      clinical site between Days 3 and 7 inclusive and will return for a Follow-up visit on Day 7,
      if already discharged, and on Day 28 (±2 days).

             requirements.

          2. The subject is male or female between 18 and 80 years of age, inclusive (50 to 80
             years for Cohorts 1-2, 18 to 50 years for Cohorts 3-5).

          3. The subject has a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35 kg/m2 and a weight of ≥50 kg
             but ≤120 kg, inclusive, at Screening.

          4. The subject is considered by the investigator to be in good general health, as
             determined by medical history, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign
             measurements, 12 lead ECG results, and physical examination findings at Screening.
             Older and elderly subjects with chronic, stable, and well-controlled medical
             conditions are eligible provided they meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria.
             Some examples of stable and well-controlled medical conditions include but are not
             limited to:

               -  Hypertension (HTN) controlled with ≤2 antihypertensive drugs

               -  Diabetes controlled with diet/exercise or treated with up to 2 oral diabetes
                  medications

                  Screening.

               -  Mild hepatic enzyme elevation (AST or ALT &lt;1.5 x ULN or total bilirubin &lt;1.2 x

                  postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months following
                  cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, and documented plasma
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 IU/mL) or amenorrhea for 24

               -  Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use
                  appropriate and effective measures of contraception (e.g., condom plus diaphragm
                  with spermicide, condom plus spermicide) during the study and for 30 days after
                  the last dose of study drug, and refrain from donating sperm for ≥90 days
                  following the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:
