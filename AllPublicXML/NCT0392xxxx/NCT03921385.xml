  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  To demonstrate the feasibility of integrating holographic technology as a heads-up
           display for navigated cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. This entails simply
           displaying the navigation screen currently used by Medtronic Stealth or Brainlab systems
           as a holographic image that can be positioned closer to the operative field.

        -  To develop a systematic, efficient communication and registration process allowing
           holographic technology to be potentially utilized as a navigation tool in cranial and
           spinal neurosurgery. This entails developing software, optimizing connection parameters,
           and devising registration techniques incorporating line-of-sight fiducial markers to
           allow the holographic device to function as a navigation instrument.

    <description>Patients undergoing navigated cranial or spine procedures will acquire standard of care clinical high-resolution imaging to be used for registration purposes intraoperatively. VGA output on the navigation machine will be utilized to project imaging information to the augmented reality headset. The holographic image will then be recorded to assess feasibility and ease of use.</description>
