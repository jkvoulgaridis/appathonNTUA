  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inter-rater reliability between experts and triage nurses was assessed in 484 emergency
      patients. The criterion-related validity was evaluated in other 30687 emergency patients,
      based on emergency department (ED) mortality, the length of stay in ED, the number of
      discharge, and hospitalization (intensive care/general ward).

    <description>a four-level category system, i.e. life-threatening (Level I), emergent (Level II), urgent (Level III) and semi-urgent (Level IV) . This system contains critical indicators (cardiac arrest, shock, and apnea), high risk indicators (ACS and DKA), single objective indicators (SBP, RR, HR, and SpO2) and MEWS (synthesis indicator). According to patients' health care problems, patients are rated by nurses into one of the four mentioned levels.</description>
