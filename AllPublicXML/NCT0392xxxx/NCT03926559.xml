  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the rise of the opioid epidemic, it is important for physicians to be more mindful of
      the amount of narcotic prescriptions that are being written every day. In the early
      postpartum period, pain and fatigue are the most common problems reported by women. Untreated
      pain has negative consequences on the amount of opioid narcotics used, postpartum depression,
      and the potential development of persistent chronic pain. While pain can interfere with a
      woman's ability to adequately take care of her newborn, narcotic abuse can lead to excessive
      maternal drowsiness and increased infant mortality in the new breastfeeding mother. The most
      common sources of pain after a vaginal delivery include breast engorgement, uterine
      contractions and perineal lacerations. Perineal lacerations are immediate postpartum
      complications of the vaginal birth process, defined as injury that involves the
      bulbocavernosum muscle complex (second degree), and may involve the anal sphincter complex
      (third degree) or the anal epithelium (fourth degree). Prevention of chronic and severe
      postpartum pain, especially after a cesarean delivery has been extensively studied, however,
      much paucity in research exists for the management of postpartum pain from perineal tears.
      Compared to patients with first degree tears or intact perineum, women with severe perineal
      lacerations (second degree or greater) have increased analgesic requirement up to the fifth
      postpartum day. . Epidural morphine has been accepted by anesthesiologists as treatment for
      acute pain. In obstetrics, 2-3 mg of epidural morphine was found to be sufficient to provide
      post-episiotomy analgesia. Neuraxial morphine has been used for analgesic management after a
      cesarean section, especially to reduce the amount of oral pain medications used in the first
      24 hours, but limited data exists on the use of neuraxial morphine after a severe perineal
      laceration repair in the setting of a vaginal delivery. Niv et al (1994) studied the effect
      of epidural morphine and monitored its timing of administration in post-epiostomy pain onset.
      They noted that if epidural morphine is administered before the onset of pain in an
      episiotomy repair it is much more effective than if given after the onset. This study hopes
      to take the prior 1994 study a step further and incorporates it's data to investigate whether
      neuraxial morphine given after a severe perineal laceration repair mitigates postpartum pain.
