    <measure>Post-surgical discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Post-surgical discomfort will be measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) and reported in millimeters. The subjects will be instructed to mark their level of pain on a line. The average change in discomfort level will be determined and compared between the two arms.
A visual analogue scale (VAS) of 100 mm long will be used to evaluate the degree of discomfort (0=no pain/hardship; 100=unbearable pain/hardship).</description>

    <description>After local anesthesia injection an modified flap is designed according to minimally invasive microsurgical techniques. After flap elevation, careful removal of granulation tissues from the periodontal defects is performed. Scaling and root planing of the involved dental roots is ensured and finally suture is placed.</description>
