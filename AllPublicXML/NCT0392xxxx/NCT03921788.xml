  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanisms of the development of pain in chronic venous diseases (CVD), including pelvic
      congestion syndrome (PCS), are studied incompletely. The existing hypotheses of the
      occurrence of venous pelvic pain (VVP) do not allow to answer the question why some patients
      have no pain syndrome while others have very pronounced pain despite the same
      morphofunctional changes in the pelvic veins? The investigators are planning to carry out a
      study aimed at studying the content of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P
      (SP) in the serum of patients with pelvic veins and pelvic pain, and to study the
      relationship between the values of CGRP and SP in these patients.

      The first phase of the study includes a set of 3 patient groups: the first is patients with
      pelvic vein dilation and blood reflux through them in combination with venous pelvic pain;
      the second is patients with pelvic vein dilatation without venous pelvic pain. The third,
      control group will include healthy female volunteers without pelvic veins and any chronic
      pain syndromes.

      At the second stage of the study, a study will be made of the levels of calcitonin
      gene-related peptide (CGRP) and the substance P (SP) in the serum using an ELISA method. In
      addition, after studying the content of the CGRP and SP in the serum of volunteers, the
      investigators expect to obtain the reference values of these neuropeptides. In this phase of
      the study, a statistical analysis of the data obtained will be carried out, a correlation
      analysis between venous pelvic pain and the level of the CGRP and CP.

      The data for each patient will be entered into a specially designed patient questionnaire. It
      will include clinical and ultrasound data, results of ELISA.

    <description>For the quantitative determination of the severity of venous pelvic pain using a visual analogue scale, measurement in points. The visual analogue scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;. The patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between &quot;no pain at all&quot; and the mark then defines the subject's pain.</description>
