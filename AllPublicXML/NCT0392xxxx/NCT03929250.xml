  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of known bioactive
      compounds from a standardized Centella asiatica water extract (CAW) product (CAP) in
      cognitively healthy elders.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the bioavailability and rate of clearance of Centella asiatica derived
           compounds in the plasma and urine of cognitively healthy elders over 12 hours.

        2. To determine the acute tolerability of a Centella asiatica product in cognitively
           healthy elders.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will orally consume a single administration of a standardized Centella asiatica
      water extract product (CAP). Two doses (2g and 4g CAW) will be administered on separate
      occasions, at least two weeks apart. The levels of known bioactive compounds present in
      Centella asiatica will be measured in human plasma and urine over 12 hours after
      administration of each of the doses.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 360 and 720 minutes after administration</time_frame>
    <description>Oral temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius by means of a thermometer. Temperatures falling outside the normal range (33.2-38.2 degrees Celsius) will be compared to baseline levels, and alternative clinical explanations considered, in order to determine if they are attributable to the study intervention. The investigators will also determine the proportion of all participants who develop changes in temperature following administration of CAP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulse rate</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 360 and 720 minutes after administration</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse rate will be measured peripherally over one minute. Pulse rates falling outside the normal range (60-80 beats per minute) will be compared to baseline levels, and alternative clinical explanations considered, in order to determine if they are attributable to the study intervention. The investigators will also determine the proportion of all participants who develop changes in pulse rate following administration of CAP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seated blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 360 and 720 minutes after administration</time_frame>
    <description>Seated blood pressure will be measured in millimeters mercury. Blood pressure readings falling outside the normal range (90-130/60-80 millimeters Mercury) will be compared to baseline levels, and alternative clinical explanations considered, in order to determine if they are attributable to the study intervention.

    <time_frame>0, 360 and 720 minutes after administration</time_frame>
    <description>Height in centimeters and weight in kilograms will be measured and aggregated to measure body mass index in kilograms per meter squared (kg/m2). Changes in body mass index greater than two kilograms per meter squared from baseline levels, along with consideration of alternative clinical explanations, will be used to determine attribution to the study intervention. The investigators will also determine the proportion of all participants who develop changes in body mass index of greater than two units (kilograms per meter squared) following administration of CAP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrocardiography</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 360 and 720 minutes after administration</time_frame>
    <description>Resting electrocardiography will be measured for up to five minutes using a five lead mobile electrocardiogram. Changes in P wave shape or length, QRS complex shape or length, and QT interval from the zero minute (baseline) timepoint will be measured, and alternative clinical explanations considered, in order to determine if any changes are attributable to the study intervention. The investigators will also determine the proportion of all participants who develop changes in electrocardiography compared to the zero minute timepoint following CAP administration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver function</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 360 and 720 minutes after administration</time_frame>
    <description>A comprehensive metabolic panel will measure alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in units per liter as markers of liver function. Enzyme levels falling outside the normal range (0-35 Units per liter for alanine aminotransferase and 17-59 Units per liter for aspartate aminotransferase) will be compared to baseline levels, and alternative clinical explanations considered, in order to determine if elevations are attributable to the study intervention. The investigators will aggregate the measures by using an elevation in either enzyme function as a reflection of overall liver function. The investigators will also determine the proportion of all participants who develop abnormal laboratory values following administration of CAP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kidney function</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 360 and 720 minutes after administration</time_frame>
    <description>A comprehensive metabolic panel will measure creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels in milligrams per deciliter as markers of kidney function. Each parameter falling outside the normal range ( 0.5 to 1.2 milligrams per deciliter for creatinine and 7 to 20 milligrams per deciliter for blood urea nitrogen), will be compared to baseline values and alternative clinical explanations considered, in order to determine if elevations are attributable to the study intervention. The investigators will aggregate the measures by using an elevation in either blood urea nitrogen or creatinine as a reflection of overall kidney function. The investigators will also determine the proportion of all participants who develop abnormal laboratory values following administration of CAP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 and 24 hours after administration</time_frame>
    <description>A standard multi-system questionnaire will record the type and severity (range 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life-threatening, 5 = fatal) of any adverse events. The Investigators will evaluate any changes in symptoms from baseline, and consider alternative clinical explanations, to determine if the changes are adverse events attributable to the study intervention. The investigators will determine the proportion of participants who report each type of adverse event following administration of CAP.</description>
