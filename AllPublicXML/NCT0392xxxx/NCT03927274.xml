  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with Topotecan by an alternative
      method, delivering topotecan directly into brain tumors, is safe and well tolerated.

    <description>For predominantly enhanced tumors with volume of 8 cc or less, only 1 Cleveland Multiport Catheter (CMC) will be placed and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) will be performed over a 4-hour period within an MRI scanner, with the goal of complete tumor coverage (as evidenced by tracer distribution on MRI). The initial rate will be 1.20 ml/hour (5.0 microliters/minute/microcatheter) and infusion will be monitored by intermittent MRI imaging. The rate may be adjusted upwards during the infusion, in the event of incomplete tumor coverage, or downwards, if new mass effect is apparent. Following completion of the 4-hour infusion, the CMC will be removed. The initial rate for each subsequent patient may be adjusted upwards in increments of up to 5 microliters/minute/microcatheter based upon the tumor coverage and safety characteristics of the previously treated patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of supratentorial WHO Grade III or IV Glioma (High
             Grade Glioma) that has undergone surgical biopsy or resection followed by adjuvant
             chemoradiotherapy, that has evidence of recurrence or progression based on imaging
             studies and a stereotactic biopsy is indicated for confirmation of
             recurrence/progression.

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status 70-100;

          -  MRI demonstration of a stereotactically accessible enhancing or predominantly non-
             enhancing mass that does not require resection to relieve clinically significant mass
             effect;

          -  Participant understands the procedures and agrees to comply with the study
             requirements by providing written informed consent

          -  Adequate organ function as indicated in protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in another investigational drug study in the prior 4 weeks

          -  Positive pregnancy test in a female

          -  Patient, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be poorly compliant.

          -  Diffuse subependymal or Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) disease

          -  Tumors involving the cerebellum

          -  Tumor enhancement involving both hemispheres

          -  Active infection requiring treatment

          -  Unexplained febrile illness

          -  Radiation or chemotherapy within 4 weeks of enrollment

          -  Systemic diseases associated with unacceptable anesthesia or operative risk
