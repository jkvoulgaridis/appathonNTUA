  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis is an idiopathic disease characterized by a decrease in the volume of the
      glenoid capsule, the development of fibrosis and a progressive decrease in the range of joint
      movement with pain. Shoulder pain and stiffness are accompanied by disability. The purpose of
      the study is to evaluate and compare the effects of high-intensity laser therapy on pain,
      disease - related disability and quality of life in patients with shoulder restriction and
      pain due to adhesive capsulitis.

      Adhesive capsulitis is an idiopathic disease characterized by a decrease in the volume of the
      glenoid capsule, the development of fibrosis and a progressive decrease in the range of joint
      movement with pain. Shoulder pain and stiffness are accompanied by disability. It is thought
      that the incidence is 3% to 5% in the general population and 20% in people with diabetes.
      Although usually reported to be self-limiting in 2 to 3 years, studies have reported that 40%
      of patients have persistent pain and stiffness for more than 3 years.

      Therefore, various therapies are used to reduce pain and increase the range of motion more
      rapidly without waiting for spontaneous recovery. Adhesive capsulitis treatment includes
      conservative and surgical treatment options. The options for non-surgical treatments are
      pharmacological treatments including intra-articular injection and physical therapy
      modalities. As for physical therapy modalities, various interventions are used. These include
      heat or ice, therapeutic ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and laser
      therapies.

      The aim of exercise programs consisting of joint range of motion (ROM), strengthening and
      stretching exercises, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and mobilization techniques
      is to alleviate pain caused by the capsular contracture and to improve glenohumeral ROM.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate and compare the effects of high-intensity laser
      therapy on pain, disease - related disability and quality of life in patients with shoulder
      restriction and pain due to adhesive capsulitis.

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was measured with visual analogue scale for pain (0-10 mm; 0 means no pain, 10 means severe pain) which is used to measure musculoskeletal pain with very good reliability and validity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder pain and disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-administered questionnaire and two dimensions are measured, one for pain and the other for functional activities. Scores range from 0 to 100 with scores closer to 0 indicating lower (or no) disability and scores closer to 100 indicating greater disability.</description>

    <measure>Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Short- form health survey 36 contains 36 items which are used to evaluate the quality of life of patients with chronic pain. It measures eight different domains that address physical functioning, physical role limitation, pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role limitation and mental health. The score of each domain ranges from 0 (worse quality of life) to 100 (best quality of life).</description>
