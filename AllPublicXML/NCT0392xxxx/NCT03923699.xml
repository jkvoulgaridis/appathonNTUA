  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical errors account for thousands of potentially preventable deaths each year. With the
      annual increase of surgical cases there is a need for research into the potential utility of
      a telemedicine-based control center for the operating room to assess risk, diagnose negative
      patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, randomized, controlled, phase 3 pragmatic clinical trial.
      Forty-eight operating rooms will be randomized daily to receive support from the ACT or not.
      All adults (eighteen years and older) undergoing surgical procedures in these operating rooms
      will be included and followed until 30-days after their surgery. Clinicians in operating
      rooms randomized to 'intervention' will receive decision support from clinicians in the ACT.
      In operating rooms not randomized to receive decision support from the ACT, the current
      standard of anesthesia care will be delivered. The intention-to-treat principle will be
      followed for all analyses.
