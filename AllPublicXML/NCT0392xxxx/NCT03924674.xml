  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous fluids (IVF) are used in hospitalized patients to replenish the fluid and
      electrolyte losses of patients who cannot take adequate hydration by mouth or through their
      gut. Inappropriate use of IVF may cause serious problems, including abnormalities in blood
      electrolytes such as sodium, which can lead to serious but rare neurologic harm; pain and
      discomfort from multiple IV insertions and subsequent complications (e.g., IV infiltration);
      and inadequate monitoring for adverse effects.

      Investigators currently don't know what the most commonly used IVF in hospitalized pediatric
      patients are, and there are no national benchmark data for IVF use. The American Academy of
      Pediatrics published a Guideline on maintenance IVF in November 2018, which contains one
      major recommendation: to use isotonic (having a similar electrolyte concentration to blood
      plasma) maintenance IVF in medical and surgical patients 28 days to 18 years old without
      pre-existing serious illnesses.

      This project aims to better describe and standardize the use of IVF in inpatient pediatric
      settings across the U.S. and evaluate the impact of an intervention bundle on maintenance IVF
      use. This project aims to improve health care value by reducing the number of routine
      laboratory draws.

      In Quality Improvement research, there are three different types of measures - outcome
      measures, process measures and balancing measures.

      In this project, the following will be tested as process measures:

        1. By May 2020, the proportion of daily weight measurements will increase by 10% from
           baseline for patients on maintenance IVF.

        2. By May 2020, participants will attend an average of ≥75% of their scheduled sessions
           with project QI coaches. This will be measured by tracking attendance during coaching
           phone calls.

      The following will be tested as balancing measures:

        1. There will be no increase in the number of floor-to-PICU transfers during
           hospitalization from baseline.

        2. There will be no increase in the number of serum sodium lab results obtained from
           baseline.

        3. There will be no increase in adverse events prompting a change in clinical management
           from baseline: hypertension or edema requiring a diuretic, hypertension requiring
           anti-hypertensive medication, and acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement
           therapy (RRT)/dialysis.

      Study Design

      All sites will participate in a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial, with 80-120 sites
      total. This design is helpful when simultaneous implementation of an intervention is not
      feasible or practical, and allows for each site to collect baseline data for comparison with
      post-intervention data. There will be 3 groups (or clusters) of approximately 30-40 sites
      each, with randomization to intervention occurring at 2 month intervals. Randomization will
      be stratified by: geographic region, size and baseline rate of IVF use.
