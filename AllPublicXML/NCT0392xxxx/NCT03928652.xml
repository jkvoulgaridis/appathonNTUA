      This is a prospective observational study. Tumor tissue specimens and surgical specimens are
      obtained from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University. The samples are analyzed
      for biomarkers. The biomarkers are correlated with clinical outcomes (failure-free survival,
      overall survival, tumor response to treatment (e.g. tumor regression grade for rectal
      cancer), distant metastasis, recurrence and death).

      The aim of the analysis is to explore potential biomarkers and validate the predictive and
      prognostic value of molecular signature in . This will lead to the definition of risk groups
      and stratification of patients and will help to precision medicine of colorectal cancer.
