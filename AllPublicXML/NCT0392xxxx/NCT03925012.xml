      The primary purpose of the BOUNCE study is to assess the effectiveness of a four-week
      family-based healthy lifestyle summer program in reducing adiposity indicators in Hispanic
      and African American girls and boys (ages 9-14 years old).

      The secondary aims of this study are to examine post-intervention changes in eating patterns,
      body image disturbances, unhealthy weight control practices, and fitness levels.

      The investigators hypothesize that at the post-BOUNCE summer intervention, children will
      exhibit significant decreases in adiposity indicators (percent body fat and waist
      circumference), sweetened drinks and fried foods consumption, and an increase in physical
      fitness (aerobic capacity and minutes of moderated-vigorous physical activity) when compared
      to their baseline values after controlling for demographic, acculturation characteristics.

    <description>Child participants will attend the healthy lifestyle summer program for 4 weeks, five days per week. The summer intervention will include daily one-hour nutrition education, one-hour behavioral counseling, and 3 one-hour exercise sessions. These physical activities include flexibility, games, traditional fitness, and dancing. Counseling and school psychology students, registered dietitian/nutrition educators, and fitness specialists will lead the respective sessions. Parental guardians will participate in a two-hour weekly parental sessions that involve: 1)nutrition education with cooking demonstrations of healthy recipes; 2)behavioral counseling to learn effective parenting strategies on how to support their child's healthy nutrition and exercise habits and goals; and 3)exercise sessions where parents will engage in different physical activities and will receive fitness tips on how to promote an active lifestyle for the entire family.</description>

          -  Child must be between the ages of 9-14 years

          -  Child must be overweight/obese as defined by a body mass index percentile for age-

          -  Child must have no physical disability or medical conditions that interfere with their
             participation in an exercise program

          -  Children must have no extensive diet restrictions that would hinder their
             participation in the BOUNCE nutrition component (e.g., unable to eat solid foods)

          -  All children will be required to submit evidence of a medical examination conducted by
             a health professional

          -  Parental guardians and child must be available to participate for the duration of the
             BOUNCE summer

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child and parental guardians are not Hispanic or African American

          -  Child is not between the ages of 9-14 years

          -  Child is underweight or normal weight (BMI &lt; 85 percentile) or are morbidly obese (BMI
             &gt; 100 percentile)

          -  Child or mother are pregnant or physically unable to participate

          -  Child has extensive diet restrictions that would hinder their participation in the
             BOUNCE nutrition component (e.g., unable to eat solid foods)

          -  Child does not have submitted evidence of a medical examination conducted by a health
             professional

        Note: We will encourage both maternal and paternal guardians to participate in the
        measurements and interventions. However, if the paternal guardian refuses to participate or
        there is no father figure present in the family, maternal guardian-child pairs will be
        still eligible to participate in this study. If the children are of mixed race, but
        identify themselves as Hispanic or African American and at least one of their parents is
        either Hispanic or African American, they will be still eligible to participate.
