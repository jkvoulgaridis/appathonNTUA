  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevailing view in telomere epidemiology is that leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is
      associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) since it serves as a biomarker
      of the cumulative burden of inflammation and oxidative stress during adult life. However, our
      recent results indicate that telomere length (TL) is mainly determined before adulthood, by
      TL at birth and TL attrition during growth. They also demonstrate that short telomeres
      precede the clinical manifestation of atherosclerosis. We therefore hypothesize that LT is
      not a simple marker, but a major determinant of arterial aging.

      Two mechanistic hypotheses may explain an active role of short telomeres in accelerated
      arterial aging and development of ACVD.

      The first is that a short TL at the leukocyte level reflects a short TL in endothelial
      progenitor cells (EPC). Cell replicative capacity being TL-dependent, short telomeres in the
      EPC would therefore be responsible for diminished replication capacity and vascular repair
      potential, thereby increasing the vulnerability for developing age-related arterial diseases.

      The second hypothesis is that a short LTL reflects short TL in arterial wall cells, leading
      to an increase in the number of senescent vascular cells. Senescent cells are known to alter
      their secretion pattern, a phenomenon called senescence-associated secretory phenotype
      (SASP), and thus contribute to tissue injury by promoting inflammation and tissue remodeling
      leading to lesion progression.

      These assumptions cannot be tested by LTL measurements alone. We propose, therefore, a model
      that makes it possible to examine different elements of TL dynamics in different tissues and
      cell types: leukocytes, circulating EPCs, in situ EPCs and arterial resident cells (mainly
      smooth muscle cells) in patients with or without atherosclerosis.

      Our model is based on the following observations:

        -  TL is synchronized (equivalent) across somatic tissues/cells of the newborn: an
           individual with short telomeres (relative to his pairs) in one tissue should also have
           short telomeres (relative to his pairs) in other tissues.

        -  TL in EPCs (both circulating and in situ) determines the cell proliferative ability and
           therefore capacity for vessels repair during aging.

        -  TL in the cells of the arterial wall determines the number of senescent cells that
           therefore contribute to tissue injury through their change of phenotype.

      The general aim of the present project is to examine the mechanistic links between arterial
      aging and TL in these different cell types.

        As part of the clinical care, the samples available according to the groups are as follows:

          -  for the group suffering from atheromatous pathology: lesion (pathological zone) and
             lesion border (healthy zone)

          -  for the group with traumatic vascular injury: lesion (but non-atheromatous lesion,
             therefore considered as control) and lesion border.
