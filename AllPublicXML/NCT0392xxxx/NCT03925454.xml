  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with kidney failure are kept alive using dialysis machines designed to remove
      toxic substances and excess fluid from the blood. Standard dialysis is undertaken three times
      a week at a dialysis unit, supported by a team of specialist dialysis nurses (so called
      in-centre haemodiafiltration or ICHDF). Each session lasts approximately 4 hours, during
      which time the fluid and toxins which have built up since the last session of treatment are
      removed from the blood. The rapid removal of fluid that takes place using this technique
      often causes unpleasant symptoms such as cramps and dizziness, as well as a &quot;hangover&quot;, which
      may last several hours. It can also cause problems with the heart in the long-term.

      In recent years, individuals requiring dialysis have been able to choose between standard
      ICHDF or having haemodialysis at home (HHD) using a convenient table top machine called
      NxStage System One. This device is used more frequently than in ICHDF and for shorter
      sessions. As a result, the amount of fluid removed during each session is less than with
      ICHDF. This may be beneficial to the heart, but may also make these individuals feel
      generally better, which may make them want to be more physically active. It may also reduce
      the time taken to recover from any symptoms experienced after dialysis.

      Over a 12 month period, markers of heart damage (using blood tests and scans of the heart) in
      patients receiving frequent HHD will be studied and the results will be compared with a group
      of patients receiving ICHDF. The study will also compare any symptoms they may have, how fit
      they are, how physically active they are and how well they sleep. In addition, the
      investigators will assess how well fluid balance is maintained in each group and measure the
      changes in their remaining kidney function during this time.

        The start aims to recruit at the Wessex Kidney Centre, a regional renal and transplant
        centre based at Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, UK (part of Portsmouth Hospitals NHS
        Trust). The patients involved in the study would have chosen their modality of dialysis in
        accordance with standard clinical practice and will not change any aspect of their
        treatment to meet the requirements of this study.
