  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer plus a predicted risk of &gt;5% for positive
      lymph nodes and with high-risk prostate cancer, international guidelines recommend ePLND
      along with the RP. Besides an improved accuracy in staging, the therapeutic role of ePLND
      remains controversial. We hypothesize that ePLND prolongs time to biochemical recurrence
      (BCR) and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) in intermediate- and high-risk PCa
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the surgical standard treatment for men with localized prostate
      cancer (PCa) and a life expectancy of &gt; 10 years. RP is a treatment option for localized PCa
      that shows benefit in prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) and overall survival compared
      to conservative management. According to the guideline recommendations of the European
      Association of Urology (EAU), RP should be accompanied by extended pelvic lymph node
      dissection (ePLND) in patients with intermediate-risk PCa (D'Amico classification) and &gt; 5%
      nomogram (Briganti) predicted risk of positive lymph nodes and in all high-risk PCa cases.

      Besides an improved accuracy in staging, the therapeutic role of ePLND remains controversial.
      The primary goal of this trial is to provide high-level evidence regarding the therapeutic
      benefit of ePLND in intermediate- and high-risk PCa patients without clinical evidence of
      nodal involvement. It is hypothesized that ePLND prolongs time to biochemical recurrence
      (BCR) and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) in intermediate- and high-risk PCa
      patients.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization until the date of death due to prostate cancer, assessed up to 15 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>PCSS will be calculated as the time from randomization to the date of death due to prostate cancer. Patients who died due to other reasons will be censored at the time of death. All other patients will be censored at the last date they were known to be alive.
Causes of death may require critical review by the coordinating investigator and the medical advisor. Particular attention will be paid to men who have been reported as having died from prostate cancer without previously reported progression or recurrence and men who were reported as having died from non-prostate cancer causes after developing biochemical or clinical progression.</description>
