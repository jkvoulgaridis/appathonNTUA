  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well recognized that physical activity/exercise is an effective intervention to improve
      sleep, reduce pain and improve function in a variety of pain conditions. Traditional
      interventions to increase physical activity are challenging in older adults due to extensive
      staffing requirements and low adherence. The investigators plan to conduct a pilot trial in a
      cohort of older adults (without dementia) with both chronic musculoskeletal pain and
      nocturnal sleep complaints to test the effectiveness of a 12-week personalized behavioral
      intervention (compared to a control group) embedded within a smartwatch application in older
      adults. 20 cognitively intact elders will be enrolled and randomly allocated to intervention
      or control group. Participants in the intervention arm will receive a 2-hour in person
      education session, and personalized, circadian-based activity guidelines, with real time
      physical activity self-monitoring, interactive prompts, biweekly phone consultation with the
      research team, and financial incentives for achieving weekly physical activity goal. The
      control group will receive general education on physical activity in older adults and
      continue routine daily activity for 12 weeks.

    <measure>Change in Subjective Sleep Quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity as assessed by Visual analog pain scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog pain scale is a commonly used tool for pain intensity in research and clinical practice. It is usually presented as a 100-mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Severity as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) rapidly assesses the severity of pain and has been commonly used in research studies. The BPI assesses pain at its &quot;worst,&quot; &quot;least,&quot; &quot;average,&quot; and &quot;now&quot; (current pain). The average score of the all pain items will be used. The score ranges from 0 to 10.</description>

    <measure>Change in Fatigue as assessed by the FACIT Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT Fatigue Scale is a short, 13-item, easy to administer tool that measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. The composite score of all item will be used. the total score ranges from 0 to 52. High scores represent less fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-reported well-being as assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-29 measures self-reported physical, mental wellbeing. It consists of 29 questions. The questions are ranked on a 5-point Likert Scale. PROMIS measures are scored on the T-score metric. High scores mean more of the concept being measured.</description>

    <intervention_name>ELDERFITNESS</intervention_name>
    <description>In person training: Participants will receive a 2-hour in person education session with the exercise trainer. Self-monitoring: Subjects will self-monitor subjects' level of physical activity (steps &amp; minutes of moderate activity) using the smartwatch. The Google calendar and Fitbit apps will send messages and alerts to the subject's smartwatch that encourage subjects to achieve subjects' daily goals. If a participant has low activity for 3 consecutive days, the research assistant will call the participant to either encourage the participant to adhere to the plan or provide a modified plan after consulting the exercise trainer.
Phone consultation: Subjects will have biweekly phone consultation with the research team members to receive guidance and adjustment on activity plans. Financial incentives: The intervention will include financial incentives. Specifically, when the daily activity goal is achieved for more than four days per week, a $5 reward will be given to subjects.</description>
