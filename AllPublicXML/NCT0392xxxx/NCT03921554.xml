    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess safety as well as efficacy of baricitinib, a
      Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor, in patients with Aicardi Goutières Syndrome (AGS), a
      multisystem heritable disorder of the innate immunity resulting in excessive interferon
      production

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aicardi Goutières Syndrome (AGS) is a multisystem heritable disorder of the innate immunity
      resulting in excessive interferon production. Most characteristically, AGS manifests as an
      early-onset encephalopathy that results in severe intellectual and physical handicap.
      Interferon is thought to cause injury not only to the brain, but also the skin, liver, lungs,
      heart and many other organs. Treatment with Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors offers the promise
      of decreasing interferon signaling and limiting the morbidity of this devastating disorder.

      The primary objective is to determine if the administration of baricitinib to patients with
      AGS results in an improvement or stability of the AGS scale at baseline at 52 weeks.

      Secondary objectives will include longitudinal stability of safety measures, improvement of
      interferon signaling scores, improvement of GMFM-88 and functional measures of neurologic
      disability, and improvement of a daily disease severity scale, for the duration of the
      treatment period.

    <description>The primary objective is to determine if the administration of baricitinib to patients with AGS results in a change or stability of the AGS scale at baseline at 52 weeks.
The AGS scale is a neurologic scale used to evaluate neurologic function of patients under treatment. The scale includes items for head circumference and developmental milestones. A lower score suggests a worse outcome. The range of scores is from 0 (most severe) to 11 (least severe).
In addition, longitudinal changes will be evaluated, based on measurements collected at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and every 3 months post-baseline for up to 288 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of interferon signaling scores</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Interferon signature scores (IFN Scores) are based on the mRNA expression of six type I IFN (Interferon)-inducible genes. Scores are derived from blood sampling, which will occur every three months. IFN scores are elevated in the AGS population and not elevated in healthy controls. The scale has not been published yet but it is hypothesized that a lower value in IFN score reflects a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) assessment tool include 88 items, each receiving a score from 0 to 3 (0 = does not initiate; 1 = initiates; 2 = partially completes; 3 = completes). Items span the spectrum of gross motor activities in five dimensions: A: Lying and Rolling (17 items), B: Sitting (20 items), C: Crawling and Kneeling (14 items), D: Standing (13 items), E: Walking, Running, Jumping (24 items). Every dimension score is expressed with a percentage. GMFM-88 will be performed every 6 months.</description>

               -  Are females of childbearing potential (women &gt;12 or who have had at least one
                  menstrual period regardless of age) who are sexually active and who do not agree
                  to use 2 forms of highly effective methods of birth control (see below) or remain
                  abstinent during the study and for at least 28 days following the last dose of

                    -  vasectomized male (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the
                       absence of sperm in the ejaculate)

          -  Overall health status that in the opinion of the investigator limits the safety of the
             use of bariticinib

          -  Have been exposed to a live vaccine within 12 weeks prior to entry or are expected to
             need/receive a live vaccine (including herpes zoster vaccination) during the course of
             the study, with the exception of oral rotavirus vaccinations for which the time period
             is 2 weeks. Young patients who are not yet vaccinated and will be unable to receive
             live vaccines while they are receiving the program drug (baricitinib) may be included
             after a documented conversation by a physician not affiliated with the study or the
             medical monitor with the parents to ensure parental consent and understanding of the
             risk/benefit ratio of not receiving scheduled vaccinations. These subjects will only
             be included in the study after a physician obtaining consent also describes the
             risk/benefit ratio of not receiving scheduled vaccinations.

          -  Have the following evidence of renal insufficiency:

               -  An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the most recent available
                  serum creatinine of &lt;40 mL/min/1.73 m2 if greater than 2 year of age. eGFR will
                  be calculated using the Bedside Schwartz Equation: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = (0.413
                  x height) / SCr, with height measured in cm, and serum creatinine (SCr) in units
                  of mg/dL.

               -  Children with an eGFR of &lt;40 mL/min/1.73 m2 will not be enrolled, unless &lt;24
                  months of age in which case a cut off of &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m2 will be used due to
                  age-based differences in normal eGFR. Normal eGFR of &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 is common
                  in children &lt;12 months, and a normal eFGR &lt;40 ml/min/1.73 m2 is common in infants
                  &lt;3-6 months.

               -  The creatinine should be measured using the IDMS (Isotopic Dilution Mass
                  Spectrometry) technique to monitor the eGFR if available. Other methods are
                  allowed but are not preferred. Laboratory testing using other methods will not be
                  used to monitor the eGFR.

          -  Have any of the following specific Hematologic abnormalities on screening laboratory
             tests:

               -  Hemoglobin &lt;7 mg/dL (70 g/L). In infants &lt;2 mo of age, 8 mg/dL will be used as a
                  threshold

               -  Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;500 cells/µL)

               -  CD4 &lt;250 cell/µl on lymphocyte subset testing (where Absolute CD4 count=Absolute
                  CD3/CD4 count=CD3/CD4 count=CD4 count=Absolute CD3+CD4+ cells)

               -  Thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;30,000/µL). Patients who are on anticoagulation or
                  having a history of life-threatening bleeding should be excluded if platelet
                  count is &lt;50,000/µL

          -  Have any of the following infectious risks:

               -  Evidence of active infection, at the time of entry or during the screening
                  period, that in the opinion of the investigator, would pose an unacceptable risk
                  for participating in the study

               -  Ongoing or incompletely treated severe or systemic infection, excluding
                  cellulitis/osteomyelitis that is felt to be attributable to AGS

               -  Have had symptomatic herpes zoster infection within 12 weeks prior to entry or
                  during the screening period

               -  Have a history of disseminated/complicated herpes zoster (for example,
                  multidermatomal involvement, central nervous system involvement or systemic
                  involvement including hepatitis or pneumonitis)

               -  Have a history of active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency
                  virus (HIV)

               -  Have had household contact with a person with active tuberculosis (TB) and did
                  not receive appropriate and documented prophylaxis for TB

          -  Have or have had a history of lymphoproliferative disease; or signs or symptoms
             suggestive of possible lymphoproliferative disease, or active primary or recurrent
             malignant disease; or been in remission from clinically significant malignancy for &lt;5
             years

          -  Have liver abnormalities consistent with severe, chronic liver disease

          -  ECG or echocardiogram results that include an arrhythmia unamenable to standard
             treatment, severe pulmonary hypertension, severe heart valvular (greater than mild
             insufficiency or stenosis), or significant left heart failure (Per AHA guidelines, an
             LVEF &lt;50% is considered impaired) or right heart failure (RV function described as
             qualitatively more than mildly diminished systolic function), that in the
             consideration of the investigator places them at greater risk for participation in the
             study

          -  Are unable or unwilling to make themselves available for the duration of the study
             and/or are unwilling to follow study restrictions/procedures

          -  Have received an immunosuppressive biologic agent/monoclonal antibody within 4
             half-lives prior to entry, for example, anakinra (4 half- lives=18 hours); etanercept
             (4 half-lives=18 days); infliximab; or adalimumab (4 half-lives=36 days). Use is not
             indicated in subjects receiving Natalizumab, Nivolumab, Trastuzumab, Denosumab, and
             Belimumab. Use of IVIg is permitted.

          -  Have received or be currently treated with BCG (Intravesical), Cladribine, Dipyrone,
             Pimecrolimus, and Tacrolimus (Topical).

          -  Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 30 days from, a clinical
             trial involving an investigational product or non-approved use of a drug or device
             (other than the investigational product used in this study), or concurrently enrolled
             in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically
             compatible with this study.

          -  Have screening laboratory test values outside the reference range for the population
             or investigative site that, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an unacceptable
             risk for the patient's participation in the study and are not attributable to AGS

          -  Have screening thyroid-stimulating hormone and/or thyroxine values outside of the
             laboratory's reference range and are assessed to be clinically significant. If results
             are available from testing within 1 month, then the patient will not have to be
             retested. Patients who are receiving thyroxine as replacement therapy may participate
             in the study provided stable therapy has been administered.

          -  Have screening electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, are clinically significant and indicate an unacceptable risk for the
             patient's participation in the study (for example, Bazett's corrected QT interval &gt;450
             msec for males and &gt;470 msec for females).

          -  Have evidence of active or latent TB as documented by a positive purified protein
             derivative (PPD) test (≥5 mm induration between approximately 2 and 3 days after
             application, regardless of vaccination history), medical history, and chest x-ray at
             screening. The patient may also have a QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test. If the test is
             positive or indeterminate, the patient may undergo evaluation including a CXR and PPD
             and assessed for likely risk of active tuberculosis infection. In infants &lt; 12 months
             of age, maternal and paternal testing can be used instead of testing the patient. Risk
             for TB will also be assessed using validated questions from The Red Book: Report of
             the Committee on Infectious Diseases (see below).

        Validated Questions for Determining Risk of LTBI in Children in the United States

          -  Has a family member or contact had tuberculosis disease?

          -  Has a family member had a positive tuberculin skin test result?

          -  Was your child born in a high-risk country (countries other than the United States,
             Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Western and North European countries)?

          -  Has your child traveled to a high-risk country? How much contact did your child have
             with the resident population?

               -  Have a positive test for hepatitis B defined as (1) positive for hepatitis B
                  surface antigen, or (2) positive for anti-hepatitis B core antibody, but negative
                  for hepatitis B surface antibody (unless the anti-hepatitis B core antibody is
                  thought to be a false positive result). In the latter case, confirmation of the
                  presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) by DNA testing is required. An HBV DNA
                  indeterminate result is considered HBV infection. If results are available from
                  testing within the previous 3 months, then the patient will not have to be
                  retested: If any of the hepatitis B tests have an indeterminate result,
                  confirmatory testing will be performed by an alternate method. In infants &lt; 3
                  months of age, maternal testing can be used instead of testing the patient.

               -  Have hepatitis C virus (positive for anti-hepatitis C antibody with confirmed
                  presence of hepatitis C virus);

               -  Have evidence of HIV infection and/or positive HIV antibodies. If results are
                  available from testing within the previous 3 months, then the patient will not
                  have to be retested. In infants &lt; 12 months of age, maternal testing can be used
                  instead of testing the patient.

               -  Have HIV virus. In infants &lt;12 months of age, maternal testing can be used
                  instead of testing the patient.

               -  ECG or echocardiogram results that in the opinion of the investigator places them
                  at greater risk if included in the study.

               -  Taking a concomitant medication on the list of exclusion criteria (please consult
                  study team as needed).
