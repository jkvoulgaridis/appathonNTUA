  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. Literature shows increasing
      evidence that dysfunction of ocular microcirculation in the optic nerve influences the
      progression of glaucoma. It has been shown that flicker light-induced vasodilatation of
      retinal veins is diminished in patients with glaucoma. Also previous studies indicate that
      the blood flow autoregulation is impaired in patients with glaucoma. Therefor the ocular
      perfusion pressure can not be maintained stable during changes of the systemic arterial blood
      pressure. Laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) represents a non-invasive method to quantify ocular
      perfusion also at the ONH. LSFG enables noninvasive quantification of microcirculation of the
      optic disc in Japanese glaucoma patients.

      Study Objectives:

      To assess the changes in LSFG parameters in patients with normal tension glaucoma, compared
      to healthy subjects during flicker light stimulation and isometric exercises.

        1. Study population: patients with normal tension glaucoma

               -  Caucasian men and women aged over 50 years

               -  Subject is generally healthy with no current significant or a history of a
                  significant neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary (including asthma), hepatic,
                  metabolic, rheumatic, autoimmune, hematological or renal disorder, as determined
                  by the investigator's clinical judgment through collection of medical history and
                  performance of a physical examination. A significant disorder is defined as a
                  disease or medical condition associated with impaired health status, requiring
                  regular or current medical treatment and/or follow up. For the purposes of this
                  study, an investigator may classify a medical condition as a nonsignificant
                  disorder despite the fact that the subject receives treatment. Subjects having
                  controlled Stage 1 hypertension (blood pressure of 140-159 mmHg systolic and/or
                  90-99 mmHg diastolic) are eligible for participation in this study

               -  Normal open angle in a gonioscopic examination

               -  Presence of glaucomatous optic disc changes in biomicroscopy and

               -  Visual field defects in at least two visual field examinations (Reliability
                  criteria: fixation errors &lt; 20%, false positives &lt; 15%, and false negatives &lt;

                  significant neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary (including asthma), hepatic,
                  metabolic, rheumatic, autoimmune, hematological or renal disorder, as determined
                  by the investigator's clinical judgment through collection of medical history and
                  performance of a physical examination. A significant disorder is defined as a
