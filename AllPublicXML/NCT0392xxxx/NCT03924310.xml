  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      State-of-the-art myoelectric prostheses provide upper limb amputees with a remarkable variety
      of grip patterns but lack proper feedback from touch sensation. This restriction limits the
      controllability of multi-articulated robotic hands, resulting in the rejection of the device
      in many cases.

      Amputees have often reminiscing sensations in the stump, i.e. by touching certain regions, it
      feels as if no longer existing fingers were touched. These regions form a phantom map and
      show promising results for touch feedback. However, not every amputee has one and the socket
      of a prosthesis offers limited space for additional devices. Thus, the investigators
      developed a feedback display which is worn in the shoe instead of the prosthesis itself. The
      investigators want to assess the viability of vibrotactile feedback stimulus on the foot as a
      substitution for pressure on the fingers of an artificial hand in a clinical study. The
      efforts are based on the hypothesis that a hand prosthesis with tactile feedback has better
      performance in manipulating fragile and heavy objects, compared with a standard commercial
      hand prosthesis without tactile feedback.
