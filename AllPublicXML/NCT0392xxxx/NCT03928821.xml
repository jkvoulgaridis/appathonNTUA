      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      antiviral activity of combinations of monoclonal antibodies PGT121, PGDM1400, 10-1074, and
      VRC07-523LS administered via intravenous infusion in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity
      of combinations of monoclonal antibodies PGT121, PGDM1400, 10-1074, and VRC07-523LS
      administered via intravenous infusion in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      Participants will initially be enrolled into one of three groups. At Day 0, Groups 1, 2, and
      3 will receive dual combinations of mAbs administered sequentially via IV. Group 1 will
      receive a combination of PGT121 and VRC07-523LS, Group 2 will receive PGDM1400 and
      VRC07-523LS, and Group 3 will receive 10-1074 and VRC07-523LS.

      Study staff will review study data from Groups 1, 2, and 3 and determine if Group 4 may begin
      to enroll. Participants in Group 4 will receive PGDM1400, PGT121, and VRC07-523LS
      administered in sequence via IV on Day 0 and at Month 4.

      Study duration will be 12 months for participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3, and 16 months for
      participants in Group 4. Participants will attend several study visits, which may include
      physical examinations, blood and urine collection, HIV testing and pretest counseling, risk
      reduction counseling, and questionnaires.

             judgment of the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to,
             protocol adherence, assessment of safety, Solicited AEs, or a volunteer's ability to
             give informed consent

          -  Current anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy

          -  Asthma other than mild, well-controlled asthma (Symptoms of asthma severity as defined
             in the most recent National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert
             Panel report). Exclude a volunteer who:

               -  Uses a short-acting rescue inhaler (typically a beta 2 agonist) daily, or

               -  Uses moderate/high-dose, inhaled corticosteroids, or

               -  In the past year has had either of the following:

               -  Greater than 1 exacerbation of symptoms treated with oral/parenteral
                  corticosteroids;

               -  Needed emergency care, urgent care, hospitalization, or intubation for asthma.

          -  Diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2 (Not exclusionary: type 2 cases controlled with
             diet alone or a history of isolated gestational diabetes)

          -  Hypertension:

               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140
                  mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a clinician (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study.)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
             within the past 3 years.

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

          -  History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema
