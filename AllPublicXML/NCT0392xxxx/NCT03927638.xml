  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigations examined the effect that posture has on metabolic and cardiovascular
      measurements. Further, it will explore the potential for body weight status or physical
      activity to influence these relationships. All subjects will complete a seated condition and
      a standing condition in a counterbalanced manner.

      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate both metabolic and cardiovascular responses
      to acute bouts of computer work while sitting and standing. Cardiovascular measurements were
      made using continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring and metabolic measurements were
      made using indirect calorimetry. Subjects will be grouped and analyzed based upon the weight
      status of the subject. All subjects will complete a seated condition and a standing condition
      in a counterbalanced manner. Investigators hypothesize that metabolic and cardiovascular
      responses will be elevated in the standing condition compared to sitting.
