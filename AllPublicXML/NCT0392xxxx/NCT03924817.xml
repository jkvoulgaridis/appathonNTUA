  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During sleep, the muscle tonus in the oropharyngeal space is lost, the tongue might fall back
      andthe volume of the pharynx decreases. Air cannot pass through as it would in the awake
      state and thus airflow limitations occur. The person asleep might compensate the flow
      limitation by breathing faster, which causes the soft tissue to vibrate (= snoring). Further
      narrowing of the airways can lead to obstructive apneas (complete airway collapse and
      stopping of airflow). First line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is positive airway
      pressure (PAP) that keeps the airways open with a pneumatic splint. Since PAP involves
      wearing a facial mask that applies air pressure into the airways, some patients cannot
      tolerate this therapy. These patients might be candidates for an alternative treatment
      approach with a mandibular advancement device (MAD).

      During sleep, the muscles in the oropharyngeal space relax, the tongue falls back and the
      volume of the pharynx decreases. Air cannot pass through as it would in the awake state and
      thus airflow limitations occur. Diminishing airflow can lead to snoring or to the airways
      collapsing completely (obstructive sleep apnea, OSA). Patients who suffer from OSA have
      trouble breathing during sleep and will have a disturbed sleep architecture as repeated
      airway closure causes wake reactions and arousals. This does not only lead to severe daytime
      sleepiness with high risk of causing car accidents, for instance, but also affects synaptic
      activity during sleep and the balance of blood gas levels. These factors can have a
      aggravating effect on blood pressure and worsen the prognosis for cardiovascular
      comorbidities. First line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is positive airway
      pressure (PAP) that keeps the airways open with a pneumatic splint. Positive airway pressure
      is being applied through a facial mask and some patients cannot tolerate this therapy or
      refuse it. An alternative treatment approach is by fitting an MAD that the patient wears
      during sleep. An MAD pushes the lower jar forward and thereby increases the volume of the
      upper airways, thus preventing them to close. Studies have shown good compliance with MAD
      therapy and benefits in terms of sleepiness and quality of life. The Narval registry study
      aims to investigate MAD usage in real life and reasons for non-compliance. The registry aims
      to record patient characteristics (e.g. comorbidities) and side effects that lead to a
      termination of therapy, but also how the costs for therapy are split between the patient and
      public or private health insurance providers and how this affects therapy initiation and
      usage.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in sleep-related quality of life assessed with the questionnaire FOSQ (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire). The Functional Outcomes of Sleep questionnaire is a &quot;self-report measure designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on multiple activities of daily living&quot; (Weaver 1997). It consists of 10 questions categorized as General Productivity, Social Outcome, Activity Level, Vigilance, Sexual Activity. The range of scores for any item is 1-4. The potential range of scores for the total score is 5-20, with 5 meaning bad sleep-related quality of life and 20 good sleep-related quality of life. The total score is being calculated by calculating the mean of the subscale scores and then multiply that mean by five. Missing or not applicable answers will not be added when calculating the mean subscale scores.</description>

    <description>Changes in daytime sleepiness assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire (ESS, measures the likelihood of a patient of falling asleep during daytime as self-reported outcome). The ESS is self-reported measure to assess whether a person would be prone to fall asleep in typical daily situations. It consists of 8 questions that can be answered with 0 = would never fall asleep, 1 = slight probability of falling asleep, 2 = moderate probability of falling asleep, 3 = high probability of falling asleep. The scores will be added up to give a total ranging from 0 - 24 and indicating different levels of excessive daytime sleepiness (6-10 higher than normal; 11-12 mild; 13-15 moderate; 16-24 severe).</description>

    <description>Changes in snoring assessed with a snoring questionnaire (the Thornton Snoring Scale contains 5 questions about snoring as subjective patient`s measure). The Thornton Snoring Scale consists of 5 questions that can be answered with 0 = never, 1 = infrequently, 2 = frequently, 3 = most of the time. The scores will be added and when the sum of all answers is higher than 5, a snoring problem is indicated.</description>
