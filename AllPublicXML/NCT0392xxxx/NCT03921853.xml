  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers will conduct a study for avoiding the metabolic syndrome in morbid obese
      patients. Thus, the aim of the present will be determine the effects of a resistance training
      programme (RT) in preventing or attenuating metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with morbid
      obesity. A second aim will be report the prevalence of non-responders in terms of
      improvements in MetS markers and other co-variables considered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular disease is expected to rise
      along with the global obesity epidemic. MetS is a cluster of clinical risk factors, including
      abdominal (visceral) obesity, hypertension, elevated serum triglycerides, low serum
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and hyperglycaemia.The MetS for example, significantly
      decreases the life expectancy of individuals with morbid obesity and increases the disease
      burden and economic costs associated with healthcare. In this sense, more recently, there was
      reported that body mass index (BMI) and fat distribution showed higher associations with
      inflammation, fat indices, and more prevalence of MetS in morbidly obese subjects, claiming
      for an early prevention of the MetS in the morbid obese state.

      Exercise training has proven to be effective in inducing a clinically significant weight loss
      and reducing cardiovascular risk. Exercise have reported to be associated with increased
      muscle mass, decreased body fat, and improved metabolic profile (i.e., improved glucose
      control and lipid levels). In addition, supervised RT improved muscle strength and functional
      capacity in patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. However, although RT has been
      widely studied in obesity, there is little information in the morbid obesity. On the other
      hand, there is poor knowledge similarly, about the interindividual variability to exercise
      training in terms of responders and non-responders (NR). Thus, considering the poor knowledge
      about the MetS prevention in morbid obese patients, as well as the little information about
      Responders and Non-Responders for improving MetS outcomes, the aim of this study will be
      determine the effects of a RT program on cardio-metabolic outcomes of MetS in patients with
      morbid obesity. A second aim will be report the prevalence of non-responders in terms of the
      effects of resistance training on MetS markers and other health-related variables.

    <description>The 20-week RT program will consist of three sessions per week, each lasting for 1 hour that will be applied to both control obese (CG) and morbid obese (MO) group. All sessions will start with 15 minutes warm-up with continuous walking and joint mobility and flexibility exercises, 5 minutes of cool down and stretching, in order for preventing injuries. Sessions will include 4 to 8 RT exercises targeting different muscle groups; 1. forearm, 2. knee flexors and 3. extensors, 3. trunk, 4. chest, 5. shoulder elevators, 6. horizontal shoulder flexors and 7. extensors, and 8. plantar flexors. The exercises for each muscle group will be performed in 3 sets of as many repetitions (continuous concentric/eccentric voluntary contraction) possible in 1 minute followed by 2.0 minutes of passive recovery. Before the RT program, each participant will be measure using the subjective modified Borg scale (1-10 points), in order of identifying the muscle failure into 1 minute of exercise.</description>
