  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational single cohort trial quantifying time to radiographic
      union (primary endpoint) and convenience, satisfaction, pain and resource requirements
      (secondary) for patients with non-operatively treated distal radius fractures managed with a
      thermoformable Exos short-arm brace.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be a prospective trial of a convenience sample of skeletally mature patients
      with radiographically-confirmed distal radius fractures that can be managed without ORIF. The
      study population will be defined as all adult patients (&gt;18 years) with stable, non-displaced
      distal radius fractures. All patients will be independent in activities of daily living.
      Patients will be screened as candidates for enrollment into the study and if the patient
      satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a clinical research coordinator or the study
      PI/coPI will explain all essential elements of the clinical trial. If the patient agrees to
      participate, the study coordinator or PI/coPI will obtain informed consent. The patient will
      still be followed clinically per the PI/coPI's standard of care.

    <description>The moldable brace utilized in the current study will be pre-fabricated and of the short-arm brace variety , which is primarily indicated for non-displaced fractures of the distal radius or distal ulna. The braces are available in multiple sizes for both right and left hands.</description>
