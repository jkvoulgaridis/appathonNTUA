      This is a single center, randomized, open label, single dose, two periods crossover study in
      healthy male volunteers. The volunteers will be randomly distributed into two groups
      (fasted-fed and fed-fasted groups). Any volunteer will be administrated once in each
      treatment period, the interval time of two treatment periods is 22 days (the interval time is
      no longer than 30 days).
