      The efficacy and safety of the PARP inhibitor in combination with the VEGFR inhibitor will be

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TP53 is a well-known tumor suppressor gene. Multiple studies have demonstrated that TP53
      mutations are poor prognostic factor in advanced solid tumor, the TP53 gene is frequently
      inactivated by mutation in a majority of human tumors. However, no effective TP53 -based
      therapy has been successfully translated into clinical cancer treatment. So, investigators
      intend to review and evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PARP inhibitor in combination
      with the VEGFR inhibitor for TP53 mutation in advanced refractory solid tumors patients from
      a real-world population.

        The objective is to describe in a real-world population.First of all, this study will be
        carried out as a retrospective, observational review of patients who clinically diagnosed
        as advanced refractory solid tumors received PARP-inhibitors combined with VEGFR-inhibitors
        drug therapy, from January 01, 2016 to August 01, 2018. The TP53 gene status must confirm
        by NGS (Next Generation Sequencing). Then, the investigators prospective observation
        effectiveness and safety of PARP-inhibitors combined with VEGFR-inhibitors therapy for
        patients who clinically diagnosed as advanced refractory solid tumors according to the
        inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those patients should have a NGS report to show the TP53
        gene status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is equal to or greater than 18 years of age.

          2. Histologic or cytologic confirmation of advanced refractory solid tumors with no
             standard treatment options, including some patients with advanced disease in reduced
             general condition (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 3 and 4).

          3. Patients with measurable or evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria In
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

          4. Patients must be able to provide blood samples or tissue samples for NGS (Next
             Generation Sequencing) testing for understanding the TP53 gene status. The amount of
             blood and tissue samples should be able to meet the requirements of DNA extraction and
             quality control.

             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             Palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) permitted providing that it has been
             completed at least 2 days prior to enrolment and no significant toxicity are expected.

             medication.

          4. Active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          5. Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication.

          6. Prior treatment with PARP or VEGFR inhibitions.

             psychiatric disorders and so on) that affect the patients completion of the study.
