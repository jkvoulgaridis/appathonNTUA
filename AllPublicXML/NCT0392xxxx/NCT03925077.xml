    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine two versions of a home-based exercise program with
      327 adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) who will be randomized into one of three groups: a)
      movement-to-music (M2M), b) standard exercise training (SET), and c) Attention control (ATT).

      The purpose of this study is to examine two versions of a home-based exercise program with
      327 adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) who will be randomized into one of three groups: a)
      movement-to-music (M2M), b) standard exercise training (SET), and c) Attention control (ATT).
      The primary aim is to compare the effects of two 8-week home-based exercise interventions
      (M2M vs. SET) delivered through an eHealth platform on self-report physical activity and
      other health outcomes. The secondary aim of this study is to better understand the
      characteristics between compliant and non-compliant participants by evaluate the
      characteristics of participants, which includes age, race, sex, level of injury, type of
      injury, presence of social support, outcome expectations from exercise, confidence in
      maintaining exercise behavior, and ability to control and maintain exercise behavior. The
      characteristics will be evaluated among participant separated into 2 groups: 1) participants
      who completed â‰¥ 50% of the intervention; 2) participants who completed post-testing but &lt; 50%
      of the intervention or who did not complete post-testing.

    <description>Pain intensity is measured using the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Intensity Adult Short Form. The instrument is a 3-item measure with the response scores ranging from 1 (had no pain) to 5 (very severe). Higher scores indicate higher fatigue. The total raw score is translated into a T-score for each participant for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Changes from Health-Related quality of life at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post 8 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life is measured using the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global-10 Health Items. The instrument is a 10-item measure with the response scores ranging from 1 (very severe) to 5 (none). Two summary scores, a global physical health score and a global mental health score, can be calculated from this scale, with each score ranging from 4 to 20. Higher scores indicate better health. The total raw score is translated into a T-score for each participant for analysis.</description>

    <description>Social participation is measured using the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities. The instrument is a 8-item measure with the response scores ranging from 1 (always) to 5 (never). The lowest possible total raw score is 8 and the highest possible score is 40. Higher scores indicate better ability to participate in social roles and activities. The total raw score is translated into a T-score for each participant for analysis.</description>

    <description>The M2M program has been developed for onsite instruction and will be repurposed into an eHealth version. The program is based on the positive effects of exercise and music on both physiological and psychosocial outcomes in people with disabilities. Investigators aim to advance our current M2M program by enabling more robust personalization features, allowing people with SCI to individualize their M2M program. Movement and tempo-based adaptations will also be available. A typical M2M session will consist of tailored movement routines starting with a warmup using range of motion exercises, followed by muscle strengthening, cardiorespiratory, and/or balance routines, and ending with a cool down emphasizing breathing and mindfulness.</description>

    <description>The SET program is based on the NCHPAD 14-Weeks to a Healthier You program launched in 2008. Exercise videos including range of motion, muscle strengthening, cardio and balance routines performed both seated and standing have been developed and will be restructured for use in this study. The SET program will be delivered through the same platform as M2M.</description>
