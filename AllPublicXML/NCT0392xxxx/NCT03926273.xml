      Several neuropeptides have concerned with epilepsy pathogenesis, ghrelin showed an
      anticonvulsant effect. There is a potential relation between its level and antiepileptic
      drugs (AED) response. Objective: to evaluate ghrelin effect in adult epileptic patients and
      in response to AED. Methods: This case control study included 40 adult epileptic patients and
      40 healthy controls. Participants were subjected to history taking of seizure semiology, full
      general and neurological examination, electroencephalography and cranial CT or MRI. Fasting
      serum acylated ghrelin (AG) and unacylated ghrelin (UAG) and urine AG levels were estimated
      to all participants by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA).
