  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is 1) to investigate the role of the sympathetic nervous system
      and cardiac-vascular function in women with PTSD; and 2) to determine whether lifestyle
      modifications (exercise training and healthy eating) would be effective in reducing
      sympathetic activity, improving cardiovascular function, and improving psychiatric and
      quality of life outcomes in women with PTSD. It is hypothesized that (1) women with PTSD will
      have over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system and impaired cardiac-vascular function
      compared with women who are trauma free, and (2) lifestyle modifications can reduce
      sympathetic activity, improve cardiac-vascular function, and improve psychiatric symptoms and
      quality of life in women with PTSD.

      This is a collaborative study between VA North Texas Healthcare System (VANTHCS), University
      of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), and Texas Health Resources. VANTHCS researchers
      will be responsible for recruitment of women veterans with PTSD and psychological
      assessments. UTSW/Texas Health Resources researchers will be responsible for recruitment of
      non-veteran women without a diagnosis of PTSD, physiological assessments, and the lifestyle
      modification intervention.

    <description>Exercise Training: A &quot;personalized&quot; training program will be developed for participants. Based on maximal steady state heart rate and resting heart rate, three training zones (recovery, base pace, and maximal steady state) will be determined. The target heart rate for each training zone will be set for each patient. The majority of training sessions during the early phase of the program will be prescribed as &quot;base pace&quot; with target heart rate equivalent to about 75% of maximal. Initially, patients will train 3 times per week for 20-30 minutes per session by walking, jogging or swimming. As the patients become relatively fit, the duration of the base training sessions will be prolonged, and subsequently sessions of increased intensity (i.e., maximal steady state) will be added.
Healthy Eating: Participants will be provided with dietary advice consistent with the American Heart Association guidelines (D.A.S.H. diet eating plan).</description>
