  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 50-70% only of inpatients who undergo colonoscopy have an adequate bowel cleansing,
      which is far below the recommended threshold of 90%. Variables associated to inadequate colon
      preparation have not been assessed yet. Identifying such variables would allow to augment the
      diagnostic yield of colonoscopy, and also to reduce costs related to the need to repeat
      colonoscopy. Aim of the present study is to find variables independently associated to an
      inadequate bowel cleansing and to subsequently build and validate a predictive model, which
      could prove useful in clinical practice to identify hard-to-prepare inpatients. Secondary
      endpoints are (i) to assess the proportion of patients with inadequate colon cleansing, (ii)
      to run a cost-effectiveness analysis between patients with adequate cleansing and patients
      who need to repeat colonoscopy. Patients undergoing urgent colonoscopy, and patients who take
      the preparation at home will be excluded.
