      This study will evaluate the efficacy of abobotulinumtoxina on Veterans with post-traumatic
      headache
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of headaches occur following head trauma, and therefore are referred
      to as post-traumatic headaches (PTH). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly prevalent in the
      Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) population and consequently
      there has been a rise in PTH in the clinical setting at VA hospitals. Botulinum toxin type A
      (BoNT-A) has been shown to be effective in treating chronic migraine and chronic daily
      headache. It is therefore reasonable to predict that BoNT-A may also be effective in treating
      PTH. This study proposes that PTH and its associated symptoms may respond positively to
      BoNT-A treatment due to its similar pathophysiology and clinical resemblance to other
      headache disorders including tension type headache, typical migraine with or without aura,
      and chronic daily headache.

      Study Design: Veterans with mild, moderate or severe brain injury with a headache developing
      within 7 days after head trauma and persisting greater than 3 months were recruited from the
      Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. The study is a prospective,
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial.

    <masking_description>The project statistician used a computer-based random number generator to create a randomized treatment allocation schedule that was provided to the pharmacist and nurse practitioner who did not disclose this information. The pharmacist provided the nurse practitioner with the medication in an unlabeled bag, which either included BoNT-A or Normal Saline. Patients were randomized to receive BoNT-A or Normal Saline as first injection. The nurse practitioner reconstituted the medication in a separate room and then provided the investigator with unlabeled syringes.</masking_description>
