  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lesions classified as &quot;High Grade Squamous Intra-epithelial Lesions&quot; (HSIL) are pre-cervical
      lesions of the cervix, induced by infection with the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). The
      detection and proper management of these lesions greatly reduces the incidence of invasive
      cervical cancer.

      Pap smear remains the most effective tool for early detection of low and high-grade cervical
      lesions. In Belgium, screening for cervical cancer is recommended every 3 years for women
      between 25 and 65 years old.

      HPV is a virus who possesses certain oncogenic genes who have the ability to inactivate tumor
      suppressor genes in the host cell. This promotes a tumorigenesis process within the tissues
      affected by the virus. The majority of human papillomavirus infections are transient and
      spontaneously cleared by host defense mechanisms, especially in the first two years after
      exposure. However, 10-20% of infections persist latently and may eventually lead to
      progression to invasive cervical cancer.

      Even high-grade lesions kan naturally be cleared, even more so if the patient is young and
      immuno-competent. Therefore, the management of HSIL lesions in young women has been modified
      and consists of adopting mainly a conservative attitude, with controls every 6 months for 2
      years. This management makes it possible to avoid unnecessary conizations of the cervix
      which, in young nulliparous patients, are not devoid of heavy obstetric consequences during
      subsequent pregnancies (premature birth, perinatal mortality). Cervical conization will only
      be considered for lesions that progress during follow-up or that persist beyond 2 years.
      However, this type of follow-up requires that patients be compliant.

      Our study has two main objectives:

        -  to determine the compliance of CHU Brugmann Hospital patients who have been proposed a
           conservative strategy for the management of HSIL lesions.

        -  to identify the predictive factors for the persistence and / or progression of
           high-grade pre-cancerous dysplastic lesions.
