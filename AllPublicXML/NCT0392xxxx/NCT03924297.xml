  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain pilot data in preparation for future research designed
      to formally evaluate the effectiveness of the Chilipad for patients with PTSD
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort, before-after trial. 20 subjects with PTSD or PTSD symptoms (per
      patient report) will use the Chilipad nightly for 5 weeks after completing a short battery of
      PROMIS questionnaires. During the 5-week study intervention, subjects will also wear an OURA
      ring on a finger. The OURA week measures sleep duration and quality. 5 weeks after study
      enrollment, patients will repeat the battery or PROMIS questionnaires and will return the
      Chilipad and OURA rings, both of which will be provided free of charge by the Chilipad and
      OURA manufacturers
