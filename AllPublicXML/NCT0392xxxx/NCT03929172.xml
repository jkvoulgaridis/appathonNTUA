  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the immunological
      effects of adeno-associated virus-like particle human papillomavirus (AAVLP-HPV) vaccine in
      healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      2A Pharma's AAVLP-HPV vaccine candidate is based on AAVLPs with insertion of sequences of the
      L2 minor HPV capsid protein. The vaccine's intended clinical use is as a vaccine for
      prophylaxis against HPV infection in adolescents and adults.

      This is a 12 month single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeated
      dose, safety, tolerability, and immunological effect study. Twenty (20) healthy, adult male
      and female subjects will be enrolled with a minimum of 40% of each gender. Sixteen (16)
      subjects will be randomized to receive the active drug and 4 subjects to receive the placebo.
      At least 1 subject of each gender will be randomized to receive the placebo.

      Subjects will receive a total of 3 doses of AAVLP-HPV or placebo: a prime on Day 1, and two
      boosts, one on Day 57 (±2 days) and one on Day 180 (±1 week). The volunteers will be followed
      until day 365 (±1 week) when they return for the final safety and serum-based immunogenicity
      and neutralising antibodies assessment.

             disease in the opinion of the PI or designee.

          3. History of any illness that, in the opinion of the PI or designee, might confound the
