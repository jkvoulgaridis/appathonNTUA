  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Regular exercise is beneficial to patients with hypertension and/or diabetes
      mellitus. However, most patients cannot maintain exercise habit. The investigators had
      developed a program called the &quot;exercise is medicine&quot;(EIM), combining motivational technique,
      information technology use and teaching exercise techniques. Before using this intervention
      in a main randomized controlled trial, the investigators would like to test its feasibility
      and acceptability. It is hypothesized that this program is feasible and acceptable to
      patients.

      Method: 40 patients with HT and/or DM will be recruited to attend the EIM intervention.
      Primary outcomes will be the rate of recruitment and rate of retention. Other clinical
      outcomes will be obtained before and immediately after the 12-week program.

    <description>This is a complex intervention. On recruitment, they will be seen by a nurse and counselled using motivational technique. They will then undergo a 12-week class. The exercise levels will be regularly feedback to the patients by use of mobile devices and trackers. Peer support is formed during the 12-week class. Resources to continue exercise will be provided to patients. Regular monitoring of physical improvement will be feedback to patients to encourage continued exercise.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  clinic systolic BP(SBP) higher than 130mmHg (for HT class) because the Hong Kong
             primary care office guideline, as of Jan 2019, regarded good control of SBP to be
             ≤130mmHg, OR HbA1c &gt;7% (for DM class)

          -  self-reported regular exercise of ≤3 times per week - this cut-off is arbitrary but
             people who exercise more than 3 times may have little space for improvement; and these
             patients will unlikely be referred to EIM when it is implemented in routine clinical
             practice, - who have used any mobile apps on their phone (because the intervention
             involve use of apps to monitor and remind regular exercise)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with diagnosed chronic obstructive lung disease and recent stroke (within
             last 12 months) are excluded because there are other evidence-proven and
             well-structured programmes for these patients in the Hospital Authority (HA), for
             instance, pulmonary rehabilitation program conducted by physiotherapy and/or
             occupational therapist in HA. - - acute myocardial infarction in last 6 months

          -  ongoing angina

          -  uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia

          -  acute diseases including known active endocarditis/acute pulmonary embolism, pulmonary
             infarction, deep vein thrombosis, acute aortic dissection, acute myocarditis

          -  known aortic stenosis

          -  known heart failure

          -  known obstructive left main coronary artery stenosis

          -  uncontrolled ventricular rates

          -  complete heart block

          -  known hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy

          -  mental impairment that limit co-operation

          -  resting blood pressure with systolic blood pressure &gt;180mmHg or diastolic blood
             pressure &gt;110mmHg

          -  known anaemia with haemoglobin level less than 11gm/dL

          -  known uncorrected electrolyte imbalance

          -  known uncontrolled hyperthyroidism.

          -  For DM patients, patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and recent retinal
             bleeding (in last 12 months) are also excluded due to reports that vigorous exercise
             may increase blood pressure and led to retinal bleeding in these patients
