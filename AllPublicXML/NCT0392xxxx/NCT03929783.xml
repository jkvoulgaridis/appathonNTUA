  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well contrast enhanced mammography works in diagnosing patients
      with suspicious breast findings. Diagnostic procedures, such as contrast enhanced
      mammography, may help to reclassify findings seen on diagnostic mammography and ultrasound as
      benign or likely benign with what would otherwise require biopsy for confirmation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary data to support the hypothesis that contrast enhanced mammography
      (CEM) can reduce benign tissue diagnosis (FP3) and therefore improve positive predictive
      value 3 (PPV3).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify specific CEM characteristics that accurately classify a finding as benign,
      high-risk or malignant.

      II. Assess the positive and negative predictive values for each digital breast tomosynthesis
      (DBT), breast ultrasound and CEM.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the outcomes/endpoints stratified by age to determine if age affects the
      ability of CEM to accurately define a lesion as benign, probably benign or suspicious.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo contrast enhanced mammography prior to scheduled standard of care core
      needle biopsy of the breast on the same day.
