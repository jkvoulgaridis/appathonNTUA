      CAEB1102-300A is a multi-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of pegzilarginase in patients with ARG1-D. This study will
      consist of a screening period; a randomized, double-blind treatment period; a long-term
      extension; and a follow up visit for final safety assessments.

      Subjects will be randomized to treatment following completion of all screening assessments
      and confirmation of study eligibility in a 2:1 ratio to receive weekly IV infusions of
      pegzilarginase plus individualized disease management (IDM) or placebo plus IDM during the
      24-week double blind treatment period. After completion of the 24-week double-blind treatment
      period, each subject will enter the long term, open-label extension, the first 8 weeks of
      which are blinded. During the long-term extension, all subjects receive pegzilarginase plus
      IDM. After 8 weeks of the LTE study, patients have the option to receive treatment by
      subcutaneous administration (SC).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are eligible to be included in the study only if all the following criteria apply:

          1. The subject and/or parent/guardian provides written informed consent/assent, which
             includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed
             consent form (ICF) and in this protocol

          2. A current diagnosis of ARG1 D as documented in medical records, which must include 1
             of the following: elevated plasma arginine levels, a mutation analysis that results in
             a pathogenic variant, or RBC arginase activity. For entry into this study, subjects
             must also fulfill the following plasma arginine criteria:

               1. The average of all measured values of plasma arginine during the screening period
                  prior to the randomization visit (Visit 1, Study Day 1) is ≥ 250 µmol/L

               2. If a subject is re-screened, the only values that are considered for eligibility
                  assessment are those in the current screening period

          3. Subjects must be ≥ 2 years of age on the date of informed consent/assent

          4. The subject must be assessable for clinically meaningful within-subject change
             (clinical response) on at least one component of one assessment included in the key
             secondary endpoints. To be considered assessable, the subject must be able to complete
             the assessment, and must have a baseline deficit in at least one component as defined
             in the protocol

          5. Have received documented confirmation from the investigator and/or dietician that the
             subject can maintain their diet in accordance with dietary information presented in
             the protocol, ie, can maintain the current level of protein consumption, including
             natural protein and EAA supplementation

          6. Subjects receiving ammonia scavenger therapy, anti-epileptic drugs, and/or medications
             for spasticity (eg, baclofen) must be on a stable dose of the medication for at least
             4 weeks prior to randomization and be willing to remain on a stable dose during the
             double-blind portion and blinded follow-up portions of the study

          7. Female and male subjects may participate. Female subjects of childbearing potential
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test during the screening period before receiving
             the first dose of study treatment, and a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of
             the first dose, prior to the first dose. If the subject (male or female) is engaging
             in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must be surgically sterile,
             postmenopausal (no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause or a high
             FSH level in the postmenopausal range in women not using hormonal contraception or
             hormonal replacement therapy), or must agree to use a highly effective method of birth
             control during the study and for a minimum of 30 days after the last study drug
             administration. Highly effective methods of contraception include: combined (estrogen
             and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
             ovulation; progesterone-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
             ovulation; intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); or
             abstinence (refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk
             associated with study treatment).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hyperammonemic episode (defined as an event in which a subject has an ammonia level
             ≥100 µM with one or more symptoms related to hyperammonemia requiring hospitalization
             or emergency room management) within the 6 weeks before the first dose of study drug
             is administered

          2. Active infection requiring anti-infective therapy within 3 weeks prior to first dose

          3. Known active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or
             hepatitis C

          4. Extreme mobility deficit, defined as either the inability to be assessed on the GFAQ
             or a score of 1 on the GFAQ

          5. Other medical conditions or comorbidities that, in the opinion of the investigator
             would interfere with study compliance or data interpretation (eg, severe intellectual
             disability precluding required study assessments)

          6. Has participated in a previous interventional study with pegzilarginase

          7. Has a history of hypersensitivity to polyethylene glycol (PEG) that, in the judgment
             of the investigator, puts the subject at unacceptable risk for adverse events

          8. Subject is being treated with botulinum toxin-containing regimens or plans to initiate
             such regimens during the double-blind or blinded follow-up portions of the study or
             received surgical or botulinum-toxin treatment for spasticity-related complications
             within the 16 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment in this study

          9. 9. Is currently participating in another therapeutic clinical trial or has received
             any investigational agent within 30 days (or 5 half-lives whichever is longer) prior
             to the first dose of study treatment in this study

         10. Previous liver or hematopoietic transplant procedure.
