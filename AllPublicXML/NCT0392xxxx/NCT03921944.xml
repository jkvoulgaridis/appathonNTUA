    <measure>Active Nerve Denervation</measure>
    <time_frame>one year post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>EMG examination will be performed by a single neurologist. The EMG Examination will be performed on the muscles (upper subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and rhomboid) to look for any presence or absence of active denervation. Presence indicated by increased insertional activity, fibrillation potential, positive sharp waves and/or with fasciculations in both operated and unoperated shoulders.</description>

    <time_frame>one year post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EMG Examination will be performed on the muscles (upper subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and rhomboid) to look for the presence or absence of neuropathic changes assessed by examining unit morphology amplitude: measured in millivolts, in both operated and unoperated shoulders.</description>

    <description>The EMG Examination will be performed on the muscles (upper subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and rhomboid) to look for the presence or absence of neuropathic changes assessed by examining unit morphology: phases with recruitment pattern measured as 1-2 or 3-4 units in both operated and unoperated shoulders.</description>

    <measure>Total number of Muscles affected with active denervation</measure>
    <time_frame>one year post surgery</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tear in Rotator Cuff Muscles in both shoulders</measure>
    <time_frame>one year post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>CT Scan to evaluate rotator cuff muscles for presence or absence of any tear in operative and non-operative. If tear is present - partial or full. If full, small or (&lt;1cm), or medium (1-3 cm_ or Large (3-5 cm) or massive (&gt;5cm), tendon involved (supraspinatus or infraspinatus or subscapularis).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatty degeneration in Rotator Cuff Muscles in both shoulders using Goutallier Classification</measure>
    <time_frame>one year post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>CT scan to evaluate atrophy in Rotator Cuff Muscles using the Goutallier Classification System. The Classification system measures fatty tissue infiltration and has five stages, ranging from Stage 0 (normal muscle) to Stage 4 (more fat than muscle) in upper subscapularis, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, teres minor and rhomboid in both operated and unoperated shoulder.</description>
