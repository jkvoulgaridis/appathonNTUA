  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness-Based Interventions have been applied in different fields to improve physical and
      psychological health. However, little is known about its applicability and effectiveness in
      Spanish adults with overweight and obesity. The aim of the present study protocol is to
      evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an adapted MBI programme to reduce emotional eating
      in adults with overweight and obesity in primary care (PC) settings.

      This study is a multi-centre, two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT), with
      pre-treatment, post-treatment and 1-year follow-up measures, and a 1:1 allocation rate
      between groups. Patients from four mental health units in Zaragoza (Spain) will be randomly
      assigned to two different parallel conditions, with one psychological intervention group ('ME
      + TAU') and usual treatment ('TAU alone') managed by their general practitioner (GP), to test
      the superiority of 'ME + TAU' provision compared with 'TAU alone' provision. For ethical
      reasons, those patients allocated to 'TAU alone' will be offered the ME programme after
      finishing the trial at 1-year follow-up.

    <description>It was designed to measure eating styles that may attenuate or contribute to the development of overweight. It comprises three scales that measure emotional, external and restrained eating. The Spanish version of the DEBQ has 33 items, 13 of them referred to the emotional eating scale (e.g., &quot;Desire to eat when irritated&quot;), and 10 items referring to the external (e.g., &quot;Eating when you feel lonely&quot;) and restrictive (e.g., &quot;Difficult to resist delicious food&quot;) scales, respectively. The items can be rated on a five-point likert scale with 1 indicating &quot;never&quot; and 5 indicating &quot;very often&quot;.</description>

    <description>Treatment As Usual (TAU) in Primary Care (PC) is any kind of treatment administered by the GP to the patient with overweight and obesity. According to nutritional status, overweight or obesity, as well as the presence of co-morbidity, different actions can comprise the treatment offered at a PC level. For individuals presenting with overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2) but with no co-morbidities, PC teams organise care plans to enable them to achieve a normal BMI range (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2). In case of suicide risk, severe social dysfunction or worsening of symptoms, it is recommended that patients are referred to mental health facilities.</description>

Sessions will always be the same day of the week, except for bank holidays or eventualities, and will be conducted by a psychologist specially trained and certified in ME with experience in leading mindfulness groups. Group sizes will range between 10 and 12 participants. At the end of each session, participants will receive theoretical contents and homework activities to be practiced along the week.</description>
