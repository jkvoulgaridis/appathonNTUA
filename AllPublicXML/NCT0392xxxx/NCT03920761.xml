  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a diagnostic accuracy evaluation and clinical feasibility study of investigational
      devices (EarlySense and ANNE systems) in a neonatal high dependency unit (nHDU) in a private
      teaching hospital and a government maternity hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Neonates who are
      admitted for routine observation and care will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To further reduce neonatal mortality rate in low resource settings (LRS) in Africa, research
      is needed to develop and optimize innovations in neonatal care, specifically technologies
      that are low cost, operator-independent, and highly efficient. The purpose of this study is
      to produce information and data regarding the performance of two existing multiparameter
      continuous physiological monitoring devices developed by device developers, EarlySense and
      Sonica. The clinical trial is intended to provide evidence to establish whether these
      investigational devices can reliably and accurately measure vital signs in neonates (when
      compared to verified reference devices) and to assess the feasibility, usability and
      acceptability of these devices for use in neonates in a LRS in Africa.
