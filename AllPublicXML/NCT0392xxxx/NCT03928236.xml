    <textblock>
      B-FREE is a pragmatic, multicentre, cluster crossover trial evaluating whether a policy
      limiting the use of intra-operative benzodiazepine reduces post-operative delirium when
      compared with a policy of 'ad libitum' administration. The knowledge generated by this study
      will provide the basis for cardiac anesthesia practice guidelines.

    <textblock>
      Delirium, an acute state of confusion, occurs in approximately 1 in 5 adults after open heart
      surgery. Even though it is a temporary state, patients who experience delirium are at
      increased risk of serious problems that last after the delirium has resolved. These problems
      include decreases in thinking, mobility, self-care, and the ability to live independently in
      a community setting. Patients who experience delirium have longer stays in hospital, are more
      likely to be discharged to a nursing home, and are more likely to die. Benzodiazepines are a
      sedative and amnestic medication that may be associated with delirium. As such,
      benzodiazepines are rarely used for sedation in the intensive care unit after cardiac
      surgery. However, benzodiazepines continue to be used frequently in the operating room by
      anesthesiologists during open heart surgery because of their amnestic effects and limited
      impact on blood pressure. Nevertheless, practice is divided among cardiac anesthesiologists,
      with some never using benzodiazepines and others using them for nearly all patients.

      Because the best approach (routine benzodiazepines or restricted benzodiazepines) remains
      uncertain, we will compare the effect of a hospital policy of intraoperative medication use
      that includes benzodiazepines to a policy that uses alternative medications and no
      benzodiazepines on the incidence of delirium after open heart surgery. The findings of the
      study have the potential to improve the outcomes of tens of thousands of patients around the
      world and will provide the basis for cardiac anesthesiology practice guidelines.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospital is a major surgical center with a minimum of 500 cases of cardiac surgery per
             year.

          -  Equipoise by the hospital physicians regarding the use of benzodiazepines during
             surgery (â‰¥ 95% of hospital cardiac anesthesia group agrees to manage adult patients
             (age &gt;18 years) as per the benzodiazepine policy in place during a given crossover
             period).

          -  Hospital routinely assesses patients (age &gt;18 years) for postoperative delirium at
             least once every 12 hours during the initial 72 hours after cardiac surgery as a part
             of routine clinical care using either the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU) or
             the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC).
