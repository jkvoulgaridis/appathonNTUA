  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) are at risk of developing major
      adverse limb events and have a similar cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality to those
      with coronary artery disease (CAD) with which is associated in most cases with a more severe
      prognosis. Because of higher risk conferred by concomitant PAD an early diagnosis is
      recommended in subjects with CAD. PAD can be diagnosed relatively easily and noninvasively
      with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) measure. An ABI ≤0.9 is an indicator of the presence of
      lower extremity PAD, indicating athero-occlusive arterial disease while &gt;1.3/1.4 indicates an
      incompressible ankle arteries. However, ABI is not routinely applied in the clinical
      practice. Data on prevalence of PAD are scanty and in patients with stable CAD are lacking.
      The under-diagnosis of PAD may be a barrier to the use of treatments to improve prognosis.
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the coexistence of PAD in subjects with stable CAD
      and to evaluate the management and the prognosis of these patients in primary care at
      12-month after the inclusion in the study.

      National, multicentre, observational, prospective study. This study will be carried out with
      the collaboration with Study Center for Primary Care and with the Italian Society of
      Angiology and Vascular Medicine (SIAPAV).

      The eligible patients with stable CAD will be called by General Practitioners (GPs).

      For all patients who agree to participate in the study and sign the consent, two visits will
      be done at baseline and after 12 months.

      At baseline will be collected information on socio-demographic and anthropometric data, blood
      pressure, heart rate, CV risk factors, medical history, lifestyle habits, PAD stage (for
      patient with abnormal ABI), pharmacological therapy and adherence to treatments. ABI
      measurement will be done using an automatic simple device. In case of abnormal ABI value, a
      SIAPAV vascular specialist, at GP's office, will confirm it using the standard manual
      continuous wave (CW) Doppler.

      At follow-up visit the following information will be collected the: referral to vascular
      specialist (if requested, at discretion of the GP), relevant change in pharmacological
      therapy, major CV events and progression of PAD, limb and coronary artery revascularizations,
      amputations, major bleeding, and death.

    <description>The prevalence of PAD will be diagnosed measuring the ankle-brachial-index (ABI) determined by dividing the higher systolic pressure measured at the ankle of both legs by the brachial arterial systolic pressure. An ABI value &lt;=0.9 is an indicator of the presence of PAD indicating athero-occlusive arterial disease while &gt;1.3/1.4 indicates an incompressible ankle arteries. The ABI measurement will be performed using the automatic device MESI ABPI MD.</description>
