      This study evaluates the addition of a novel mask (nasal reservoir cannula) to a standard
      nasal cannula during supplemental oxygenation for the treatment of hospitalized pediatric
      patients with hypoxemia due to severe pneumonia. Half of patients (Group A) will receive
      oxygen for 1 hour using a novel mask (nasal reservoir cannula) plus standard nasal cannula
      (Period 1), followed by a 1-hour period of continued use of the standard nasal cannula
      delivery (Period 2). Half of patients (Group B) will receive oxygen for 1 hour using a
      standard nasal cannula (Period 1), followed by a 1-hour period of continued use of the novel
      mask (nasal reservoir cannula) plus standard nasal cannula (Period 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death among children less than 5 years of age.
      Hypoxemia is a major fatal complication of pneumonia, and the risk of death increases with
      increasing severity of hypoxemia. Improving oxygen delivery and extending oxygen supplies to
      children with hypoxemia due to severe pneumonia could reduce mortality in resource-limited
      settings.

      Global Good has developed a low cost oxygen mask (nasal reservoir cannula) to more
      efficiently deliver oxygen to the pediatric patient by increasing dead space to recapture a
      portion of expelled oxygen using the spatial distribution of the nasal reservoir cannula
      volume and length of surface seal. This nasal reservoir cannula fits over a standard nasal
      cannula (also termed prong). The system is designed to reduce administered oxygen to deliver
      an equal or higher fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) per oxygen delivered (L/min) compared
      with a standard nasal cannula alone.
