      A prospective observational cohort study that measures pre- and postoperative outcome of
      septorhinoplasty by means of patient-related outcome measures (PROMS: NOSE and FACE-Q) as
      well as with functional tests (NAR, AR, PNIF).

      Introduction:

      In an ENT setting, septorhinoplasty is frequently performed for both functional and aesthetic
      reasons. Therefore, pre- and postoperative evaluation of patients' 'total' satisfaction
      regarding their nasal appearance and functional result is paramount.

      Objectives:

      To measure the pre- and postoperative functional and aesthetic outcome in patients undergoing
      an external septorhinoplasty.

      Design, setting, participants:

      A prospective observational, longitudinal outcome cohort study in a single private hospital
      centre is set up. All participants are patients undergoing an external septorhinoplasty for
      functional and aesthetic reasons.

      Exposures:

      The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scale (NOSE) and the FACE-Q Satisfaction With Nose,
      FACE-Q Satisfaction With Nostrils, are administered to patients preoperatively and at 3, 6
      and 12 months postoperatively. Also functional tests (nasal anterior rhinomanometry (NAR),
      Peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and acoustic rhinometry (AR) will be performed
      preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 and 12 months. Patient demographics, nasal history,
      and outcomes will be analyzed.

      Main outcome and measures:

      The primary outcome will measure longitudinal postoperative changes in nasal obstruction and
      aesthetic satisfaction:

        -  Change between pre- and postoperative results of NOSE and FACE-Q questionnaires (time
           frame: at inclusion and at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively)

        -  Change between pre- and postoperative values of NAR, PNIF and acoustic rhinometry (time
           frame: at inclusion and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively)

      Secondary outcome

        -  Correlation between PROMS and functional tests

        -  Correlation between change in functional tests and the surgical methods used
