  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity has reached pandemic proportions and is associated with increased
      morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Of particular concern is that most middle to
      older age adults fall far short of recommendations for health enhancing physical activities.
      This research takes a novel approach to tackling this problem by combining mindfulness with
      behavioral strategies in a unique 'Mindful Movement' program offered through YMCA community
      facilities.
