  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify a pattern of chemoresistive sensors able to recognise the
      presence of a tumoral pathology from a health state through the analysis of Volatile Organic
      Compounds inside the specimen.

      The chemoresistive nanostructured sensors are into an innovative patented device SCENT B1
      which can analyse different specimens: blood samples, tissue biopsies, cell cultures.

      In this study SCENT B1 wil be used to compare the measures of:

        -  tumoral and health tissues taken from different neoplasms after their surgical resection

        -  blood samples from healthy and tumor affected people

        -  pre and post- operative blood samples of tumor affected people

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCENT B1 is a patented device constituted by four chemoresistive nanostructured sensors able
      to vary their conductance depending on chemical substances present in the environment. These
      sensors are extremely sensitive as they can identify substances at a concentration of tens
      parts per billion such as volatile organic compounds derived from tumor cells metabolism.

      Every sensor answers differently from the others and the aim of the study is to find the best
      array of sensors able to discriminate among tumoral and healthy specimens.

      Different specimens are tested: tissue biopsies and blood samples. Blood samples are
      collected from patients undergoing surgical resection of the neoplasm. A first blood sample
      is collected before the surgery and it is compared to a control sample taken from an healthy
      volunteer. The second blood sample is taken from the patient during a follow-up visit after
      the finish of any post-operative therapy. Blood samples are conserved at ambient temperature
      and analyzed by SCENT B1 on the same day of the collection.

      Health and tumoral tissue biopsies are collected from surgical resection specimens, kept in
      breeding ground, cleaned from bacteria, adipose tissue and other contaminants and finally
      processed in SCENT B1 on the day after the collection.

      The four sensors' outputs are combined in statistical analysis in order to define the
      threshold between health and tumor affected specimens.
