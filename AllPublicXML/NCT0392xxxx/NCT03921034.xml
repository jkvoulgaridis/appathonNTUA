  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy of IPACK on
      postoperative opioid consumption, patient satisfaction, pain scores, mobility, and several
      other secondary outcomes in adults undergoing primary unilateral TKA.

      Enrolled patients will be randomized to either continuous ACB with IPACK or to continuous ACB
      with sham subcutaneous saline injection. Outcomes assessors and patients will be blinded to
      the intervention.
