  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need for a better experimental system to understand flavivirus antibody
      responses, beyond dengue, to make sure the investigators are using current vaccines to
      greatest effect and to inform the development of next-generation vaccines. This study will
      use live chimeric JE vaccine IMOJEV速 as a tool for flavivirus epitope discovery. This will
      allow experimental JEV infection using replication competent, live, attenuated virus as a
      model, in a setting where the flavivirus infection history of humans can be tightly
      controlled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that in previously flavivirus-exposed individuals, the
      antibody response is more broadly cross neutralising, and that this will lead to the
      identification of conserved virion surface epitopes that could be the target of second
      generation vaccines.

      Specific aims

        1. To establish a human model system of JEV infection in healthy adult volunteers using
           live attenuated JE vaccine IMOJEV速.

        2. To define the fine specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibody response after JE
           vaccination, using human monoclonal antibodies.

        3. To examine whether there are epitopes which can serve as the target of broadly
           cross-neutralising antibody responses.

      Experimentally the fine specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibody response will be
      studied by cloning antibodies from plasmablasts (B cells responding to the vaccine) that have
      been single cell sorted by flow cytometry at one week post vaccine. These human monoclonal
      antibodies will then be mapped on to the surface of the virus particle using established
      approaches, and tested to look for cross-reactive antibodies.

             physical examination and normal screening blood tests

          5. No previous flavivirus vaccination (JE, tick borne encephalitis or yellow fever (YF)),
             residence in a flavivirus endemic area or planned travel to a flavivirus endemic area
