      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, single blinded (Philips hair counter) study in healthy
      women of skin types I up to and including V.

      Safety and efficacy of hair removal with the Investigational Philips IPL-device will be
      investigated.

      In-clinic, each study subject will undergo twelve IPL-treatments at four areas bilaterally
      (face, axilla, bikini line, and legs) with an investigational IPL device applied by a device
      operator.

      Hair re-growth in four body areas, face, axillae, bikini line and leg will be evaluated
      separately.

      After the 4 bi-weekly treatments, one follow-up visit will be organized. After the completion
      of full treatment cycle (12 treatments), subjects will be followed for 1 and 3 months
      (short-term follow-up) and for 6, 9 and 12 months (long-term follow up).

    <description>The analysis of the Primary safety endpoint will be based on the safety population which include all the enrolled subjects with at least one treatment. The primary safety endpoints include the treatment-emerged, anticipated adverse events (e.g. pain/discomfort, anticipated skin reactions.), non-anticipated adverse events, serious adverse events and reasons for discontinuation. Pain/discomfort will be evaluated per treatment per body area using the 5-point pain score grade. The percentage of the top-two scores will be calculated. Skin reactions will be assessed per treatment and body area, and will be described for type, onset, duration and severity. Incidence of adverse events will be summarized by frequency, severity and by relationship to device. Safety data will be summarized with descriptive statistics by body area, time points and clinical sites and combined.</description>

    <description>This study will be conducted in women, aged 18 to 65 years, with skin types I up to and including V, and measured melanin values of â‰¤ 553 Melanin index in each qualifying treatment area in face (upper lip), axilla, bikini line, and leg. Each of the 2cm x 4cm treatment area bilateral located in axilla, bikini line and leg should count a minimum of 24 hairs. In face (upper lip) on upper lip, a minimum of 10 hairs should be available in each of the 1cm x 2cm selected treatment area bilateral located. The procedure to define the treatment area is described in the Training Manual [5]. Skin type must be determined based on an evaluation by a dermatologist or designee at site according to the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale.</description>
