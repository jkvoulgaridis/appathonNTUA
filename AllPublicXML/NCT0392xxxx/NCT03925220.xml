  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to test the efficacy of a family communication-based, novel,
      adaptable, and resource-efficient substance misuse preventive intervention for
      parents/guardians of pre/early adolescents (grades 5-7). The short-term goal of this study is
      to increase the quality time that parents spend with their children through eating meals
      together, and in so doing, talking about the harms associated with substance use
      (intermediate endpoint), which will in turn, lead to the long-term goal of preventing the
      initiation and misuse of substances among their children as they enter adolescence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of substance use and misuse among adolescents is a national public health
      priority. Universal prevention programs that include parents/guardians (referred to as
      &quot;parents&quot;) in this effort have been shown to prevent and reduce substance use problems among
      adolescents. However, the programs that have been most effective are resource and participant
      intensive. In addition, the majority of the current programs are not gender-specific and in
      some cases, long-term effects have been shown for one gender but not the other. The purpose
      of the current study is to test the efficacy of a brief, communication-based, substance use
      preventive intervention for parents of pre/early adolescents. The proposal is based on data
      from a study funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) where the investigative
      team conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention among 70
      parents/guardians and their children. The intervention was found to be acceptable and
      feasible to participants and families in the intervention had increased parent-child
      communication about substance use compared to those in the control condition. The purpose of
      the pilot study was to lay the groundwork for a large-scale trial of the intervention with
      500 parent-child dyads. The brief intervention framework utilizes a one-time in-person
      session and a follow-up phone call with a communication specialist to facilitate parents'
      roles as preventionists, which will focus on family interactions at meals, the role of peers
      in substance use, and parent-child communication about substance use. For this in-person
      session, parents will be asked to review a handbook with gender-specific information that
      emphasizes engaging in family meals, communication, and talking with their child about the
      harms of substance use. For the home-based component, tips and reminders with content from
      the handbooks will be sent via text messages throughout the three-month study period. Parents
      in the comparison condition will receive a handbook, similar in length and structure, on
      nutrition and physical activity, as well as receive comparison text messages and meet with a
      study team member. All study materials will be available in English and Spanish. It is
      hypothesized that over the study period, parents randomized to the intervention will have an
      increased frequency of parent-child communication about substance use. It is also
      hypothesized that these parents will have more positive and fewer negative family
      interactions during meals and qualitatively better content of conversations about substance
      use with their children compared to parents in the comparison condition. Furthermore, it is
      hypothesized that compared to children of parents in the comparison condition, children of
      parents who receive the intervention will self-report reduced intentions and willingness to
      use substances, reduced affiliation with substance-using peers, and increased negative
      attitudes and expectancies regarding substance use, and secondarily, lower rates of substance
      use initiation.

    <measure>Changes in quality of parent-child conversations about substance use</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of parent-child conversations about substance use will be assessed by an audio-recording of a prompted parent-child conversation using an adapted version of the Family Assessment Task (FAsTask), which will be coded quantitatively.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of family mealtime interactions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mean quality of mealtime interactions will be measured using various scales from the Iowa Family Interaction Rating Scales (IFIRS) coding system: Dyadic Interaction Scales, Dyadic Relationship Scales, Group Interactions Scales, and Parenting Scales. Observed behaviors from 3 video-recorded family meals will be assessed and scored on a 9-point scale. A higher score indicates coders observed a higher intensity and/or frequency of the construct in the video-recorded family meals. Each IFIRS scale is scored individually and the average across the 3 family meals will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Changes in child substance use expectancies (alcohol).</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and negative expectancies about the affective, cognitive, and behavioral effects of alcohol use will be assessed with the Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire-Adolescent Form, short version. The tool is comprised of 27 items, each with response options ranging from (1) Strongly Disagree to (6) Strongly Agree. Questions 6, 9, 17, 26 are scored in opposite direction before they are included in the scales. Scores are summed to create a total scale range from 27 - 162. A higher score on the scale indicates a greater belief that alcohol has desirable effects.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in child substance use expectancies (cigarettes).</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and negative expectancies about the affective, cognitive, and behavioral effects of cigarette use will be assessed with the Positive and Negative Outcome Expectancies of Smoking scale. The tool comprises 12 items, each with response options ranging from (1) Strongly Disagree to (6) Strongly Agree. The tool has two subscales (positive expectancies, determined by 7 questions; negative expectancies, determined by 5 questions). Summary scores for both the positive and negative expectancies are created. Summary score values range from 0-7 for positive, 0-5 for negative expectancies. Higher score on positive expectancies scale indicates a greater belief that there are positive outcomes of smoking. Higher score on negative expectancies scale indicates a greater belief in negative consequences of smoking.</description>

    <measure>Changes in child substance use expectancies (marijuana).</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and negative expectancies about the affective, cognitive, and behavioral effects of marijuana use will be assessed with an adapted version of the Marijuana Effect Expectancies Questionnaire - Brief. The tool comprises three standalone subscales (Relaxation/Tension Reduction, Cognitive/Behavioral Impairment, Global Negative Effects) for a total of 27 items. Each item has responses ranging from (1) Strongly Disagree to (6) Strongly Agree. Scores for each subscale are calculated by averaging item scores within that subscale. Each subscale score range is from 1 - 6. Higher scores on each scale indicate greater expectations of Relaxation/Tension Reduction, Cognitive/Behavioral Impairment, and Global Negative Effects associated with marijuana use.</description>

    <measure>Changes in child affiliation with substance-using peers.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using an item from the Monitoring the Future study, children will be asked how many of their friends they think use substances. The item is repeated for each substance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in child willingness to use substances.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Child willingness to use substances will be assessed through three items adapted from the measure combining intention and willingness originally developed for tobacco and amphetamines found in Gibbons et al. (1998) Reasoned Action and Social Reaction: Willingness and Intention as Independent Predictors of Health Risk. The three items will be asked for each substance. Each item has response options ranging from (1) Not at all likely to (6) Very likely. The second two items are reverse coded and the three items are averaged to create a behavioral willingness index that ranges from 1 to 6. Each substance is scored separately. A higher score indicates that the child is more willing to try the substance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in child intentions to use substances.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Two items from the Youth Alcohol and Drug Survey will assess child's intention to use substances. The two items will be asked for each substance at baseline and each follow up timepoint. Each item has the response options (0) No, (1) Probably No, (2) Probably Yes, (3) Yes. Each item assessed individually, and each substance is scored separately. A higher score indicates greater intention to use the substance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pre/early-adolescent substance use initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Substance use initiation for each substance will be assessed with three items from the Drug Use Questionnaire. The items will be asked for each substance at baseline and each follow up timepoint, and are used to calculate time of initiation and incidence. Child responds Yes/No to the &quot;ever used&quot; question and if responds yes, provides day of first use. Frequency of use question has responses: (0) Never, (1) Once a month or less, (2) About once a week, (3) Several times a week, (4) About once a day, (5) Several times a day.</description>

    <description>Parents will be given a handbook specific to the gender of their child that provides information and advice communication and substance use prevention. Parents will then participate in a one-hour session with an interventionist where the main points in the handbook will be reviewed and they will fill out an action plan on how to make changes in communication about substances with their child. The interventionist will also provide parents with a referral packet. Two weeks after the in-person session, participants will have a half-hour follow-up phone call with the same study interventionist. For the home-based component, parents will receive two messages each week with reminders and tips that reinforce the information covered in the handbook. Finally, participants will receive a magnet about the importance of family meals that they will be instructed to put on their refrigerators.</description>

    <description>For the comparison condition, after the baseline assessment, parents will receive a handbook on nutrition and physical activity entitled: &quot;Healthy Eating &amp; Physical Activity Across Your Lifespan: Helping your Child - Tips for Parents&quot;. This handbook, which is adapted from the handbook developed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the Weight Control Information Network, is approximately the same length as the intervention handbook and is available in English and Spanish. It is given with an insert on reducing weight talk and weight teasing in the family. Parents will also receive a magnet with a message about nutrition and exercise. To control for contact time, these participants will meet in person with a study staff member two weeks after receiving the handbook, complete an action plan, and have the 30-minute call, as well as receive two text messages twice per week for 13 weeks with tips and reminders from the comparison handbook and insert.</description>
