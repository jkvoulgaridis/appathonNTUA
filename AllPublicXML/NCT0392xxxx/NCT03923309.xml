  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though refusal of radical surgery was often happened in rectal cancer patient after
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, little is currently known about the actual oncologic outcome
      of it. Thus the investigators designed this study to compare the oncologic outcome of
      unintended rectal preservation with intended rectal preservation by surgeon.

      The investigators identified patients whose organ were preserved by non-operative management
      or local excision after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for mid to low rectal cancer. Then, the
      patients were categorized into two groups according to the agreement on omitting radical
      surgery (rectal preservation). When treatment decision was agreed by their surgeon, the
      patients were categorized as intended rectal preservation. When there was disagreement by
      surgeon on rectal preservation, then the patients categorized as unintended rectal
      preservation. Oncologic outcome was compared between two groups.
