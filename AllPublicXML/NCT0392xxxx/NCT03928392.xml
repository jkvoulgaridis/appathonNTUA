  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether an occupational therapy program could
      enhance mental health outcomes for veterans who SCUBA dive. SCUBA diving requires modified
      breathing techniques and has been found to provide calming effects to individuals who engage
      in this activity. Occupational therapy interventions such as mindfulness, journaling, and
      deep breathing techniques can also provide similar calming effects. Therefore, this study
      will explore whether occupational therapy can provide additional benefits to overall mental
      health of veterans who SCUBA dive.

    <description>Study participants will complete the assessment, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) which is an individualized composite measurement of factors designed to assess clients' perception of their occupational performance and satisfaction with that performance. The participants will identify up to 5 goals. For each goal the participant will rate their perceived performance on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing the lowest level of performance and 10 representing the highest level of performance. The average of the scores will be recorded. Participants will also rate their satisfaction with performance on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing the lowest level of satisfaction and 10 representing the highest level of satisfaction. The average of these scores will represent the satisfaction with performance score.</description>

    <measure>The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD through a 20-item self-report measure. In the PCL-5, individuals are presented with a list of problems people may have as a result of a stressful situation. Individuals are asked to indicate how much they have been bothered by this problem in the past month. Problems can be rated as &quot;not at all, a little bit (1), moderately (2), quite a bit (3), or extremely&quot; (4).</description>

    <measure>The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) is a individualized composite measurement used to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in community settings. The DASS-21 asks 21 questions and is comprised of three subscales: The Depression sub-scale which measures hopelessness, low self-esteem, and low positive affect; the Anxiety scale which assesses autonomic arousal, musculoskeletal symptoms, situational anxiety and subjective experience of anxious arousal; and the Stress scale which assesses tension, agitation, and negative affect. There are 21 questions and responses are provided on a 4-point Likert scale, Where 0 = Did not apply to me, 1 = applied to me some degree, or some of the time, 2 = applied to me a considerable degree or good part of time, and 3 = applied to me very much or most of the time.</description>

    <description>Two SCUBA dives in conjunction with occupational therapy intervention. The occupational therapy intervention will take place on the beach or on the boat before/after the SCUBA dive. The intervention will consist of learning 3 different breathing techniques. Participants will also be educated about mindfulness principals. Additionally, participants will complete journaling activities between dives.</description>
