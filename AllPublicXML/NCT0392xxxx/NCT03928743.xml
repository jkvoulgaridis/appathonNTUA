    <measure>Change from Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) is a validated self-reported instrument, which consists of six 10 unit horizontal Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) to measure the disease activity of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from the subject's perspective. It measures the severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration) over the last week. The final BASDAI scores ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) partial remission (PR) is defined as a score of &lt;=2 units on a 0 to 10 unit scale in all 4 domains listed for ASAS20.</description>

    <measure>Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score major improvement (ASDAS-MI) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score major improvement (ASDAS-MI) is achieved when there is a reduction (improvement) &gt;= 2.0 in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) relative to Baseline.
ASDAS is calculated as the sum of the following components:
0.121 × Total back pain (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Q2 result)
0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Q6 result)
0.110 × Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGADA)
0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Q3 result)
0.579 × (natural logarithm of the C-reactive protein (CRP) [mg/L] + 1)
Total back pain, PGADA, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling and fatigue are all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units).
High ASDAS scores mean worse disease. If a subjects achieves the ASDAS-MI it indicates a major improvement of their disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) assesses physical function in comprising 10 items relating to activities during the past week. Each item ranges from 0 ('Easy') to 10 ('Impossible'). The BASFI is the mean of the 10 scores such that the total score ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating better physical function. A negative value in BASFI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in nocturnal spinal pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the nocturnal spinal pain NRS at Week 16. Nocturnal spinal pain experienced by ankylosing spondylitis (AS) subjects is measured by one question: pain in the spine at night due to AS?. When responding, the subject is to consider the average amount of pain in the preceding week. It is assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units). A lower score indicates less pain and an improvement of the outcome.</description>

    <description>The Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL), a validated disease-specific 18-item questionnaire, has been developed specifically for measuring health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and has shown to be responsive in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). The ASQoL score ranges from 0 to 18 with a higher score indicating worse HRQoL.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>There are 8 SF-36 domain scores. In addition to domain scores, the PCS scores are calculated from the 8 domains. Each of the 8 domain scores and the component summary scores ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status. A larger positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Metrology Index (BASMI) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Metrology Index (BASMI) characterizes the spinal mobility of subjects with axial Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). It is a disease-specific measure consisting of 5 clinical measures to reflect subject axial status: cervical rotation; tragus to wall distance; lateral lumbar flexion; lumbar flexion (modified Schober test); intermalleolar distance. According to the linear definition of the BASMI a score of 0 to 10 is calculated for each item based on the measurement. The mean of the sum of the 5 scores provides the BASMI score. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient's limitation of movement due to their axial SpA. A negative value in BASMI change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

    <description>The Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis (MASES) is an index that measures the severity (ie, intensity and extent) of enthesitis through the assessment of 13 entheses (bilateral costochondral 1, costochondral 7, anterior superior iliac spine, posterior iliac spine, iliac crest and proximal insertion of the Achilles tendon sites, and the fifth lumbar vertebral body spinous process) each scored as 0 or 1 and then summed for a possible score of 0 to 13.

    <ipd_description>Data from this study may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized IPD and redacted study documents which may include: raw datasets, analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, blank case report form, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a pre-specified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if a determination is made that the data cannot be adequately anonymized.</ipd_description>
