  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We intend to survey school aged patients following ACL surgery on when they return to school.
      We will analyze independent variables to determine if any relationship exists that may
      influence the amount of time missed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing ACL surgery who are enrolled in middle or high school will be
      recruited for study participation. Patients undergoing concomitant additional ligament
      surgery will be excluded. The only procedure will be to answer a short written questionnaire
      asking when they returned to school and what accommodations, if any, the school made
      available for them. This will occur at the patient's 2 week post-operative clinic visit. This
      clinic visit is a standard of care visit. Independent variables will be collected from the
      medical record and are all standard of care information routinely collected from this patient
      populations (age, sex, race, date of surgery, surgeon, sport played, grade, ACL surgery graft
      type, associated meniscal or chondral surgery, length of post-operative narcotic use,
      regional nerve block at the time of surgery, SANE score, IKDC score, brace used).
