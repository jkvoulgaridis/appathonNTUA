  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a common complication after surgical repair of elbow trauma.
      Uric acid is the end-product of purine metabolism that has any physiological and pathogenic
      potential functions. However, the relationship of HO and uric acid has not been explored up
      to now. This study aimed to assess the relationship of HO and uric acid. The investigators
      retrospectively reviewed the demographics of participants who undergone the surgery for elbow
      trauma in our hospital between January 2012 and December 2018. One hundred participants
      included in our study. The participants were divided into two groups by the existing HO or
      not. The serum uric acid between both groups were compared by using the independent samples
      student T tests.

      The investigators retrospectively analyzed the demographics of these participants in our
      hospital who underwent the surgery after trauma of elbow joint between January 2012 and
      December 2018. All of the participants had a previous history of elbow joint fractures
      including distal humerus fracture or proximal ulna fracture or capitulum radii fracture or
      elbow fracture dislocation. According to X ray or CT scan, the participants were divided into
      two groups. One group the participants had not existed radiographic evidence of heterotopic
      ossification or formatted ectopic lamellar bone. And the other group is the participants with
      radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification. And we recorded patient serum uric acid,
      sex and age, Body Mass Index (BMI), the situation of joint trauma and comorbid conditions
      including diabetes mellitus or impaired blood glucose, gout, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis
      and various vitamin deficiency diseases. Moreover, the grades of heterotopic ossification
      were recorded for all patients according to Hastings and Graham Classification System for
      Heterotopic Ossification at the Elbow Joint.
