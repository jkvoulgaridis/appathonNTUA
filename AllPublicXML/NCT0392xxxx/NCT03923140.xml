  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study to observe the efficacy and safety of tranilast in CAPS
      patients. The investigators would analyze the changes in Auto-Inflammatory Diseases Activity
      Index (AIDAI) before and after treatment as well as changes in inflammatory markers,
      patients' and physician's global assessment of disease activity to determine the efficacy and
      safety of tranilast.

      Seventy-one patients with CAPS will be recruited. After signing the informed consent, they
      will be administrated with tranilast (For juvenile patients, 5mg/kg.d with a maximum dose of
      0.3g per day; For adult patients, the dose is 0.1g each time, three times a day). These
      patients will be followed up for 6 months. AIDAI is recorded by patients' or their parents
      one month before the start of treatment, and at the 1st, 3rd and 6th month after the
      treatment. Inflammatory markers, and patients' and physician's global assessment of disease
      activity will be assessed during the 1st, 3rd and 6th month follow-up. Side effects will be
      monitored and recorded as well. Experimental data before and after the administration of
      tranilast will be analyzed and be statistically processed, to figure out whether tranilast is
      effective and safe for CAPS patients.

    <description>Patients or their parents completed a 1-month (31 days) prospective diary with 12 yes/no items( Fever ≥38°C, Overall symptoms, Abdominal pain, Nausea/vomiting, Diarrhoea, Headaches, Chest pain, Painful nodes, Arthralgia or myalgia, Swelling of the joints, Eye manifestations, Skin rash) at the previous 1 month before treatment, and the 6th month after treatment . Each item of this diary was dichotomised as no (0)=absence of symptom or yes (1)=presence of symptom. The calculation of the Auto-Inflammatory Diseases Activity Index score is straightforward, consisting of the sum of all 12 items (0-372 in a month of 31 days). Higher values represent higher disease activity.</description>
