  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Alzheimer Report 2015 estimates that 46.8 million people have dementia worldwide,
      reaching 131.5 million by 2050. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia and
      contributes 60-70% of cases. Internationally it is recommended to focus action on mild
      cognitive impairment as preclinical condition for its effectiveness in delaying dementia. The
      combined study of high-precision brain neuroimaging, cognitive parameters and metabolome
      constitute an optimal approach that would provide a unique opportunity for understanding,
      prevention and treatment of dementia and mild cognitive impairment. The EFICCOM project aims
      to examine the effect of a 5-month period supervised exercise intervention on cerebral,
      cognitive, metabolomic dimensions in older people at risk of mild cognitive impairment.
      Secondarily, the effect of this intervention on antioxidant capacity, lipid metabolism and
      glucose, physical health (functional capacity, blood pressure, body composition) and mental
      (quality of life and depression) will be studied, as well as other factors risk (genetic and
      biological) for the development of Alzheimer. A total of 100 people aged between 65 and 75
      years old at risk of mild cognitive impairment will be randomly distributed in the supervised
      exercise intervention group (n = 50) and control group (n = 50). The design will include a
      5-month intervention with measurements at pre and post intervention and a third measurement
      (retest) after 3 months of completion. The multicomponent supervised exercise program will
      include aerobic, strength, cognitive and coordinative-agility-balance works, and progression
      will be established in different load parameters (frequency, volume, intensity, density).
      Therefore, randomized controlled studies are needed to know the specific effect of
      dose-response considering the various dimensions in parallel such as neuroimaging, cognitive
      status and metabolomics. This will allow us to understand from a comprehensive perspective
      the causes and mechanisms underlying the response. The EFICCOM project will significantly
      increase scientific knowledge about the role of exercise on brain as a therapeutic measure in
      people at risk of mild cognitive impairment from a multidimensional perspective. The project
      will have a significant impact at social and economic level by transferring the study
      findings to social and health setting by means of agents and networks provided for the
      project.

    <description>5 months of supervised physical exercise program. The individualized and progressive Health periodization model will be applied establishing an initial individualizing period, as well as identifying any need or adaptation to apply during the exercise program. The physical exercise program will be applied in a period of progressive increase whose initial objective will be to reach the volume and intensity established by the international recommendations of physical activity (http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/) for this population. Briefly, a volume of 150 min/week of moderate-vigorous physical activity (60% -85% reserve heart rate) spread over a maximum of 5 days and including force work 2-3 days/week. The training load will progressively increase with a wave and flexible periodization.</description>

    <description>The methodology will be multicomponent, including aerobic, strength, coordination-cognitive and balance-agility. The physical exercise sessions will be designed in such a way that they work the dimensions but being attractive and motivating for the participants. Each session will include 10 minutes of warm-up with smooth running and mobility exercises; 35-40 minutes of aerobic, strength, coordination-cognitive and balance-agility progressively developed; and 10 minutes back to calm at low intensity with stretching exercises. Nutritional intervention will not be included. For quality purposes, we will use small groups (10-15 pers). After each session participants will be asked about their subjective perception of the effort and the intensity will be controlled by heart rate monitors.</description>
