      The main purpose of this study was to observe the pelvic floor muscle strength abnormalities
      of cesarean section and vaginal delivery at different time points within six months after
      delivery without any intervention. It was a prospective observational study, and the main
      study population was healthy postpartum women. Regular follow-up was conducted at 6 weeks, 9
      weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months and 6 months postpartum. The follow-ups included
      gynecological examination, pelvic floor electrophysiological indexes (category I and II
      muscle fiber strength and fatigue), questionnaire (ICI- Q-SF, OABSS, UDI-6), and pelvic floor
      ultrasound. The incidence of pelvic floor muscle strength abnormality at different postpartum
      time points was statistically analyzed, the high-risk factors of postpartum pelvic floor
      function abnormality caused by pregnancy and delivery were analyzed, and the general rules of
      the natural development of pelvic floor function were observed.
