      A prospective, multicenter, observational evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the FRED®
      device in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center observational study. Treatment and follow-up visits will be performed
      as per standard of care. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that use of the
      FREDTM/FREDTM Jr Embolic device in intracranial aneurysm treatment is safe and effective when
      assessed at 6, 12 months and yearly up to 5 years post procedure.

      150 patients will be enrolled over an 15-month recruitment period. All patients will be
      followed for 5 years.

        Patients who are at least 18 years of age presenting with an unruptured or recanalized
        intracranial aneurysm requiring endovascular treatment. Those eligible to be treated with
        FRED/FRED Jr will be enrolled after having signed an informed consent form.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient older than 18 years old

          2. Patient harboring a non-acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysm within the last 30 days
             of presentation:

               -  for which use of FRED or FRED Jr has been deemed appropriate

               -  being the only aneurysm to require treatment within the next 12 months

               -  and optionally previously treated by surgery (clipping) or with an intrasaccular
                  device: aneurysm recanalized

          3. Patient with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 2

          4. Patient has received information about data collection and has signed and dated an
             Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has suffered from an ICH within the 30 days prior to the procedure.

          2. The aneurysm to be treated is associated with a cAVM

          3. The aneurysm to be treated is in the posterior circulation

          4. The aneurysm to be treated has a stenosis of its parent artery &gt;50%

          5. Patient has another aneurysm previously treated with a stent or a flow diverter

               -  on the same parent vessel at any time

               -  on a different parent vessel, less than 3 months prior to the procedure
                  (previously-implanted stents in the non-index proximal carotid are acceptable)

          6. Patient with whom anticoagulant, antiplatelet or thrombolytic drugs are
             contra-indicated or test performed regarding AP medication administered is not
             efficient for the patient

          7. Patient with known hypersensitivity to contrast products or nickel titanium, not
             treatable

          8. Pregnancy or child breastfeeding

          9. Patient unable or unlikely to complete required follow up

         10. Patient has severe or fatal comorbidity or a life expectancy of less than 1 year

         11. Treatment with a flow diverter other than FRED/FRED Jr or in addition to FRED/FRED Jr
             is planned
