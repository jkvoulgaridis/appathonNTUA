  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Quality Improvement initiative is to reduce severe morbidity and
      mortality among premature infants through proven and cost-effective clinical management
      during the antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum periods. In order to reduce neonatal
      mortality and morbidity due to preterm birth complications, health facilities must be able to
      identify and manage women in preterm labor, accurately administer medications, and provide
      high-quality postnatal care.

      The purpose of this Quality Improvement initiative is to reduce severe morbidity and
      mortality among premature infants through proven and cost-effective clinical management
      during the antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum periods. In order to reduce neonatal
      mortality and morbidity due to preterm birth complications, health facilities must be able to
      identify and manage women in preterm labor, accurately administer medications, and provide
      high-quality postnatal care.

      The study will provide evidence of implementing a package of clinical interventions coupled
      with quality improvement and monitoring strategy aimed at reducing neonatal mortality in 3
      resource-limited health facilities, leveraging on an existing strengthened birth registry to
      provide neonatal outcomes up to 28 days after delivery. Additionally, using a multifaceted
      approach through an interdisciplinary team, the investigators will identify the social and
      cultural barriers that contribute to home-based deliveries. These findings will be helpful to
      the Ministry of Health in shaping future policies regarding the scale-up of newborn care
      clinical protocols as part of Government's efforts to reducing neonatal mortality in Zambia.
