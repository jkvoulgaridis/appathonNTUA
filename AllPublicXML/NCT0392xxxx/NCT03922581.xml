  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot a primary-care based mindfulness intervention for
      chronically traumatized African Americans screening positive for posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in primary care clinics within an urban
      public hospital. The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design along with
      a multi-method psychological and physiological assessment approach to establish the
      feasibility and acceptability of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention
      for primary care versus wait-list control in African Americans with chronic trauma exposure
      and comorbid PTSD and MDD. Preliminary mechanisms of action associated with MBCT including
      emotion dysregulation and autonomic function will be evaluated. The data collection and
      8-session group intervention will take place in primary care clinics within an urban public
      hospital serving primarily low-income, minority individuals (&gt;80% African American).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is significant public health burden of chronic trauma exposure in low income,
      predominantly ethnic minority, urban communities, which is reflected in the extraordinarily
      high levels of trauma-related psychiatric disorders, particularly PTSD and MDD. Despite this,
      limited access to behavioral health treatment and significant barriers to treatment
      engagement and success remain and integrating mind-body approaches in medical settings could
      be a critical next step in treating chronically traumatized individuals in these urban
      settings. This study will utilize a randomized controlled trial design along with a
      multi-method assessment approach to ascertain the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      mechanisms of action and outcomes of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy versus wait-list
      control in 80 African Americans with chronic trauma exposure and comorbid PTSD and MDD
      symptoms.

      Participants will be randomized to an 8-session (90 minutes each) group intervention or
      wait-list control. The researchers will examine the retention and follow-up rates,
      participants' report of acceptability and interest in the intervention, and examine barriers
      to treatment engagement through self-report measures and exit interviews. This study will
      also investigate preliminary mechanisms of action and outcomes of the mindfulness
      intervention in targeting emotion regulation and autonomic processes by measuring self-report
      of emotion dysregulation using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and autonomic
      arousal to trauma cues using eSense technology to assess skin conductance during
      administration of Standardized Trauma Interview. Latent growth modeling will assess relative
      changes in emotion dysregulation and autonomic function over time through intervention and 1
      month follow-up.

    <measure>Retention rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Follow-up (1 month after the end of the 8-week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Retention rates will be assessed using session attendance. Previous mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) interventions among low-income minority populations have yielded completion rates of 53-80%. Based on 80% completion rates of MBSR in primary care and 75% completion rates of MBCT both in combat vet samples and the anticipated improved accessibility through primary care, it is expected that subjects in the intervention group will evidence at least 75% retention and follow-up rates.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-group Follow-up Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants randomized to the MBCT intervention will complete an open-ended, follow-up questionnaire designed to assess feelings and changes experienced from participation in the intervention. The 10 questions include &quot;how did you feel about the group?&quot; and &quot;what barriers came up for you in participating in the group?&quot;. Responses are in text form rather than on a pre-set scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in skin conductance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, Follow-up (3 months after the end of the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Skin conductance (SC) response will be measured using a mobile SC device, eSense (Mindfield Biosystems). Continuous recording of SC is measured with electrodes on hands and data is transmitted through the eSense app. Using the PhenX Toolkit protocol, a two minute baseline measure of SC will be obtained and then SC levels will be measured during administration of the Standardized Trauma Interview immediately following to determine physiological reactivity to trauma stimuli. SC response is calculated by subtracting SC level at the end of baseline recording (average of last 30 seconds) from the maximum SC level value during the trauma interview.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, Follow-up (1 month after the end of the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will assess for presence of depressive symptoms and serve as MDD screening tool. The PHQ-9 is a 9-item tool that asks respondents to indicate how frequently they have felt symptoms of depression on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 = not at all and 3 = nearly every day. Total scores range from 0 to 27, where higher scores indicate worse depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 (PCL-5) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item questionnaire asking respondents to report how much they have been bothered by problems in the past month on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total scores range from 0 to 80 where higher scores indicate increased difficulty with responses to stressful experiences.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a 21-item instrument asking respondents to indicate how much they are bothered by negative feelings. Responses are on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 = the problematic feeling is not present and 3 = the feeling is very strong. Total scores range from 0 to 63, where high scores indicate worse problems with negative feelings.</description>
