  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry disability index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is based on a self-administered questionnaire measuring ''back-specific function.'' The questionnaire comprises 10 items, each with 6 levels of response. Each item is scored from 0 to 5, and the total summation is converted to a 0-100 scale. The ODI scores ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating severe symptoms.
This is assessed by ODI survey at 1 year after surgery</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Oswestry disability index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12, months, and every year, up to 5 year after operation</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8, 12, 24, 48 hours, 2 weeks, 3, 6, and 12, months, and every year, up to 5 year after operation</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a measurement score that indicates pain severity status. VAS score comprised a 10-cm line with ''none'' (0) on one end of the scale and ''disabling pain'' (10) on the other.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline EuroQoL-5 dimension (EQ-5D) value</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12, months, and every year, up to 5 year after operation</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Rated level can be coded as a number 1 to 5, which indicates having no problems for 1, and having extreme problems for 5. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 55555 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). EQ-5D health states may be converted into a single index value. The index values are a major feature of the EQ-5D instrument, facilitating the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that are used to inform economic evaluations of health care interventions. The value sets are anchored on 11111 = 1 and 55555 = 0 and can therefore be used in QALY calculations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline PainDETECT score</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12, months, and every year, up to 5 year after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The painDETECT Questionnaire (PDQ) is a screening tool designed to detect neuropathic pain in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) based on self-reported pain characteristics. The degree of the seven types of pain quality, the type of pain pattern, and the presence of radiating pain. From the three components of the PDQ, a total score is calculated; a high score indicates that the pain is likely to have a neuropathic component. Scoring is performed using a scoring manual, and results in a final screening score: a score of 0-12 indicates nociceptive pain, 19-38 indicates neuropathic pain, and 13-18 indicates mixed pain.</description>
