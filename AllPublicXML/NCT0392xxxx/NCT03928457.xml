  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The massive use of highly technological devices in Neonatal Intensive Care Units may expose
      preterm neonates to electromagnetic fields, especially radiofrequencies, at low doses but
      continuously and chronically. Strikingly, the effect of long-term exposure to
      radiofrequencies on the neurophysiological development of preterm neonates has never been
      studied so far. The only studies on the impact of chronic exposure to radiofrequencies have
      been conducted in animals or adult humans, whereas preterm infants may be particularly
      vulnerable due to increased penetration of radiofrequency waves into the brain during a
      crucial period of neurodevelopment. The present project will aim at 1) quantifying individual
      levels of chronic exposure (during 6 weeks) to which preterm neonates are subjected during
      their stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, 2) following the evolution of the thermal
      environment and of the clinical parameters of the neonates after birth, 3) identifying
      potential alterations of neurophysiological activity (sleep, cerebral hemodynamics, autonomic
      nervous activity) which will be correlated to actual levels of chronic RF-EMF (radiofrequency
      electromagnetic fields) exposure.

    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are potentially exposed to chronic, low levels of electromagnetic fields,
      especially radiofrequencies, while hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units. Moreover,
      they may be particularly vulnerable due to increased penetration of radiofrequency waves into
      the brain during a crucial period of neurodevelopment. This study will aim at evaluating the
      influence of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields exposure on the neurophysiological
      development in preterm neonates.

      The first part of this study will be devoted to the measurement of environmental
      electromagnetic fields in order to map their distribution in the paediatric department. From
      birth and during 6 weeks, the investigators will perform, for each child, a continuous
      measurement of radiofrequencies at the incubator level. Infants' clinical data (medical
      history, nutrition, morphology...) and the evolution of the thermal environment in incubators
      (air and body temperatures) will also be continually monitored. At 3 and 6 weeks of life, the
      investigators will investigate sleep (EEG, EOG), cerebral hemodynamics (near-infrared
      spectroscopy), autonomic nervous system activity (ECG, heart rate variability) and various
      cardiorespiratory parameters (SpO2, apnoea, bradycardia) thanks to a night-time
      polysomnography.

      The impact of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields will be evaluated by analyses of the
      relationship between exposure levels and the various parameters extracted from the
      neurophysiological investigation phase.
