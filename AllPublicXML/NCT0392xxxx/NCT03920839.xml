        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors including the following: histologically or
             cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IIIB not amenable to curative treatment or
             Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (pemetrexed-platinum treatment groups must have
             nonsquamous histology type); and histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis
             of advanced/metastatic unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma.

          -  No prior systemic treatment with the following exceptions: participants with a known
             sensitizing mutation (eg, BRAF, EGFR, ALK, or ROS1) should have had disease
             progression on or following an approved targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor; and
             participants who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy are eligible if the
             adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy was completed at least 6 months before the date of
             enrollment.

          -  Measurable or nonmeasurable tumor lesions per RECIST v1.1.

          -  Is currently participating and receiving investigational therapy or has participated

             investigational device within 4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression with
             corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg once daily of prednisone or equivalent) or immunosuppressive
             drugs within 2 years before the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Is on chronic systemic steroids (&gt; 10 mg once daily of prednisone or equivalent).

          -  Known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis

             and a washout period of ≥ 4 weeks since radiation therapy is required).

          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.

          -  Evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, noninfectious pneumonitis.

          -  History of organ transplant, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          -  Active infections requiring systemic antibiotics.

          -  Known active hepatitis B or C.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency, including participants known to be HIV positive
             (positive for HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Significant cardiac event within 6 months before Cycle 1 Day 1.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 28 days of the planned start of study treatment.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any component of the study drugs, excipients, or another
