    <textblock>
      Because the atherosclerosis process partly occur in the intercellular space of the vessel
      wall, the determination of the constitution of lipoproteins in the interstitial fluid may
      expand our knowledge about the atherosclerosis process and lead to a better understanding of
      what constitutes the increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease in patients with
      chronic diseases. We hypothesize that the apoB-containing particles in T2D patients are more
      susceptible to be retained or consumed in the intercellular compartment, which in turn could
      be one explanation for the elevated risk of atherosclerosis. We hypothesise that with the
      progression of chronic kidney disease this process is further increased. Patients undergoing
      dialysis are known to have a very high risk of cardiovascular disease. We now want to study
      the cholesterol metabolism in interstitial fluid in subjects undergoing hemodialysis because
      of diabetic nephropathy and in subjects undergoing hemodialysis because of chronic kidney
      disease of other causes.
