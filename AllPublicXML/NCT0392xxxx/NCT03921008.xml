  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive form of soft tissue sarcoma. Prior work demonstrates
      very poor outcomes, with most patients developing metastatic disease and less than 50%
      surviving greater than 5 years. In other soft tissue sarcomas, the use of radiotherapy and/or
      chemotherapy have improved progression-free survival in patients undergoing limited,
      organ-sparing surgeries. Taxane chemotherapy has shown efficacy in patients with metastatic
      angiosarcoma, but this has not been tested in patients with localized disease. This study
      examines the efficacy of induction paclitaxel followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy
      with paclitaxel prior to curative surgical resection.

    <description>All patients will receive standard of care induction chemotherapy with 6 weekly cycles of paclitaxel at 80 mg/m^2. They will then receive 6 weekly cycles of paclitaxel at 80 mg/m^2 concurrently with radiation therapy. Patients will be receiving paclitaxel as part of their routine care, but in order to participate in this study, their induction chemotherapy regimen must be paclitaxel. Radiation therapy is 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions delivered within 7 weeks.
Standard of care surgery ideally within 6 weeks after completing concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed cutaneous angiosarcoma.

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 5 mm with CT scan or ≥ 5 mm by
             clinical exam at the time of diagnosis

          -  Currently receiving or planning to receive weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks at 80 mg/m^2
             weekly. The patient must be able to begin radiotherapy within the first 7 weeks of
             paclitaxel treatment.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate
             contraception prior to the study, for the duration of the study, and one month after
             completion of the study

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients deemed ineligible for curative therapy by the treating medical oncologist,
             radiation oncologist, or surgeon.

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 3 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Currently receiving any investigational agents.

          -  Current central nervous system disease or distant metastatic disease not including
             local-regional lymph nodes or satellite lesions. Patients with known brain metastases
             must be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because
             they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Grade 2 or greater neuropathy

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to paclitaxel or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac
             arrhythmia.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  HIV-positive patients whose CD4+ T-cell count is &lt; 350 cells/mcL.
