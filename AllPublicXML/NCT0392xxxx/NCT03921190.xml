      To study the patients' and dentists' perception of receiving/ administering maxillary buccal
      infiltration anesthesia using an open or closed mouth techniques
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Local anesthesia is an essential part of dentistry. The most commonly used
      technique to anesthetise maxillary posterior teeth is buccal infiltration with a local
      anesthetic agent. The technique described in the literature focuses on the location of
      injection, the direction of the needle insertion in relation to the root apex, the direction
      of needle bevel in relation to the cortical bone plate, the size of needle and the type and
      amount of the local anesthetic agent used. However, there is no mention to whether the
      patient should open their mouth or maintain their teeth in intercuspation during the
      injection procedure.

      Aims: This research aims to a) compare two techniques of injection (open and closed-mouth
      techniques) in terms of the discomfort experienced by patients during the injection procedure
      and b) evaluate the dentists' preference in performing either of the two techniques.

    <description>Patient perception of pain/ discomfort during injection will be recorded on a standard 100mm visual analogue scale where 100 is the worst imaginable pain and 0 is no pain at all. The patient's reported value will be registered as a numerical value and the means for the two groups will be compared to detect any statistical difference</description>

    <description>Participating dentists will be asked to rate the visibility of injection site and ease of cheek retraction on a standard 100mm visual analogue scale where 100 indicates the best possible visibility/ ease of cheek retraction and 0 means no visibility at all/ impossible cheek retraction. Finally the dentists will be asked to register their own preference of performing either of the two techniques (if any)</description>
