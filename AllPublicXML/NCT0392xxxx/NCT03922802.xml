      hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with transcutaneous (non-invasive) spinal cord stimulation on

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training modulates spinal
           locomotor networks in individuals with spinal cord injury

        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training improves locomotor
           function in individuals with spinal cord injury

        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training improves symmetry of
           gait in individuals with spinal cord injury

        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training improves standing
           posture and balance in individuals with spinal cord injury

        -  To determine whether ambulation efficiency (improved cardiovascular conditioning)
           improves with a combination of AIH, transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation and
           ambulation training in individuals with spinal cord injury

    <description>Participants will ambulate along Gait Rite electronic walkway 6 times (3 times per gait speed) to evaluate baseline gait pattern at both their self-selected and safe fast gait speed. The Gait Rite electronic walkway contains sensor pads encapsulated in a carpet and connected to a computer. The system can be laid over any flat surface and automates measuring temporal and spatial gait parameters. The Gait Rite electronic walkway for the study shall be a minimum of 14 feet long. The Gait Rite data capture was chosen as measurement of the patient's overall gait quality.</description>

    <measure>Change in 6 Minute Walk Test Using VO2 Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 (baseline test, initial visit), After 4 weeks of intervention (Mid Point), After 8 weeks of intervention (Post intervention), 3 month follow-up, 6 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up]</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) measures the distance a subject can walk indoors on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes, using assertive devices, as necessary. The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The test will be used to determine participant's gait efficiency at baseline and at study completion. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded. This test will be administered while wearing a portable gas analysis system called the Cosmed K4B2 to measure oxygen consumption. This system measures oxygen consumption (VO2) and Carbon-dioxide production (VCO2) in a breath by breath fashion.</description>

    <description>Locomotion assessment for inter and intra limb coordination using wearable sensors and EMG sensors. Participants ambulate along Gait Rite electronic walkway up to 12 times (3 times per gait speed with and without lower extremity orthotics if safe and appropriate) to evaluate gait pattern at both self-selected and safe fast gait speed.</description>

    <description>Spinal Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) will be obtained by stimulating the spinal cord between spinous processes of up to 5 vertebrae with a single pulse. MEPs are the electromyograph responses of the peripheral muscles to electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. MEPs will be used to test the integrity of the motor pathways of the spinal cord.
A Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Neurostimulator (BioStim-5 or NeuroEnabling Stimulator System) will deliver transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation.</description>
