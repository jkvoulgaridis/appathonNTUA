      The purpose of this study is to examine therapeutic efficacy of cognitive Training based on
      location information and activity in people with mild cognitive impairment

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  A single arm, open-label study.

        -  Cognitive Training based on location information and activity is consists of both
           cognitive training and exercise(walking) using objects in the participant's home. The
           researchers visit the participant's home and find objects that were mainly used in the
           real life and easy to access (table, computer, television, etc.) and attach the
           recognition Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) Tag (sticker integrated). The stickers printed on
           the tags consist of word categories (eg animals) belonging to a particular category, so
           as to assist strategic recall in the stepped recall task. The participants follow the
           instruction from the tablet-based program to perform the task. During performing the
           cognitive training program, the participants are guided to walk between the tagged
           objects in their home.

        -  The participants are aged over 60 years old and diagnosed with mild cognitive
           impairment.

    <measure>Change in CERAD-TS1 score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total Score of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (CERAD-TS1) . CERAD-TS1 is generated by simply summing the scores of six tests including the 1) Verbal fluency (range 0-24), 2) Boston naming test (0-15), 3) Word List Memory (0-30), 4) Word List Recall (0-10), 5) Word list recognition (0-10), 6) Constructional Praxis (0-11). The range of CERAD-TS1 score is 0 to 100 points), and the higher score represents the better cognitive function.</description>
