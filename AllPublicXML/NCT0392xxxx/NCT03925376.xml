      This study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of baseline characteristics for
      patients undergoing redo cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Redo cardiac surgery is associated with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and
      mortality. Patients undergoing redo cardiac surgery are becoming increasingly complex due to
      multiple comorbidities, adherence of mediastinal structures to the undersurface of the
      sternum as well as the spatial location of patent bypass grafts relative to the route of
      entry. Association estimates between baseline characteristics and outcomes in those cohort
      are imprecise. The aim of this study is to identify prognostic factors associated with redo
      cardiac surgery which may help physicians predict clinical outcomes and guide their treatment
      decision.

    <description>Redo cardiac surgery is technically challenging due to scarring of tissues resulting in loss of tissue planes, adhesions, multiple comorbid factors and risk of injury during re-entry.Suggested techniques in coronary artery surgery with a left internal mammary artery include routing the graft through a slit in the pericardium to minimize the possibility of adherence to the sternal table.</description>
