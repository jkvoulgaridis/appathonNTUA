  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to enable patients with solid tumors, who received anetumab
      ravtansine in a Bayer-sponsored clinical trial, to continue treatment after their respective
      study has been closed. The patients will be observed to collect information on how safe and
      efficient the drug is.

      The primary objective of the study is to collect long-term safety information on anetumab
      ravtansine and to enable patients, who received an anetumab ravtansine-containing treatment
      in any Bayer-sponsored anetumab ravtansine parent study, to continue the treatment. The
      secondary objective is to further investigate the efficacy of the drug.
