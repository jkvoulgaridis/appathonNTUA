      The primary objective of the pilot study is to determine activity of PAC-1 and nivolumab
      combination in subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma previously treated with immune
      checkpoint inhibitor therapy as assessed by objective response rate (ORR) using RECIST 1.1
      criteria.

      PAC-1 in combination with nivolumab: The MTD will be determined using a modified-Fibonacci
      dose-escalation 3+3 design.

      This pilot study will evaluate nivolumab in combination with PAC-1 in subjects with
      metastatic RCC. Nivolumab will be delivered by IV infusion on Day 1 and PAC-1 will be taken
      orally on Days 1-28 of each 28-day cycle, and response will be evaluated after every 2
      cycles. Treatment will continue until disease progression (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria),
      unacceptable toxicity, subject refusal, or subject death either from progression of disease,
      the therapy itself, or from other causes. Subjects who voluntarily stop the study, have
      progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicities will be followed for survival every 3 months
      for 12 months from start of study medication

If patient remains on study and has no dose limiting toxicities, then in third cycle, dose will be escalated to 750 mg and continue in following cycles, if no dose adjustment is needed because of toxicities.
