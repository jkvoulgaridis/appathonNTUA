  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will seek to determine if surgical patients do better or the same if participants
      undergo pre-operative counseling for elective laparoscopic same day surgery. The study
      hypothesizes that patients who receive a pre-operative education booklet and a phone call
      from a surgical registered nurse, compared to the current standard of care, will have higher
      satisfaction with regard to participants' surgical experience, decrease in the number of
      post-operative phone calls, decrease in the number of opioid medications, and decrease in the
      number of emergency department visits. The importance of this study is to understand what
      surgical clinical practices can do in the pre-operative setting to enhance a surgical
      patient's recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade there has been an increasing focus on the patient's pre-operative,
      operative and post operative experience to help patient's in participants' recovery. For
      example, the surgical community has focused on pathways such as Enhanced Recovery After
      Surgery (ERAS), to improve patient's outcome and surgical experience. Despite this emphasis,
      little has been described in the literature as to how surgeons can improve a patient's
      experience by counseling participants on what participants can expect before, during, and
      after the surgery.

    <description>All subjects in the 'education booklet and preoperative' arm will receive the current standard Johns Hopkins Community Physicians Surgery packet and the Patient Information Booklet, specific to participants' surgery. Those subjects randomized to the 'education booklet and preoperative' arm will receive a pre-operative phone call by the research study's lead nurse, Catherine Davidson, approximately 1 week after participants enroll in the study. She will review pre-operative and post-operative guidelines pertinent to participants' operative as outlined in the patient information booklet. The amount of time (in minutes) that this phone call takes will be recorded in an excel file sheet.</description>
