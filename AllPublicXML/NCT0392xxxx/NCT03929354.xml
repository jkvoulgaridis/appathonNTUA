  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study randomises patients with patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, to be
      managed either by providing an intensive 12-week lifestyle modification programme, or
      standard healthcare.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and acquired disability
      globally. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 30% of total global deaths are
      due to CVD, and approximately 6 million deaths result from cerebrovascular disease.

      A common cause of cerebrovascular disease is internal carotid artery stenosis. Despite recent
      advances in carotid artery revascularisation, risk factor modification remains the
      cornerstone of therapy for this devastating disease. According to the European Society of
      Cardiology (ESC), the lifestyle risk factors for vascular diseases include; cigarette
      smoking, physical inactivity, increased body mass index, and unhealthy diet, and stress,
      while the medical risk factors include; High blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and
      hyperlipidaemia. All these factors have been identified in several studies as significant
      modifiable risk factors that should be targeted for preventing morbidity and mortality
      resulting from cerebrovascular disease.

      Previous studies indicated that modifiable risk factor programmes can help cardiac patients
      to achieve their risk factor modification targets. However, to date there do not seem to be
      any studies assessing the outcomes of a multidisciplinary risk factor modification programme
      in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Our study will evaluate the impact of an intensive
      12-week, multidisciplinary risk factors modification programme on medical and lifestyle risk
      factors modification, as well as on risk reduction for stroke and cardiovascular events,
      among patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. We will compare these outcomes to
      that of standard care traditionally provided to this high-risk patient group.

    <description>Assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at enrolment and after one year.
The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a validated 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment, patient's orientation, attention, memory, language, and visual-spatial skills.
The maximum score is 30 points (out of 30). Any score greater than or equal to 24 points (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (≤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-23 points) cognitive impairment. Moderate to low scores correlate closely with the presence of dementia. A version of the MMSE questionnaire can be found on the British Columbia Ministry of Health website.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Dartmouth Cooperative Information Project (COOP) charts at enrolment and after one year.
The COOP charts measure six core aspects of functional status: physical fitness, feelings, daily activities, social activities, change in health, pain, and overall health. The instrument consists of six charts, referring to the above mentioned aspects of functioning. Each chart consists of a simple title, a question referring to the status of the patient and an ordinal five-point response scale illustrated with a simple drawing.
Each item is rated on this five-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (no limitation at all) to 5 (severely limited); for 'change in health' score 1 means 'much better' and score 5 'much worse'. The designers do not advocate summing the responses to gain a single index ﬁgure of health status.</description>

    <description>Patients in the intervention arm will attend the 12-week intensive lifestyle programme which includes healthy lifestyle change such as smoking cessation, healthy food choices and increasing physical activity levels, as well as management of cholesterol, diabetes, and blood pressure.
The 12-week programme will consist of 12 sessions of 2.5 hours each per week.
Each of the weekly sessions will incorporate an individualised meeting between the multidisciplinary healthcare team and each patient to review the progress and health goals.
The weekly sessions will also include a one-hour group exercise programme and an educational workshop.</description>
