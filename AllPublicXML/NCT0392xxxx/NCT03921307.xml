    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of laboratory and
      chairside fabricated monolithic anterior and posterior LDGC CAD/CAM crowns performed by
      predoctoral students at the University of Toronto and the effect of different patient and
      provider-related factors on their longevity and to compare them to the metal-ceramic (MC)
      crowns. A sample of LDGC CAD/CAM crowns (IPS e.max, Ivoclar Vivadent) provided by predoctoral
      students was evaluated. Crown preparations were made according to the specific criteria and
      were milled in-house using the CEREC bluecam and Omnicam systems. Crowns were cemented with
      Rely-X Unicem (3M/ESPE) and Calibra Universal (Dentsply Sirona) resin cements. Clinical
      assessment of the crowns and supporting periodontal structures was performed following the
      modified California Dental Association (CDA) criteria. Intra-oral photographs, periapical and
      bitewing radiographs were taken for further assessment by two evaluators. Two-hundred and
      fifty-one patients with 275 crowns were examined with a follow-up period of up to 6 years.

      The clinical success of the monolithic Lithium-disilicate Glass-ceramic (LDGC) crowns
      manufactured with computer-aided design (CAD) / computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technology
      provided by predoctoral students was not investigated. Thus, the purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the clinical performance of laboratory and chairside fabricated monolithic anterior
      and posterior LDGC CAD/CAM crowns performed by predoctoral students at the University of
      Toronto and the effect of different patient and provider-related factors on their longevity
      and to compare them to the metal-ceramic (MC) crowns. A sample of LDGC CAD/CAM crowns (IPS
      e.max, Ivoclar Vivadent) provided by predoctoral students was evaluated. Crown preparations
      were made according to the specific criteria and were milled in-house using the CEREC bluecam
      and Omnicam systems. Crowns were cemented with Rely-X Unicem (3M/ESPE) and Calibra Universal
      (Dentsply Sirona) resin cements. Clinical assessment of the crowns and supporting periodontal
      structures was performed following the modified California Dental Association (CDA) criteria.
      Intra-oral photographs, periapical and bitewing radiographs were taken for further assessment
      by two evaluators. Two-hundred and fifty-one patients with 275 crowns were examined with a
      follow-up period of up to 6 years. Part 1 evaluated the performance of laboratory-fabricated
      LDGC CAD/CAM crowns. Part 2 evaluated the performance of chairside LDGC CAD/CAM crowns. Forty
      crowns were evaluated. Part 3 evaluated the performance of LDGC CAD/CAM and MC crowns using
      split-mouth design. A total of 25 patients and 50 crowns (25 crowns for each group) were
      examined.
