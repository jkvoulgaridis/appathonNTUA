  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses about the corneal
      ectatic disease Keratoconus based on data obtained from Keratoconus patients in the Homburg
      Keratoconus Center (HKC).

      The Homburg Keratoconus Center (HKC) was founded in 2010 and, up to now, comprises more than
      1.200 Keratoconus patients. Topographic, tomographic and biomechanic characteristics of the
      disease are being analyzed with the intention to elucidate how the disease begins and
      develops during lifetime.
