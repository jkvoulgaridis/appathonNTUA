      1. Determine the rate and incidence of peri-operative &amp; post-operative adverse events
           (complications, infections, re-operations, re-admissions) in the endoscopic approach for
           the treatment of SIJ arthropathy and chronic lower back pain (CLBP).

        2. Determine the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) using EQ-5D scale, VAS (Visual
           Analog Scale) &amp; ODI (Oswestry Disability Index), outcomes following the endoscopic
           approach for the treatment of SIJ arthropathy and chronic lower back pain (CLBP) (pre-
           to post-operative changes).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) that lasts for more than six months is estimated to occur in
      60-80% of the general population in their lifetime and is associated with substantial
      healthcare costs. The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) complex is one of the major sources of CLBP,
      accounting for around 10-33% of the total number of CLBP cases. The SIJ complex consists of
      the joint capsule, synovia, various muscles and ligamentous structures overlying the join and
      neuronal structures that innervate the SIJ. Current interventional and surgical treatment
      options for SIJ complex mediated CLBP include intraarticular and periarticular injection of
      the joint, SIJ fusion and radio frequency ablation (RFA) of the neuronal structures
      innervating the SIJ. The described interventional procedures are simple procedures and
      provides quick pain relief, but the effect is short-lived. In addition, SIJ fusion is an
      invasive surgical procedure that should be reserved for refractory intractable pain of the
      SIJ1.

      New endoscopic electrothermic ablation of the SIJ capsula, synovial and neuronal structures
      have been utilized in the treatment of facetogenic CLBP in a few number of clinical reports
      with favorable results, but to our knowledge, the efficacy of this technique when applied to
      SIJ-associated CLBP has not been reported. In this study, the investigators will utilize
      endoscopy for the precise microsurgical and ablation (ESIJ) of the potential pain generators
      associated with the SIJ and evaluate the clinical efficacy of this new technique.

    <description>5 Question Health Questionnaire: patient's rate their mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression developed by Euroqol Research Foundation.
Each of the 5 dimensions comprising the EQ-5D descriptive system is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems:
Dimension 1: Mobility Dimension 2: Self-Care Dimension 3: Usual Activities Dimension 4: Pain/Discomfort Dimension 5: Anxiety/Depression
Level 1: indicating no problem Level 2: indicating slight problems Level 3: indicating moderate problems Level 4: indicating severe problems Level 5: indicating extreme problems
A total of 3,125 possible health states is defined in this way. Each state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code.
Lowest Score: 11111 (No problems on any of the 5 dimensions) Highest Score: 55555 (Extreme problems on all of the 5 dimensions)</description>

    <description>New techniques have been developed and tested to expand the usefulness of minimally invasive spine surgery beyond disk herniation. This includes endoscopic electrothermic ablation which can be used to target SIJ-associated CLBP. A small retrospective study demonstrated significant improvements in Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index from pre-operative levels in patients with CLBP associated with the SIJ for up to 21 months following the procedure. However, there has not yet been a prospective study to assess the efficacy of this procedure, and therefore, this is the aim of this study.</description>
