      The purpose of this trial is to collect clinical outcomes including radiographic and CT
      outcomes in patients who undergo interbody spinal fusion using the EVOS Lumbar Interbody
      System.

      This prospective, non-comparative, multi-center, post-market trial will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the PEEK-OPTIMA™ HA Enhance Interbody Cages System - EVOS- HA in patients
      suffering from degenerative disc disease and spondylolisthesis in the lumbar spine. The trial
      will capture clinical outcomes, radiographic and CT outcomes over a 24 month period post
      operatively. Two centers will be involved in the recruitment of 30 patients. All patients
      will be drawn from clinics which focus on this type of treatment.

    <time_frame>pre-operatively, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire SF-12 collection of questions health related to assess vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, emotional and physical functioning, social and mental health. Patients will pick from a set list of answers for each health related question. The responses on each item are scored and summarized into Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) and range from 0 to 100. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>Questionnaire ODI ( Oswestry Disability Index) - disability questionnaire uses to assess functional impairment of the patient. Regarding lifting, ability to walk, sit, stand sleep, travel graded by score of 0-100 (0 = no disability and 100- maximum disability possible)</description>
