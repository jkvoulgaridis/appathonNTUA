  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RHAPSODY-plus project consists of two parts. In a first step carers of people with young
      onset dementia (YOD; onset before the age of 65) have the opportunity to use the RHAPSODY
      online program (Kurz et al., 2016) to inform themselves about different topics on young onset
      dementia. In a second step the participants will receive two individual counseling sessions
      via MEET (online videoconferencing) with a social worker and a psychologist. Goal is to
      investigate whether these counseling sessions have an additional benefit.

      RHAPSODY-plus is a joint project of the Technische Universität München, Zentrum für kognitive
      Störungen and the Melbourne University. The project consists of two parts. In a first step
      carers of people with young onset dementia (YOD; onset before the age of 65) have the
      opportunity to use the RHAPSODY online program (Kurz et al., 2016) for four weeks. This
      e-learning program focuses on managing problem behaviors, dealing with role change, obtaining
      support, and looking after oneself. In a second step the participants will receive two
      individual counseling sessions via MEET (online videoconferencing). In a first session carers
      can talk with a social worker about individual problems concerning social, financial and
      legal issues. In a second session with a psychologist personal and emotional problems can be
      addressed. These two sessions are about 60 minutes. The study investigates whether these
      counseling sessions have an additional benefit. The primary aim is to determine whether the
      intervention is considered acceptable and useful by the participants. Secondary aim is to
      investigate whether the intervention is feasible. The sample size will be determined when
      data saturation is reached (no new themes emerge from the qualitative data at the final
      feedback session). From previous experiences with pilot studies using qualitative methods we
      expect this to be achieved with approximately 20 participants. This number of participants
      should also ensure that a diverse group of carers is participating in this pilot study (both
      genders; different age groups, types of relatives; diagnoses (both FTD and AD) for care
      recipients; environments (city versus rural); socioeconomic status; and carer stressors
      (carers with children, carers who hold a job, carers with different stressors, etc.).
