  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) tools have improved survival and quality of life
      (QoL) of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, and in the follow-up of lung cancer
      patients. Current study investigates electronic patient reported outcome tool in the
      follow-up of cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

      Current study aims to evaluate 1) patient reported symptoms and their severity, 2) Number of
      triggered alerts by the tool and their correlation to treatment side-effects, cancer
      progression, other medical events or survival, 3) Correlation between different symptoms and
      the correlation of symptoms to treatment side-effects, cancer progression, other medical
      events or survival,4) QoL of patients and correlation of changes in QoL to treatment
      side-effects, cancer progression, other medical events or survival, 5) Patient compliance, 6)
      Correlation of baseline laboratory values to treatment side-effects, cancer progression,
      other medical events or survival.

    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life according to QLQ-C30 Summary scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, and at 4, 8, and 12weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation of the Summary score of QLQ-C30 to treatment side-effects, cancer progression, or other medical events or survival.
The Core Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) is a validated cancer health-related quality-of-life questionnaire that includes five function domains (physical, emotional, social, role, cognitive), eight symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, and appetite loss), as well as global health/quality of life and financial impact. Subjects respond on a four-point-scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot; for most items. Raw scores are linearly converted to a 0-100 scale. For the functioning scales and global QoL higher scores indicate better functioning; for the symptom scales higher scores indicate higher symptom burden. The summary score of QLQ-C30 is calculated from the mean of 13 of 15 QLQ-C30 scales (the Global Quality of Life scale and the Financial Impact scale are not included).</description>
