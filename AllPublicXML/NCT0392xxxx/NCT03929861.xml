      Primary Objective: To compare the bioavailability of a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg
      capsules (Test product) with the bioavailability of a single dose of Diflucan™ capsules, 150
      mg (Reference) administered under fasting conditions in order to assess bioequivalence
      Secondary Objectives: To assess safety and tolerability in form of adverse events and
      clinical parameters (systolic/diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature,
      physical examination, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory testing, and overall
      tolerability) and to assess further pharmacokinetic parameters of fluconazole
