      Main Study Up to 100 subjects, both non-CF volunteers and Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients, will
      participate in a single study visit that will include a DEXA scan, micro CT, and blood
      collection.

      Denosumab (Prolia) Sub study Approximately 50 adult subjects with CF who participated in the
      main study and have results indicating bone disease will receive treatment with Denosumab for
      up to 5 years. They will be asked to return annually for repeat DEXA scans, micro CT, and
      blood collection.

Change in BV/TV and cortical thickness will be taken to indicate increased/decreased bone mass accrual by microCT.</description>

    <description>Approximately 50 subjects with CF that have completed the main study and have results which indicate bone disease are eligible to participate in the sub study. Subjects who consent will receive treatment with denosumab (60 mg/ml via subcutaneous injection in the upper arm, upper thigh, or abdomen every 6 months) for up to 5 years. These subjects will be asked to return every 6 months for injections and annually (+/- 6 months) for up to 5 years for a DEXA scan, micro CT, and blood collection.</description>
