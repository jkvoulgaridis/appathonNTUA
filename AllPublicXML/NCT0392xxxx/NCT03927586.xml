  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine: (1) the effects of combined physical exercise and
      cognitive training versus exercise or cognitive training alone on cognition, physical
      function, daily function, quality of life and social participation outcomes, (2) determine
      the relative effects of simultaneous vs. sequential combination of physical exercise and
      cognitive training on these health-related outcomes, (3) determine the long-term effects of
      different types of trainings on these outcome measures.

    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or minor neurocognitive disorder involves problems with
      memory, executive function and language. The age-adjusted prevalence of MCI in Taiwan is
      approximately 18%. The progression rate from MCI to dementia ranges from 10 to 15% each year,
      and over 50% of the MCI population will develop into severe cognitive impairment or dementia
      in five years. Early detection and intervention of the individuals with MCI may help delay or
      prevent progress from MCI to dementia, and reduce the burden of their caregivers and the
      medical expenses of the health-care system. Whilst numerous studies have established the
      potential benefits of cognitive or physical exercise training on cognition for individuals
      with MCI, some recent studies suggested that combining physical exercise and cognitive
      training may augment the intervention effects. Also, different combination methods -
      combining physical exercise and cognitive training either sequentially or simultaneously
      under a dual-task paradigm may impose differential cognitive challenges on the participants,
      and it is yet not clear which combination strategy has better training effects.

    <measure>Change scores of Verbal fluency test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 36 intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal fluency tests will be used to evaluate the semantic memory of the participants. The participants will be instructed to say as many words as possible from a given category (i.e., fruit or animal) in one minute. The validity, reliability, and normative performance of verbal fluency tests have been well-established (Harrison, Buxton, Husain, &amp; Wise, 2000).</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Wechsler Memory Scale - Third Edition (WMS-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 36 intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the WMS-III subtests, including Faces Recognition, Verbal Paired Associates, Word Lists, and Spatial Span to assess the immediate, delayed, and working memory tests. The Faces Recognition test involves 24 pictures of human faces. The participants will be required to look through the faces one by one, and later recognize those faces. For the Verbal Paired Associates test, the instructor will read out eight-word pairs for the participant to memorize. The participants will be asked to respond to the appropriate word that matches the test word. In the Word Lists test, the instructor will read out 12 words in a list and the participants will need to repeat as many words as they could immediately and 25-35 minutes after. As for the Spatial Span test, the instructor will point to spatially located blocks in a sequential order; the participants will then touch the blocks either in the same sequential order or in a reversed order.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Third Edition (WAIS-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 36 intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The WAIS-III is developed to measure an individual's intelligence level. It includes tests that evaluate cognitive functions in verbal comprehension, working memory, perceptual organization, and processing speed. The subtests that we will use are the Digit Symbol-Coding and Matrix Reasoning tests. The Digit Symbol-Coding test consists of 9 digit-symbol pairs and the participants will be asked to write down the corresponding symbols for the given digits on the test sheet as accurately and as fast as possible. As for the Matrix Reasoning test, the participants will need to logically solve missing puzzles within given matrixes. The test result of the Matrix Reasoning test indicates a general intelligence level because it entails the abilities of visual-spatial reasoning, abstract reasoning, visual organization, and visuospatial information processing.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Stroop Color-Word test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 36 intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Color-Word assesses the abilities of selective attention, inhibition and executive function. The participants will be tested under congruent and incongruent conditions. In the congruent condition, the participant will name the color ink of a word which is consistent with the written color name; whereas in the incongruent condition the participant will name the color ink differs from the written color name. The time to complete the task will be calculated for each condition (Koss, Ober, Delis, &amp; Friedland, 1984; Ridley, Johnson, &amp; Braisted, 1978).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Dual-task test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 36 intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The dual-task test evaluates the ability to shift attention between one task and another. Participants will sit and perform the box and block test (BBT) or walk 10 meters while doing secondary cognitive or motor tasks. Two cognitive secondary tasks will be performed by the participants: (1) arithmetic task: participants will be asked to perform serial subtractions by 7 starting from 100 or random two-digit numbers (e.g., Baetens et al., 2013); (2) tone discrimination task: participants will be presented a number of low and high-pitched tones and they will respond to either the high or low-pitched tones during the trial. Both cognitive task performances will be recorded and the results will be compared to single cognitive task performance. In addition to the cognitive dual-task, participants will perform a motor task (e.g., holding a cup of water) while walking.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Timed up and go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 36 intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG assesses the dynamic balance ability and mobility. The participants will be required to stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The time to complete the TUG test has been shown to be a good indicator to detect potential fallers in frail elderly (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991). The test-retest reliability of TUG on individuals with cognitive impairment was excellent (Blankevoort, van Heuvelen, &amp; Scherder, 2013).</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Sit-to-stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post test immediately after completing 36 intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline), follow up test (6 months after completing intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The 30 second sit-to-stand will be assessed to indicate the strength and endurance level of the lower extremities. The participants will be asked to stand up from a standardized chair and then sit down as many times as possible within 30 seconds. The feasibility and reliability of using sit-to-stand test in people with cognitive impairment have been established to be good (Blankevoort et al., 2013).</description>
