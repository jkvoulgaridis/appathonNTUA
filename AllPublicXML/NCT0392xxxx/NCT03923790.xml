  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot trial is to compare post-stroke care blood pressure (BP) treatment
      using an interdisciplinary telehealth model [called the Stroke Telemedicine Outpatient
      Program (STOP) for Blood Pressure Reduction] to usual care in stroke patients at risk for
      uncontrolled BP. The intervention will address general and stroke-related factors associated
      with racial disparities in BP control. We will assess feasibility of implementation of the
      trial and will use the measures and outcomes assessed in the pilot to examine knowledge gaps.

    <description>Pharmacist evaluates patient prior to discharge and a nurse navigator contacts patient 72 hours after discharge. Patient receives educational packet and a blue tooth enabled BP monitor with an iPad. A video telehealth visit occurs 7 days after discharge attended by a nurse practitioner (NP) or MD , social worker (SW), and pharmacist. The NP and pharmacist review the BP data to determine the need for medication adjustment. The SW assesses the need for resources. BP is reviewed via an online portal every 2 weeks until average BP is &lt; 130/80mmHg, then monthly. Uncontrolled BP prompts a call from the pharmacist to discuss medication adherence and titration. Subsequent video telehealth visits occur 1 month, 3 months, and 5 months after enrollment.</description>

    <description>A stroke prevention trained nurse practitioner or MD or social worker will review the participant's hospital records and depression, dietary, and sleep apnea screens,will reinforce the care plan based on patient-specific needs.They will counsel patients on salt reduction, the Mediterranean diet, and the importance of diet and exercise for stroke prevention.Along with the pharmacist they will also review the BP data to determine the need for medication adjustment and will discuss the side effects and interactions.The social worker will assess the need for medication assistance and other resources. The care plan will be shared with primary care providers (PCP)and patients will be referred to a PCP if they do not have one. The social worker will also will assist uninsured patients in applying for Texas County Indigent Care programs.</description>
