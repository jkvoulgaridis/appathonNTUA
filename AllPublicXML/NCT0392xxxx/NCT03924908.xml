  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different non-pharmacological techniques, including hypnosis and virtual reality are
      currently used as complementary tools in the treatment of pain related to burn injury. A new
      technique called 'virtual reality hypnosis' (VRH) (Patterson et al., 2004), which encompasses
      a combination of both tools, is regularly used although its actual function remains unknown
      to this date. With the goal to improve our understanding of VRH combination effects, it is
      necessary to elaborate randomized and controlled research studies in order to understand
      their actual function in individual's perception. 100 patients who are treated as outpatients
      for burn care will be randomly assigned to virtual reality or VRH. Patients will receive one
      session of one of these techniques during burn dressing change.Physiological parameters will
      be recorded during dressing change. Participants will fill in a questionnaire evaluating
      their tendency to be absorbed and dissociated, and another evaluating their level of
      perceived immersion. Their level of anxiety, pain, fatigue and relaxation will be evaluated
      before and after the session. A short interview will also be conducted to give participants
      the opportunity to openly describe their experience.

    <description>Absorption will be measured as the two components of hypnosis. We will measure absorption and dissociation using the Visual Analogical Scales (VAS). VAS is from 0 to 10. 0 is not absorbed and 10 is really absorbed. When responding to a VAS item, participants will be asked to specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>
