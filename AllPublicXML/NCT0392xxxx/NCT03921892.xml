  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility and acceptability study will compare in-person to web-based parenting
      education for adolescent fathers on the outcomes of parenting confidence and participation in
      parenting activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized feasibility and acceptability study using a block generator for
      randomization of participants aged 15 to 21 into either in-person parenting education or
      on-line parenting. Outcome measures include parenting self-efficacy and participation in
      daily parenting activities. Participants will take part in approximately twelve hours of
      parenting education, whether in-person or on-line. Recruitment flyers will be placed in two
      primary care clinics and a large regional hospital's Labor &amp; Delivery and Postpartum
      (Mother-Baby) Units. Participants will seek out the opportunity to participate by calling the
      phone number or sending an e-mail to the investigators to learn more about the study and
      their potential participation. If participants meet eligibility criteria and elect to
      participate, baseline measurements will be completed after enrollment, with follow-up
      measures at one month and two months.
