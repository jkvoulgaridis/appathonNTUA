  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this sub-study is to use positron emission tomography and computed tomography
      imaging (PET/CT) with an investigational drug called [11C] acetate to see if inflammation in
      patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) can cause changes in blood flow and
      oxygen use in the heart. This study may help physicians better understand how to treat
      patients diagnosed with ADHF in the future.
