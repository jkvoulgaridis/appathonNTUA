  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) trial of 177Lu-DOTA-OCTREOTATE in
      children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and
      pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT)
      using 177Lu-DOTA-OCTREOTATE given intravenously in children is an effective treatment and to
      describe its toxicities.

      This study will consists of two groups:

      Group A - children age 18 months to 18 years with relapsed or refractory neuroendocrine
      tumors and pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.

      Group B - children age 6 months to 18 years with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.

    <description>Six subjects in each group will have whole body imaging and SPECT/CT of kidneys performed at 3-8 hours plus whole body and SPECT at 20-28 hours, 44-52 hours, 92-100 hours and 116-124 hours after the administration of the radiopharmaceutical. Data will be analyzed using method of Madsen[1,2]. Single point dosimetry will be utilized with subsequent cohorts if data demonstrates agreement with adult dosimetry. Biological effective dose (BED) to kidneys will be calculated according to Bodei et al [3].
The information on renal uptake, renal mass and residence time will be entered into OLINDA software to calculate the radiation dose. If single point dosimetry proves to be accurate, any remaining Phase I subjects and all Phase II subjects will receive single point dosimetry for both renal and bone marrow radiation dose estimation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease not amenable to standard treatment (nonresectable or disease present after one
             or more surgeries and/or Sandostatin treatment) or subject has failed existing first
             line chemotherapy, biologic therapy, targeted agent therapy or radiation therapy.

          -  Participation in Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry.

          -  A pathologically confirmed (histology or cytology) Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET),
             Neuroblastoma (NB), Pheochromocytoma (PCC), or Paraganglioma (PGL).

          -  For patients with measurable or evaluable disease: &gt;50% of lesions must demonstrate
             68Ga- DOTATATE uptake greater than physiologic liver uptake by visual assessment. At
             least one lesion must be confirmed by conventional imaging (CT or MRI).

          -  For patients with measurable disease, the target lesion is one that either has never
             received external beam radiation or has been previously irradiated and has since
             demonstrated progression.

          -  For patients with no measurable disease (no measurable target lesions), who have
             evaluable disease (bone disease, MIBG positive disease, liver metastases not
             detectable on MRI or CT), the disease must be seen on 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT.

          -  For patients with neuroblastoma, If the patient has only one MIBG positive lesion and
             that lesion was radiated, a biopsy or 18FDG PET scan must be done at least 28 days
             after radiation was completed and must show viable neuroblastoma. Such a lesion is not
             sufficient for eligibility if no lesions are positive for 68Ga- DOTATATE PET/CT.

          -  No previous endogenous radiation with 177Lu-DOTATATE/TOC or 90Y-DOTATATE/TOC within 12
             months of most recent treatment. Previous treatment must be limited to ≤40 Gy
             biologically effective dose (BED) to kidneys and ≤2 Gy to bone marrow; hematopoietic
             stem cells (HSC) ≥2X106 CD34+ cells/kg must be available if &gt;2 Gy prior exposure to

               -  The effects of 177Lu-DOTATATE on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
                  reason and because Class C agents are known to be teratogenic, all subjects
                  capable of becoming pregnant must agree to practice a medically acceptable birth
                  control measure (abstinence, birth control pills, intrauterine devices, vaginal
                  diaphragm, vaginal sponge, or condom with spermicidal jelly) throughout the study
                  and for eight months following the end of the last treatment. Should a woman
                  become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
                  should inform her treating physician immediately.

               -  Parent's ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
                  consent document for children ≤7 years of age. Children ≥7 years of age will sign
                  assent along with parental consent or will co-sign consent with parent in
                  accordance with rules of the state in which treatment is received.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 177Lu-DOTATATE is a Class C agent
             with potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with 177Lu-DOTATATE, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued until 3 months after the last administration of study drug.

          -  Major surgery within 8 weeks of study drug administration.

          -  External beam radiation to both kidneys (scatter doses of &lt;500 cGy to a single kidney

          -  Concurrent, malignant disease for which patient is on active therapy.

          -  Another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition which is currently
             uncontrolled by treatment and which would likely affect the subject's ability to
             complete this protocol.

          -  Subjects who have received Sandostatin LAR or long-acting lanreotide in the past 28
             days must be appropriately delayed. Subjects may be maintained on short acting
             octreotide during the time from last injection of long-acting somatostatin analogue
             until 18-24 hrs prior to injection of study drug.

          -  Known antibodies to Octreotide, Lanreotide, or DOTATATE or history of allergic
             reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to
             177Lu-DOTATATE.

          -  Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection,
             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, hepatic cirrhosis or severe impairment, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Corticosteroids: Patients receiving corticosteroids who have not been on a stable or
             decreasing dose of corticosteroid for at least 7 days prior to enrollment are not
             eligible. If used to modify immune adverse events related to prior therapy, ≥ 14 days
             must have elapsed since last dose of corticosteroid

          -  Patients who have received a prior solid organ transplantation are not eligible

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have a known allergy to any of the drugs used in the
             study

          -  Prior Therapy:

               -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anti-cancer agents known to be myelosuppressive.
                  At least 21 days after the last dose of cytotoxic or myelosuppressive
                  chemotherapy (42 days if prior nitrosourea).

               -  Anti-cancer agents not known to be myelosuppressive (e.g. not associated with
                  reduced platelet or ANC counts): ≥ 7 days after the last dose of agent.

               -  Antibodies: ≥ 21 days must have elapsed from infusion of last dose of antibody,

                  growth factor (e.g. Peg-Filgrastim) or 7 days for short-acting growth factor. For
                  agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after
                  administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse
                  events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with
                  the study chair and the study-assigned Research Coordinator.
