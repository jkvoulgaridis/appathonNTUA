    <measure>Change from baseline in weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is to characterize the dose-response relationship of LOU064 administered once or twice daily in subjects with CSU with respect to change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 4.
The UAS7 is the sum of the HSS7 score (weekly Hives Severity Sore) and the ISS7 score (weekly Itch Severity Score). The possible range of the weekly UAS7 score is 0 - 42 (highest activity).</description>

    <measure>Complete absence of hives and itch (UAS7=0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over time from week 1 to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The UAS7 is the sum of the HSS7 score (weekly Hives Severity Sore) and the ISS7 score (weekly Itch Severity Score). The possible range of the weekly UAS7 score is 0 - 42 (highest activity).
A complete absence of hives and itches over a week is defined as UAS7=0.</description>

    <measure>Disease control (UAS7&lt;=6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over time from week 1 to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The UAS7 is the sum of the HSS7 score (weekly Hives Severity Sore) and the ISS7 score (weekly Itch Severity Score). The possible range of the weekly UAS7 score is 0 - 42 (highest activity).
Disease control is defined as UAS7&lt;=6.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative number of weeks with an AAS7=0 response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The AAS is a validated tool to assess occurrence of episodes of angioedema. If the subject reports the occurrence of angioedema (&quot;opening question&quot;) with &quot;no&quot;, AAS score for this day is 0. If &quot;yes&quot; is the answer to the opening question, the subject will continue to answer questions about the duration, severity and impact on daily functioning and appearance of the angioedema. The AAS7 is a weekly AAS score (AAS7). Minimum and maximum possible AAS7 scores are 0−105. Higher score means higher severity.</description>

    <measure>DLQI score of 0 or 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a 10-item dermatology-specific quality of life (QoL) measure. Subjects rate their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives thinking about the previous 7 days. An overall score is calculated and ranges from 0 to 30 (higher score meaning worse disease-related QoL). A DLQI score of 0 or 1 means that there is no impact of a skin disease on the patient's life.</description>
