  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients are often given the choice of delaying or avoiding treatment as one of their
      options. However, there is not much information guiding lung cancer patients and their
      clinicians regarding this approach. Active surveillance is a way of either delaying or
      avoiding treatment and its possible side effects through carefully watching for changes in
      the tumor and considering treatment if there is progression. The purpose of this research
      study is to evaluate active surveillance and ways to better understand if and when to treat
      patients with stage IA lung cancer.

      The University of Vermont Medical Center is looking at determining if active surveillance is
      a viable option for low risk lung cancer patients. Currently, the National Cancer Care
      Network (NCCN) guidelines recommends considering stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR)
      for patients not well enough for surgery, which is generally well tolerated, but it's also
      been shown to cause significant worsening of shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and in
      extreme cases, death. Investigators are using this pilot study as a means to determine
      outcomes for patients who choose an active surveillance approach. This information could
      change future conversations between doctor and patient regarding treatment options, giving
      patients the choice to choose radiation therapy or to delay treatment by taking an active
      surveillance approach.

      Investigators have published outcomes for 12 elderly patients with stage IA lung cancer who
      had chosen the active surveillance approach, reserving radiation therapy for when rapid tumor
      growth was determined (PMID 30648024). The clinical outcomes were similar to those expected
      if treatment had been provided, and at two years from the time the tumor was found almost
      half the patients were able to avoid getting radiation.

      By deciding to participate in this study, patients are agreeing to postpone their treatment
      for an active surveillance approach while continuing with a computed tomography (CT) scan
      regimen to follow tumor growth. Once their tumor size is determined there are parameters in
      place to decide when patients should consider radiation. These parameters are based on speed
      of tumor growth over time and tumor size.

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators propose a study involving active surveillance for NSCLC where patients would have consideration of SABR if either the tumor exceeded 3 cm in size or the volume doubling time (VDT) decreased to &lt;400 days. Following enrollment, chest CT with contrast (with slice thickness ≤3 mm) to be performed 3 months (+/- 30 days) after the initial CT]. Patients with VDTs &lt;400 days must be considered for SABR. SABR is not mandatory [patient choice] and active surveillance may be continued. Patients with VDTs ≥400 days continue active surveillance via serial CTs with intervals of every 3 months (+/- 30 days) up to 2 years total.
Following informed consent, blood samples will be acquired following the protocol schedule based on enrollment group. Quality of life questionnaires will also be completed following the protocol schedule for the main cohort only.</intervention_model_description>
