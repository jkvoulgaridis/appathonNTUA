  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates role of calf muscle function for gait performance, balance and knee
      joint loading.

      Previous studies have linked age-related loss of calf muscle function with impairments in
      gait performance and balance, and increased loading of the areas of knee joint that are
      susceptible for development of osteoarthritis. In this study, an exercise intervention is
      used to target structural and neural aspects of impaired calf muscle function with aging. The
      intervention includes 14 weeks of strength training for the calf muscles and training
      sessions to enhance calf function during walking. The study will test whether the
      intervention is effective in improving walking speed, reduce metabolic cost of walking,
      improve standing balance and reduce knee joint loading.

    <intervention_model_description>Thirty older adults will be recruited and randomized into two groups. The other groups receive an intervention including strength training and gait retraining lasting for 14 weeks while the other group serves as a control group without receiving any intervention. At the end, outcome measures are obtained.
A third group consists of 15 young adults. This group does not receive intervention and outcome measures are obtained only at a single time point.</intervention_model_description>
