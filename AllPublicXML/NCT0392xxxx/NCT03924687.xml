  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain has a significant impact on the physical and psychological functioning of those
      living with this condition. It is now recognized that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
      is an effective intervention in managing chronic pain; however, several barriers limit its
      accessibility.

      The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an eight-week bibliotherapy-type
      self-administered psychological intervention with minimal therapeutic contact, based on ACT,
      in the management of chronic pain.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial with two groups (one experimental group and one
      wait-list control group). Participants will be randomly assigned to each condition and
      measures will be taken at pretest, posttest and three months following the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the effectiveness of an
      eight-week self-administered intervention program (bibliotherapy) based on Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy with minimal therapeutic support in the management of chronic pain.

      This study was based on the following hypotheses. In comparison to the control group, from
      pre to post, the self-help program will:

        1. significantly reduce pain-related disability (primary variable);

        2. improve depressive symptoms related to CP (secondary variable);

        3. increase the level of pain acceptance;

        4. reduce psychological inflexibility linked to painful symptoms (process variables).

           It was also expected that:

        5. the improvements would be maintained at three-month follow-up;

        6. participants would have an overall impression of a positive change following the
           intervention.

    <description>Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ-8: Fish, McGuire, Hogan, Morrison, &amp; Stewart 2010). The CPAQ-8 is an 8-item measure that evaluates acceptance of pain according to two sub-scales: activity engagement and pain willingness. Items are rated on a Likert scale from 0 = never true to 6 = always true. Total scores range from 0 to 48 and higher scores reflect greater acceptance of pain.</description>

Scores range from 12 to 84, with higher scores revealing greater psychological inflexibility.</description>
