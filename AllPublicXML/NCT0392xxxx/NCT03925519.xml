      -  Physical exercise for 6 months produced significant improvement in adiponectin, hs-CRP,
           and nitric oxide (NO) and was significantly correlated with adiposity markers, lipid
           profile and glycemic control factors in both obese and non-obese diabetic patients.

        -  Patients with good physical activity reported a significant decrease in BMI, CHD risk
           scores, reduced hs-CRP, an increase in the levels of adiponectin and nitric oxide.

        -  In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, adiposity markers, lipid profile, hs-CRP, and
           adiponectin were significantly improved following moderate exercise interventions

      To elucidate the potential role of exercise as anti-adiposity and anti-cardio protective
      modulates, we thought to investigate the effect of supervised aerobic training of moderate
      intensity on adiposity markers, nitric oxide level, plasma adiponectin, hs-CRP, and its
      association with CHD risk score in obese and non-obese patients with type 2 diabetes.

      Blood samples were obtained from all subjects at 0800 h after an overnight fast before and
      after the training program Venous blood samples (5 mL) were collected into plain tubes, the
      samples were allowed to clot for half an hour following which samples were centrifuged for 15
      minutes at 2000 rpm. Samples were given a coded study identification number and were stored
      frozen at 80°C until analysis.

        Fifty subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for more than 5 years aged 45-70 years were
        invited in the period from 2013 to 2014 to participate in this study. Patients were
        diagnosed according to the criteria of American diabetes association.32 Based on the values
        of BMI, the patients were classified into two groups, obese diabetic group (n= 25, BMI ≥ 30
        kg/m2) and non-obese group (n= 25, BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2).
