      This is a study to demonstrate that pancrelipase Delayed Release (DR) capsules manufactured
      with a Modernized Process (MP) is non-inferior to currently marketed pancrelipase DR capsules
      in participants with EPI due to Cystic Fibrosis (CF), as measured by Coefficient of Fat
      Absorption (CFA). Safety will also be evaluated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a documented diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) confirmed by:

               -  a sweat chloride test &gt;= 60 mmol/L, and/or

               -  documented CF-causing cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
                  mutations and clinical features of CF.

          -  Participant has diagnosis of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI) at screening
             proven by CFA &lt; 70% without Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT)
             supplementation.

          -  Participant has EPI that is currently clinically controlled (no clinically overt
             steatorrhea or diarrhea) under treatment with a commercially available Pancreatic
             Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT), on an individually established dose regimen for
             more than 3 months prior to Screening, with a daily dose not exceeding 4,000 Lipase
             Units (LU)/g fat/day or 10,000 LU/kg/day.

          -  Participant is available for three hospitalization/confinement periods of 6 to 8 days
             each, one during the screening period and two during the expected study window.

          -  Participant is able to consume the 100 g fat/day diet.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI percentile for age less than 10% in participants less than 18 years of age.

          -  Participant has a history of any of the following gastrointestinal disorders (acute
             pancreatitis within 6 months prior to Visit 2, chronic pancreatitis, fibrosing
             colonopathy, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) within 6 months prior to
             Visit 2, C. difficile infection within 6 months prior to Visit 2, celiac disease,
             gastric bypass or partial/total gastrectomy, Crohn's disease or other inflammatory
             bowel disease, small bowel surgery (other than minor resection due to meconium ileus
             without resultant malabsorption syndrome), or any type of malignancy involving the
             digestive tract in the last 5 years).

          -  Participant has a history of any clinically significant endocrine, respiratory (except
             mild asthma or CF related lung disease), neurological, cardiac, renal, hepatic
             (including Hepatitis B or C), hematologic or psychiatric disease or disorder, or any
             other uncontrolled medical illness which might limit participation in or completion of
             the study.

          -  Participant requires concomitant treatment with any medication not allowed by the
             protocol or a prohibited medication is expected to be needed during the study.

          -  Participant is currently receiving nutritional supplementation via tube feeding
             (nasogastric, gastrostomy, jejunostomy).

          -  Participant has clinically significant (as per Investigator's judgment) abnormalities
             in clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis (excluding findings that are
             associated with CF) such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) levels &gt;= 3 times the upper limit of normal values, or
             clinically significant (investigator opinion) elevation of uric acid.
