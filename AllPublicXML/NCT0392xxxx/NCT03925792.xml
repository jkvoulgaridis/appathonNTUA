  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility and efficacy of lifestyle medicine for the
      enhancement of psychological wellness in police officers. The integrative lifestyle
      intervention is based on the &quot;Healthy Body Healthy Mind (HBHM)&quot; programme developed by the
      University of Melbourne. It includes lifestyle psychoeducation, physical activity, nutrition
      and diet, relaxation/ mindfulness, and sleep. These components are weaved with psychological
      elements such as stress management, cognitive restructuring, motivational interviewing, and
      goal setting strategies that are led by clinical psychologists. While lifestyle medicine has
      been recognised for centuries a a mean to improve physical health, the field of lifestyle
      medicine in the context of mental health is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, there is
      increasing evidence demonstrating the efficacy of individual components of lifestyle medicine
      (e.g. diet, physical activities, and sleep) on mood and stress management. With a
      well-researched lifestyle medicine programme adopted from Australia, the research team of the
      Chinese University of Hong Kong has customised the intervention protocol to fit the Chinese
      culture, and has conducted a pilot trial to test the protocol across different communities
      and work populations. The investigators aim to examine the effectiveness of an integration of
      multiple lifestyle adjustments on psychological wellness from a holistic body-mind
      perspective. Acknowledging that police officers are one of hte work populations with
      stressful work nature, it is in a hope that lifestyle medicine would be effective to
      facilitate stress coping and enhance the psychological wellness of police officers in the
      long run.

    <measure>Change in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9, a 20-item questionnaire used for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day).
PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>DASS-21 is a 21-items scales, comprises three sub-scales which measures the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress, over the past week. The DASS is based on a dimensional rather than a categorical conception of psychological disorder, thus it has no direct implications for the allocation of patients to discrete diagnostic categories. However, recommended cutoffs for conventional severity labels (normal, moderate, severe) are given in the DASS Manual.
Depression Anxiety Stress Normal 0-9 0-7 0-14 Mild 10-13 8-9 15-18 Moderate 14-20 10-14 19-25 Severe 21-27 15-19 26-33 Ex. Severe 28+ 20+ 34+</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>ISI is a 7-item scale designed to evaluate perceived insomnia severity. Ratings on the 5-point Likert scale are obtained on the perceived severity of sleep-onset, sleep-maintenance, early morning awakening problems, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeably of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and level of distress caused by the sleep problem.
Total score categories: 0-7 indicates no clinically significant insomnia, 8-14 refers to subthreshold insomnia,15-21 represents clinical insomnia (moderate severity), and 22-28 is clinical insomnia (severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Resilience Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The BRS, originally developed by Smith and colleagues (2008), is a 6-item questionnaire rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores represent higher level of psychological resilience. The Chinese version of the test validated by Lai &amp; Yue (2014) has demonstrated good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha &gt; .72) and were comparable to the original version developed by Smith and colleagues.
Total score divided by 6 and to be categorized: 1.00-2.99 indicates low resilience; 3.00-4.30 indicates normal resilience and 4.31-5.00 indicated high resilience.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form (Six-Dimension) Health Survey (SF-6D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-6D is a preference-based single index measure of health. A six-digit number represents each SF-6D health state, each digit denotes the level of one of six SF-6D dimensions: physical functioning, role limitation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality. The SF-6D index, scores from 0.0 (worst health state) to 1.0 (best health state).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The 52-item HPLPII is composed of a total scale and six subscales to measure behaviors in the theorized dimensions of health-promoting lifestyle: spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, nutrition, physical activity, health responsibility, and stress management.
Items are scored as Never (N) = 1, Sometimes (S)= 2, Often (O) = 3, Routinely (R) = 4 A score for overall health-promoting lifestyle is obtained by calculating a mean of the individual's responses to all 52 items; six subscale scores are obtained similarly by calculating a mean of the responses to subscale items. The use of means rather than sums of scale items is recommended to retain the 1 to 4 metric of item responses and to allow meaningful comparisons of scores across subscales.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>SDS is a brief, 5-item self-report tool that assesses functional impairment in work/school, social life, and family life. Representation of scores in terms of functional impairment: 0: not at all, 1-3: mildly, 4-6: moderately, 7-9: markedly, 10: extremely.</description>
