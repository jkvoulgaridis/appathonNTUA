      The study aim to evaluate the performance of Pure-Vu System in cleansing patients' colon with
      history of inadequate bowel preparation who are indicated for a colonoscopy procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned as a single arm, open trial will include up to 30 patients, aim to
      evaluate the performance of Pure-Vu System in cleansing patients' colon with history of
      inadequate bowel preparation who are indicated for a colonoscopy procedure.

      Subjects will be enrolled at up to 3 clinical sites in Israel. Subjects who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be required to follow a standard bowel preparation instruction.
      Patients will be asked to record and provide their diet and bowel movements in the provided
      diary log at time of their scheduled colonoscopy (Diary log is provided in appendix C) and to
      complete a satisfaction questionnaire include feedback on the procedure and on specific
      aspects related to the preparation regime.

      Following the procedure a telephone follow-up will be conducted at 48 hours (± 48 hours) post
      Pure-Vu procedure to assess patient well-being and capture any adverse events.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Boston Bowel Preparation Scale( BBPS) &gt;1 in All Colon Segments After the Use of Pure-Vu System</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The rating of the cleansing quality was evaluated by using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), Segment score of 0-3 given to each of the 3 segments of the colon (Left side, Transverse and right side):
Score 0- Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared.
Score 1- A portion of the mucosa of the colon segment is seen, but other areas of the colon segment are not seen well due to staining, residual stool, and/or opaque liquid.
Score 2- A minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool, and/or opaque liquid are visible, but the mucosa of the colon segment are seen well.
Score 3-The entire mucosa of the colon segment is seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool, or opaque liquid.

    <description>The Pure-Vu System enables colon cleansing during standard colonoscopy using a standard colonoscope. The cleansing device, which is attached to the tip of the colonoscope and is connected to an external workstation, generates fluid jets within the colon thus dissolving the feces into small parts. The fecal matter &amp; fluids are drained through the evacuation pipe of the cleansing device into a collecting reservoir.</description>

    <description>Pure-Vu System is intended to connect to standard colonoscopes to help facilitate intra-procedural cleaning of a poorly prepared colon by irrigating and/or cleaning the colon and evacuating the irrigation fluid (saline water), feces and other bodily fluids and matter, e.g. blood.</description>
