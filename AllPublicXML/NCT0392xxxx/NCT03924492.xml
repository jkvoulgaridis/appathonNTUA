      This is an expanded access program intended to provide access to ZULRESSO™ (brexanolone)
      injection for the treatment of a limited number of eligible women with postpartum depression
      during the period prior to commercial availability. Requests for access must be made by a
      healthcare provider for a specific patient based on a determination with patient that the
      benefits of treatment outweigh the risks and an assessment of eligibility based on program
      criteria. Sites with eligible patients must apply and meet requirements for participation in
      the expanded access program.
