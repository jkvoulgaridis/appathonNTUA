  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter, Phase III Study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab injection (JS001) or placebo combined with
      chemotherapyin Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Participants with TKI-resistant
      EGFR-mutated Tumors; and evaluate the population with the best predictive biomarkers, i.e.,
      positive diagnosis population.

      About 350 subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with activated EGFR mutation will
      be 1:1 randomized into two groups, JS001 combined with the standard 1st-line chemotherapy
      will be given in the study group whereas placebo combined with standard 1st-line chemotherapy
      will be given in the control group. The stratification will be based on the following
      factors:

      The history of the previous lines of EGFR-TKI treament ( 1st or 2nd line of TKI vs. 3rd line
      of TKI vs. 1st or 2nd line of TKI + 3rd line of TKI) ; Disease stage (IIIB-C vs. IV);
