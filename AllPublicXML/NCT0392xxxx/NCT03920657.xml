  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific rationale for this study is the evolving understanding that iron-induced
      tissue damage is not only a process of progressive bulking of organs through high-volumes
      iron deposition, but also a reactive iron species related &quot;toxic&quot; damage.

      Iron mediated damage can occur prior reaching high iron storage thresholds derived from
      thalassemia major setting, free toxic iron species being already present when transferrin
      saturation &gt;60-70% (25); therefore a timely early adoption of iron chelation may be of
      benefit before overt iron overload is seen.

      Our hypothesis is that early and low dose DFX-FCT is better tolerated and is able to prevent
      iron accumulation and consequently tissue iron related damage, by consistently suppressing
      iron reactive oxygen species (NTBI and LPI).

      If this hypothesis is confirmed this approach could contribute to an improvement of clinical
      practice of patients managements. Additionally this approach might also be a contribute in
      preventing future iron overloaded related complication, in this already frail and co-treated
      patient population.

    <description>The baseline iron status of MDS patients at the beginning of their transfusion story is today unknown. This study is the first unbiased and direct measurement of iron stress and oxidative stress in MDS patients at the beginning of the transfusion story.
Baseline iron status will be described by classical iron markers:
serum ferritin (ng/ml), transferritin saturation (%), liver and pancreas iron concentration by MRI (mg/g dry weight). Total body iron stores will be calculated (mg/kg) with the published formula (N Engl J Med 2000; 343:327-331).
Tissue reactive oxygen species will be measured in the patient's plasma as follows:
non-transferrin bound iron= micromoles/L, Labile Plasma Iron= micromoles/L. Oxidative stress will be measured by Malonildialdehyde (MDA). Levels in plasmas= micromoles/L.</description>

Serum ferritin = ng/ml.
Relationship between suppression of tissue iron species and prevention of iron accumulation (observational study) will be measured by the:
NTBI/LPI values (micromoles/L), Differences end of study - baseline quantitative parameters of iron loading (liver and pancreas iron concentration and total body iron stores).</description>
