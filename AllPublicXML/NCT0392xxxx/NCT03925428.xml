  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of GSK525762C (molibresib besylate)
      and entinostat in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphomas that have spread to other
      parts of the body (advanced) or are not responding to treatment (refractory). GSK525762C and
      entinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. This study may help doctors find out if giving the combination of GSK525762C and
      entinostat is better or worse than the usual approach for treating solid tumors or lymphomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GSK525762C and entinostat in combination
      in patients with advanced and refractory solid tumors and lymphomas based on dose limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) of the combination of GSK525762C and entinostat.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety profile of GSK525762C and entinostat in advanced and refractory
      solid tumors and lymphomas.

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of GSK525762C and entinostat in advanced and
      refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.

      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and
      overall survival (OS) of GSK525762C and entinostat in this patient population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of GSK525762C and entinostat therapy on apoptosis, as measured by an
      apoptosis multiplex immunoassay.

      II. To assess the effect of GSK525762C and entinostat therapy on c-MYC and YAP1 as measured
      by ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression.

      III. To assess the effect of GSK525762C and entinostat therapy on tumor burden and gene
      expression patterns as measured by whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq)
      on circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and molibresib PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

             least 4 weeks after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of
             progression.

          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.

          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac
             function using the New York Heart Association functional classification. To be
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow and retain orally administered medication.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of
             starting treatment.

          -  The effects of entinostat and GSK525762C on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             For this reason and because HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) and BET inhibitor (BETi) agents are
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and their male partner must
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for 7
             months after completion of entinostat and GSK525762C administration. Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the
             study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of
             entinostat and GSK525762C administration.

          -  Patients must have tumors determined to be easily accessible for biopsy and must be
             willing to have serial biopsies. Tumor biopsies will be performed on the most
             accessible biopsiable site of disease. All possible precautions to avoid complications
             will be taken, including discussions in multidisciplinary meetings, if needed. If a
             biopsy cannot be performed safely (e.g. there is no safely accessible biopsiable tumor
             tissue) or biopsy does not yield sufficient tissue for analysis, participation is
             still allowed.

          -  Patients on both therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation may participate as long
             as they have no history of clinically significant bleeding while on anticoagulation.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had any anti-cancer therapy within 14 days (or 5 half-lives,
             whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of the investigational products.

          -  Patients who have received radiation therapy within 21 days prior to the first dose of
             the investigational products.

          -  Patients who have a diagnosis of NK cell lymphoma.

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy.
             Toxicities should have recovered to =&lt; grade 1, excluding alopecia, or should be
             stable chronic grade 2 toxicities that do not overlap with presumed toxicities of
             entinostat or GSK525762C.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known untreated or symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases are
             excluded. Patients with previously treated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis may
             be included provided that they have stable CNS disease for at least 4 weeks (confirmed
             by imaging) without symptoms and are off corticosteroids (above physiologic dose) for
             that indication.

          -  Patients with significant malabsorption or nausea and vomiting that would interfere
             with oral therapies.

          -  Patients with bleeding diathesis or clinically significant bleeding within the prior 6
             months.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to entinostat (e.g. medications that have a benzamide structure [tiapride,
             remoxipride, clebopride] or GSK525762C [e.g. benzodiazepines]).

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or strong
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
             herbal product.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.

          -  Patients with a history of clinically significant bleeding.

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because entinostat is an HDACi and
             GSK525762C is a BETi with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with entinostat or GSK525762C, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued throughout the treatment period and for at least 28 days
             following the last dose of study treatment if the mother is treated with entinostat or
             GSK525762C.
