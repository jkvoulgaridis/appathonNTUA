  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the Investigator's propose to validate a newly developed approach, DeepGRAI
      (Deep Gray Rating via Artificial Intelligence), to simplify the calculation of thalamic
      atrophy in a clinical routine and allow academic and community neurologists to plan, perform,
      and publish novel and influential clinical research using data from clinical routine, by
      employing deep machine learning (DML) pattern recognition (PR) information through use of
      artificial intelligence (AI).

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, cross-sectional and longitudinal
      population study of brain volume changes in MS patients. The retrospective electronic medical
      record (EMR) and brain MRI image data will be collected at participating MS centers and
      de-identified data will be integrated into a central research database. All the data to be
      integrated into the database has already been collected by physicians at the centers as part
      of their routine clinical practice and is thus non-interventional and retrospective in
      nature. This new approach will be compared to existing approaches of brain volume measurement
      that are currently widely available. This breakthrough approach would lead to potentially
      abandoning classis measurement of the specific brain volume structures and would be
      applicable in real-time in clinical routine.
