  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction(STEMI) is rising and the existing
      emergency medical aid system for STEMI was not enough for timely perfusion treatment. No
      existing research with high-quality data focuses on the characteristic of STEMI incidence and
      regional network construction. Aiming of Guangdong GAMI(reGional network for Acute Myocardial
      Infarction) project is to establish effective collaborative regional network system for STEMI
      patients treatment.

      The project of Guangdong GAMI(reGional network for Acute Myocardial Infarction) is being
      conducted during 2015-2019 in four districts with diverse economic development across
      Guangdong province. All the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients
      admitted in the hospital within 30 days from the symptom onset were enrolled and the designed
      sample size was 4000 patients. The key data of the timeline of STEMI onset and treatment were
      precisely recorded. Other details of STEMI treatment in hospitals such as laboratory data and
      medication were also collected. During the research period, actions of both optimizing the
      regional STEMI patients transfer and treatment to shorten the medical delay, as well as
      educating the public to improve their awareness of early treatment of STEMI were taken
      meanwhile. Timeline of STEMI patients visit and treatment were compared before and after
      every half year to elevate the effect of the actions and optimize the following action to
      better shorten the treatment delay. In addition, laboratory data, medication, and follow-up
      information were recorded in a database for further analysis regarding the STEMI patient
      treatment.
