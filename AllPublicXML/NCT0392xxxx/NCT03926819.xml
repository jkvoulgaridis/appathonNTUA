      This is a single center, open label Phase 1 clinical trial in normal adult subjects to assess
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of HBI-002, an orally
      administered liquid containing carbon monoxide, with single ascending doses (SAD), followed
      by multiple ascending doses (MAD) with doses daily for 7 days.

             Unit= 150 mL wine, 360 mL beer or 45 mL of 40% alcohol)

          8. History of pulmonary infiltrate or pneumonia within 6 months before screening or
             pulmonary/bronchial infection within 2 weeks of screening.

          9. History of cancer with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell

             safety

         14. Pregnancy or breast feeding.

         15. Treatment with an investigational drug within the longer of 30 days or five half-lives
