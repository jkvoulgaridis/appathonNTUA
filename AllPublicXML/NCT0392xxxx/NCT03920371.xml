      The aim of the project is to undertake clinical development of a hybrid compact gamma camera
      that combines gamma ray and optical imaging. It is an extension of the previous pilot study
      using a newly developed handheld hybrid compact gamma camera in clinical arena.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single visit study involving patients who have been referred to the Nuclear
      Medicine Clinic at Nottingham University Hospitals as part of a standard diagnostic test.
      Each patient's participation will be approximately 30 minutes and not normally longer than
      one hour. The study will run for 11 months commencing February 2017 and ceasing at the end of
      December 2017.

      As part of their routine care, patients will be sent a letter booking their diagnostic test
      through a Nuclear Medicine Clinic. Once they have confirmed that they will be attending this
      diagnostic test, one of the clinical study team trained to take consent will contact the
      patient by phone. At this point they will be informed of the reason for the study, why they
      have been approached and the study schedule. If they express interest in participating they
      will then be sent a copy of the patient informed consent forms. They will be given a minimum
      of 24 hours before formally signing consent at the study site immediately before
      participating.

      Study plan:

      Following the administration of the routine radiopharmaceutical and the standard wait before
      clinical diagnostic imaging, the patient will have research images acquired using the hybrid
      prototype gamma camera. All research images will be anonymised and the additional imaging
      performed as part of this study will fit in with the patient and the diagnostic test
      schedules. Should the patient wish to stop at any point, the research study procedure will be
      terminated. Once these images have been acquired then the patient will go home or proceed
      with the requirements of their diagnostic test. 75 participants will be recruited for this
      study.
