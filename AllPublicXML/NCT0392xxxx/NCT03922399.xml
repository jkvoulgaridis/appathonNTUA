      Protocol title： Outcome evaluation for burn scar therapy-laser and surgery in patients in
      Formosa Fun Coast Explosion

      Objectives： The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of both lasers and
      operations on patients with major burn scar(&gt;20% TBSA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background： There is no gold standard treatment for burn scar treatment, especially for those
      with major burn scar. In the Formosa Fun-Coast Dust Explosion in 2015, lots of patients with
      major burn scar suffer from severe pathologic burn scar syndromes. The gold of the study is
      to evaluate the efficacy of both lasers and operations on major burn scars treatment in the
      past two years.

      Study Design： To take the assessment of scar into account, the investigators use both
      objectives and subjective methods to evaluate the scar condition. In addition to the scale of
      scar, the investigators also use both sonography and HRV system to evaluate the expressions
      of scar. All evaluated tools used are the same as those used in 20160201R and 20160202R. The
      investigators also used previous records to check the patient's scar condition before these
      treatments.

      Hypothesis： After treatment, scar conditions should get better than before. However, the
      investigators need more scientific statistics to evaluate the improve rate.

      Key words： Burn scar, burn scar syndromes. Scar laser treatment
