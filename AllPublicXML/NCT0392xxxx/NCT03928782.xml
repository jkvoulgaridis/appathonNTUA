  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid and accurate assessment of radiation injury dose is the key to success in early
      treatment and an urgent issue to be solved in clinical medicine.Researches showed that the
      expression of the microRNAs in human peripheral blood had much correlation with radiation
      injury resulted from different dosages of radiation.In this study,acute leukemic patients who
      will be pretreated by whole-body radiation are taked as the object of study,and biochip
      technology are adopted to detect the expression levels of the microRNAs in subject peripheral
      blood before-and-after radiation,and different expression is tested and Bioinformatics
      prediction,to evaluate the correlation between radiation injury dose and expression levels of
      the microRNAs in human peripheral blood.
