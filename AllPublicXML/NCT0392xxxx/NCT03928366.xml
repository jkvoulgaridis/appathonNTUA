    <textblock>
      Background: The mechanisms of action of intravenous anesthetics are unclear and the current
      monitors have limitations.

      This signifies difficulties when assessing the correct dosage due to the considerable
      inter-individual variability of the patients, particularly in the elderly or seriously ill.
      It is necessary to customize the administration of anesthetics as underdosage can lead to the
      patient awareness during aggressive procedures, and over-dosage can cause serious
      complications and even augment mortality.

      Objective: To design a new monitoring system of the levels of consciousness and analgesia in
      anesthetized subjects which is more accurate than those currently employed. It will be based
      on the synchronic changes of functional magnetic resonance (fMR) and electroencephalograph
      (EEG) readings, and clinical responses.

      Methodology: Thirty healthy volunteers will be given propofol and remifentanil in different
      combinations, and painful stimuli will be also applied. The principal variable will be fMR
      images obtained by echo-planar imaging sequences. Real time will be correlated with cortical
      connectivity maps (connectome), EEG parameters (qCON, qNOX), clinical responses, and
      concentrations of anesthetics measured by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models (TCI).

      Main goal:

      Develop a system for monitoring the effect of anesthetics on consciousness and pain, based on
      synchronous changes in functional neuroimaging, EEG and clinical responses.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Analyze the changes produced in the cortical connectivity map during the induction of
           anesthesia to understand the process of &quot;advancement&quot;.

        -  Know more accurately the neuronal circuits involved in propofol-induced sleep.

        -  Study if the application of a known painful stimulus modifies in any way (clinical, EEG
           or by RMf) the LOC that has just been reached.

        -  Establish propofol dosing guidelines adjusted to each patient, studying if they reach
           the LOC at &quot;sedative&quot; or &quot;hypnotic&quot; doses.

        -  Establish remifentanil dosing guidelines, adjusted to each patient, studying the
           concentration of remifentanil to which the pain response in neuroimaging is inhibited
           (activation deactivation neuronal in fMRI).

        -  Validate existing mathematical models in relation to plasma and brain concentrations of
           propofol and remifentanil.

        -  Validate the value of clinical signs to predict whether a patient feels the painful
           stimulus received.

    <ipd_description>Participants will be introduced to the fMRI The head will be set to try to prevent involuntary movements associated with the LOC. Routine by pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and electrocardiogram (ECG). It will be administered oxygen at 2 liters / min by nasal cannula with capnography line and transcutaneous CO2 will be monitored. Volunteers will not be premedicated.
EEG activity and fMRI images, as detailed in the section &quot;Study variables&quot;. Each series of acquisitions will consist of a &quot;resting state&quot; (rs-fMRI), in which the subject will be asked to close their eyes and leave the mind ramble without further slogans, and also a series of tasks in which the participant will be exposed to a sequence of perceptive and nociceptive stimuli in order to objectify the effect of the drug on the nervous system central. The BOLD signal extracted from the RMf images will allow to study the dynamics of the metabolic changes and neurons in the brain with a temporal resolution.</ipd_description>
