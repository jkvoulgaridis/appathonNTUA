    <description>An initial safety evaluation will be performed in participants with relapsed AML. If atezolizumab in combination with Hu5F9-G4 is initially safe and tolerable in participants an additional cohort with R/R AML will be evaluated to further test the safety and anti-tumor activity. If dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are observed in &gt;=33% of participants in this initial cohort, a dose de-escalation cohort will be enrolled. If less than 33% of enrolled and dosed participants in any given cohort experience a DLT, an expansion cohort of 15 participants will be enrolled at the highest tolerated dose for this combination. If a dose de-escalation cohort is needed, an expansion cohort will be enrolled at the lower tolerated dose for this combination.</description>

Starting on Day 15 of Cycle 1, Hu5F9-G4 maintenance will be given by IV infusion at a dose of 30 mg/kg once a week (QW) of each 28-day cycle. Dosing for de-escalation, if needed: Hu5F9-G4 will be given as two priming doses of 1 mg/kg IV on Days 1 and 4, followed by loading doses of 10 mg/kg IV on Day 8 and 15 mg/kg on Day 11. Starting on Day 15, maintenance treatment with Hu5F9-G4 will be given by IV infusion at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a week (QW).</description>
