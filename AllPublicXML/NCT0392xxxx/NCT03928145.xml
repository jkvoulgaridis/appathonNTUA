  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thiazide diuretics have demonstrated favorable blood pressure lowering efficacy, safety
      profile and low cost, but it is still unclear what are the equivalence of doses of their more
      common agents, chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide. Besides, concernments about adverse
      metabolic effects such as hypokalemia, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia do exist, which may
      be attenuated with the concomitant administration of a potassium-sparing diuretic, such as
      amiloride. In addition to control adverse effects of thiazides, amiloride could offer an
      additional blood pressure lowering effect, but the efficacy of different doses was not fully
      established. This study aims to investigate the blood pressure lowering efficacy of
      chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide, in combination with amiloride in different doses, for
      the initial management in patients with primary hypertension.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a factorial (2x2) randomized double-blinded clinical trial comparing the association
      of a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone 25 mg/day or hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/day) with a
      potassium-sparing diuretic (amiloride 10 mg/day or amiloride 20 mg/day) as first drug option
      in patients aged 30 to 75 years with primary hypertension. The thiazide diuretic and
      amiloride will be combined in a single capsule. The capsules will be of the same size and
      color, so that neither the researcher nor the patients can distinguish the treatment by their
      appearance. The primary outcome will be the mean change from baseline in 24-h systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The
      secondary outcomes will be the mean change from baseline in daytime and nighttime systolic
      and diastolic blood pressure measured by ABPM, mean change from baseline in systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure measured by office blood pressure, incidence of adverse events,
      variation of laboratory parameters and proportion of patients who achieved blood pressure
      control (&lt;140/90 mmHg and &lt;130/80 mmHg for office blood pressure and 24-h ABPM,
      respectively). The follow-up will last 12 weeks. For a P alpha of 0.05, power of 80%, and
      standard deviation of 9 mmHg, and absolute difference of 6 mmHg on systolic blood pressure on
      24-h ABPM, it will be necessary to study a total of 76 patients. The sample size will be
      increased by 10% to compensate losses, resulting in 84 patients being randomized in total (42
      for each arm).

    <intervention_model_description>The trial has a factorial design, where participants will receive two simultaneous interventions: a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone 25 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg) and a potassium-sparing diuretic (amiloride 10 mg or amiloride 20 mg). Randomization will be done in 1:1:1:1 ratio, and participants will be randomly assigned to four groups: a) chlorthalidone 25 mg + amiloride 10 mg; b) chlorthalidone 25 mg + amiloride 20 mg; c) hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg + amiloride 10 mg; and d) hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg + amiloride 20 mg.</intervention_model_description>
