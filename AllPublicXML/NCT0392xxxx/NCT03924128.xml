  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PhotoBioModulation (PBM) is a mature science with therapeutic efficacy in humans and animals,
      and with excellent results in different medical specialties without side effects. However
      there are gaps that prevent adoption on a large scale. Recent research developed by our group
      and partners allowed us to understand the mechanisms of action of PBM, from Molecular Physics
      through Biochemistry and with consequent clinical validation, with precise, replicable and
      personalized therapeutic results. These findings have led to treatments for many kinds of
      pains with industrial predictability and accuracy, phenotypic adequacy technologies that are
      encapsulated, prescribed, and applied. Photobiomodulation applications cover treatments for
      pain, inflammation, tissue regeneration, healing, immune system activation, all of which are
      essential characteristics for osteoarthritis therapy. Our idea is to formulate great
      challenges of Photobiomodulation as a solution to osteoarthritis as follows: 1) Make
      PBM-based therapies as predictable as drug-based therapies; this is possible with precise
      dose calculation performed by our team; 2) Map the biochemical and molecular effects of PBM,
      including those related to gene expression; 3) Unify PBM theory by synthesizing and giving
      meaning to the millions of PBM data associated with osteoarthritis and correlating with
      clinical study to be performed under this thematic project. Overcoming these challenges, PBM
      will become a complementary (or supplementary) alternative to medications, physiotherapy and
      surgical procedures for the treatment of osteoarthritis.
