  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is expanded access to an Investigational New Drug (IND) for an individual patient
      with spinal cord injury (SCI) at cervical spine 5-6 (C 5-6) designed to provide access to
      autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access single-dose study with the primary goal of treatment submitted at
      the request of an individual patient with complete C5-6 spinal cord injury (SCI) resulting in
      quadriplegia who does not qualify for any current clinical trials and for whom there are no
      other FDA approved fully restorative treatments. The overall objective of this study is to
      evaluate patient's response, adverse events and serious adverse events (AE/SAEs), and cell
      expansion characteristics of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of autologous adipose-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs) in a subject with complete SCI resulting in quadriplegia.
