  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facial hyperpigmentation is a common skin issue that can cause embarrassment and affect the
      quality of life in majority of people. The investigators are conducting a research to study
      an efficacy and tolerability of Isobutylamido-thiazolyl-resorcinol 0.2% in lightening of the
      facial hyperpigmentation in comparison to vehicle intervention in 4, 8 and 12-week period.
      The ultimate goal is to provide the best cosmetic cream to improve the quality of life of
      people who suffer from facial hyperpigmentation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Facial hyperpigmentation is a skin issue that occurs frequently in people with darker skin
      types. Studies show that the prevalence of facial hyperpigmentation is related to ethnicity
      and is accounted for up to 40%of the total population. The pathogenesis of facial
      hyperpigmentation is still unclear, but several factors seem to contribute such as
      ultraviolet radiation, female hormones, and genetics, which increase melanin production in
      the skin cells, specifically the epidermal melanocyte, and dermal melanophage.
      Hyperpigmentation can be embarrassing and affect the quality of life in the pertained
      individuals.

      Tyrosinase enzyme plays a key element in melanin production which causes dark areas. In 2018,
      several studies have reported a new cosmetic product using Isobutylamido-thiazolyl-resorcinol
      (Beiersdorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) in facial hyperpigmentation. In vitro studies found that in
      melanocyte culture, Isobutylamido-thiazolyl-resorcinol inhibit melanin production. Studies
      discovered that Isobutylamido-thiazolyl-resorcinol 0.2% can reduce facial hyperpigmentation
      within 4 weeks. Hyperpigmentation begin to fade away within 12 weeks of daily application.

      The objective is to study efficacy and tolerability of a cosmetic formulation with
      Isobutylamido-thiazolyl-resorcinol 0.2% compared to its vehicle in facial hyperpigmentation
      after 4, 8 and 12-week.

      This is a randomized double-blind and vehicle-controlled study. Two hundred subjects both
      male and female 18 years or older with facial hyperpigmentation are recruited in the study.
      The study was performed at the Institute of Dermatology, Bangkok, Thailand. Subjects agree to
      attend monthly sessions every 4 weeks for 12 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, vehicle controlled, double-blind study and is performed at the Institute of Dermatology. Subjects are randomized into 2 groups by a computer prior to the start of the study - group 1 receives Isobutylamido-thiazolyl-resorcinol 0.2% cream and group 2 receives vehicle cream for 12 weeks. Both Study products have to be applied twice daily.Total of 4 clinical sessions are carried out in order to evaluate Isobutylamido-thiazolyl-resorcinol 0.2% efficacy and tolerability at week 4, 8 and 12. Subjects and investigators are blinded about allocation. The appearance of the vehicle formulation was similar to the verum formulation and could not be distinguished neither by patients nor by the investigator.</intervention_model_description>
