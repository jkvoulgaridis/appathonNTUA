  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of patients with localized prostate cancer, and treated for curative
      intent by radiotherapy, have a local recurrence. Among these patients with local recurrence,
      few receive curative remedial treatment but most of them are treated with palliative hormonal
      therapy without any chance of long-term recovery.

      The use of Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) in focal treatment (only on recurrence) is an effective
      and not very morbid option, especially compared to surgery. The quality of this treatment is
      conditioned by both an early diagnosis of recurrence, a precise localization of recurrence in
      the prostate and a rigorous extension assessment for the detection of occult metastases.

      Innovations in medical imaging have led to the development of a new generation of &quot;hybrid&quot;
      machines that combine PET (Positron Emission Tomodensitometry) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging) technology. Associated with the use of 68Gallium-labeled PSMA (Prostate-Specific
      Membrane Antigen), a new tracer specific for prostate cancer, the investigators believe that
      this PET-MRI imaging technique can:

        1. To identify at an early stage the metastatic patients and to allow a more adapted
           therapeutic management.

        2. A better evaluation of the limits of local recurrence and therefore a more precise
           definition than with MRI alone of the tumor zone to be destroyed.

      Finally, the investigators believe that the PET-MRI / 68Ga-PSMA exam, used for the selection
      of patients eligible for focal HIFU treatment and used for the treatment itself, should allow
      obtaining an optimal control of the cancer recurrence with the least possible side effects.

Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale. Each items as a standardized value from 0 to 100. Then the average of the standardized value is determined in each domain to crate the summary score. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>

    <description>Urinary function will be assessed using the IPSS (International Prostate Score Symptom) questionnaire. The IPSS questionnaire is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35. The score is then categorized as follow: Mild (symptoms score less than or equal to 7), Moderate (symptom score range 8-19), Severe (symptom score range 20-35). The higher the score, the worse the symptoms.</description>

The score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 56 items. It is then categorized as follow: 22-25: No erectile dysfunction, 17-21: Mild erectile dysfunction, 12-16: Mild to moderate erectile dysfunction, 8-11: Moderate erectile dysfunction, 5-7: Severe erectile dysfunction.
