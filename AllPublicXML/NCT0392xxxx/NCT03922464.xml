    <description>Evaluations of the blinded reviewer's Nürnberger-Müller Scale for Cellulite between Baseline (Visit 0/1) and Follow up visits (Visits 4 to 6).
The Nurnberger-Muller Scale classifies cellulite into four categories:
Stage Zero No dimpling is seen on the skin when you are standing naked in front of the mirror. When the skin is pinched no orange peel effect is seen.
Stage One No dimpling is seen on the skin when you are standing, but when you pinch your skin you have bumps and lumps.
Stage two You can see dimpling or the orange peel appearance when standing naked in front of the mirror, but not when lie down.
Stage three You can see dimpling both when you are standing and lying down.</description>

    <intervention_name>Poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra® Aesthetic)</intervention_name>
    <description>Sculptra® Aesthetic is a commercially available product that is licensed for sale in Canada. It is an injectable implant that contains microparticles of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), a biocompatible, biodegradable, synthetic polymer from the alpha-hydroxy-acid family. Sculptra® Aesthetic is suitable for increasing the volume of depressed areas, particularly to correct skin depressions, such as in skin creases, wrinkles, folds, scars and for skin aging. Sculptra® Aesthetic is also suitable for large volume corrections of the signs of facial fat loss (lipoatrophy).
The safety and efficacy of Sculptra® Aesthetic has been investigated in the literature and is generally considered safe and effective. PLLA has been used successfully to reverse HIV‐associated lipoatrophy as well as to rejuvenate the face, neck, décolletage, hands, abdomen and gluteal regions.</description>
