  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to attempt to identify genetic mutations or other gene-based
      variations in adults and children who have cancer, or are likely to develop an inherited form
      of cancer, and potentially reduce their risk for cancer or treat the cancer earlier.

        Potential participants will be identified by members of the Clinical Genetics Service from
        the following sources: a) MSK patients previously tested through MSK IMPACT #12-245
        protocol; b) MSK patients referred to the Clinical Genetics Service by an MSK physician,
        outside physician, or self-referral; c) non-MSKCC patients referred or self-referred to the
        Clinical Genetics Service or directly to the P.I. and identified as candidates for
        participation in this study; d) family members of probands identified by the study team to
        be informative for research purposed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have undergone clinical and/or research genetic evaluation, found to
             have or not have a germline genetic variant (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of
             uncertain/unknown significance, likely benign).

          -  Individuals with or without a personal history of malignant or pre-malignant lesions
             who demonstrate: a) clinical findings suggestive of a genetic cancer susceptibility
             syndrome including very early age at onset, multiple primary malignancies, or other
             features; and/or b) family histories suggestive of a genetic cancer susceptibility
             syndrome, or c) other features suggesting inherited etiology of malignancy as
             determined by the PI.

          -  Family members of the above participants. Both children (with parental consent as age
             appropriate) and adults are eligible to participation.

          -  Individuals may or may not be enrolled MSK patients; probands may be referred to (or
             self-referred to) the study and may be enrolled at discretion of the PI and if able to
             provide informed consent.

          -  Biospecimens derived from deceased family members may be used for research in this
             study if consent if provided by the executor of the estate of that individual.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from this study if he/she has physical, cognitive or
             psychiatric conditions that interfere with ability to give meaningful informed
             consent.
