  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have showed that a broader spectrum influenza vaccine may help in reducing the
      influenza burden of disease. Butantan Institute is currently developing a quadrivalent
      influenza vaccine candidate. This study is will provide safety and immunogenicity data on
      this quadrivalent influenza vaccine candidate.

      The study will be conducted in an open population of healthy participants (3-59 years old)
      recruited in different clinical sites in Brazil and will be adequately powered to assess
      safety, immune response (measured by GMT HI antibodies) to each viral strain in the vaccines
      and lot-to-lot consistency.

    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded, randomized active-control comparator study to assess the safety and
      immunogenicity of QIV-IB, the Butantan Institute quadrivalent influenza vaccine candidate. As
      active controls, two trivalent influenza vaccines with different Influenza B strains, one
      with influenza B/Victoria strain (TIVV-IB) and other with influenza B/Yamagata strain
      (TIVY-IB) The study is designed to build a safety database of the quadrivalent influenza
      vaccine in adults to detect adverse events with a frequency of 1:1000 or higher and safety
      databases for pediatric age groups to detect adverse events with frequency of 1:100 or
      higher.

      In terms of immune response, the study aims to demonstrate superiority of HI (Hemagglutinin
      inhibition) GMT (Geometric Mean Titer) of the QIV-IB for the Influenza B strain that is not
      present in each trivalent vaccine control. Regarding the Influenza A and B strains common to
      QIV-IB and both trivalent vaccine controls, the study aims to demonstrate non-inferiority on
      those strains.

      Finally, a lot-to-lot consistency test will be performed in a sub-group of adult
      participants.
