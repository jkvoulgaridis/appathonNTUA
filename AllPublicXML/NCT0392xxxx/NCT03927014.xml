      Objective: To evaluate serum evaluate thiol/ disulfide levels in preeclampsia and address its
      relationship with its severity.

      Methods: This prospective study will include 50 pregnancies complicated with preeclampsia and
      50 healthy pregnancies. The blood for analysis will obtain at the admission and serum thiol/
      disulfide levels will measure using commercially available reagent kits. The continuous
      values were evaluated using Student's t-test, and categorical values were evaluated using the
      Chi-square test. P values &lt; .05 were accepted as significant.

      This is an observational prospective cohort study will conduct at Obstetrics and Gynecology
      Department of Cengiz Gokcek Obstetrics and Children's Hospital between April and October
      2019. One hundred women will enrol in the study in two groups. We will consecutively recruit
      50 pregnancies complicated with preeclampsia, and 50 healthy pregnancies will select for the
      control group. All patients will give their oral and written informed consent before their
      inclusion in the study. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical
      Research of Gaziantep University (Reference number: 2019/147). The study strictly will adhere
      to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

    <description>The diagnosis of preeclampsia, as defined by the Committee on Terminology of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), will establish based on the presence of proteinuria (urinary excretion of 300 mg protein or higher, or at least 1+in dipstick in a 24-h urine specimen) and a blood pressure level of â‰¥140/90mmHg (two blood pressure measurements 6 h apart) that occurs after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman. Diastolic and/or systolic blood pressure up to 110/160 mm Hg will consider mild, and higher values will consider to being severe.</description>

    <description>Venous blood will sample from the antecubital veins for measuring the serum concentration of thiol/disulfide levels. The serum thiol/disulfide levels will measure using commercially available reagent kits, which is produced to detect human thiol/disulfide levels (Rel Assay Diagnostics Gaziantep, Turkey). The thiol/disulfide levels measurements were performed in accordance with the company's protocol.</description>
