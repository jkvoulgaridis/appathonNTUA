    <textblock>
      A functional model of a fluid-filled, smaller dead volume breast pump has been developed in
      order to more closely mimic the breastfeeding infant. The technology of fluid-filled pumping
      has been tested in one prior clinical study and has now progressed to a complete prototype
      with which the user can assemble, pump, disassemble, clean and reuse.

      Current breast pumps function in a way that is different to breastfeeding. These include the
      seal to the breast, the movement of the nipple, the sensations of warmth and moisture, the
      variability in frequency, and the strength of the applied vacuum. During breastfeeding the
      mother's nipple and the infant's mouth form a chamber that is a fluid-filled, no dead volume
      system, which is needed to create a working vacuum to remove milk from the breast. There is
      no air visible in the natural system according to ultrasound measurements. This is unlike
      breast pumps which use an air-filled, large dead volume system, to create a working vacuum.
      Therefore, a functional model of a fluid-filled, smaller dead volume breast pump has been
      developed in order to more closely mimic the breastfeeding infant. The technology of
      fluid-filled pumping has been tested in one prior clinical study and has now progressed to a
      complete prototype with which the user can assemble, pump, disassemble, clean and reuse.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject ≥ 18 years old

          2. Infant is ≥1 and ≤6 month old

          3. Subject and baby are healthy according to self-declaration in the &quot;Mother and infant
             health questionnaire&quot;

          4. Subject is predominantly breastfeeding (80% of all feeds, i.e. ≤150 ml formula/day or
             equal representative amount of solid food)

          5. The subject agrees to pump or feed the last time a minimum of 2 hours (hr) before the
             start of the pumping session at the study site

          6. The subject agrees to photographs/3 D scan of the breast and upper body (no face),

          7. The subject agrees to a video while pumping

          8. The subject signs the informed consent documentation

          9. Subject agrees that a maximum of 2 male team members can be present in the room to
             conduct the usability part of the study

         10. The mother accepts that the pumped milk in visit 2 must be donated to the study i.e.
             cannot be fed to the baby

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has a nipple size ≥ 21 mm
