  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) medication as a maintenance
      therapy for the treatment of binge-eating disorder (BED) in patients with obesity. This is a
      controlled test of whether, amongst responders to acute treatments, LDX medication results in
      superior maintenance and longer-term outcomes compared with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a heterogeneous problem and research has highlighted the particular significance
      of a subgroup with binge-eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent formal eating disorder.
      Improved treatments for patients with obesity and BED are needed that can produce sustained
      clinical outcomes and promote weight loss. This study (maintenance stage) RCT will provide
      findings from a controlled test, amongst responders to acute treatments, whether LDX
      medication results in superior maintenance and longer-term outcomes than placebo. This is one
      of the few RCTs for BED of medication with follow-up after medication discontinuation.
