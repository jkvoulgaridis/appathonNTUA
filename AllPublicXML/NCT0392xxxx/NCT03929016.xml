  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how the test medicine DNDI-0690 is taken up and broken down by the
      body and will also look at the safety and tolerability of the test medicine after a single
      dose. This is the first time the test medicine DNDI-0690 will be administered to humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DNDI-0690 is intended to be used as oral treatment for Visceral Leishmaniasis with potential
      for the cutaneous form of the disease, Cutaneous Leishmaniasis. The present protocol
      describes the first-in-human (FIH) study with DNDI-0690.
