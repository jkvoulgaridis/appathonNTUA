    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare using bougie as an assistant for endotracheal intubation through
      Air-Q and Fastrach intubating laryngeal mask devices when blind intubation fails as attempt
      to increase its success rate.

      The investigators hypothesis that using bougie with its smaller caliber or lesser size can
      facilitate intubation and improve success rate when blind intubation through both devices
      fails.

      Study objectives

        -  To make a comparison between Air-Q intubating laryngeal mask and Fastrach intubating
           laryngeal mask by using bougie assisted endotracheal intubation through both devices in
           patients undergoing elective surgeries in Suez Canal Hospitals.

        -  To assess the first trial success rate, the total success rate, time to tracheal
           intubation, the number of attempts, hemodynamics and adverse events.

    <description>Endotracheal tube introducers (gum elastic bougie) for emergency intubation The endotracheal tube introducer (ETI) is an effective and inexpensive adjunct to difficult airway management that is easy to use.
ETI is solid introducer 60-70 cm long with a 35 - 40 distally angulated (Coude) tip. They are easy to use, widely available, and have been used as adjuncts to difficult direct laryngoscopy for many decades.
The gum elastic bougie is usually guided by tactile clicks as the device passes the cartilage rings of the trachea. After Supraglottic devices are removed, an ETT can subsequently be railroaded over the bougie.</description>
