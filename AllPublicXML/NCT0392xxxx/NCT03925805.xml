  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve HRQoL in patients with chronic diseases, a comprehensive understanding of the
      association between HRQoL and chronic diseases is vital. Therefore, the aim of the study is
      to provide a profound insight in HRQoL outcomes and its determinants in chronically ill
      patients, with a focus on multimorbidity and socio-economic status in a primary care setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A primary care based cross-sectional study will be conducted to investigate HRQoL in adult
      patients with chronic diseases in Flanders (Belgium).

      An a priori sample size of minimum 1000 participants was targeted. For addressing the
      research aims, multiple linear regression models will be conducted assessing several main
      determinants, such as multimorbidity and SES, associated to HRQoL as main outcome parameter.
      These models should allow for controlling the effect of main confounders, in particular sex,
      age, educational level, body mass index and smoking, and for including interaction terms with
      psychosocial variables. A sample size calculation showed that the minimum required sample for
      a multiple regression study including 10 predictors with a medium anticipated effect size was
      118, given a desired statistical power level of 80% and a probability level of 5% (Cohen et
      al., 2003). However, for accurately estimating population parameters in observational
      studies, it has been recommended that the ideal sample size should preferably be at least 300
      [19]. Because this study has three clusters of disease groups, stratified analyses require a
      sample size of 900 participants. Also, a 10% increase was added to cover for missing
      variables. This sample size is also expected to widely cover clinically relevant differences
      between a number of chronic disease subgroups. Based on the conclusions of a systematic
      review by Norman et al. (2003), the clinical relevant difference will be set at a half
      standard deviation which appears to be the threshold of discrimination for changes in HRQoL
      for chronic diseases. A statistical power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05 will be
      taken into account. Conclusively, per group, information on 76 patients is needed 1) to
      assess the HRQoL (based on SF-36) in each patients group with a 5% precision and 2) to allow
      for comparisons across groups. Hence, a total sample of 1000 patients is required.

      Patient recruitment will be organized through general practitioners (GP) and community health
      centers across Flanders (Belgium). First, a number of GP practices located across urban and
      rural regions willing to participate in this study will be identified through a convenience
      sample based on their contact with a LOK group (Local Quality Group). This is a group of
      colleagues, doctors or pharmacists-biologists, who share and critically assess their medical
      practices (peer review) in order to improve the quality of care. GPs willingness to cooperate
      in the study will be asked at the LOK group meeting. In this meeting, the researchers will
      briefly present the study. Afterwards, interested GPs will be visited by the researchers at
      their practice with more detailed information about the study and they will receive the paper
      questionnaires. GPs will be asked to identify patients within their practice after validation
      of the eligibility criteria. GPs will explain briefly the purposes of the study to the
      patients and invite them to participate through voluntary response sample.

      A paper-based questionnaire, including informed consent, will be distributed to the
      participant by the GP at consultation. The questionnaire will be filled in by the patient at
      home. Afterwards, the patient can return the questionnaire to the researchers for free via a
      prepaid envelope or the questionnaire can be given back to the GP at later consultation. The
      questionnaire will take 30 minutes to gather patient information and research outcomes. The
      GPs will receive in advance detailed information by the researcher to ensure the aim of the
      study and the data collection process are understood. Due to practical restrictions, home
      visits for fulfilling the questionnaires was not achievable in this study.

      Descriptive statistics will be reported in order to describe the sample of the study
      participants. Means, standard deviations, median, and percentages for the continuous
      variables and frequency tables for categorical variables will be displayed. Socio-demographic
      differences between study participants will be tested with the appropriate test.

      Exploratory data analysis will be performed both for the continuous variables as well as the
      categorical variables. T-tests and one-way analysis of variance will be reported to compare
      groups when normal distribution is applicable. Non-parametric tests will be used when
      variables are not normally distributed. A p-value of 0.05 will be considered as statistically
      significant. Furthermore, multiple linear regression models will be conducted assessing
      several main determinants, such as multimorbidity and SES, associated to HRQoL as main
      outcome parameter. Furthermore, the study results will be validated against the HRQoL data
      collected in the Health Interview Survey with the aim to predict future HRQoL burden.

    <measure>Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one time point (inclusion)</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured using the EuroQol Five Dimensions (EQ-5D). The EQ-5D-5L is a valid extension of the 3-level questionnaire. It can be defined as a standardized non-disease specific value-based instrument to describe and value health-related quality of life. The instrument consists of two components: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).The first part consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five response categories (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems), from which a single EQ-5D index score can be calculated ranging from 0 (dead) to 1 (perfect health). The EQ-VAS measures one's self-perceived health today on a vertical scale from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health) on which participants have to indicate their current health.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-perceived health status (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one time point (inclusion)</time_frame>
    <description>This study will use the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) as a generic subjective or self-perceived health status instrument to assess patient's functional health and well-being whereas both physical and mental functioning components can be measured. This study makes use of the 12-item version instead of the 36-item version, because it can be completed in a shorter time. This instrument contains 12 items including eight domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health) which can be easily completed in five minutes. The summary scores, on a scale from 0 to 100, will be calculated to represent physical (Physical Component Summary score) and mental functioning (Mental Component Summary score). Higher scores indicate better self-perceived health status. The SF-12 has been confirmed as a valid and reliable instrument for measuring health perception in a general population for primary care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sense of coherence (SOC-13)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one time point (inclusion)</time_frame>
    <description>Sense of coherence will be measured using the brief Antonovsky's Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC) which contains 13 items covering three dimensions: comprehensibility (the extent to which events are perceived as making sense, that they are ordered, consistent and structured), manageability (the extent to which a person feels he/she can cope), and meaningfulness (how much one feels that life makes sense and challenges are worthy of commitment). Responses are reported by a semantic scale ranging from one (never or very seldom) to seven points (very often). SOC scores range from 13 to 91, and a higher score indicates higher SOC.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy (GSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one time point (inclusion)</time_frame>
    <description>General self-efficacy will be measured using the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). The GSES is a 10-item psychometric scale that is designed to assess optimistic self-beliefs to cope with a variety of difficult demands in life. The total score is calculated by the sum of all items. Scores range between 10 and 40, with higher scores indicating more self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health literacy (HLS-EU-Q6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one time point (inclusion)</time_frame>
    <description>The HLS-EU-Q6 will be used as a short scale of the European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-EU-Q). This tool consists of 6 items addressing self-reported difficulties in accessing, understanding, appraising and applying information in tasks concerning decision-making in health care, disease prevention, and health promotion. Responses are reported from one (very difficult) to four (very easy). The scale score varies between 1 and 4, with higher scores indicating better health literacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient enablement (PEI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one time point (inclusion)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) focuses on the impact of a clinical consultation for an acute or chronic disease in primary care on a patient's self-perceived ability to understand and cope with health issues and disease. It consists of six questions that reflect patient enablement. The responses are scored on a three-point scale (same or less/not applicable = 0, better/more = 1, and much better/much more = 2). The total PEI score ranges between 0 and 12 to indicate low (0-4), medium (score 5-9), and high enablement (10-12).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social support (F-SozU)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one time point (inclusion)</time_frame>
    <description>Social support will be measured using the 6-item shortened version of the Social Support Questionnaire (F-SozU). This valid and reliable instrument is well accepted in epidemiologic contexts to assess social support in the general population. Responses are rated on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (does not apply) to 5 (exactly applicable). The total range is from 0 to 30 with higher values representing higher perceived and received social support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multimorbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one time point (inclusion)</time_frame>
    <description>Multimorbidity will be measured by a self-developed list based on the MultiMorbidity Questionnaire (MM-21), and documents 24 self-reported chronic conditions in primary care. Participants have to indicate for each condition 'yes' or 'no', 'yes' may only be filled in for the conditions that have been confirmed by a doctor or for which the participant is taking prescribed drugs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptoms (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one time point (inclusion)</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item brief self-reported instrument to determine possible presence of anxiety and depressive states. The HADS compromises two scales, each consisting of seven items. A maximum score of 21 can be achieved per scale. The higher the overall score, the higher levels of anxiety and depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Illness perception (IPQ-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one time point (inclusion)</time_frame>
    <description>The brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-B) will be used for assessing patients' cognitive and emotional representations of their illness including consequences, timeline, personal control, treatment control, identity, coherence, concern, emotional response, and causes. The questionnaire uses a scale from 0 to 10 to assess cognitive illness representations (IPQcognitive, item 1-5), emotional representations (IPQemotional, item 6 and 8), and illness comprehensibility (IPQcomprehensibility, item 7). A low score on items number 1,2,5,6 and 8 indicates that the illness is perceived as benign while a low score on the items 3, 4 and 7 indicates that the illness is perceived as threatening. By reversing these three items it is possible to compute an overall score. A higher score reflects a more threatening view of the illness.</description>
