    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relations. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 40 days</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis). PASI-75 responders are the participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score.</description>

PASI-90 responders are the participants who achieved at least a 90% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score.</description>

    <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination.

PASI-100 responders are the participants who achieved at least a 100% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score.</description>
