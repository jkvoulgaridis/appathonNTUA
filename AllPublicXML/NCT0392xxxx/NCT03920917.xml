  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryoballoon ablation is proven to be effective in pulmonary vein isolation in patients with
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and it can reduce the procedure time compared to conventional
      radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation. Recently, high-power short-duration RF ablation has
      been known to reduce procedure time remarkably, and it can eliminate extra-pulmonary vein
      foci, which cannot be treated by Cryoballoon ablation. The aim of this study is to compare
      Cryoballoon ablation and high-power short-duration RF ablation in patients with paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation in terms of the efficacy and the safety in a prospective randomized
      trial.

      A. Study design

        1. Prospective randomization (cryoballoon PV isolation group vs. Radiofrequency Pulmonary
           Vein isolation and Additional Right Atrial linear ablation) (Using the Python program, a
           random number module is imported with the import random syntax, and the random number
           table for the two groups is created.)

        2. Target number of subjects: 330 (165 per group)

        3. Rhythm FU : 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines (Holter monitoring at the baseline, 3,6 month,
           and thereafter every 6 months to 24 month, then 1 year; ECG if the patient has any
           symptom)

        4. Anticoagulant therapy followed by 2014 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines

        5. All complications in each group will be evaluated including the re-hospitalization rate,
           major cardiovascular event, and mortality rate.

      B. Progress and rhythm/ECG follow-up

        1. To be performed in accordance with the 2012 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines for AF management

        2. Follow-up at 1 weeks, 3,6 months, and thereafter every 6-month after procedure.

        3. Rhythm control at 3,6 months, and thereafter every 6-month follow-up with Holter

        4. If the patient complains of symptoms, ECG will be performed at any time, and rhythm
           follow-up will be carried out with a Holter or event recorder.

      C. Follow-up All the patients will be followed-up at 1 weeks, 3, 6 months, and thereafter
      every 6 months. If the patient shows any symptom within the clinical study period, patient
      will visit the outpatient clinic. ECG will be performed at every outpatient visits, and
      24-hour Holter or event recording will be performed 3, 6 months, and thereafter every 6
      months for 2 years, and every year after 2 years (2012 Heart Rhythm Society/EHRA/European
      Cardiac Arrhythmia Society Expert Consensus Statement guidelines). If atrial fibrillation or
      atrial tachycardia lasting more than 30 seconds is observed in 12-lead ECG or Holter, it will
      be evaluated as recurrence. Recurrence within 3 months after the procedure will be classified
      as early recurrence, and that after 3 months will be classified as clinical recurrence.
