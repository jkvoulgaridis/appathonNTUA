  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective observational study that evaluates the rate of cardiovascular
      adverse events leading to hospitalization in metastatic colorectal cancer in the French
      county Calvados by drug exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the characteristics of cardiovascular adverse events leading to
      hospitalization in metastatic colorectal cancer. Descriptive analysis will include incidence,
      type of cardiovascular adverse events.

      We will explore the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events with regard of the
      antineoplastic drug exposures. This will provide information about the individual drug safety
      profiles.

    <measure>Difference in rates of cardiovascular adverse events leading to hospitalization between chemotherapy treated patients and chemotherapy-free patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 2004 and 2017</time_frame>
    <description>Any cardiovascular adverse event (e.g. the non limitative list: ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, ischaemic stroke, embolic or thrombotic events, arrhythmias, conductive disorders) that was the primary diagnosis of a hospital admission.
Any anticancer drug (chemotherapy) intake will be considered for the primary analysis.
We will use a competing risk statistical model.</description>

    <measure>Risk of cardiovascular adverse events (any) for each individual anticancer drug.</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 2004 and 2017</time_frame>
    <description>Drug exposure will be defined as a binary variable for each drug. (intakes/no intakes). A competing risk model will be used.</description>

    <measure>Risk of cardiovascular adverse events (any) for each anticancer drugs combination/protocol</measure>

    <measure>Risk of individual cardiovascular adverse events of chemotherapy treated patients versus chemotherapy-free patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 2004 and 2017</time_frame>
    <description>Several individual cardiovascular adverse events will be assessed in separate analyses: ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, ischaemic stroke, embolic or thrombotic events, arrhythmias, conductive disorders). A competing risk model will be used</description>

    <measure>Dose-effect relation ship between individual anticancer drugs and cardiovascular adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 2004 and 2017</time_frame>
    <description>Dose will be approached by the number of cycles of the anticancer drug and by the cumulative dose (in milligram) received.</description>

    <description>The French county Calvados registry of digestive cancers will allow to identify patients with a metastatic colorectal cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2014.
Patients will be included if the cancer was diagnosed at the metastatic stage between 2004 and 2014 or non-metastatic before 2004 that became metastatic between 2004 and 2014 (synchronous and metachronous tumors)</description>
