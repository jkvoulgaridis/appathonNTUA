  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will notify centers of center's post-endoscopic infection rates and evaluate the
      effectiveness of this notification system to decrease infection rates. The investigators aim
      to notify centers of the number of patients and center's risk-adjusted rates of
      hospitalizations for infections after colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
      procedures performed between January 2015 and September 2018. The investigators will
      randomize centers to two notification groups: (1) Ability to view center's rate compared with
      all other centers (ASCs and outpatient centers notified and compared separately) or (2)
      Ability to view center's rate compared with the other centers with a similar patient
      comorbidity profile and in addition to viewing option 1. Facilities will answer questions
      about center's infection control practices. The investigators hypothesize that centers with
      high rates of post-procedural infections will (1) be more likely to report that the center
      took action to investigate the center's infection control practices after the first
      notification and (2) observe a decrease in infections after the notification. The
      investigators anticipate that centers with high rates of post-procedural infections that are
      randomized to group 2 will have greater change. The investigators anticipate no change in
      rates of infection in the facilities that had zero or very low (n=1) event rates.
