  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an enormous increase in diabetes mellitus worldwide, especially in developed
      countries. Ninety percent of diabetes cases worldwide are of Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      as a result of greater prevalence of sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet and rise of obesity,
      as well as an increasing number of elderly populations. T2DM can be attributed to relative
      deficiency of insulin involving insulin resistance, aberrant synthesis of hepatic glucose and
      progressive deterioration of pancreatic beta-cell functions resulting in chronic
      hyperglycaemia. A growing amount of evidence has emerged in the last several years linking
      various nutrients and food sources with a positive management of T2DM. In in vitro studies,
      various botanical extracts have been found to significantly inhibit the activity of
      alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. The inhibition of these enzymes' activity is a rational
      approach in managing glucose level for borderline and T2DM sufferers as inhibition of both
      alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activity can profoundly reduce post-prandial increase in
      blood plasma glucose concentration following a mixed carbohydrate intake. Excessive levels of
      blood plasma glucose and free fatty acids impose a stressful condition for pancreatic
      beta-cells and other insulin sensitive cells resulting in the local secretion of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines causing a continuous low levels of abnormal
      inflammation that alter insulin's action. As the body becomes less sensitive to insulin, the
      resulting insulin resistance leads to further inflammation, with more inflammation causing
      more insulin resistance, causing blood plasma sugar levels to continuously increase,
      eventually resulting in T2DM. In in vitro animal models, various compounds of botanical
      origin have also been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activities which can be beneficial
      in managing T2DM.
