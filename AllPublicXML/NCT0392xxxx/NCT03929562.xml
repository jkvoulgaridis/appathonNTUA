  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to learn more about how to improve patients' health before and after a
      scheduled surgery by examining acceptability and initial efficacy of pre-operative alcohol
      use reduction interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized clinical pilot trial that assesses preliminary intervention
      efficacy of a two-session health coaching intervention relative to brief advice among
      pre-operative elective surgical patients and evaluates intervention acceptability. Study
      subjects will be outpatients at a large health system in the midwestern United States and
      fulfill the study's inclusion criteria. Subjects will be randomized to one of two
      intervention conditions: Health Coaching or Brief Advice.

    <description>Two 50-minute health coaching sessions will use a non-confrontation motivational interviewing (MI) style. Intervention delivery will include expressing concern about unhealthy drinking, providing feedback linking alcohol use and health (related to surgery and general health), advising the patient regarding abstinence or alcohol use reduction, and working with the patient to set a drinking goal if he/she is ready to change. We will also include a personalized feedback component to address the links between pre-operative alcohol use and postoperative morbidity/mortality.</description>
