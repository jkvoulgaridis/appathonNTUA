    <description>Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a PR or better according to the disease-specific response criteria. Evaluation of prostate treatment response will be performed according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR) will be calculated from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the disease-specific response criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Evaluation of prostate treatment response will be performed according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histology: Part 1: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with
             histologic confirmation of adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma with small-cell or
             neuroendocrine features is allowed. mCRPC is defined by prostate Cancer Working Group
             (PCWG )3 criteria. Part 2: mCRPC as defined above or pathologically confirmed
             metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as defined by world health organization (WHO)
             2016 Classifications

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease: Part 1: Either measurable or evaluable disease for
             prostate cancer. Part 2: At least one measurable lesion as per RECIST v1.1.

          -  Participants with accessible lesions enrolled in selected pharmacokinetic
             (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) cohorts and in Part 2 must agree to undergo the mandatory
             fresh tumor biopsies, unless collection of the biopsy presents a safety risk

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 2 weeks between prior anticancer treatment (including radiotherapy)

             Grade less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1 or baseline

          -  Prior treatment with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted therapy except
             for PSMA-targeted vaccine is permitted

          -  Solid organ or bone marrow transplantation

          -  Seizure or known condition that may predispose to seizure or intracranial masses
