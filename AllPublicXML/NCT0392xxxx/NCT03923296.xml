  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iterative co-design study where patients receiving systemic cancer therapy, carers and
      healthcare professionals involved in delivering cancer therapy, work with Entia to design a
      home based blood monitoring service. The iterative process means that at each stage of the
      development process, Entia will be building on what is learnt in the previous stage.
