      Introduction: Errors in communication, and during transfers of information and medical
      responsibility, are frequent and risky. Objectives: Primary: To evaluate the effect of the
      implementation of the I-PASS® transfer program on the reduction in the frequency of medical
      attention errors in intensive pediatric therapies in the public hospitals setting. Secondary:
      1) Measure the effect of the intervention in increasing the frequency of use of key elements
      of high quality verbal and written communication during the transfer of patients by health
      professionals. 2) To explore the effect of the intervention on the culture of patient safety
      among health professionals who assist pediatric patients in areas of clinical
      hospitalization. Material and Methods: Design: Staged clinical trial (Stepped Wedge)
      Duration: 9 months (progressive enrollment of 2 participating units every 2 months). Scope:
      Pediatric Intensive Care Units Subjects: health professionals involved in transfers in each
      institution. Intervention: Implementation of a multi-faceted evidence-based transfer package
      (I-PASS®) that has already been adapted for use in Argentina. The program includes multiple
      components, including educational training, implementation of a mnemonic verbal and written
      delivery rule I-PASS®, live observations of transfers to drive continuous improvement of the
      quality of intervention, through the feedback and a campaign of visual reinforcement
      materials to ensure sustainability. Events of interest: acceptance of the intervention.
      Frequency of preventable damages associated with medical care measured with GAPPS® as
      screening tools. Safety culture survey. Length of the transfer before and after the
      intervention.
