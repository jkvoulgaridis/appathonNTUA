  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subchondroplasty procedure has been used to treat bone marrow edema mostly located in the
      periarticular region of the knee. In the past few years, it has expanded its use in the foot
      and ankle. There has, however, been very minimal research documented on its utilization in
      that area. The study's hypothesis is that use of calcium phosphate bone substitute in the
      foot and ankle to treat bone marrow edema will have more favorable short and long-term
      outcomes than joint destructive and joint sparing procedures more commonly performed for
      treatment in the past.

      Subchondroplasty procedure has been used to treat bone marrow edema mostly located in the
      periarticular region of the knee. In the past few years, it has expanded its use in the foot
      and ankle. There has, however, been very minimal research documented on its utilization in
      that area. Bone marrow edema arises from altered stresses on bones due to osteoarthritis,
      biomechanical abnormalities, coalitions, infection, and trauma. This study is aimed to
      prospectively evaluate the course of treatment and outcomes of painful bone marrow lesions in
      these associated podiatric circumstances using Subchondroplasty. This should, therefore,
      expose this modality as a viable treatment option for bone marrow edema.

      Patients will be evaluated in the office/clinic setting with a positive diagnosis of bone
      marrow edema confirmed via MRI. They must have failed 3 months of conservative treatment
      measures including, but not limited to, orthotic modifications, taping, immobilization or
      offloading, and anti-inflammatories. Patient population includes individuals over the age of
      18 with no significant comorbidities or previous foot and ankle surgical interventions. These
      patients will go on to have calcium phosphate mineral compound injected into the bone marrow
      lesions. We will track the progression of their symptoms and evaluate via VAS scores AOFAS at
      3 months, 6 months, and 1-year follow-ups.

      The Subchondroplasty procedure is a viable treatment option for bone marrow edema in the
      setting of altered pedal biomechanics, gait abnormalities, osteoarthritis, and trauma. It is
      a minimally invasive procedure that maximizes positive outcomes, allows the patient to be
      immediately weight bearing following surgery, and has short OR times. This surgical procedure
      is a new and innovative technique introduced to the podiatric field that will allow the
      surgeon to intervene at an earlier stage in efforts to alleviate symptoms.
