  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of a heterologous 2-dose
      regimen utilizing Ad26.ZEBOV (first vaccination; Dose 1) and MVA-BN-Filo (second vaccination;
      Dose 2) administered intramuscularly (IM) on Days 1 and 57, respectively.

          -  History of Ebola virus disease (EVD), or prior exposure to Ebola virus, including

          -  Having received any experimental candidate Ad26- or modified vaccinia ankara
             (MVA)-based vaccine in the past

          -  Known allergy or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines
             or vaccine products (including any of the constituents of the study vaccines [for
             example, polysorbate 80, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or L-histidine for
             Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine; tris (hydroxymethyl)-amino methane (THAM) for MVA-BN-Filo vaccine
             and Neisseria meningitidis polysaccharide or tetanus toxoid for MenACWY]), including
             known allergy to chicken or egg proteins and aminoglycosides (gentamicin)

          -  Presence of acute illness (this does not include minor illnesses such as mild diarrhea
             or mild upper respiratory tract infection) or axillary temperature greater than or
             equal to (&gt;=) 37.5 degree celsius on Day 1. Participants with such symptoms will be
             excluded from enrollment at that time but may be rescheduled for enrollment at a later
             date
