      Background and rationale of the study:

      Patients undergoing non-cardiac major surgery show a perioperative cardiac risk and
      postoperative complications, that can be stratified based on parameters linked to patient's
      conditions and to surgery types.

      An accurate identification of this risk could offer numerous advantages for these patients,
      who's 30-day mortality is around 2%. The identification of the correct risk could lead to a
      better pre- and postoperative management, that could guarantee a better surgery outcome and a
      faster postoperative recovery.

      To this day there is no perfect method to correctly estimate this risk. Various studies show
      that high BNP levels are linked to cardiac events at 30 and 180 days. Further investigations
      identify different groups, at low, intermediate and high risk, based on BNP levels.

      BNP is released by ventricular myocytes in response to a wall distress, due to an increased
      volume, pressure or myocardial ischemia.

      So BNP plasma levels could be used as a prognostic and diagnostic marker, improving the
      cardiac risk stratification in patients undergoing surgery and a much more precise
      management.

      This study is determined to do an evaluation of the correlations between pre- and
      postoperative BNP levels and the incidence of cardiac events in patients undergoing major
      vascular surgery.

      Patient's informed consent signature for adhesion at the study will be initially requested.
      With their acceptance, parameters will be recorded anonymously in the Case Report Form,
      identified by their initials and a numeric code, until hospital discharge.

      The parameters analyzed will be related to:

        -  preoperative evaluation: anamnesis, health general conditions, METs, preoperative
           monitoring, in particularly BNP basal levels;

        -  intraoperative evaluation: intraoperative monitoring;

        -  postoperative evaluation: BNP and cTnI levels at 24 and 48 hours, and about pulmonary,
           cardiovascular, neurological and surgical postoperative complications, based on the
           medical record.

      The data will be transferred on Excel worksheet, utilized for descriptive analysis related at
      every variable.
