  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine a novel interpersonal target; namely, parent-teen conversations
      about youth health behavior change. The rationale is that parents have profound impacts on
      teen risk and vulnerability. Yet parents receive minimal training in the elements of
      conversations that optimally inspire their children toward engaging in healthy behaviors. A
      theoretically grounded and reliable taxonomy of behavior change techniques (BCTs) will be
      used as a basis for scientifically deriving the conversational elements, or micro-mechanisms,
      that reduce parent-teen conflict and facilitate upward spirals of healthful behavior change.
      This proposal builds on pilot data from a recently completed NICHD-funded R01 in which a
      sleep treatment improved sleep and reduced risk on selected outcomes in youth. While
      sleep-related health behaviors will be the focus of this R21, the research is designed to be
      relevant to a broad range of health behavior change. As part of an Administrative Supplement
      to the R21 awarded in Fall, 2019, two changes are made. First, measures of psychophysiology
      have been added to the Hot Topics Task. Second, an independent sample of teens who are
      healthy sleepers (n = 20), and their parents, will be tested on the protocol twice, 9 weeks
      apart. This comparison group is included to control for the passage of time and for
      completing the protocol twice. They do not receive an intervention.

    <description>The Parent Behavior Change Intervention (PBC-I) is a behavioral intervention intended to teach parent behavior change techniques to better support their adolescents to improve sleep health behavior. The Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) is comprised of cross-cutting interventions, 'core modules' and 'optional modules'. TranS-C is derived and adapted from our previous disorder-focused research, firmly grounded in basic science and treatment literature.</description>
