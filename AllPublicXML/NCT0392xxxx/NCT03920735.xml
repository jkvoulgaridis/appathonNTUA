  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of a cohort of consecutive non-selected patients from the Strasbourg University
      Hospital, and therefore representative of the real life, will allow better identifying the
      risk factors for these infections (by comparison with a cohort of patient with similar
      conditions of immunosuppression and no infection) and improving the diagnosis and therapeutic
      management.

      The primary objective is to identify prognosis factors affecting survival in patients with
      opportunistic infections
