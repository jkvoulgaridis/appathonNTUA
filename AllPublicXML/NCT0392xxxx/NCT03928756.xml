  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this formative study is to test and iteratively refine a new mobile phone
      app, which delivers assessments and tailored intervention content. The study will use social
      media advertisements to recruit a total of 40 youth between the ages of 16-24 years. Those
      screening positive for past-month binge drinking or marijuana use will be invited to complete
      a baseline survey, download and use the app for 30 days, and complete a follow-up survey
      about the app functionality, design and content, and preliminary outcomes (intentions and
      importance of reducing use).

      Previously, the study team developed a prototype mobile application which utilized novel
      engagement strategies to enhance user adherence with daily and weekly survey assessments. The
      new app developed for this study extends the previous app by featuring the capability to also
      deliver tailored health intervention. As part of the app, users are prompted to complete
      brief daily and weekly assessments for 30 days. For each completed assessment, users earn
      small financial rewards and points to unlock new fish that populate a virtual aquarium in the
      app. The app also features push notifications with survey reminders and life insights (or
      graphs plotting data collected over time) to increase user engagement with the app.
      Additionally, each day, users are randomized to receive intervention content (see the
      &quot;Interventions&quot; section for more information) tailored on their recent assessment responses.
      After 30 days of using the app, participants will be asked to complete a follow-up survey;
      data collected will provide preliminary feedback regarding the feasibility and effectiveness
      of using the app to deliver substance use intervention content to affected youth.
