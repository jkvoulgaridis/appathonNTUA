  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a comprehensive, multiomic study that will integrate longitudinal
      data associating changes in specific gut bacteria and host in response to prebiotic fiber
      supplementation. These data will guide the development of an integrative biological signature
      relating bacterial-derived metabolites with biological outcome in the host. The open sharing
      of data generated by the proposed research represents a significant public resource that will
      support and accelerate future novel studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenolics-rich prebiotic fiber has been correlated with a number of positive health outcomes,
      however their bioavailability is typically low. A large portion the gut microbiota metabolize
      these fibers releasing a range of phenolic acids, which are believed to be principle
      bioactive components driving reduction in disease risk. Despite this, little evidence exists
      linking specific gut bacteria with the metabolites they produce and the downstream biological
      effects that these compounds exert. With this study, the investigators propose to assemble a
      cohort of healthy individuals that will receive prebiotic supplementation, during
      comprehensive, longitudinal characterization of the microbiota and host changes with clinical
      markers and multiple omics assays. These multiomic data will then be integrated, generating
      unique biological signatures that define the role that microbial metabolites from specific
      bacteria play in host biological activity. To validate the biological function of these
      microbial metabolites, gnobiotic mice will be inoculated with the microbial strains
      identified. The newly identified metabolites will also be synthesized in vitro to demonstrate
      their structure, biological properties and applications. Through this study the investigators
      expect to gain a detailed and clear understanding of the physiological changes, at the
      mechanistic level, that occur in the microbiome and host in response to dietary
      supplementation with prebiotic fiber.
