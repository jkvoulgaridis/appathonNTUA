  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators proposed to conduct a retrospective study to evaluate the impact of the
      implementation of apTeleCare software on the management of dialysis patients at home in terms
      of the number and duration of hospitalizations. For this purpose, the investigators will
      compare patients' data over a 2-year interval before the introduction of Telemonitoring
      (January 2012 and December 2013 inclusive - Group 1) with patients data who have benefited
      from this application (between August 2016 and July 2018).
