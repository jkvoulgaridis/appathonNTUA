  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cordyceps and Rhodiola are two common herbal supplements marketed and consumed as adaptogens
      to athletes with regard to enhanced performance. The effects of these supplements has been
      well studied in animals but whether or not the same effects translate to humans is still
      unclear. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to determine whether combined
      supplementation of Rhodiola and Cordyceps, compared to Rhodiola alone and placebo, will
      demonstrate a greater improvement in oxygen consumption (ie. VO2 max).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Herbal supplements are consumed worldwide with surveys approximating five billion dollars
      spent annually by consumers in the United States alone. Herbal supplements, such as Rhodiola
      and Cordyceps, both of which are considered to be adaptogens, remain popular among athletes.
      These adaptogens act as antioxidants, which have been speculated to confer endurance
      performance benefits by delaying muscle fatigue via the attenuation of muscle damage
      accumulation and its related by-products during prolonged or exhaustive exercise.
      Nevertheless, previous research investigating the individual effects of Rhodiola and
      Cordyceps on aerobic training performance remain equivocal. Moreover, literature elucidating
      the potential additive effects of Rhodiola and Cordyceps in human subjects are scarce.
      Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to determine the acute, additive influence of
      oral Rhodiola and Cordyceps supplementation on VO2 max, with secondary variables of interest
      being plasma glucose and lactate concentration, and measures of gastrointestinal distress.

    <description>Section 1 contains 6 questions assessing upper abdominal problems (reflux, heartburn, bloating, cramps, vomiting, and nausea). Section 2 contains 7 questions assessing lower abdominal problems (intestinal cramps, flatulence, urge to defecate, left abdominal pain, right abdominal pain, loose stool, and diarrhea). Section 3 contains 4 questions assessing systematic problems (dizziness, headache, muscle cramp, and urge to urinate). Each of the 17 questions is answered using a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (no problem at all) to 10 (the worst it has ever been). Each of the 3 sections will be scored separately. Section 1 will be scored on a scale of 0-60. Section 2 will be scored on a scale of 0-70. Section 3 will be scored on a scale of 0-40.</description>
