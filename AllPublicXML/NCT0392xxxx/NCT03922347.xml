    <textblock>
      This study is a community trial that aims to establish and evaluate an mHealth screening and
      promotional tool for improving eye health in Iran. Sampling frame is a region in Tehran
      province with around 1 million sub-urban and rural inhabitants. investigators have obtained
      the list of health centers and their underserved population from the health authorities. In
      this region, health services are delivered through rural health houses, urban health posts
      and overhead health centers (221 units in total). investigators choose 27 units using cluster
      random sampling method with a probability proportional to size strategy, then investigators
      randomly assign them into three arms (explained below). The interventions will be at
      community level with the community as the unit of randomization.

      Arm 1- Training of the Primary Health Care (PHC) workers + PHC workers will be empowered with
      the mHealth tool to monitor, screen and promote community members Arm 2- PHC system will be
      strengthened with health promotion and screening programmes (same content as the mHealth
      tool) and PHC workers will deliver eye health messages and screening tests by the
      conventional facilities.

      Arm 3: Control group: only observation and registering of routine care
