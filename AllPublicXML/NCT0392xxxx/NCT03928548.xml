      The purpose of this study is to establish the validity of the adult and pediatric
      Malnutrition Clinical Characteristics (MCC). In addition, this project will: examine the
      relationship between the MCC and an objective measure of body composition; and establish the
      relationship between in-patient Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) care and medical
      outcomes for all in-patients requiring nutrition care, and specifically for malnourished
      patients. Sixty pediatric and 60 adult in-patient acute care facilities will participate in
      this research study. The total number of participants enrolled across the 120 facilities will
      be between 2400-9600.

      The aims of the study include:

        1. Assess the interrater reliability of the MCC.

        2. Determine the predictive validity of the adult and pediatric MCC relative to a portfolio
           of patient medical outcomes.

        3. Determine the relationship between the adult and pediatric MCC and body composition
           measurements conducted via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in a subset of
           patients.

        4. Identify the utility of BIA for body composition analysis in clinical settings.

        5. Estimate the level of RDN care necessary to improve patient outcomes within the
           portfolio of outcomes. Specifically: quantify the dose (minutes of care and frequency of
           encounters) of RDN care that is associated with improved medical outcomes in patients
           already identified as requiring nutrition care, after adjusting for disease severity and
           other potential confounders.

        6. Identify the additional level of RDN care necessary to improve the medical outcomes in
           patients who have been identified as malnourished using the MCC.
