  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a widely prevalent virus in the general US population, has been shown
      to be associated with increased inflammation and mortality. Previous small pilot studies have
      demonstrated that latent CMV may be reactivated during chemotherapy in cancer patients, and
      may be associated with unfavorable cancer outcomes such as fatigue and increased mortality.

      The central research idea for this study, supported by previous preliminary data, is that CMV
      reactivation is an unrecognized complicating factor in the treatment of ovarian cancer that
      impacts patient outcomes. The overarching goals of this observational study are:

        -  To assess how CMV infection is associated with ovarian cancer symptoms over the course
           of the disease and its treatment.

        -  To describe the relationship between CMV reactivation in ovarian cancer patients,
           survival, fatigue, and other QOL outcomes, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

    <description>Cancer-related fatigue will be measured using the Fatigue Symptom Inventory. The scale is composed of 14 items (one is not scored). A total Disruption Index is calculated by summing items 5-11 (each item ranges from 0-10). A lower score indicates lower fatigue. Possible range is 0-70.</description>
