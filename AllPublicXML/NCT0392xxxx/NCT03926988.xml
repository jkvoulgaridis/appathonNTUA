      This is a prospective, open label, multi-center registry designed to assess the safety,
      performance and efficacy of the NeVa stent retriever in the treatment of large vessel
      occlusion strokes. Up to 400 subjects at up 20 sites will participate in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria: Only subjects already treated with the NeVa devices can be considered
        for enrollment.

          1. Clinical signs and symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke,
             and subject belongs to one of the following subgroups:

             1.1. Subject has failed IV t-PA therapy

             1.2. Subject is contraindicated for IV t-PA administration

          2. Age ≥18

          3. NIHSS score ≥ 6

          4. Pre-stroke mRS score of ≤ 1

          5. Intracranial arterial occlusion of the distal intracranial carotid artery or middle
             cerebral artery (M1/M2), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), posterior cerebral artery
             (PCA), basilar artery, or vertebral artery demonstrated with DSA.

          6. Thrombectomy procedure can be initiated within 24 hours from symptom onset (defined as
             time last known well [TLKW])

          7. Imaging Inclusion Criteria:

             7.1. Non-Contrast CT Selection (if CT Perfusion or MRI not utilized): ASPECTS 6-10 if
             treatment started 0-6 hours from TLKW ASPECTS 8-10 if treatment started 6-24 hours
             from TLKW

             7.2. CT Perfusion core ≤50 cc

             7.3. MRI DWI core ≤50 cc

          8. Subject or legal representative is able and willing to give informed consent within 48
             hours after the intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-existing medical neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound the
             neurological or functional evaluations, e.g. dementia with prescribed
             anti-cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g. Aricept).

          2. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, significant cardiac arrhythmia, evidence of ongoing
             myocardial infarction, concern for pre- treatment pulmonary aspiration.

          3. Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or stroke in multiple territories

          4. Cerebral vasculitis

          5. History of severe allergy to contrast medium.

          6. Known allergy to NeVa materials (nitinol, stainless steel)

          7. Suspicion of aortic dissection, septic embolus, or bacterial endocarditis

          8. Systemic infection

          9. Significant mass effect with midline shift

         10. Evidence of intracranial tumor (except small meningioma)

         11. Inability to deploy NeVA device for at least one pass for any other reason

         12. Life expectancy less than 6 months

         13. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes an
             endovascular procedure or poses a significant hazard to the subject if an endovascular
             procedure was performed.
