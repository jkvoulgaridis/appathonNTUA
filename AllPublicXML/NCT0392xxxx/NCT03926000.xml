  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient arthroscopic knee surgery can be performed with general or regional anesthesia.
      Recent data suggest that spinal and epidural anesthesia require longer discharge times than
      the newer shorter-acting general anesthetic drugs. Ideal premedication drug should relieve
      anxiety, produce amnesia and sedation, decrease secretions, prevent nausea and vomiting, have
      dose sparing effect on the anaesthetic drugs, and suppress pressor response to laryngoscopy
      and intubation. Recently, gabapentin and pregabalin were suggested as pre-operative drugs to
      decrease anxiety, stress response to laryngoscopy and post operative pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      112 patients undergoing elective knee arthroscopy will randomly divided into two equal
      groups, 56 patients each. All patients will receive premedication one hour before the
      procedure. PG group will receive 150 mg pregabalin and C group will receive placebo. All
      patients will receive total intravenous anesthesia to achieve optimum working conditions.
      Intra-operative total amount of anesthetics will be compared in both groups.
