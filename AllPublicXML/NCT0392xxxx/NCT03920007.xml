      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of SAR439483 administered as a
      unilateral subretinal injection in patients with Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) caused by
      autosomal recessive guanylate cyclase 2D (GUCY2D) mutations (GUCY2D-LCA).

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of ascending doses of SAR439483 administered as a unilateral
      subretinal injection in patients with GUCY2D-LCA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study duration per participant is approximately 112 weeks including: an approximately 56-day
      screening/baseline period, an approximately 52-week study observation period including 1
      treatment day, and an approximately 52-week safety follow-up period. The end of study visit
      will be approximately 104 weeks after the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP)
      administration.

      After completion of the main study (DFI14738), participants may have the option to enroll in
      a separate long-term follow-up study, in which case they would no longer continue in DFI14738
      and their end of study visit would be conducted at Week 52.

      The study is separated into 2 parts including a dose escalation phase (Part A) and a dose
      expansion phase (Part B). In Part B participants will be treated at the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) determined from Part A.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Male or female participant with clinical diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis
             caused by biallelic mutations in the GUCY2D (retinal guanylate cyclase) gene with all
             of the following: a) Documented mutations in both alleles of the GUCY2D gene per
             testing in a CLIA-approved laboratory, b) For Cohort 1-3, best corrected visual acuity
             (BCVA) of 20/200 or worse in the eye to be injected; subsequent cohorts may include
             BCVA of 20/80 or worse in the eye to be injected, c) Photoreceptor (outer nuclear)
             layer structure identifiable on an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan across the
             central retina.

          -  Age ≥18 years for Cohorts 1 through 4, and age ≥ 6 years and &lt;18 years for Cohort 5.

          -  Male and female participants must follow the contraception requirements of the trial.

          -  Participants must agree to not donate blood, organs, tissues, cells or sperm for at
             least three months following SAR439483 administration.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Complicating systemic diseases (such as medical conditions causing immunosuppression)
             that would preclude the gene transfer, ocular surgery or planned study procedures.

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Pre-existing eye conditions in the study eye that would preclude the planned surgery
             or interfere with the assessment and interpretation of study endpoints: for example,
             glaucoma or optic neuropathy that has resulted in significant visual loss, corneal or
             lenticular abnormalities or opacities that would preclude view of the fundus or
             performance of the outcome measures, uveitis, retinopathy and maculopathy that in the
             opinion of the Investigator are causing significant visual loss.

          -  Presence of significant ocular abnormalities in the study eye that in the opinion of
             the Investigator would preclude the planned surgery, effective safety follow-up, or
             interfere with the interpretation of study endpoints (eg, glaucoma, corneal or
             significant lens abnormalities or opacities, pre-existing uveitis, intraocular
             infection, choroidal neovascularization).

          -  Any contraindication to the planned surgical procedure, such as contraindications to
             the use of anaesthesia or allergy to medications planned in the peri-operative period.

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational medicinal
             product (IMP), diagnostic agents used during the study or medications planned for use
             in the peri-operative period, particularly corticosteroids.

          -  Women who are pregnant (defined as positive beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG)
             blood or urine test), lactating or breastfeeding.

          -  Any ocular procedure, either planned or performed within 6 months of Day 1, which
             would interfere with the planned surgery or the interpretation of study endpoints in
             the opinion of the Principal Investigator (PI).

          -  Laboratory test abnormalities or abnormalities in electrocardiogram that in the
             opinion of the PI would make the participant unsuitable for participation in the
             study.

          -  Significant intercurrent illness or infection during the 28 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Current substance use disorder.

          -  Use of any investigational agent administered within 5 times the elimination half-life
             of that investigational agent prior to SAR439483 administration.

          -  Enrollment in any other clinical treatment study, for any condition, including those
             relating to GUCY2D-LCA, throughout the duration of the SAR439483 study participation.

          -  Use of anticoagulation therapy within two weeks prior to surgery.

          -  Use of immunosuppressive medications.

          -  Current, planned during the course of this trial, or past (within 5 times the
             elimination half-life of that therapy prior to SAR439483 administration) use of
             anti-viral therapy that would inactivate the investigational agent.

          -  Received gene therapy within the last 15 years.
