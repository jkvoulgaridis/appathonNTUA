  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an estimated 150,000 patients, a knee joint replacement is performed in Germany every
      year. The perioperative care of the patients aims at an optimal surgical technique, which
      leads to a high functionality in the joint, and above all at an adequate pain treatment.
      Patients experience pain especially intraoperatively and in the first days after the
      operation. The intensity of pain is a decisive factor that can hinder the patient's
      mobilization. In the KneeOptOut study (ethics application number EA4/009/17), which has
      already been successfully carried out and approved by this ethics committee, it was shown
      that the use of local infiltration anaesthesia (LIA) for pain therapy after primary knee
      endoprosthetics is comparable to catheter-supported regional anaesthesia (manuscript under
      review at the European Journal of Anaesthesiology). During surgery, the morphine requirement
      of patients in the LIA group was significantly higher than that of patients who underwent
      catheterization. Postoperatively, however, both subjective pain by VAS and opiate consumption
      were comparable.

      In order to optimize the intraoperative opiate need/consumption, an early-intraoperative
      procedure for local infiltration anesthesia will now be compared with the previous
      late-intraoperative procedure. Both procedures correspond to SOP for the treatment of primary
      knee endoprostheses and are currently used depending on the surgeon's requirements.
