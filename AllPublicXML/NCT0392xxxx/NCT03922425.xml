      A single-blinded hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial (Type II), that both evaluates the
      intervention outcomes (clinical and service use outcomes) through patient-randomization in
      the implementation sites, as well as evaluates the implementation strategy chosen for the
      intervention and its impact on implementation outcomes (e.g. adoption, fidelity,
      acceptability and maintenance (continued implementation) of the intervention).

      The overall goal of the study is to contribute to improving the level of functioning and
      quality of life and mental health outcomes for people with severe and enduring mental ill
      health (SMI) (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression) by adapting and upscaling the
      implementation of a community-based service delivery model in Montenegro. Effectiveness
      component of the trial: Multidisciplinary community mental health teams for people with SMI.
      The intervention condition offers flexible, assertive community treatment (FACT) in the
      community for people with SMI. FACT can intensify (e.g. provide more intensive treatment in
      the form of daily home visits, crisis care at home, more intensive evidence-based
      psycho-social and pharmacological treatments) or provide less intensive treatment depending
      on client need. It can also provide less intensive care during non-crisis periods, offering
      routine home treatment where a combination of psychological and pharmacological treatments
      (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, family-based interventions)
      are offered, as well as care processes (reviewing recovery and crisis/treatment plans, and
      the clients' Wellness Recovery Action Plan), and social care interventions (assistance in
      obtaining or maintaining employment, looking for reasonable accommodation options). Care
      offered in this project in the intervention condition will be provided by a multidisciplinary
      community mental health team (CMHT), consisting of a diverse set of professionals including
      psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and social workers, that deliver integrated medical and
      social care that are focused on (symptomatic-, functional- and personal-) recovery. CMHTs
      will provide home-based treatment inclusive of crisis resolution services and procedures for
      early recognition of sub-clinical psychosis and bipolar disorder, ACT, and intensive case
      management. Integrated care (i.e. health and social care interventions) will be provided to
      all clients. Furthermore, health and social care evidence-based interventions for severe
      mental illnesses will be employed during home treatment, such as family-based interventions,
      motivational interviewing, and cognitive behavioral therapies, combined with medication
      management and identifying employment (paid and unpaid options) and support in finding and
      maintaining this employment, (Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) recovery groups and
      housing opportunities. Comparison condition: Usual care Health care settings and their
      providers randomized to the control condition receive usual care.

    <description>World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2 (WHODAS2) measures health and disability-level of functioning in 6 domains:Cognition, Mobility, Self-care,Getting along, Life activities, Participation in community activities.The instrument is self-reporting; can be administered by a health worker if needed. Answers are distributed into 5 categories:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;mild&quot;,&quot;moderate&quot;,&quot;severe&quot;and&quot;extreme or cannot do&quot;. It ends with 3 items where answers are presented as number of days (when difficulties were present). Score on any dimension ranges 0 to 7, results are depicted in a diagram which reflects relation between dimensions(the higher the score, the lower level of difficulties/better functioning) and changes over time</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Euro Quality of Life Index (Euro QoL 5-D 3-L). The instrument measures five dimensions: Mobility, Self-care, Daily activities, Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/ Depression. Each dimension can be rated at three levels: from no problems to major problems. The five dimensions can be summed into a descriptive health state with 11111 representing no problems in any of the five health dimensions and 33333 indicating major problems in any of the five health dimensions. Second part of the instrument is the Visual Analogue Scale to assess health status at baseline, where 0 signifies worst imaginable health state, and 100 signifies best imaginable health state.</description>
