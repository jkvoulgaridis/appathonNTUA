  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to experience depression as nondiabetic
      individuals, and depression in turn increases the risk of diabetes. Clinical care for
      patients for either condition usually fails to consider the impact of sex and gender on
      tests, diagnosis and treatment, and evidence on these impacts is limited. The investigators
      aim to assess the impact of a continuing professional education activity (CPD) on diabetes
      and depression that includes considerations of sex and gender on the clinical behaviours of
      French-speaking healthcare professionals in Canada.

      In a non-randomised controlled trial, the investigators are assessing the impacts of two CPD
      activities on depression and diabetes, one that includes considerations of sex and gender,
      and an identical one that omits sex and gender considerations, on French-speaking healthcare
      professionals' self-reported clinical behaviors regarding sex and gender considerations
      post-intervention and at 3 months. Data collection will occur in three distinct locations in
      Canada. Project development, data collection and analysis and dissemination of results will
      all integrate considerations of sex and gender. The process of creating a CPD activity that
      integrates considerations of sex and gender could be scaled up to other CPD activities in
      other clinical subjects and in other minority languages.

    <description>Clinical behavioural intention to integrate considerations of sex and gender into the diagnosis and treatment of depression and diabetes, using the validated CPD-REACTION scale. CPD=continuing professional development, REACTION=a theoRy-basEd instrument to assess the impACT of continuing professional development activities on professional behavIOr chaNge. A 12-item Likert-type scale (i.e., Strongly disagree = 1, Strongly agree = 7; Never = 1, Always = 7, etc.) evaluates 5 constructs: 1) intention; 2) social influence; 3) beliefs about capabilities; 4) moral norms; and 5) beliefs about consequences. Sociodemographic questions are asked on sex, age (10 age ranges), province, rural/urban/semi-rural practice, and language of consultation. Mean, standard deviation, median and frequencies are calculated to summarize participant characteristics and questionnaire item responses. Construct scores are obtained by calculating the mean score for the items.</description>
