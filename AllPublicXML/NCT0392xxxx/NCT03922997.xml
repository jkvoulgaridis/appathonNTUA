    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, single-arm, multicenter study of the long-term safety and efficacy of
      atezolizumab treatment in patients with Stage IIIb or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) who have progressed following standard systemic chemotherapy (including if given in
      combination with anti-PD-1 therapy or after anti-PD-1 as monotherapy).

    <description>EQ-5D-5L, EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire is a self-report health status questionnaire that consists of six questions used to calculate a health utility score for use in health economic analysis. The EuroQol EQ-5D has two components: a five-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analog scale (VAS) that measures health state. Overall scores range from 0 to 1, with low scores representing a higher level of dysfunction.</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-LC13, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire—Supplemental Lung Cancer Module will be used to assess self-reported outcomes. EORTC QLQ-LC13 includes 13 items that address key lung cancer symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and site-specific pain), treatment-related adverse effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy and alopecia) and pain medication. The dysphagia scale is multi-item, while the rest are single-item scales.</description>

             chemotherapy. Patients who have discontinued first-line or second-line systemic

             eligible.

          -  The last dose of prior systemic anticancer therapy must have been administered ≥ 21
             days prior to the first study treatment.

             or MRI evaluation during screening and prior radiographic evaluation, are eligible

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          -  Adequate hematologic and end-organ function

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent or use
             contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the
             treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab

          -  Patients must have recovered from all acute toxicities from previous therapy,
             excluding alopecia and toxicities related to prior anti-PD-1-therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion oncogene

          -  Symptomatic CNS metastases

          -  Spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation or
             previously diagnosed and treated spinal cord compression without evidence that disease
             has been clinically stable for ≥ 2 weeks prior to the first study treatment

          -  Leptomeningeal disease

          -  Uncontrolled pericardial effusion or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures

          -  Pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant during the study

             with the protocol, including significant liver disease

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease

          -  Significant renal disorder requiring dialysis or indication for renal transplant

          -  Treatment with any other investigational agent or participation in another clinical
             trial with therapeutic intent within 28 days prior to study treatment initiation

          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to study treatment initiation or
             anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study
             other than for diagnosis

          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation
