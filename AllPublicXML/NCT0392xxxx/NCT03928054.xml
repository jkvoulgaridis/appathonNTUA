      INTRODUCTION: The Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of joint disease, its features
      include joint space narrowing, osteophytes formation of the joint margins, motor deficit,
      reduced strength, and persistent pain. As a treatment option physiotherapy has several
      resources for the patient approach. However, the effect of treatment is not only the
      application of therapeutic techniques and resources but also to existing contextual factors
      such as the therapeutic alliance. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of an intervention with
      the focus on positive therapeutic alliance in subjects OA knee on pain and disability.
      METHODS: This is a randomized study of two arms with a blind evaluator. 40 subjects were
      randomized into 2 groups: group 1 &quot;Kinesio Taping® KT&quot; group 2 &quot; Kinesio Taping® with
      therapeutic alliance KT+AT&quot;. Both groups received the application of Kinesio Taping® method
      as the concepts of the original method. The group &quot;KT+AT&quot; session was conducted in order to
      increase the relationship between the therapist and the patient.
