  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The walk and bike practice are two physical activities the most cited for benefits of
      physical activity thanks to their progressive and soft characters adapted to patients
      suffering from chronic diseases (diabetes, obesity, cancer...) with muscular deficit
      cardio-respiratory.

      However, cycling may, depending on the natural land, imply efforts and
      articular-muscular-tendon pressions more important particularly in hilly natural land.

      Moreover, lots of physical and physiological barriers oppose to the bike practice in the
      population of patients with chronic diseases. The electric bike can be useful.

      This electric bike will be powerful but safe, totally programmable to adapt to patients,
      slope, rehabilitation objectives but very easy to use.

      From medicine, it is necessary to ensure a moderate and regular effort regarding patients.

      To do this, it is necessary to individualize adjustments of electric bike to have a
      progressive rehabilitation program and a progressive load force.

      It needs to dispose monitoring and evaluation tools in real situations outside (lots of
      physiological and technical sensors). The intelligent electric bike for health proposes to be
      in accordance to this specifications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to validate the technical and organizational feasibility of
      workshops using the intelligent electric bike for health with different devices such as two
      connected vests (non-invasive) measuring on the one hand the cardiological and respiratory
      parameters (connected vest named : Etisens) and the other hand the kinetic energy of movement
      (connected vest named : Optimove).

      The development of this ambulatory physiology platform and the engine brake create
      perspectives for an outdoor rehabilitation tool that for example could stimulate, on an
      altitude free-excursion, a mountain pass of Alpes doing the link of health, sport and
      well-being.
