  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study patients with elective surgery will wear two devices (HealthDot and Elan) after
      surgery in hospital and after discharge at home for up to 2 weeks (HealthDot) or 3 weeks
      (Elan). The HealthDot will measure heart rate, posture, activity and respiratory rate which
      are stored on the device as well as sent to Philips. The Elan device will measure PPG and
      accelerometer data which is transferred to Philips. The data collected will be used for
      algorithm development. Data will be analysed retrospectively and compared to readmission and
      adverse events to see if the events could have been predicted due to the collected data by
      the devices. No clinical decisions will be based on the measurements done during the study.
