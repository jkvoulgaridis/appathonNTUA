  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed as a prospective, non-randomised, single centre study to
      determine the predictive utility of Short Term Variation (STV) of the Fetal Heart Rate
      (FHR)from the intrapartum FHR data collected using the portable fetal ECG monitor (Monica
      AN24) in women requiring continuous monitoring during labour due to antenatal or intrapartum
      risk factors.

    <description>This is a feasibility study with a primary objective to establish design of a large multi-centre study. Outcome measure is percentage number of participants to have a umbilical blood cord gas PH level below 7.20. This will inform the statistical sample for the larger study.</description>

    <description>This is a feasibility study with a primary objective to establish design of a large multi-centre study. Outcome measure is how many participants recruited per month this will inform how many centre's will be required to deliver statistical sample size for larger study.</description>

    <description>This is a feasibility study with a primary objective to establish design of a large multi-centre study. Outcome measure is number of completed data sets. A complete data set equals more than one hour of recorded data from mobile fetal heart rate monitor and arterial umbilical cord blood gas level taken. This will inform estimated sample size for larger study.</description>
