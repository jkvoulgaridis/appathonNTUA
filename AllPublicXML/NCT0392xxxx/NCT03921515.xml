      Background:

      The way the body heals and protects itself from getting sick is called the immune response.
      Some people with weak immune systems get sick often or get rashes and skin infections.
      Researchers want to find out how the immune system and skin problems are related so they can
      help these people.

      Objective:

      To learn about how immune response and skin healing are related to each other.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18-65 with hyper IgE syndrome or Job syndrome or people ages 7-65 with chronic
      granulomatous disease. Healthy volunteers ages 18 65 are also needed.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Possible urine tests

      Participants will have 1 to 3 visits within about a week. Visits will include the following:

      Participants will have a wells device strapped to the inside of the forearm. It will suction
      the skin and pull the top layer away to form 8 blisters. The skin over the blisters and the
      liquid inside will be collected.

      Participants will have up to 4 skin biopsies. A sharp tool will remove a small plug of skin
      from the forearm.

      Participants may have blood and urine tests.

      The skin on participants skin will be rubbed with a cotton swab.

      Some participants will have an overnight visit. They will have the blister device placed back
      on the arm. The wells will be lined up over the blister wounds. The wells will be filled with
      either saline or the participant s blood serum. The device will be covered and left on the
      arm for up to 24 hours. Doctors will periodically remove some liquid from the wells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of community-associated (CA) staphylococcal infections, especially those caused
      by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has increased in recent years. Skin
      and soft tissues are the primary sites for these infections. Although many patients without
      apparent underlying immune dysfunction suffer from recurrent and persistent skin infections
      with S.aureus, patients with conditions such as hyper immunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES, or Job
      s syndrome) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) are disproportionately affected. Although
      underlying host molecular defects responsible for some of these predisposing conditions have
      been uncovered in recent years, the skin immune response to S. aureus infections has not been
      elucidated in either healthy volunteers or susceptible populations. We hypothesize that the
      local skin response determines susceptibility to S. aureus skin infection.

      In this sample collection protocol, we will perform exploratory evaluations of
      anti-staphylococcal immune responses in healthy volunteers, subjects with HIES, and subjects
      with CGD. Following screening and baseline procedures, including blood draw and skin swab,
      subjects will have the option to undergo blister induction, where a suction device will be
      used to induce skin blisters on the forearm. The tops of the blisters and blister fluid will
      be collected for research testing and storage for future research. An optional overnight
      inpatient stay may be performed to collect additional cellular infiltrates in response to
      autologous serum and/or sterile saline. Subjects may also have up to 4 skin punch biopsies
      from the forearm over the course of a week to capture wound healing progress and identify
      involved genes. All research procedures will be performed at the National Institutes of
      Health Clinical Center (NIH CC).

      The primary objective of this research is to perform ex vivo assessment of wound healing
      pathways using a skin blister model and skin biopsies to obtain keratinocyte cultures and
      evaluate skin immune responses. We will use three experimental approaches: 1) ex vivo
      evaluation of anti-microbial responses and tissue remodeling through derivation of
      keratinocyte cultures from skin blisters and biopsies, 2) in vivo and ex vivo assessment of
      cellular response after blister induction using overnight exposure to autologous serum and/or
      sterile saline, and 3) evaluation of in vivo responses to skin biopsies. We anticipate that
      the research will provide critical new information on the human skin immune and remodeling
      responses and will have direct relevance for the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and
      therapeutics.
