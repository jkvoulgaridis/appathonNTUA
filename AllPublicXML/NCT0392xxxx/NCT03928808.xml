  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pilot study designed to explore the safety, feasibility, tolerability,
      and acceptability of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the treatment of severe and
      enduring anorexia nervosa (SE-AN).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label investigation of 10 individuals seeking inpatient treatment for severe and
      enduring anorexia nervosa. In addition to standard inpatient treatment, patients receive one
      FMT per week for 4 weeks, with follow-ups at 8 weeks and 6 months. Patients will receive 30
      mL of healthy fecal microbial preparation (OpenBiome, FMP30) into the upper GI tract via a
      nasogastric tube weekly for 4 weeks. Primary outcomes are to determine safety, feasibility,
      tolerability, and acceptability of FMT for the treatment of AN. Secondary outcomes are: to
      determine preliminary efficacy as indexed by weight gain and weight retention over follow-up;
      to assess positive change in psychological metrics; to measure the efficiency of microbial
      transfer from the FMT material to the recipient intestinal microbiota; and to determine the
      duration of this effect via repeat stool sampling paired with 16S rRNA gene and/or shallow
      shotgun metagenomics.

    <time_frame>Pre-Treatment through Follow-Up (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The EDE-Q is a 28-item questionnaire measuring eating pathology and is derived directly from the Eating Disorder Examination Interview. The EDE-Q focuses on the past 28 days to assess the main behavioral (eating and purging) and attitudinal features of eating disorders. The 28 items are rated by the participant on a 7-point scale (ranging from 0 to 6), with higher scores indicating increased pathology. The EDE-Q includes 4 subscales: Restraint, Eating Concern, Weight Concern, and Shape Concern. The global score is the average of all 28 items, with a range of 0 to 6.</description>
