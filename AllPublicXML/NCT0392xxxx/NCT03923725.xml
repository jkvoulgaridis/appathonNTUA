      A randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three
      antimalarial drugs versus two antimalarial drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Co-blistered or co-formulated Triple Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (TACTs) could be
      rapidly deployed in areas with multidrug resistant malaria. For other regions, the safety and
      efficacy of TACTs should be assessed in the local setting in order to guarantee rapid
      deployment in case resistance starts affecting treatment efficacy. Furthermore, deployment of
      TACTs on a wide scale could prevent or delay the emergence and spread of antimalarial
      resistance in areas where this has not yet happened. The efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      TACTs need extensive evaluation in adults and children before policy recommendations can
      change and widespread deployment can be considered. Therefore, we aim to conduct a large
      scale placebo controlled randomized clinical trial in 10 African countries to compare the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of the TACTs artemether-lumefantrine+amodiaquine and
      DHA-piperaquine+mefloquine and the standard Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs)
      artemether-lumefantrine+placebo, and DHA-piperaquine+placebo .

      In addition to the main clinical outcomes of the study, we aim to assess the extent of the
      spread or the de novo emergence of resistance to the antimalarials in the combinations
      through detailed in vivo and in vitro assessments and to study the pharmacokinetics and
      inter-drug interactions of the drugs, the parasite- and host-related factors affecting
      treatment outcomes. Finally, we aim to gain insights into the spread of resistance mediated
      by population movements and parasite gene flows in general through travel surveys and
      geographic localization of parasite genetic data.
