  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase 2 clinical trial, the aim is to evaluate the efficacy of the ER-antagonist
      Fulvestrant in women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) low grade gynecological cancers.
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the response rate (RR) upon Fulvestrant
      treatment, comprising either partial or complete response, as determined by RECIST v1.1
      criteria for each tumor type. The secondary objectives are to: (1) determine progression-free
      survival (PFS) upon Fulvestrant treatment, after 3 years, in each tumor type group (2) assess
      clinical benefit (CB) upon Fulvestrant treatment, comprising complete response, partial
      response and stable disease, as determined by RECIST v1.1 criteria, in each tumor type group
      (3) assess duration of response in each tumor type group (4) assess safety and tolerability
      of Fulvestrant administration in each tumor type group (5) assess quality of life (QoL) and
      symptoms in each tumor type group. As exploratory objectives, the aim is to: (1) evaluate the
      feasibility of 16α-18F-fluoro-17β-estradiol (18F-FES) PET imaging for detection of ER
      expression (2) determine the value of sequential 18F-FES PET scans in predicting response to
      Fulvestrant (3) collect tumor biopsies and cf-DNA from patients enrolled in the trial. These
      samples will be subsequently characterized at the genetic level, to identify adaptive
      response mechanisms to Fulvestrant treatment.

    <description>Quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D questionnaire. EQ-5D has 2 parts—the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analog scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 health states (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), which will be converted into a summary index according to the EQ-5D user guide. The EQ VAS records the self-rated health on an analog scale. For both EQ-5D index and EQ VAS, a higher score indicates a better health status.
Descriptive statistics of the subscores and the summary score at each visit and the difference with baseline will be reported.</description>

    <description>Quality of life as measured by the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire. For EORTC QLQ-C30, functional scores (emotional, role, cognitive, physical, and social) will be pooled and a summary score will be calculated according to Giesinger et al. A higher score indicates better health for functioning and global health status, whereas for the symptom scales a lower score indicates a lower level of symptom burden.
Descriptive statistics of the subscores and the summary score at each visit and the difference with baseline will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Detection of ER expression by 18F-FES PET imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>up to week 156</time_frame>
    <description>16α-18F-fluoro-17β-estradiol (18F-FES) positron emission tomography (PET) technique uses a radiolabeled estrogen derivative and allows non-invasive, repetitive imaging of the ER receptor, mainly the α subtype.
This technique has been validated for measurement of ER expression in breast cancer.
PET parameters will be derived from the PET data at baseline and will be correlated to the treatment response and the survival of the patients (PFS and OS). Liver metastases will not be included in the analysis due to high physiologic background uptake.</description>

    <measure>Predicting response to Fulvestrant by sequential 18F-FES PET imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>up to week 156</time_frame>
    <description>16α-18F-fluoro-17β-estradiol (18F-FES) positron emission tomography (PET) uses a radiolabeled estrogen derivative and allows non-invasive, repetitive imaging of the ER, mainly the α subtype. This technique has been validated for measurement of ER in breast cancer and it has been shown that lesions with no or limited reduction of 18F-FES uptake are at risk for early progression and thus therapy failure.
The relationship between the absolute value of the PET parameters, and their change between baseline and Week 4, will be correlated to treatment response and survival of the patients.
The hypothesis is that responding patients will have a median reduction of FES uptake on pre- and post-fulvestrant 18F-FES-PET (at Week 4) of &gt;75% (based on SUVmax). All patients with CR or PR according to RECIST will be classified as having responded to Fulvestrant treatment. The response rate is hypothesized to be higher in the 18F-FES responder group than in the 18F-FES non-responder group.</description>

             finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of a disease
             or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the
             interpretation of the results, render the patient at high risk from treatment
