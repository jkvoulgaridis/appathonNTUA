        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years old and ≤ 65 years old;

          2. Phase Ib: fasting sUA in the morning of screening period (fasted after 8:00 pm on the
             previous day) of healthy subjects meets the following requirement: 270 umol/l (4.5
             mg/dL) ≤ sUA &lt;420 umol/l (7 mg/dL)

             Phase IIa: hyperuricemia subjects should meet any of the following:

          3. Subject's BMI range is 18.0~32.0 kg/m2 (inclusive);

          4. Female subjects must be non-pregnant and non-lactating, surgically sterilized or ≥ 60

             investigator. Routine urine tests include normal urine creatinine, urine
             protein/creatinine ratio. ECGs are within the normal range or clinically insignificant
             as judged by the principle investigator.

             benzbromarone) within 14 days prior to randomization;

         12. Daily dose of aspirin &gt; 100 mg within 14 days before randomization;

         13. Use of any diuretic within 14 days before randomization;

         14. Use of any Chinese herbal medicine within 14 days before randomization;

         15. History of drug abuse or alcohol abuse (for phase Ib healthy subjects, the screening
             alcohol test and urine drug test are positive);

         16. Any situation that may prevent the subject from completing the study or pose a
             significant risk to the subject as considered by any investigator;

         17. Any other situation that may pose excessive risks to the subject or affect outcome or
             study interpretation as considered by any investigator;
