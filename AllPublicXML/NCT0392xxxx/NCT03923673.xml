  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are studying the safety and efficacy of a minimally invasive treatment called a
      pericardiotomy, which creates a small opening in the sac that surrounds the heart.
      Researchers will test the short and long term effects of this procedure by monitoring
      subjects heart function and symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Age ≥ 30 years

          -  Symptoms of severe dyspnea (III-IV) without evidence of a non-cardiac or ischemic
             explanation for dyspnea

          -  EF of &gt; or = 50% determined on most recent imaging study within the preceding 5 years,
             with no change in clinical status suggesting potential for deterioration in systolic
             function

          -  One of the following:

               -  Previous hospitalization for HF with radiographic evidence (pulmonary venous
                  hypertension, vascular congestion, interstitial edema, pleural effusion) of
                  pulmonary congestion or

               -  Catheterization documented elevated filling pressures at rest (PCWP ≥15 or LVEDP
                  ≥18) or with exercise (PCWP ≥25) or

               -  Elevated NT-proBNP (&gt;400 pg/ml) or BNP(&gt;200 pg/ml) or

               -  Echo evidence of diastolic dysfunction/elevated filling pressures manifest by
                  medial E/e' ratio≥15 and/or left atrial enlargement and chronic treatment with a
                  diuretic for signs or symptoms of heart failure

          -  Heart failure is primary factor limiting activity as indicated by answering # 2 to the
             following question: My ability to be active is most limited by:

               -  Joint, foot, leg, hip or back pain

               -  Shortness of breath and/or fatigue and/or chest pain

               -  Unsteadiness or dizziness

               -  Lifestyle, weather, or I just don't like to be active

               -  Ambulatory (not wheelchair / scooter dependent)

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Left or right ventricular dilatation noted on cardiac imaging study prior to
             enrollment (either echocardiography or MRI).

          -  Any hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt; 8.0 g/dl within 30 days prior to randomization

          -  Acute coronary syndrome within 3 months defined by electrocardiographic (ECG) changes
             and biomarkers of myocardial necrosis (e.g., troponin) in an appropriate clinical
             setting (chest discomfort or anginal equivalent)

          -  PCI, coronary artery bypass grafting, or new biventricular pacing within past 3 months

          -  Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

          -  Known infiltrative cardiomyopathy (amyloid)

          -  Pericardial disease (constriction, pericarditis, tamponade)

          -  Active myocarditis

          -  Complex congenital heart disease

          -  Active collagen vascular disease

             moderate regurgitant lesions)

          -  Acute or chronic severe liver disease as evidenced by any of the following:
             encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, INR &gt; 1.7 in the absence of anticoagulation
             treatment

          -  Terminal illness (other than HF) with expected survival of less than 1 year

          -  Enrollment or planned enrollment in another therapeutic clinical trial in next 3
             months.

          -  Inability to comply with planned study procedures
