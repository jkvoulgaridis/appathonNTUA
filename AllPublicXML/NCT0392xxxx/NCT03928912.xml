  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tibial shaft fractures is common long tubular fracture that account for about 13.7% of all
      fractures. And the incidence of nonunion of tibial shaft fracture varied from 1% to 80%. This
      study aimed to confirm the risk factors of nonunion of tibial shaft fracture. Moreover, the
      investigators hope to establish the clinical pathway of various risk factors for fracture
      nonunion and affirm the importance of different risk factors.

      Tibial shaft fractures is common long tubular fracture that account for about 13.7% of all
      fractures. And the incidence of nonunion of tibial shaft fracture varied from 1% to 80%. The
      investigators retrospectively analyzed the demographics of these participants in our hospital
      that occur long tubular fracture. One group is participants that existed fracture nonunion.
      And the other group is the participants that did not exist fracture nonunion. The
      investigators recorded twelve variables and confirm the risk factors by uni-variate Logistic
      regression analysis. Moreover, the investigators hope to establish the clinical pathway of
      various risk factors for fracture nonunion and affirm the importance of different risk
      factors.

    <description>the Gustilo type of the open fracture can be divided into three types. And the type I is the open fractures with wounds that is clean and smaller than 1cm. Type II is the the open fractures with wounds that is moderately unclean and bigger than 1cm, which also has a wide soft tissue injury. Type III is the all open fractures that accompany with severe soft tissue injury and pollution.</description>
