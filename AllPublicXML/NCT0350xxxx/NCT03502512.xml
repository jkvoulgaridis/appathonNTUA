    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well REVOLVE or PureGraft technique works in processing fat grafts for
      patients who are undergoing breast reconstruction. During breast reconstructive surgery that
      uses autologous fat grafting (transplanting fat tissue from one part of your body to
      another), fat tissue is removed from the body (usually the abdomen, buttock, or thighs) and
      injected into another part of the body. This tissue must be &quot;processed&quot; (sometimes referred
      to as &quot;washed&quot; or &quot;prepared&quot;) before being inserted back into the body. It is not yet known
      whether REVOLVE or PureGraft technique may work better in retaining graft fat after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure and compare the rate of fat graft retention, defined as the rate between the
      volume of fat remaining in the surgical site at one year and the volume of fat at baseline,
      associated with the use of two aforementioned adipose tissue processing techniques.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure early post-operative complications including infection, hematoma, delayed wound
      healing or seroma.

      II. To measure late complications associated with fat grafting including fat necrosis, cyst
      formation, palpable mass, or breast asymmetry.

      III. To measure patient reported outcomes (PRO, BREAST-Questionnaire [Q], Body Image Survey).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo reconstructive surgery with REVOLVE technique.

      ARM II: Patients undergo reconstructive surgery with PureGraft technique.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks and then once a year for up
      to 2 years.
