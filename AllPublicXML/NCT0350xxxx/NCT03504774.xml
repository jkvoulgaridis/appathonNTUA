      A prospective Phase 2, single-center, single-allergen OIT of cashew or shrimp in participants
      with proven allergies to either cashew or shrimp, respectively. We intend to treat 72
      participants, ages 7 to 55 years with an allergy to either cashew, or shrimp determined by
      Double Blind-Placebo Controlled-Food Challenge (DBPCFC), allergy history, clinical symptoms,
      food-allergen (FA)-specific IgE levels, and skin prick test (SPT).

      A prospective Phase 2, single-center, single-allergen OIT of cashew or shrimp in participants
      with proven allergies to either cashew or shrimp, respectively. We intend to treat 72
      participants, ages 7 to 55 years with an allergy to either cashew or shrimp determined by
      Double Blind-Placebo Controlled-Food Challenge (DBPCFC), allergy history, clinical symptoms,
      food-allergen (FA)-specific IgE levels, and skin prick test (SPT). Enrolled participants must
      be positive at or before the 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) dosing level of FA protein. OIT
      treatment groups will be cashew (n=36), or shrimp (n=36).

      All cohorts will undergo an updosing regimen starting at 5 mg allergen, with dose escalation
      every 2 weeks to reach a 1000 mg dose at week 28, after which they will be maintained at that
      dose for 24 weeks. At the conclusion of the maintenance phase (Week 52), participants will
      undergo DBPCFC. Participants that pass their food challenge with no or mild objective
      reactions to up to a cumulative 2043 mg of the FA allergen in their OIT at the end of this
      phase (primary outcome) will be considered desensitized and have successfully met the primary
      endpoint.

      Participants then will continue in the study by undergoing withdrawal from OIT for 6 weeks to
      examine mechanisms underlying sustained responsiveness (SU) which will be defined as a
      participant's passing a DBPCFC with no or mild objective reaction to up to a cumulative 2043
      mg of the FA allergen in their OIT at week 58. Participants will be followed for an
      additional 12 weeks to reach the end of the study phase (Week 70). There will be an
      opportunity to continue withdrawal with DBPCFC every 6 weeks until week 70 to be able to
      study the ability to maintain SU over a relatively longer term.
