      Up to 31 subjects diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma will receive one application of
      a permeation enhancer and 2, 3, or 5 treatment applications of a Cisplatin drug-loaded patch
      to the tumor site at each of 4 treatment visits. These 4 treatment visits will be scheduled
      to occur during the 3 weeks prior to the standard of care tumor resection.

      Up to 31 subjects diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma will receive one application of
      a permeation enhancer and 2, 3, or 5 treatment applications of a Cisplatin drug-loaded patch
      to the tumor site at each of 4 treatment visits. These 4 treatment visits will be scheduled
      to occur during the 3 weeks prior to the standard of care tumor resection. After the surgery,
      subjects will be followed for 6 months for disease recurrence.

      Ten subjects will be enrolled in Stage 1 of the study and will receive a permeation enhancer
      and 3 treatment applications of the cisplatin drug-loaded patch at each treatment visit. Up
      to 21 additional subjects will enroll in Stage 2 for the purpose of 16 total evaluable
      subjects at the final dose for the efficacy analysis. In Stage 2, the dose may be escalated,
      de-escalated, or remain the same based on the results in Stage 1. All subjects will be
      followed for 6 months post-surgery for disease recurrence.

      During and at the conclusion of the treatment period, subjects will be monitored for local
      and systemic safety, tumor response due to the treatment, and systemic drug exposure.
