      Primary: Nutritional therapy in the form of a whole-food based smoothie can be used to induce
      remission of active Crohn's disease.

      Secondary: Consuming a whole foods based smoothie will result in measurable changes to the
      microbiome of individuals with Crohn's disease and healthy controls.

      The specific aims of this proposal are:

        1. To develop a whole-food based smoothie, based on principles of the specific carbohydrate
           diet, that is comparable in macronutrients and micronutrients to formulas used for
           exclusive enteral nutritional (EEN) therapy in Crohn's disease.

        2. To evaluate the ability of a whole-food based smoothie to induce remission of active
           Crohn's disease.

        3. To evaluate changes to the intestinal microbiome in healthy individuals consuming a
           whole-food based smoothie diet.

      This will be an open label, pilot study over 4 weeks in children with newly diagnosed Crohn's
      disease treated with a smoothie designed to emulate formulas used for exclusive enteral
      nutritional therapy. In place of formula, whole-foods based smoothie recipes and the food to
      create the smoothies will be given to each participant/family. The smoothies will be based
      upon the concept of reverse-engineering of exclusive enteral nutrition (RE-EEN). The smoothie
      recipes will involve whole foods that can be blenderized to liquid consistency. Similar to
      the formulas used for EEN, the smoothies will provide calories, protein, fat, and
      carbohydrates in a distribution to support growth and development.
