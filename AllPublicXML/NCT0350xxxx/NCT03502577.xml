      This phase I trial determines the side effects and best dose of B-cell maturation antigen
      (BCMA)-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells when combined with gamma-secretase inhibitor
      LY3039478 (JSMD194), cyclophosphamide, and fludarabine in treating participants with multiple
      myeloma that that has come back or remains despite treatment. Placing genes added in the
      laboratory into immune T-cells may make the T-cells recognize BCMA, a protein on the surface
      of cancer cells. JSMD194 may enhance the killing of cancer cells by increasing the BCMA
      expression on multiple myeloma cells, making the targeted BCMA CAR-T treatment more
      effective. JSMD194 also decreases the amount of BCMA found in the circulation (called soluble
      BCMA) that is not bound to the myeloma cells. JSMD194 can therefore reduce the potential for
      soluble BCMA to act as a decoy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving BCMA CAR T
      therapy with JSMD194, cyclophosphamide, and fludarabine may work better in treating
      participants with relapsed or persistent multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of BCMA-targeting CAR T-cells in combination with JSMD194 for
      patients with relapsed or treatment refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To identify the recommended phase 2 dose (R2PD) of BCMA CAR T cells administered in
      combination with JSMD194 in patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the peak concentration, in vivo persistence and the phenotype of transferred
      CAR T cells when administered in combination with JSMD194.

      II. To estimate the antitumor activity of adoptively transferred BCMA CAR T cells when
      administered with JSMD194.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of BCMA-specific CAR T-cells.

      Participants receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on days -4 to -2. Participants then
      receive BCMA-specific CAR T-cells intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0 and
      gamma-secretase inhibitor LY3039478 orally (PO) on days 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18.
      Patients will also receive JSMD194 orally before the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to
      evaluate the effect of this drug alone on multiple myeloma cell BCMA levels.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months for years
      1-5 and annually for years 6-15.
