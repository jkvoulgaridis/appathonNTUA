  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foot complications are among the most serious and costly complications of diabetes. People
      with diabetes have a 10-fold increased risk for a leg or foot amputation compared to those
      that do not have diabetes. Amputation of all or part of foot is usually preceded by a foot
      ulcer, which became infected. This is a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a topical
      antiseptic, chlorhexidine, for daily foot cleaning on the recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers
      in Veterans with a recent history of a foot ulcer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Population: Up to 200 Veterans at risk for diabetic foot ulcer recurrence

      Site: VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS)

      Study Duration: Approximately 5 years

      Study Design: Randomized double-blind clinical trial comparing a) a daily foot care regimen
      with cloths containing 2% chlorhexidine to b) a daily foot care regimen with cloths not
      containing 2% chlorhexidine

      Objectives:

      Primary: To determine if chlorhexidine reduces the recurrence of foot complications including
      chronic foot ulcer, foot infection or foot amputation.

      Secondary: To determine if chlorhexidine increases antibiotic resistance among bacterial
      pathogens on feet.

      Exploratory: To describe changes in the microbiota of the feet with chlorhexidine and foot
      complications

      Treatment Regimens: 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate Cloths versus Bath Cloths

      Route of Administration: Topical application on the feet

      Dose and Interval: 1 cloth daily

      Duration of Participant's Participation: Up to 13 months

    <description>The investigators will assess participants for foot complications to include: new chronic foot ulcers or foot infections or foot amputations. The primary outcome is either 1) a new chronic (present 28 days from initial diagnosis) foot ulcer or a moderate or severe foot infection (as defined by IDSA Diabetic Foot Infection Severity classification) not from an existing ulcer a foot amputation for a new ulcer.</description>
