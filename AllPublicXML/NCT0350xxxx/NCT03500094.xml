    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and
      efficacy of migalastat treatment in pediatric subjects 12 to &lt;18 years of age with Fabry
      disease and amenable GLA variants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b, 2-stage, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the
      safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of migalastat treatment in pediatric
      subjects 12 to &lt;18 years of age and weighing ≥ 45 kg (99 pounds) with Fabry disease and with
      amenable GLA variants. Subjects must be either naïve to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or
      have stopped ERT at least 14 days at the time of screening.

      Stage 1 will be a treatment period of approximately 1 month (4 weeks); Stage 2 will be a
      treatment period of 11 months and a 30-day (untreated) safety follow-up period. There will be
      no break in treatment between Stages 1 and 2. Prior to Stage 1, there will be a screening
      period lasting at least 14 days and up to 30 days (or more, if GLA genotyping is required).
      Stage 1 and 2 together will consist of a 12-month treatment period, and a 30-day safety
      follow-up period, for a total of approximately 13 months. Subjects may have the option to
      enroll in a long-term extension study conducted under a separate protocol.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 PK sampling groups using interactive
      response technology (IRT). Four blood samples for determination of migalastat concentrations
      in plasma will be collected on any one 24 hour period between Day 15 and Day 30 of study drug
      administration and again at Months 6 and 12.

    <time_frame>baseline to Month 12/ET</time_frame>
    <description>The FABPRO-GI and Pain Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (24-hour version) consists of 4 questions regarding gastrointestinal signs and symptoms and 2 questions regarding pain relative to the past 24 hours. Subjects will record the frequency and consistency of stools using the Bristol Stool Scale, a pictorial chart and descriptive text for 7 types of stool, ranging from Type 1 (separate hard lumps, like nuts - hard to pass) through Type 7 (watery, no solid pieces - entirely liquid). Subjects will also rate the severity of their worst occurrence of diarrhea, constipation, tummy pain, and overall pain from 0 (none) to 10 (worst possible); for tummy pain, subjects will indicate the location of any tummy pain using a diagram.</description>

    <description>The PGI-C consists of 4 questions regarding diarrhea, abdominal pain, overall pain, and daily living to be answered using a 7-point scale. Subjects rate their change as &quot;very much improved,&quot; &quot;much improved,&quot; &quot;minimally improved,&quot; &quot;no change,&quot; &quot;minimally worse,&quot; &quot;much worse,&quot; or &quot;very much worse.&quot; Subjects will complete the questions by themselves without assistance from their parents or legal guardians.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in FPHPQ scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Month 12/ET</time_frame>
    <description>The FPHPQ includes questions about Fabry disease-specific symptoms (eg, sweating, pain, dizziness and tiredness, heat and cold intolerance, swollen eyelids, gastrointestinal symptoms, feeling thirsty, difficulty hearing, ringing or buzzing noise in the ears, and ability and enjoyment to participate in sports). The frequency of these symptoms will be rated using a 5-point Likert scale (always (worse), often, sometimes, seldom, never (better)). Pain intensity is measured on a 10-point scale, numeric responses are given for onset of pain and school days missed, and yes/no questions are posed about difficulty hearing and other problems not specifically mentioned. There are 2 age-specific self-report versions for children 8 to 12 years and 13 to 18 years, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in PedsQL scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Month 12/ET</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL™ is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. It consists of 23 items and includes questions about physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning relative to the prior 7 days, using a 5-point scale (never (better), almost never, sometimes, often and almost always (worse)). Both parents or legally-authorized representatives and subjects complete the appropriate version of the PedsQL independently of one another. Parents or legally-authorized representatives and subjects may self-administer the questions after introductory instructions are given by study site personnel.</description>
