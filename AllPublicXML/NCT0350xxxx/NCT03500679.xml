  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety/reactogenicity of the ExPEC4V clinical
      trial material (CTM) after the first vaccination and to evaluate the immunogenicity of the
      ExPEC4V CTM, as measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 14 days after the
      first vaccination (on Day 15).

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study vaccine. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. Solicited local AEs were precisely defined local events that participants were specifically asked about and which were noted by participants in the diary. Solicited local AEs included injection-site pain/tenderness, injection-site erythema and injection-site swelling/induration.</description>

An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study vaccine.

             excipients

          -  Participant with abnormal function of the immune system resulting from: a) clinical
             conditions (for example, autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency); b) chronic or
             recurrent use of systemic corticosteroids; c) administration of antineoplastic and
             immunomodulating agents or radiotherapy

          -  Participant has a history of neoplastic disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix that was successfully treated) within the past 1 year
             or a history of any hematological malignancy

             (uncontrolled) chronic medical condition or physical examination findings for which,
             in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of
             the participant (for example, compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit,

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study vaccine. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. Solicited local AEs were precisely defined local events that participants were specifically asked about and which were noted by participants in the diary. Solicited local AEs included injection-site pain/tenderness, injection-site erythema and injection-site swelling/induration.</description>

          <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study vaccine. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. Solicited systemic AEs were precisely defined systemic events that participants were specifically asked about and which were noted by participants in the diary.

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study vaccine. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. Unsolicited AEs were precisely defined events that participants were not asked about and which were not noted by participants in the diary.</description>
