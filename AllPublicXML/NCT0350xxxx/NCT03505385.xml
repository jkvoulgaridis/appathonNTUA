  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. There is a growing demand for long-term care settings. Care-home residents are a
      vulnerable group with high levels of physical dependency and cognitive impairment. Long-term
      care facilities' policy need to adapt and offer more effective and sustainable interventions
      to address their complex physical and mental health needs. Despite the increasing emphasis on
      patient and public involvement, marginalised groups such as care-home residents, can be
      overlooked when including people in the research process. The GET READY project aims to
      integrate service-learning methodology into Physical Therapy and Sport Sciences University
      degrees by offering students individual service opportunities (placements) with residential
      care homes, in order to co-create the best suited intervention with researchers, older adults
      of both genders (end-users) in care homes, health professionals, caregivers, family members
      and policy makers.

      Methods. Stage 1 will integrate a service-learning methodology within a Physical Therapy
      module in Glasgow and Sport Sciences module in Barcelona, design two workshops for care home
      residents and conduct a co-creation protocol. Stage 2 will assess the intervention
      feasibility, safety and preliminary effects of the co-created intervention in a group of 33
      care home residents, within a two-armed pragmatic randomized clinical trial.

    <description>The Get Ready (GR) intervention was delivered one-to-one with the care home resident and a relevant family member during a 12-week period:
The familiarisation stage aimed to build a rapport with two long-term achievement goals to sit less and move more with the resident and the family member and consisted of two sessions, one in week 1 (50-60minutes) and the other in week 3 (30-40 minutes).
The ramping up stage aimed to review the rapport and reach an achievable consensus with the resident and the family member. It consisted of two sessions, one in week 5 and the other in week 7 (20-30 minutes each).
The maintenance stage aimed at integrating behaviours and included two sessions, one in week 9 and the other at week 12 (20-30 minutes each). Sessions 5 and 6 were used to understand how the resident was getting on with their short-term GR goals, facilitating some problem-solving discussions.</description>
