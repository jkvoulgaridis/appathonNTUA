  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the superiority of an Optical
      Coherence Tomography (OCT)-guided stent implantation strategy as compared to an
      angiography-guided stent implantation strategy in achieving larger post-PCI lumen dimensions
      and improving clinical cardiovascular outcomes in patients with high-risk clinical
      characteristics and/or with high-risk angiographic lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-blind clinical investigation randomizing subjects to OCT-guided
      coronary stent implantation vs. angiography-guided coronary stent implantation in a 1:1
      ratio. The clinical investigation will be conducted at approximately 125 centers in North
      America (US and Canada), Europe, Middle East and Asia-Pacific.

      All patients will undergo baseline and post PCI imaging with their randomized modality. In
      addition, the Angiography group will undergo a blinded post-PCI OCT run to allow comparison
      of OCT derived minimum stent area (MSA) in both groups.

      After hospital discharge, all patients will have clinical follow-up at 30 days, 1 year, and 2
      years.

    <description>MSA achieved in the proximal and distal stented segments relative to their respective reference lumen areas. The stent length is divided into 2 equal segments (proximal and distal) except for lesions containing a bifurcation (visually estimated side branch ≥2.5 mm). When there is a bifurcation present, rather than splitting the stent into two halves, the division is based upon the midpoint of the proximal most side branch.
Acceptable stent expansion (categorical variable): MSA of the proximal segment is ≥90% of the proximal reference lumen area and the MSA of the distal segment is ≥90% of the distal reference lumen area.
Unacceptable stent expansion (categorical variable): MSA of the proximal segment is &lt;90% of the proximal reference lumen area, and/or the MSA of the distal segment is &lt;90% of the distal reference lumen area.

          2. Subject must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable angina, silent
             ischemia (ischemia in the absence of chest pain or other anginal equivalents),
             unstable angina, or acute myocardial infarction) suitable for elective PCI.

          3. Patients undergoing planned XIENCE stent implantation during a clinically indicated
             PCI procedure meeting one or more of the following criteria:

             A) High clinical-risk, defined as;

             i. Medication-treated diabetes mellitus, AND/OR

             B) High angiographic-risk lesion(s), with at least one target lesion in each target
             vessel planned for randomization meeting at least one of the following criteria;

             i. Target lesion is the culprit lesion responsible for either:

               -  NSTEMI, defined as a clinical syndrome consistent with an acute coronary syndrome
                  and a minimum troponin of 1 ng/dL (may or may not have returned to normal), OR

               -  STEMI &gt;24 hours from the onset of ischemic symptoms

             ii. long or multiple lesions (defined as intended total stent length in any single
             target vessel ≥28 mm), Note: For a long target lesion, this would permit treatment by
             a single long stent or overlapping stents.

             Note: For up to two target lesions located in a single target vessel and treated with
             non-overlapping stents, they may be located in a continuous vessel or split up between
             a main vessel and a side branch.

             iii. bifurcation intended to be treated with 2 planned stents (i.e. in both the main
             branch and side branch), and where the planned side branch stent is ≥ 2.5 mm in
             diameter by angiographic visual estimation.

             iv. angiographic severe calcification (defined as angiographically visible
             calcification on both sides of the vessel wall in the absence of cardiac motion),

             v. chronic total occlusion (CTO) (enrolment and randomization in this case performed
             only after successful antegrade wire escalation crossing and pre-dilatation)

             vi. in-stent restenosis of diffuse or multi-focal pattern. Lesion must be at or within
             the existing stent margin(s) and have angiographically visually-assessed DS ≥70% or DS
             ≥50% with non-invasive or invasive evidence of ischemia

          4. All target lesions (those lesions to be randomized) must have a visually estimated or
             quantitatively assessed %DS of either ≥70%, or ≥50% plus one or more of the following:
             an abnormal functional test (e.g. fractional flow reserve, stress test) signifying
             ischemia in the distribution of the target lesion(s) or biomarker positive ACS with
             plaque disruption or thrombus.

             Note: For purposes of study eligibility, a minimum troponin of 1 ng/dL at the time of
             screening will be considered biomarker positive.

          5. All target lesions must be planned for treatment with only ≥2.5 mm and ≤3.5 mm stents
             and post-dilatation balloons based on pre-PCI angiographic visual estimation.

          6. No more than 2 target lesions requiring PCI are present in any single vessel., and no
             more than 2 target vessels are allowed. Thus, up to 4 randomized target lesions per
             patient in a maximum of 2 target vessels are allowed, including branches. The intended
             target lesions will be declared just prior to randomization.

             Note: A lesion is defined as any segment(s) of the coronary tree, no matter how long,
             which is planned to be covered with one contiguous length of stent, whether single or
             overlapped. A bifurcation counts as a single lesion even if the side branch is planned
             to be treated.

             Note: All lesions in a randomized target vessel that are intended to be treated by PCI
             are designated as target lesions, and at least one target lesion in each randomized
             target vessel must meet angiographic high-risk inclusion criteria summarized above in
             3B). The only exception is for patients who qualify for the trial on the basis of
             medication-treated diabetes, in which case no target lesion is required to meet
             angiographic high-risk inclusion criteria.

          7. All target lesions intended to be treated by PCI in the target vessel are amenable to
             OCT-guided PCI.

             Example: If a qualifying angiographic high-risk lesion is in the proximal LAD, and
             there is a second target lesion in the distal LAD which is a focal lesion not
             otherwise meeting high-risk criteria, both the proximal LAD and distal LAD lesions
             must be amenable to OCT (e.g. no excessive tortuosity or calcification precluding
             delivering the OCT catheter), and each lesion must undergo OCT-guided stenting.
             Otherwise the vessel should be excluded from randomization.

          8. Subject must provide written Informed Consent prior to any study related procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria (none may be present)

        Clinical exclusion criteria:

          1. STEMI ≤24 hours from the onset of ischemic symptoms

          2. Creatinine clearance ≤30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (as calculated by MDRD formula for estimated
             GFR) and not on dialysis. Note: chronic dialysis dependent patients are eligible for
             enrolment regardless of creatinine clearance.

          3. Hypotension, shock or need for mechanical support or intravenous vasopressors at the
             time the patient would be undergoing the index procedure.

          4. CHF (Killip class ≥2 or NYHA class ≥3)

          5. LVEF ≤30% by the most recent imaging test within 3 months prior to procedure. If no
             LVEF test result within 3 months is available, it must be assessed by
             echocardiography, multiple gated acquisition (MUGA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
             ventriculography (LV gram) or other method.

          6. Unstable ventricular arrhythmias

          7. Inability to take DAPT (both aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor) for at least 12 months in
             the patient presenting with an ACS, or at least 6 months in the patient presenting
             with stable CAD, unless the patient is also taking chronic oral anticoagulation in
             which case a shorter duration of DAPT may be prescribed per local standard of care.

          8. Planned major cardiac or non-cardiac surgery within 24 months after the index
             procedure Note: Major surgery is any invasive operative procedure in which an
             extensive resection is performed, e.g. a body cavity is entered, organs are removed,
             or normal anatomy is altered.

             Note: Minor surgery is an operation on the superficial structures of the body or a
             manipulative procedure that does not involve a serious risk. Planned minor surgery is
             not excluded.

          9. Prior PCI within the target vessel within 12 months

             Note: Prior PCI within the target vessel within 12 months is allowed for in-stent
             restenosis (target lesion is the prior PCI site) if no more than one layer of
             previously implanted stent is present.

             Note: In-stent restenosis involving two or more layers of stent implanted at any time
             prior to index procedure (i.e. an earlier episode of in-stent restenosis previously
             treated with a second stent) is excluded.

         10. Any planned PCI within the target vessel(s) within 24 months after the study
             procedure, other than a planned staged intervention in a second randomized target
             vessel.

             Note: Planned staged interventions must be noted at the time of randomization, and the
             decision to stage may be modified within 24 hours of completion of the index PCI.

             Note: PCI in non-target vessels is permitted &gt;48 hours after the index procedure.

         11. Any prior PCI in a non-target vessel within 24 hours before the study procedure, or
             within previous 30 days if unsuccessful or complicated.

             Note: Patients requiring non-target vessel PCI may be enrolled and the non-target
             vessel(s) may be treated in the same index procedure as the randomized lesions (in all
             cases prior to randomization), as long as treatment of the lesion(s) in the non-target
             vessel is successful and uncomplicated.

             Successful and uncomplicated definition for non-target vessel treatment during the
             index procedure: Angiographic diameter stenosis &lt;10% for all treated non-target
             lesions, with TIMI III flow in this vessel, without final dissection ≥ NHLBI type B,
             perforation anytime during the procedure, prolonged chest pain (&gt;5 minutes) or
             prolonged ST-segment elevation or depression (&gt;5 minutes), or cardiac arrest or need
             for defibrillation or cardioversion or hypotension/heart failure requiring mechanical
             or intravenous hemodynamic support or intubation).

         12. Subject has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the study drugs
             (including all P2Y12 inhibitors, one or more components of the study devices,
             including everolimus, cobalt, chromium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, acrylic and
             fluoropolymers, or radiocontrast dye that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

         13. Subject has received a solid organ transplant which is functioning or is active on a
             waiting list for any solid organ transplants with expected transplantation within 24
             months.

         14. Subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has known immunosuppressive or
             severe autoimmune disease that requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., human
             immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.). Note: corticosteroids are
             not included as immunosuppressant therapy.

         15. Subject has previously received or is scheduled to receive radiotherapy to a coronary
             artery (vascular brachytherapy), or the chest/mediastinum.

         16. Subject has a platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3.

         17. Subject has a documented or suspected hepatic disorder as defined as cirrhosis or
             Child-Pugh ≥ Class B.

         18. Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or has had a significant
             gastro-intestinal or significant urinary bleed within the past six months.

         19. Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic neurological attack
             (TIA) within the past six months, or any prior intracranial bleed, or any permanent
             neurologic defect, or any known intracranial pathology (e.g., aneurysm, arteriovenous
             malformation, etc.).

         20. Subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath
             insertion. Note: femoral arterial disease does not exclude the patient if radial
             access may be used.

         21. Subject has life expectancy &lt;2 years for any non-cardiac cause.

         22. Subject is currently participating in another investigational drug or device clinical
             study that has not yet completed its primary endpoint.

         23. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 2 years
             following index procedure. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site
             standard test.

         24. Presence of other anatomic or comorbid conditions, or other medical, social, or
             psychological conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could limit the
             subject's ability to participate in the clinical investigation or to comply with
             follow-up requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the clinical
             investigation results.

        Angiographic exclusion criteria

          1. Syntax score ≥33, unless a formal meeting of the Heart Team, including a cardiac
             surgeon, concludes that PCI is appropriate.

          2. Planned use of any stent &lt;2.5 mm in a target vessel based on visual estimation (note:
             a smaller stent may be used in a bail-out scenario - e.g. to treat a distal dissection
             - but its use cannot be planned prior to enrolment)

          3. Planned use of a stent or post-dilatation balloon ≥3.75 mm for the target lesion

          4. Severe vessel tortuosity or calcification in a target vessel such that it is unlikely
             that the OCT catheter can be delivered (note: severe vessel calcification is allowed
             if it is expected that the OCT catheter can be delivered at baseline or after vessel
             preparation with balloon pre-dilatation or atherectomy)

          5. The target vessel has a lesion with DS ≥ 50% that is not planned for treatment at the

          6. The target lesion is in the left main coronary artery

          7. The target lesion is in a bypass graft conduit. Note: A native coronary artery may be
             randomized if a prior bypass graft conduit to the vessel is totally occluded, but not
             if it is patent.

          8. The target lesion is an ostial RCA stenosis

          9. The target lesion is a stent thrombosis

         10. Planned use of any stent other than Xience in a target lesion
