      The study is a single site, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that
      will assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine
      and PfSPZ-CVac against naturally occurring malaria in Indonesian soldiers. A total of 420
      participants will be randomized 1.0:0.5:1.0:0.5 to 4 groups. Participants will be recruited
      from an Indonesian army battalion based in a malaria-free area. All volunteers will be
      healthy males aged 18 to 55 years. They will be immunized in a malaria-free area of
      Indonesia, and then deployed to eastern Indonesia for ~6-9 months. Standard safety,
      tolerability, and parasitology data will be collected before deployment during the
      immunization period.

      Participants will receive three doses by DVI of

        1. PfSPZ Vaccine on days 1, 8, and 29,

        2. PfSPZ Challenge with chloroquine (CQ) prophylaxis on days 1, 29, and 57,

        3. normal saline (NS) on days 1, 8, and 29, or

        4. normal saline with CQ prophylaxis on days 1, 29, and 57. The PfSPZ Vaccine dose will be
           9 x 10^5 PfSPZ. The PfSPZ Challenge dose will be 2 x 10^5 PfSPZ. CQ will first be given
           as a loading dose of 620 mg base two days before the first administration of PfSPZ
           Challenge or NS, followed by weekly 310 mg doses of CQ with the last dose 5 days after
           the last dose of PfSPZ Challenge.

             the participant unable to comply with the protocol or might compromise the integrity
             of the data.

          -  Any evidence of active malaria, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, confirmed by RDT,
             microscopy or PCR less than 3 weeks before first injection of PfSPZ Vaccine or
