  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open-label, prospective, two-period, interventional safety study of
      bilateral use of AAV2-REP1 in adult male subjects with genetically confirmed CHM.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 clinical trial of a gene therapy vector made from adeno-associated virus
      (AAV) called AAV2-REP1 for the treatment of Choroideremia. Participating subjects will be
      required to attend a screening visit during which their suitability for the study will be
      assessed, and eligible subjects will undergo a surgical procedure under general anaesthesia
      consisting of vitrectomy, retinal detachment and sub-retinal administration of AAV2-REP1.

      Subjects will be treated bilaterally, with the interval between eyes determined by discussion
      between the investigator and Nightstar. Participating subjects will be required to attend
      follow up visits for 12 months following the second eye surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Are willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study to have
             both eyes treated.

          2. Are male and ≥18 years of age.

          3. Have documentation of a genetically-confirmed diagnosis of CHM.

          4. Have active disease clinically visible within the macular region of both eyes.

          5. Have a BCVA of ≥34 ETDRS letters (20/200 or better Snellen acuity) in both eyes, or in
             the untreated eye, if the other eye was previously treated with AAV2-REP1*

             *If previously treated with AAV2-REP1 in an antecedent study, subjects may be eligible
             for participation following Sponsor approval.

          6. For subjects who received treatment with AAV2-REP1 in an antecedent study, have
             biological samples available to complete an adequate immunology profile.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a history of amblyopia or inflammatory disorder in either eye.

          2. Are unwilling to use barrier contraception methods or abstain from sexual intercourse
             for a period of 3 months following treatment with AAV2-REP1 in either eye.

          3. Have had previous intraocular surgery performed within 3 months of the Screening Visit
             in either eye.

          4. Have any other significant ocular or non-ocular disease/disorder which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may either put the subjects at risk because of participation in
             the study, or may influence the results of the study or the subject's ability to
             participate in the study. This includes but is not limited to a potential subject:

               -  with a contraindication to oral corticosteroid (e.g., prednisolone/prednisone)

               -  with clinically significant cataract in either eye

               -  who, in the clinical opinion of the Investigator, is not an appropriate candidate
                  for sub-retinal surgery.

          5. Have participated in another research study involving an investigational product in
             the past 12 weeks or received a gene/cell-based therapy at any time previously, except
             if treated within an antecedent study with AAV2-REP1.
