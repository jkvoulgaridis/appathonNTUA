      To study the initial experience with implanting and fitting a new Bone Conduction system in
      pediatric patient population with conductive, mixed or single-sided deafness.

      Experimental: Bone-conduction hearing device The bone-conduction hearing device Osia system
      allows a direct bone-conduction through an osseointegrated implant. A magnet allows the
      external Sound Processor to be placed in the correct position over the implanted system
      including an inner magnet.

      Device: Osia System An external Sound Processor captures and digitize the sound which is
      transferred to the internal implant where it is converted to an electrical signal. The
      electrical signal is further transferred as a vibration through an osseointegrated implant to
      the mastoid bone and eventually to the cochlea

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Individuals 5 through 18 years of age will be eligible for inclusion in
        the investigation if all of the criteria below are met:

        Conductive or mixed hearing loss in the ear to be implanted. Bone conduction thresholds
        with pure-tone average (PTA4; mean of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) of less than or equal to 55 dB
        HL.

        Subject does not benefit from or will not wear a conventional hearing aid.

        Note: Candidates may include individuals seeking new implantation unilaterally (in one ear)
        or bilaterally (both ears) as well as individuals already implanted with a bone-anchored
        device seeking a second-side implant.

        OR

        Single-sided sensorineural deafness who is a candidate for Baha surgery. Air conduction
        thresholds with a pure-tone average (PTA4; mean of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) of less that equal
        to 20 dB HL in the good ear.

        Subject does not benefit from or will not wear a conventional hearing aid

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Uncontrolled diabetes as judged by the investigator. Subject who has received radiotherapy
        in the area of implantation, or such radiotherapy is planned during the study period.

        Current use of ototoxic drugs. Condition that could jeopardize osseointegration and/or
        wound healing or condition that may have an impact on the outcome of the investigation as
        judged by the investigator.

        Insufficient bone quality and quantity for implantation of a BI300 Implant, as determined
        by the surgeon.

        Unable to follow investigational procedures. Participation in another clinical
        investigation with pharmaceutical and/or device
