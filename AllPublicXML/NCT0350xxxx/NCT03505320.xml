  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of zolbetuzimab
      as a single agent as assessed by an independent central reader. This study will also assess
      the ORR and Progression Free Survival (PFS) of zolbetuximab in combination with mFOLFOX6 and
      in combination with pembrolizumab, assess the safety and tolerability, assess the effects on
      CLDN18.2 expression and assess the immunogenicity and immunomodulatory effects of
      zolbetuximab as a single agent and in combination with mFOLFOX6 and in combination with
      pembrolizumab. This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of zolbetuximab,
      oxaliplatin, fluorouracil (5-FU), and pembrolizumab, evaluate health-Related Quality of Life
      (HRQoL), evaluate the Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration of Response (DOR), PFS of
      zolbetuximab as a single agent, in combination with mFOLFOX6 and in combination with
      pembrolizumab based on both investigator and independent central reader assessment, assess
      Overall Survival (OS) of zolbetuximab as a single agent and in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the antitumor activity of zolbetuximab, an Immunoglobulin (IgG1)
      chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against CLDN18.2, in subjects with recurrent locally
      advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma whose tumors have
      high or intermediate CLDN18.2 expression. For each cohort, the study consists of the
      following periods: pre-screening; screening; treatment; and follow-up for disease
      progression. In addition, there will be a survival follow-up period for Cohort 1A and Cohort
      3B participants only. Tolerability of zolbetuximab in combination with pembrolizumab in
      Japanese participant(s) will be evaluated in Cohort 3B, if Japanese subjects are not enrolled
      in the Cohort 3A DLT assessment.

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group for use as a generic, preference-based measure of health outcomes. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item self-reported measure of functioning and wellbeing, which assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. This questionnaire also records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 = the worst health a participant can imagine to 100 = the best health a participant can imagine) visual analogue scale. Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) based on values derived from general population samples.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be treated with zolbetuximab and pembrolizumab on a 21-day cycle. Cohort 3 consists of 2 parts: a safety lead in (Cohort 3A) and an expansion (Cohort 3B).
Cohort 3A: Loading dose of zolbetuximab will be administered at cycle 1, day 1 followed by maintenance dose of zolbetuximab once every 3 weeks (Q3W). Pembrolizumab will be administered to 3 to 6 subjects at a intravenously on day 1 of every 21-day cycle and will be infused 1 hour after the zolbetuximab infusion is completed. Tolerability and safety of zolbetuximab in combination with pembrolizumab will be evaluated during the 3-week dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment period. If this cycle 1 dose is not tolerable, a lower dose of zolbetuximab in combination with pembrolizumab will subsequently be evaluated.
Cohort 3B: A zolbetuximab plus pembrolizumab combination expansion cohort (Cohort 3B) may be opened based on the tolerability of the dose in Cohort 3A.</description>
