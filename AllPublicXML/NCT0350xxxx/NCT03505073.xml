      Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) has become the largest single cause of death
      worldwide. It is responsible for an estimated 17 million deaths and led to 151 million
      disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost (~30.0% of all deaths and 14.0% of all DALYs
      lost).1 Further, by 2020, 32.0% of the world population deaths will be caused by ASCVD and by
      2030; it's expected to be responsible for 33.0% of all deaths (24.2 million).2 Most of
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events nowadays are taking place in low- and
      middle-income countries with 80% of the burden occurring in these countries.3

      In Egypt, since 1990, ASCVD related mortality was increased over three folds; to be
      responsible for over 40% of deaths compared with 12% reported two decades earlier.4 Egypt was
      categorized as a &quot;very-high-risk country for ASCVD&quot; (according to 2016 ESC Guidelines on
      cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice).5 According to (WHO 2014), ASCVD
      related mortality in Egypt has been increased to account for 46% of total deaths.

      Multiple risk factors are attributed to causing ASCVD. These risk factors fall into the
      categories of either nonmodifiable or modifiable risk factors.6 Nonmodifiable risk factors
      consist of those conditions that a person cannot alter, including age, heredity, ethnicity
      and type 1 diabetes.

      Whereas modifiable risk factors are conditions that can be altered by making certain
      lifestyle changes.

      In 2003, the Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation identified nine major modifiable risk
      factors for ASCVD, namely, tobacco smoking, alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, unhealthy
      dietary habits, obesity, high BP, high concentrations of dietary fat and blood lipids, and
      high blood glucose concentrations.7 Sudden stress, frequent migraine and the use of oral
      contraceptives have also been identified as risk factors for the increased incidence of
      coronary disease and stroke.8,9 The Egyptian National Hypertension Project (NHP)10,11 was
      conducted between year 1991 and 1993 in six Egyptian governorates to define the prevalence of
      ASCVD risk factors in adult Egyptians. The project documented an extremely high prevalence
      and prominent clustering of ASCVD risk factors in adult men and women particularly obesity.

      Since that time, and despite the increasing ASCVD related morbidity and mortality in our
      Egyptian society, as mentioned before, there's no recent studies (up to our knowledge) was
      conducted to determine the risk factors associated to ASCVD.

      This study overall aim is to systematically explore and investigate the association between
      dietary habits and risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in Assiut
      governorate.
