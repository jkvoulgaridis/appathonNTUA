    <textblock>
      Locomotor training is an established rehabilitation approach that is beneficial for improving
      walking function in individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCIs). This approach focuses on
      repetitive practice and appropriate stepping movements to activate spinal neural networks and
      promote rhythmic motor output associated with walking. Assistance with stepping movements is
      often provided by physical therapists and trainers, but this can be costly and difficult to
      deliver in the cost-constrained U.S. healthcare market. Robotic devices have been used as an
      alternate method to deliver locomotor training, but current robotic approaches often lack the
      natural movement variations that characterize normal human stepping. Furthermore, studies to
      compare locomotor training approaches have not shown any specific benefits of using robotic
      devices. A new type of robotic device has emerged that uses an individual's muscle activation
      and stepping movements to control the robot during walking. This adaptive robotic device
      adjusts to the user's intentions and can assist with stepping during locomotor training in a
      manner that matches natural human stepping. While this type of adaptive robot has been
      preliminarily tested, the safety and efficacy of locomotor training using adaptive robotics
      are not well-established in patients with SCI. This is a critical step to determine if
      individuals with SCI may benefit from use of this device and for preliminary adoption of this
      technology. Recent studies have used the Cyberdyne Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) to deliver
      locomotor training and have reported outcomes suggesting that the HAL adaptive robot is safe
      and efficacious for walking rehabilitation in European SCI patients. Therefore this study
      will use the HAL adaptive robot to deliver locomotor training. This research is necessary to
      determine if use of the HAL is potentially beneficial and warranted for use with locomotor
      training and SCI patients receiving care in the U.S. Results of this study may contribute to
      the development and implementation of effective walking rehabilitation approaches for people
      with SCIs.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of locomotor training using
      adaptive robotics in adults with chronic SCI. Safety will be determined by monitoring of
      adverse responses such as skin irritation, pain, changes in spasticity and function.
      Preliminary efficacy for improving walking function will be determined by tests of walking
      speed and endurance prior to and following 60 daily sessions of locomotor training using
      adaptive robots.

      Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that locomotor training using adaptive robotics such as
      the Cyberdyne Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is safe for individuals with chronic incomplete
      spinal cord injury (SCI). Safety will be demonstrated by an adverse response rate that does
      not exceed the frequency and severity of adverse responses reported for other
      well-established locomotor rehabilitation approaches. Safety will be assessed by monitoring
      of specific conditions such as skin integrity, pain, and spasticity.

      Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that locomotor training using adaptive robotics such as
      the Cyberdyne HAL (5x/week for 12 weeks, 60 sessions, 2 hours each) is efficacious for
      improving walking function in adults with chronic incomplete SCIs. Walking function may be
      assessed using standard clinical tests to measure walking speed and walking endurance. A
      battery of clinical tests (listed in Outcome Measures) will be selected for use based on each
      participant's functional capabilities.

      To address the aims of the study, the investigators will use a pre-post repeated measures
      study design. Following phone and in-person screenings and physician approval, individuals
      will provide informed consent to the study procedures. Non-invasive tests of physical
      function and health will be conducted prior to and following 60 sessions of locomotor
      training using the HAL, an adaptive robotic device that is custom fitted to each individual
      to provide assistance to the lower limbs during locomotor training.

      Subject recruitment: Individuals with chronic SCI (&gt;1 year) who meet the given enrollment
      criteria (see inclusion and exclusion criteria) will be included for this study. Recruitment
      will occur from within the Brooks Health System which includes the Brooks Cybernic Treatment
      Center, as well as from their healthcare providers and advertisements in the community.
