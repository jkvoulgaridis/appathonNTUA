      This research study is studying whether contrast enhanced mammography can predict if atypical
      ductal hyperplasia will progress to cancer.

      The device involved in this study is:

      -Contrast enhanced mammography

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study device for this purpose.

      Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) is a common diagnosis after breast biopsy. Although it is
      not cancer itself, ADH can become breast cancer in some cases. As a result, surgery is
      performed to remove ADH to make sure it doesn't progress to cancer. In many cases, no cancer
      is found during the surgery.

      Previous studies have shown that breast MRI may be able to predict which areas of ADH will be
      cancer at the time of surgery. This would help prevent unnecessary surgery in some patients.

      Contrast enhanced mammography is a new type of mammogram that is already being used in
      clinical practice to help find breast cancer. Similar to breast MRI, it uses contrast
      material combined with the mammogram to highlight areas that might be breast cancer and that
      could be missed on the mammogram alone. Contrast material is a dye or other substance that
      helps show abnormal areas within the body.

      Studies have shown the contrast enhanced mammography has a similar ability to find breast
      cancer as breast MRI.

      The investigators purpose is to see whether contrast enhanced mammography can predict which
      areas of ADH will become breast cancer at the time of surgery. The investigators believe this
      will help prevent unnecessary surgery in many with women with the diagnosis of ADH.

    <description>Investigators will evaluate how incidental findings seen on CESM impact the surgical management of patients diagnosed with ADH. The initial surgical management documented in the clinical report (created before CESM performed) will be compared with the surgical management documented in the medical record after the CESM was performed to determine the change.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age, Minimum 30 years. CESM is an imaging exam that uses radiation and is not
             typically employed in women younger than age 30 due to potentially negative biologic
             effects on glandular breast tissue.

          -  Participants who had a percutaneous breast biopsy (to include stereotactic,
             tomosynthesis, or ultrasound guided) that revealed ADH

          -  Participants will be undergoing surgical excision to remove the ADH.

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined by a GFR ≥60
             mL/min/1.73 m2 to be performed per clinical protocol

          -  Patients ≥65 years without underlying renal insufficiency get GFR tested within 6
             months of the exam.

          -  Patients &lt; 65 years without underlying renal insufficiency do not require an GFR
             calculation)

          -  Patients ≥65 years with known underlying renal insufficiency get GFR tested within 1
             month of the exam.

          -  Patients &lt; 65 years with known renal insufficiency get GFR tested within 1 month of
             the exam.

          -  Because of the potential teratogenic effects of radiation, women of child-bearing
             potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
             birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, until the CESM is performed. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant, she should inform the study team
             prior to getting the CESM.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with a core biopsy diagnosis of atypia with associated malignancy (in the
             same quadrant) will be excluded.

          -  Participant had a breast MRI that was performed after the diagnosis of ADH but before
             surgical excision

          -  Participants who have a known allergy to contrast media.

          -  Participants who have a known severe allergic response to one or more allergens, as
             defined by anaphylaxis.

          -  Participants with persistent asthma as defined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
             Institute.

          -  Participants with renal insufficiency or failure, as determined by a point of care
             renal function blood test.

          -  Participants who are breastfeeding are excluded because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to contrast
             administration in the mother.

          -  Participants with the following underlying medical conditions: multiple myeloma,
             myasthenia gravis, dysproteinemias, severe cardiac disease, aortic stenosis, primary
             pulmonary hypertension, cardiac arrythmia, or severe cardiomyopathy. These underlying
             medical conditions may make the participant more likely to develop a contrast
             reaction. This is based on the ACR contrast manual version 10.3 and hospital policy.

          -  Participants with thyroid carcinoma or thyroid disease for whom systemic radioactive
             iodine therapy is part of planned diagnostic work-up or treatment within 2 months
             following the contrast mammogram study.

          -  Participants with a concurrent active illness including, but not limited to,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,
             thyroid storm.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CESM uses radiation with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. This will be defined by a urine
             pregnancy test prior to the CESM study.

        <title>CESM's Ability to Predict Upgrade Rates of Biopsy Proven ADH at Surgical Excision</title>
        <description>Investigators will evaluate whether enhancement on CESM can predict which cases of ADH upgrade at the time of surgical excision.</description>
        <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
        <population>Images were performed but outcome data was not collected and therefore we cannot provide any analysis.</population>

            <title>Contrast Enhanced Mammography</title>
            <description>The CESM images will be performed according to clinical protocol
Images will be acquired within approximately 2-12 minutes of contrast injection
A total of four images per breast will be acquired with low and high energy
Two radiologists will prospectively review the CESM, and will use a third as tie-breaker
The CESM will be evaluated for the biopsy site and up to two additional findings in either breast
The biopsy site will be evaluated for abnormal findings that would suggest malignant involvement
Contrast enhanced mammography: Contrast enhanced mammography is a new type of mammogram that uses contrast material combined with the mammogram to highlight areas that might be breast cancer and that could be missed on the mammogram alone.</description>

        <title>Types of Changes in Surgical Management Based on CESM</title>
        <description>Investigators will evaluate how incidental findings seen on CESM impact the surgical management of patients diagnosed with ADH. The initial surgical management documented in the clinical report (created before CESM performed) will be compared with the surgical management documented in the medical record after the CESM was performed to determine the change.</description>
