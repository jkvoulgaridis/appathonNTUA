    <textblock>
      A clinical trial to validate the MCPM (Multi-parameter Combined Physiological Signal-based
      Monitoring), in estimating physiological activity level, at rest, previous and following
      stimuli.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Multi-parameter Combined Physiological Signal-based Monitoring (MCPM) system is a
      non-invasive multi-parameter physiological monitoring system, intended for continuous .
      acquisition, analysis and display of physiological signals and a Combined Physiological
      Activity Index (CPAI).

      Subjects who meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled to the study
      and their physiological measures, at rest and during exposure to the thermal and stressogenic
      physical stimuli will be recorded by the MCPM system. All subjects will be recorded according
      to a standard procedure; subjects will be lying in the supine position and will be instructed
      to avoid any movements. The experimenter will connect the sensors (MCPM finger probe). During
      the experimental session, different thermal stimuli will be administrated via the cold
      pressor test, with 10-20 minutes of non-stimuli interval. The last stimuli is an stressogenic
      physical preformed by the subject.

      1-2 weeks following the first visit, about half of the subjects will be invited to a second
      visit, identical study visit, to assess the between session test-retest reliability of the
      signals. During the second visit, CPAI will be measured again under randomize thermal stimuli
      and an additional 3 Celsius degrees cold stimuli.
