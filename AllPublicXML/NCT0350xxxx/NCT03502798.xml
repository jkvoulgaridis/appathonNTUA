  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a low coherence interferometry (LCI) endoscopic probe
      that can examine the cervix for evidence of cervical dysplasia. The device will make optical
      measurements of the cervix to determine:

        1. the difference between two different types of cervical cells: ectocervical cells and
           endocervical cells. Cervical dysplasia is most likely to occur at the junction between
           these two types of cells.

        2. features of individual cervical cells that indicate whether the cell is normal or
           abnormal (cervical dysplasia).
