  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical images used to guide treatment of tumor(s) are presently displayed on flat-panel
      monitors (like screens used with computers). This protocol will evaluate, using a new headset
      to view the images in true 3D (&quot;360 degrees&quot;), while using standard flat panel monitors as
      usual (in accordance with standard of care). The headset is combined with a mini-global
      positioning system (GPS)-like system to help navigate to treat tumor(s). This evaluation is
      to show that the headset has potential to provide guidance and navigation information that
      can improve the treatment of tumor(s) with heat.

      This protocol will clinically evaluate new 3D holographic guidance and navigation for
      percutaneous ablation of solid tumors to ultimately overcome limitations of displaying images
      on 2D flat-panel monitors (&quot;flat screens&quot;). 3D Holographic percutaneous ablation (3D HPA)
      provides real-time, 360Â° visualization for guidance and navigation of tracked interventional
      instruments augmented to the operative site. In this preliminary protocol, 3D HPA will be
      evaluated as an adjunct to flat-screen display of conventional images used for guidance
      (ultrasound, fluoroscopy, CT), in accordance with standard of care.
