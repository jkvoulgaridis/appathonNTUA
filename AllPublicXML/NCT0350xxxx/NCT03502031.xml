  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NephroNet proposes to examine whether combining Spironolactone with maximal RAAS blockade
      will further reduce urinary protein at one year and whether prolonged therapy (24 months) is
      able to slow the decline in GFR. Because of combination MRA and RAAS therapy significantly
      increases the risk for clinically significantcccc, the investigators also plan to determine
      whether the addition of Patironts facilitates the use of combination therapy and allows a
      larger proportion of diabetic patients the potential benefit of combination therapy on renal
      function.

      Prospective, open-labeled study of 72 patients with overt Type II diabetic nephropathy and
      &gt;500 mg/gm UP/Cr ratio that will mnmnmnn be randomized to maximal RAAS blockade alone or in
      combination with Spironolactone (25 mg) for 24 months. An analysis of the change in 12 months
      and change in eGFR at 24 months will be performed

             injections at the time of randomization

          -  All eligible patients will be on a stable, maximum tolerated dose of an ACE or ARB for
             2 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Note: The determination of maximum tolerated ACE-ARB therapy will be left to the
             discretion of the site principal investigator

          -  All eligible patients will have hypertension targeted to a blood pressure of &lt;
             140/90mm Hg.

          -  Antihypertensive therapy may be adjusted to achieve the target blood pressure prior to
             the time of randomization.

          -  ACE or ARB therapy will be the primary antihypertensive therapy used for blood
             pressure control and will be titrated to the highest tolerated dose to achieve a
             target blood pressure of &lt; 140/90. Patients requiring additional medications to
             achieve the target blood pressure will use antihypertensive agents that have neutral
             effects on urinary proteinuria (e.g. Hydralazine or long acting Dihydropyridine
             calcium channel blockers etc.). The final choice of additional medications will be
             left to the discretion of the site principal investigator (PI)

          -  Patients with an average urine protein to creatinine (UP/Cr) ratio that is &gt; 500 mg/gm
             from the average of two historical values recorded within one year prior to
             randomization will be considered eligible for study entry.

          -  Patients with a baseline K+ of &gt;5.5 meq/l on maximum tolerated ACE-ARB therapy during
             the screening period can be treated with 8.4 grams of Patiromer for 7 days. If at the
             end of 7days the serum K+ is &lt; 5.0 meq/liter the patient will be considered eligible
             to participate in the study. If at the end of 7 days the serum K+ &gt;5.0 meq/l the dose
             of Patiromer can be increased to 16.8 grams. If at the end of 7 days the serum K+ is &lt;
             5.0 meq/L, the patient will be considered eligible for study entry. If after 7 days at
             the higher dose of Patiromer the serum K+ &gt;5.0, the patient will be considered
             ineligible for study participation.

          -  Patients with an estimated GFR by CKD-Epi equation &gt;20 mls/min/1.73 m2

          -  Patients with known allergy or intolerance to ACEI, ARB, or Spironolactone therapy

          -  Patients taking oral or IV digoxin

          -  Patients receiving chronic steroids &gt; 10 mg/day oral Prednisone

          -  Patient that do not have minimum of 3 recorded eGFR determinations within 2 years
             prior to study randomization

          -  Concurrent use of Amiloride, Triamteren, Aliskerin, or other Aldosterone antagonists
             Patients receiving any of the above medications will be considered eligible for study
