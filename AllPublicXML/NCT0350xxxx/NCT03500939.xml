    <textblock>
      The main objective of the PROOF trial is to investigate efficacy and safety of normobaric
      hyperoxygenation (NBHO) as a neuroprotective treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke
      due to large vessel occlusion likely to receive endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (TBY) in
      a randomized controlled clinical phase IIb trial.
