  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability and bioequivalence of 2
      strengths of the FDC tablet product SYR-322-4833 BL compared to the individual alogliptin and
      pioglitazone tablets in healthy Russian participants.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study are called Incresync (SYR-322-4833 BL), alogliptin, and
      pioglitazone. This study will assess the bioequivalence, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of
      alogliptin and pioglitazone administered as individual tablets and as the FDC tablet product
      in healthy volunteers.

      The study will enroll approximately 72 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the 4 treatment sequences to receive one of the
      following treatments:

        -  Regimen A: SYR-322-4833 BL (25 mg + 15 mg)

        -  Regimen B: Alogliptin 25 mg + pioglitazone 15 mg

        -  Regimen C: SYR-322-4833 BL (25 mg + 30 mg)

        -  Regimen D: Alogliptin 25 mg + pioglitazone 30 mg

      All participants will be asked to take single dose of study medication on Day 1 of each
      intervention period.

      This single center trial will be conducted in Russia. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 66 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted
      by telephone 14 days after their last dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.
