  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in patients with tumors known to express the
      protein mesothelin, the following properties of BAY2287411 injection:

        -  safety (to identify, assess, minimize, and appropriately manage the risks associated to
           the study drug)

        -  tolerability (the degree to which side effects can be tolerated by your body)

        -  maximum tolerated dose

        -  pharmacokinetics (the effect of your body on the study drug)

        -  anti-tumor activity

        -  recommended dose for further clinical development
