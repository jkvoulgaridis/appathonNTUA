  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life threatening genetic disorder resulting from mutations found in
      the gene known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This
      clinical study will enroll 22 participants without the F508del mutation, carrying partial
      function mutations not approved for Trikafta, and who are not expected to be approved for
      CFTR modulator treatment in the immediate future. Each participant will be given Trikafta for
      approximately four weeks. The study researchers will monitor clinical endpoints that include
      forced expiratory volume (FEV1), sweat chloride, and nasal potential difference.
      Additionally, the researchers will obtain skin biopsy material from each subject so that
      induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be modified into airway cell monolayers and tested
      for response to Trikafta. In this way, the study will evaluate an emerging and readily
      accessible in vitro endpoint as a predictor of clinical response. This study will serve as a
      pilot/test case for other clinical protocols relevant to patients with rare CFTR variants who
      do not currently receive modulator therapies. It is hypothesized that a robust correlation
      will be established between in vitro Trikafta responsiveness of iPS cells and in vivo benefit
      (FEV1) to patients, and will provide a new tool for utilizing iPS to identify patient
      populations most suitable for cystic fibrosis modulator therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life threatening genetic disorder resulting from mutations found in
      the gene known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Defects in
      this gene prevent correct chloride transport in and out of cells. It has become increasingly
      important to develop new in vitro model systems capable of predicting in vivo clinical
      effectiveness of modulator therapy among patients with CF. This objective represents a
      significant and unmet need for advancing personalized therapeutics in the disease. The
      current trial is intended to show for the first time that primary iPS cells differentiated to
      an airway epithelial phenotype can be used to predict in vivo clinical response for rare CF
      patient populations - with the long-term goal of facilitating drug access for individuals
      with unusual (or even private) CF variants.

      Trikafta is currently approved for patients with CF carrying at least one copy of the common
      F508del variant. This study is a clinical study of 22 subjects without the F508del mutation,
      carrying partial function mutations not approved for Trikafta, and who are not expected to be
      approved for CFTR modulator treatment in the immediate future.

      Each participant will have clinical and/or preclinical evidence that Trikafta should offer
      benefit, and each will be given Trikafta for approximately four weeks. The researchers will
      monitor clinical endpoints that include FEV1, sweat chloride, and nasal potential difference.
      The study will differentiate iPS cells from each subject to generate airway epithelial
      monolayers that can be tested for response to Trikafta. In this way, this study will evaluate
      an emerging and readily accessible in vitro surrogate endpoint as a predictor of clinical
      response. This trial will also serve as a pilot/test case for other clinical protocols
      relevant to patients with rare CFTR variants and evidence of residual function who do not
      have an approved modulator therapy—due to rarity of their mutation. It is hypothesized that a
      robust correlation will be established between in vitro Trikafta responsiveness of iPS cells
      and in vivo benefit (FEV1) in patients, and provide a powerful tool for utilizing iPS cells
      to identify rare CF patient populations most suitable for cystic fibrosis modulator therapy.

    <description>FEV1 provides a direct measurement of patient health among individuals with cystic fibrosis and declines in FEV1 are associated with poor outcomes among those with CF. FEV1 is measured by spirometry and is the maximum amount of air the participant can blow out in one second.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Cutaneous punch biopsy material will be collected from each participant so that iPS cells can be differentiated into airway epithelial monolayers and tested for response to the treatment, in vitro. By using iPS cells differentiated to exhibit a respiratory epithelial phenotype, this study will determine whether the cells can be used to predict clinical responsiveness to Trikafta.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sweat chloride</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 14, 28, 56</time_frame>
    <description>Persons with CF have higher levels of chloride in their sweat. Sweat chloride concentrations of less than or equal to 29 mmol/L are considered normal, concentrations of 30-59 mmol/L are considered intermediate and indicate that the individual may have CF. Concentrations of 60 mmol/L and more mean that a diagnosis of CF is likely.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in nasal potential difference (NPD) measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 7, 14, 28, 56</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal potential difference assesses the function of CFTR protein by measuring the electrical response of nasal mucosa to the perfusion of different ionic solutions. The nasal potential difference test uses a small needle placed under the skin of the arm a few inches above the wrist. A very thin piece of tubing is placed into the nose, through which ionic solutions are pumped. Response to each solution is recorded by an electrode feeding into a microvolt meter.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 14, 28, 56</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will take the CFQ-R that corresponds to their age to assess quality of life. Responses to questions are coded as 1 = very true or always, 2 = mostly true or often, 3 = somewhat true or sometimes, and 4 = not at all true or never. Some items are reverse scored so that higher scores indicate increased ability and higher quality of life. For this study, a summary score will be calculated to provide a single quality of life value. The questionnaire for ages 12-13 includes 35 questions and total scores can range from 35 to 140. The questionnaire for ages 14 and older has 50 questions and total scores range from 50 to 200.</description>
