      To study the effects of liraglutide on neural responses to high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in
      individuals with obesity.

    <textblock>
      Adolescents are the highest consumers of sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) potentially because
      their developing brains are most susceptible to the rewarding neural effects of sugar
      consumption. Thus, we specifically target this population (adolescents) to understand neural
      mechanisms involved in excess sugar consumption which predisposes to the development of
      obesity, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes.
