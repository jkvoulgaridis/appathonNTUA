    <measure>Main Study - The Percentage of Collected Auscultation Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>For each participants the auscultation sound files were collected at 12 points of the body. In each defined region of the participant's body, auscultation was to be performed to maximize the sound quality according to the investigator's experience. Auscultations were recorded using a Littmann Digital Stethoscope (Model 3200) and the 3M Littmann StethAssist software on a computer provided for the study. The unit of the measure is &quot;Percentage of auscultation points collected per participants&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Entire Study - Participants Reported Symptoms of Respiratory Disease - Dyspnoea Recorded Via a Modified Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnoea was assessed for participants as grade 0 and 1 of the modified MRC scale, ranging from 0 to 4 with `0´ being minor and `4´ being severe.
Where, 0 = I only get breathless with strenuous exercise;
= I get short of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill;
= On level ground, I walk slower than people of the same age because of breathlessness, or have to stop for breath when walking at my own pace;
= I stop for breath after walking about 100 meters or after a few minutes on level ground;
= I am too breathless to leave the house or I am breathless when dressing.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Multicenter, single-visit study to collect new data of participants with confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary disease (IPF) and symptomatic controls (non-IPF). Participants were grouped based on their diagnosis at screening. Data for main study was collected from April2018 to July2018 and for substudy from September2018 to January2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All participants were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Participants attended specialist sites which would then ensure that all participants met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants were not to be entered in the trial if any one of the specific entry criteria were not met.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>For each participants the auscultation sound files were collected at 12 points of the body. In each defined region of the participant's body, auscultation was to be performed to maximize the sound quality according to the investigator's experience. Auscultations were recorded using a Littmann Digital Stethoscope (Model 3200) and the 3M Littmann StethAssist software on a computer provided for the study. The unit of the measure is &quot;Percentage of auscultation points collected per participants&quot;.</description>

        <description>For each participants the auscultation sound files were collected at 12 points of the body. In each defined region of the participant's body, auscultation was to be performed to maximize the sound quality according to the investigator's experience.
