      This clinical research is a retrospective, pivotal, multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) study
      with an enriched sample of 300 breast screening or diagnostic cases which were selected from
      the library of mammograms collected under Fujifilm protocol FMSU2013-004A (all subjects
      previously provided written informed consent agreeing their image data and supporting
      documentation could be used for future research and investigations). Approximately 18
      qualified radiologists will independently perform two reads on all (approximately 300) cases.
      Each reader will read each case both as a FFDM read, and a DBT plus S-View read on the ASPIRE
      Bellus II workstation.

      As its primary endpoint, this study is designed to evaluate whether the area under the
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) based on probability of malignancy (POM)
      scores and requiring correct lesion localization is statistically non-inferior for DBT plus
      S-View versus FFDM.

    <description>Average of each radiologist reader's ROC (receiving operating characteristic curve) based on per-subject POM (probability of malignancy) scores requiring correct lesion localization. A ROC curve is a plot of Sensitivity versus 1-Specificity and is a summary of diagnostic performance of a device or clinician. The reader will first record whether there are mammographic findings and an initial BI-RADS assessment of 0, 1, or 2. If the answer to this question is &quot;no&quot; the reader will be asked to confirm for this case: a BI-RADS assessment category of 1 or 2, a Probability of Malignancy (POM) score following the POM guidance provided in the protocol, and recall decision of &quot;no&quot;. If the reader answers &quot;yes&quot; to whether there are mammographic findings, the reader will be asked to confirm an initial BI-RADS assessment category of 0, and will then provide detailed information on each suspicious finding (up to three findings) and the decision whether or not to recall the subject.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>This was a retrospective, multi-reader multi-case reader study. 18 radiologist readers read all 300 cases (half FFDM and half DBT plus S-View reads) at each of 2 visits which were separated by a memory washout period of approximately 4 weeks. Images were previously acquired under Fujifilm protocol FMSU2013-004A.</pre_assignment_details>

A ROC curve is a plot of Sensitivity versus 1-Specificity and is a summary of diagnostic performance of a device or clinician.

If the reader answers &quot;yes&quot; to whether there are mammographic findings, the reader will be asked to confirm an initial BI-RADS assessment category of 0, and will then provide detailed information on each suspicious finding (up to three findings) and the decision whether or not to recall the subject.</description>
