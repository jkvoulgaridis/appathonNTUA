  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be nested as a randomized controlled trial within an online Delphi and will
      assess the effects of the population sampling compared to purposive sampling for consensus in
      an online Delphi.

      The Delphi method of engaging panels of experts from specific interest areas has been widely
      utilized in the for the development of research reporting guidelines, core outcome sets,
      clinical medicine, nursing practice, medical education and healthcare services. An assessment
      completed by Atkins and colleagues in 2005 report that a small panel of similarly trained
      experts can develop reliable criteria that inform judgment and support effective
      decision-making. Despite the wide applicability of the Delphi methodology, it is not known
      how the number of participants or their similarity as a stakeholder group influences results
      in an online Delphi.Purposeful sampling will be used with a randomized sample taken from each
      stakeholder group for analysis and this analysis will be presented alongside the full
      analysis and the results compared.

      The Protocol Lab for Online Trials-Delphi (PLOT-D), which will use an online 3-round Delphi
      combined with participatory action research to inform the development of a multi-use protocol
      template for writing protocols for self-recruited online trials of interventional
      self-management. The Protocol lab will use the Delphi findings, along with earlier research
      to redesign a series of protocols for online randomized trials with the aim of providing
      support for citizens to work alongside researchers to build participatory health trials
      online.
