  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to explore two marketed devices providing a multimarker monitoring including
      physical activity under real-life conditions in patients with heart failure with preserved
      ejection fraction (HFpEF) and with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). It
      aims to identify potential novel endpoints for future heart failure trials by exploring
      clinically relevant changes over time and correlations/associations with conventional
      endpoints such as the six minute walking distance (6MWD), biomarkers and clinical events.
      Furthermore, it aims to address the challenges and feasibility of implementing device based
      measurements under real-life conditions.
