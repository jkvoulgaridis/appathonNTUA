    <textblock>
      This is a single center, non-randomized feasibility clinical evaluation that is designed to
      affirm the safety of the ENVUE™ System guidance during the placement of the ENvizion Medical™
      enteral feeding tubes.

    <textblock>
      Enteral nutrition is the preferred route for the provision of nutritional support in most
      critical ill patients with functional gastrointestinal tract. Achieving early enteral
      nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients is associated with fewer major complications,
      reduced mortality and length of hospital stay, and significant cost savings. It is estimated
      that approximately 1.2 million feeding tubes are placed blindly each year in the United
      States alone. Despite the obvious advantages of the enteral tube feeding, inadvertent
      placement of Enteral Feeding Tube (EFT) into the airway is relatively common and can result
      in significant pulmonary injury including pneumothorax and pneumonia. Airway misplacement
      occurs in 1.2- 4 % of blind EFT insertions, with 0.2 to 1.2% of all the feeding tube
      placements cause pulmonary complications to patients. The gold standard for detecting
      inadvertent placement of a feeding tube in the lungs is radiography. However, because of its
      cost, possible delay of feedings while waiting for radiography, and risk for radiation
      exposure, clinicians continue to seek for alternative methods to confirm correct placement.

      All the above mentioned, emphasizes the fact that safe and effective delivery of nasoenteral
      tube feedings requires assurance that the feeding tube tip is in a proper position. The
      ENVUE™ System is an electromagnetic tracking system which tracks the path of the feeding tube
      during placement. The benefit of the system when EFT is misdirected into the pulmonary system
      is a real-time visual tracing, which may prompt users to withdraw the tube and reinsert it.
