  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New and creative approaches are needed to address childhood obesity. Current strategies
      result in suboptimal outcomes and are intensive and costly. It has been theorized that
      overeating, may have addictive qualities, although few weight management interventions have
      tested therapeutic techniques founded on addiction medicine principles, such as, withdrawal,
      tolerance and craving control1, 2. A pilot study utilizing an addiction model based mobile
      health (mHealth) weight-loss intervention in adolescents showed that the app intervention
      reduced BMI Z-score (zBMI) to a greater extent than youth participating in an in-clinic
      multidisciplinary weight management intervention, and appeared to be a cost-effective, labor
      efficient method for adolescent weight management.

      The proposed multi-site randomized control trial (RCT) will test the effectiveness of an
      addiction-based weight loss intervention, embodied first as a smartphone app with telephone
      coaching and second as an identical approach phone-coaching alone intervention compared to
      age matched controls participating in an in-clinic weight management interventions in a
      larger sample of economically, racially and ethnically diverse adolescents (ages 14-18).

      One hundred and eighty adolescents will be recruited from pediatric interdisciplinary weight
      management clinics operating out of five different hospital systems in Southern California
      and through targeted mailing to 40 ethnically, racially and economically diverse
      neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. The adolescents will be randomized 1:1 via stratified
      block randomization to either receive 1) interactive addiction model based mobile health
      (mHealth) weight-loss intervention with personalized phone-coaching (AppCoach), 2)
      interactive addiction model based mHealth weight-loss intervention alone (App) or 3)
      Multidisciplinary in-clinic weight management program (Clinic). Assessment of the
      intervention's effect on zBMI and percent over the 95th percentile (%BMIp95), fasting
      metabolic parameters, addictive eating habits, executive function, and motivation for change
      will be obtained at enrollment, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months (1 year post intervention follow up).
      In addition, a real-life economic analysis (cost, cost-saving and non-monetary benefits)
      analysis will be completed comparing AppCoach to 1) App and 2) Clinic. We will further
      explore whether primary and secondary outcomes differ by race and whether race moderates the
      relationship between initial intervention efficacy and prolonged weight maintenance.

      Aim 1 (Primary Outcomes): To test the effectiveness of an addiction-based weight loss
      intervention, embodied first as a smartphone app with telephone coaching (AppCoach) compared
      to (1) addiction model based weight-loss app alone (App) and (2) multi-disciplinary in-clinic
      weight loss intervention (Clinic) on weight outcomes of overweight and obese adolescents at
      3, 6, 12 and 18 months post enrollment.

      Hypothesis 1a: Participants who complete the six month AppCoach will have a greater decrease
      in their zBMI and %BMIp95 compared to baseline at completion of the 6 months intervention,
      than those receiving App or Clinic.

      Hypothesis 1b: Participants who completed the six month AppCoach will have greater decrease
      in their zBMI and %BMIp95 compared to baseline at 6 and 12 months post intervention
      completion compared to App and Clinic.

      Aim 2 (Secondary Outcomes): To compare the effects of AppCoach on addictive eating behaviors,
      motivation and self-regulatory behaviors at completion of the intervention and 6 and 12
      months post intervention.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to App or Clinic, AppCoach will result in lower YFAS-c scores, higher
      motivation and improved self- regulatory behaviors scores when evaluated at completion of the
      intervention and 6 and 12 months post intervention.

      Aim 3 (Mediators): To test whether baseline traits and behaviors mediate the effect of
      AppCoach compared to App and Clinic.

      Hypothesis 3: Higher baseline YFAS-c scores lower executive function scores and previous
      history with mobile platforms will mediate the efficacy of AppCoach and App.

      Aim 4: To conduct a real-life economic analysis (costs, cost-savings and non-monetary
      benefits) of delivering AppCoach compared to 1) App and 2) Clinic.

      Hypothesis 4: An addiction-based weight loss mHealth intervention will be more cost-effective
      than weight-loss coaching alone and in-person delivery of multidisciplinary weight-loss
      intervention.

      Research Design Methods:

      Study Design:

      Multi-center, randomized, controlled, trial of an addiction based mobile health (mHealth)

      participants who meet eligibility criteria will be contacted via phone by the on-site CRC.
      The CRC will briefly introduce the study aims and intervention and request the youth and
      family to consider participation to be fully discussed at the first visit. The CRC will
      obtain the eligible participants' email address and send them a recruitment email.
