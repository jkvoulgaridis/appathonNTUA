      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi in
      pre-symptomatic patients with SMA and 2 or 3 copies SMN2

      Phase 3, open-label, single-arm study of a single, one-time dose of onasemnogene
      abeparvovec-xioi (gene replacement therapy) in patients with spinal muscular atrophy who meet
      enrollment criteria and are genetically defined by bi-allelic deletion of survival motor
      neuron 1 gene (SMN1) with 2 or 3 copies of survival motor neuron 2 gene (SMN2). Patients with
      SMN1 point mutations or the SMN2 gene modifier mutation (c.859G&gt;C) may enroll but will not be
      included in the efficacy analysis sets.

      The study includes a screening period, a gene replacement therapy period, and a follow-up
      period. During the screening period (Days -30 to -2), patients whose parent(s)/legal
      guardian(s) provide informed consent will undergo screening procedures to determine
      eligibility for study enrollment. Patients who meet the entry criteria will enter the
      in-patient gene replacement therapy period (Day -1 to Day 2). On Day -1, patients will be
      admitted to the hospital for pre-treatment baseline procedures. On Day 1, patients will
      receive a single, one-time intravenous (IV) infusion of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi, and
      will undergo in-patient safety monitoring for a minimum of 24 hours post infusion. Patients
      may be discharged 24 hours after the infusion, based on Investigator judgment. During the
      outpatient follow-up period (Days 3 to End of Study at 18 or 24 of age, dependent upon
      respective SMN2 copy number), patients will return at regularly scheduled intervals for
      efficacy and safety assessments until the End of Study when the patient reaches 18 months of
      age (SMN2 = 2) or 24 months of age (SMN2 = 3). After the End of Study visit, eligible
      patients will be asked to rollover into a long-term follow up study.
