  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has three aims that hope to expand the knowledge on the cause of Sturge-Weber
      Syndrome (SWS) and improve clinical care of Sturge-Weber Syndrome patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is one of three projects of an NIH Rare Disease Clinical Research Consortium
      focused on brain blood vessel malformations in three different rare diseases. The focus of
      this project is on Sturge-Weber Syndrome.

      We plan to improve the future understanding and treatment of Sturge-Weber Syndrome by 1)
      establishing a national consortium database which will gather lager amounts of clinical data
      and serve indirectly as a registry to foster future clinical trials and determine the
      usefulness of urine vascular biomarkers to determine the vascular remodeling of the SWS
      birthmark and choroidal angioma, 2) study vascular remodeling with retrospective and
      prospective neuroimaging to determine the vascular remodeling of the deep draining
      intraparenchymal vessels as it relates to SWS neurologic status, and 3) relate the GNAQ
      mutation to altered phosphorylation of pathway proteins and angiogenesis factors in SWS
      tissue.

        For Aim 1, the population will be subjects with Sturge-Weber Syndrome and diagnosed brain
        involvement. There will be a separate group made up of family members of those with
        Sturge-Weber syndrome brain involvement to have as a control for the urine portion of Aim
        1. For the optical coherence tomography (OCT) portion of Aim 1, the population will be
        subjects with Sturge-Weber Syndrome eye involvement. For Aim 2, the population will be
        subjects that have Sturge-Weber Syndrome with brain involvement. For Aim 3, the population
        will be subjects with Sturge-Weber Syndrome, diagnosed brain involvement, and V1
        distribution Port-Wine Stain.
