  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (R/T) for locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often used in
      patient who is not suitable for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and other local
      therapy, especially in those with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) caused by tumor cells.
      Several previous studies have showed that local R/T is tolerable and can induce a substantial
      tumor response in HCC management. In addition, the safety, toxicity and preliminary efficacy
      of Lipotecan® (TLC388) has also been proved in patients with terminal malignancy. This study
      aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of concomitant Lipotecan® and
      radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced HCC and PVTT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lipotecan® is a drug product of TLC388 HCl, which is a potent camptothecin analog with
      cytotoxic activities against a variety of human tumor cell lines and anti-tumor activities in
      several xenograft models with human tumor cell lines. Structurally, TLC388 HCl is related to
      other camptothecins, but it has been chemically modified to improve stability and potency,
      and to minimize toxicities.
