  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial for children with the diagnosis of mild acute pancreatitis
      admitted to the hospital for continued management. Patients will be enrolled in the study
      within 24 hours of admission/diagnosis and will be allowed an oral diet once enrolled.
      Demographic, laboratory and imaging data done as standard of care will be collected and
      additional blood work will be sent as part of the study. Patients will be followed
      prospectively with regards to tolerance to oral nutrition, pain, length of stay and
      complications. The hypothesis is that patients that are able to tolerate early oral nutrition
      will have shorter length of stays and will be similar in terms of pain score ratings,
      readmission rates, complications and the need for invasive supplemental nutrition. Also
      patients that are able to tolerate early oral nutrition will have less significant elevation
      of biochemical markers of pancreatitis severity when compared to patients that do not
      tolerate early oral nutrition and historical controls.

    <description>Dr. Kumar left Nationwide Children's Hospital in 2014 and efforts to get ahold of her to complete her ct.gov entries have been unsuccessful as we are not able to get ahold of her.
In July 2014, she wrote in her Continuing Review application to the NCH IRB: &quot;34 patients have been recruited and data has mostly been collected. Follow up calls have been made and no adverse events occurred during the study period.&quot;
No other information is available.</description>
