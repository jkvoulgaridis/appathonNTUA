  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective treatment for people with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) which improves symptoms, reduces hospitalisation and lowers
      healthcare costs. However less than 1% of Australians with COPD receive pulmonary
      rehabilitation each year, due to poor access to programs and high levels of disability. This
      randomised controlled trial will examine the benefits and costs of a novel, entirely
      home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program for COPD. We hypothesise that home-based
      pulmonary rehabilitation can deliver equivalent clinical outcomes at lower cost than the
      centre-based program.

      We will randomly allocate 144 people with COPD to undertake either standard pulmonary
      rehabilitation in a hospital setting, or a low-cost home-based program. Those who undertake
      pulmonary rehabilitation in the hospital setting will attend the hospital twice each week for
      eight weeks for supervised exercise training and education. People in the home pulmonary
      rehabilitation group will receive one home visit and weekly telephone calls for eight weeks,
      for supervision and mentoring of exercise and provision of education. We will compare the
      number of people who complete the program in each setting. We will also test whether the
      groups have similar results for the standard pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes of
      breathlessness, quality of life and exercise capacity, at the end of the program and 12
      months later. We will compare health care costs and personal costs between groups after 12
      months.

      If home-based pulmonary rehabilitation can improve uptake of this important treatment,
      deliver good clinical outcomes and reduce costs this will have significant and long-lasting
      benefits for patients, the community and the health system
