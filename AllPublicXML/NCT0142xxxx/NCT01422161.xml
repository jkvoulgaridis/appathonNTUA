      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of botulinum toxin (commonly
      known as BOTOX®) into the affected hand of Stroke patients, while targeting the muscles
      controlling the hand, will lead to improved use of the hand when compared to injections of
      placebo (a substance that looks similar to the study drug but contains no active study
      medication).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparesis is the most common motor impairment after stroke that frequently leads to
      persistent deficits in hand function. This study investigates whether the application of
      botulinum toxin to a set of synergistically-acting hand muscles, in conjunction with
      task-specific therapy, will lead to reorganization and improved motor function in the
      stroke-involved hand. The investigators will use objective psychophysical measures of hand
      function and hand function rating scales to investigate if Botox in conjunction with
      task-specific therapy will lead to:

        -  improved motor execution,

        -  improved motor planning during a psychophysical two-finger grasping and lifting task
           with varying object weight, and

        -  increased hand function as assessed by the time taken to complete fine motor tasks.

    <measure>Measure of Upper Limb Motor Impairment Measured by Fugl Meyer Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Treatment, Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>This scale has 3 points for each item. A zero is given for the item if the subject cannot do the task. A score of 1 is given when the task is performed partially and a score of 2 is given when the task is performed fully. Reflex activity is measured using 2 points only, with a score of 0 or 3 for absence and presence of reflex. The maximum total score that can be obtained in Fugl Meyer assessment is 226, though it is common practice to assess all domains separately.The five domains assessed by Fugl-Meyer scale are:
Motor function (Maximum score in upper limb = 66; Maximum score in lower limb = 34) Sensory function (Maximum score = 24) Balance (Maximum score = 14) Range of motion of joints (Maximum score = 44) Joint pain (Maximum score = 44)</description>

    <measure>Disability Measured by Modified Rankin Scale Score Post-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability.The mRS is an ordered scale coded from 0 (no symptoms at all), 1 (No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities), 2 (Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance), 3 (Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance), 4 (Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance), 5 (severe disability) and 6 (death).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Impairment Measured by the Fugl-Meyer Scale Post-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day and 90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Scale is comprised of five domains and there are 155 items in total: Motor functioning (in the upper and lower extremities); Sensory functioning (evaluates light touch on two surfaces of the arm and leg, and position sense for 8 joints); Balance (contains 7 tests, 3 seated and 4 standing); Joint range of motion (8 joints); Joint pain. Each domain contains multiple items, each scored on a 3-point ordinal scale (0 = cannot perform, 1= perform partially, 2 = perform fully).</description>

        <title>Measure of Upper Limb Motor Impairment Measured by Fugl Meyer Scale</title>
        <description>This scale has 3 points for each item. A zero is given for the item if the subject cannot do the task. A score of 1 is given when the task is performed partially and a score of 2 is given when the task is performed fully. Reflex activity is measured using 2 points only, with a score of 0 or 3 for absence and presence of reflex. The maximum total score that can be obtained in Fugl Meyer assessment is 226, though it is common practice to assess all domains separately.The five domains assessed by Fugl-Meyer scale are:
Motor function (Maximum score in upper limb = 66; Maximum score in lower limb = 34) Sensory function (Maximum score = 24) Balance (Maximum score = 14) Range of motion of joints (Maximum score = 44) Joint pain (Maximum score = 44)</description>
