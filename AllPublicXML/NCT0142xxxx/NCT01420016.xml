  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to develop and implement sophisticated point-of-care
      Electronic Health Record (EHR)-based clinical decision support that (a) identifies and (b)
      prioritizes all available evidence-based treatment options to reduce a given patient's
      cardiovascular risk (CVR). After developing the EHR-based decision support intervention, the
      investigators will test its impact on CVR, the components of CVR, in a group randomized trial
      that includes 18 primary care clinics, 60 primary care physicians, and 18,000 adults with
      moderate or high CVR. This approach, if successful, will (a) improve chronic disease outcomes
      and reduce CVR for about 35% of the U.S. adult population, (b) maximize the clinical return
      on the massive investments that are increasingly being made in sophisticated outpatient EHR
      systems, and (c) provide a model for how to use EHR technology support to deliver
      &quot;personalized medicine&quot; in primary care settings

    <textblock>
      This project developed and implemented a sophisticated point-of-care EHR-based clinical
      decision support that (a) identified and (b) prioritized all available evidence-based
      treatment options to reduce a given patient's cardiovascular risk (CVR). The prioritized list
      of treatment options is provided in different formats to both the primary care physician
      (PCP) and patient at the time of each office visit made by a patient with moderate to high
      CVR and sub-optimally controlled and potentially reversible CVR factors. Available
      evidence-based treatment options are prioritized based on the magnitude of potential CVR
      reduction of each treatment option. This intervention strategy, referred to as Prioritized
      Clinical Decision Support (CDS), is specifically designed for widespread use in primary care
      settings and has the potential to substantially augment current efforts to control CVR in the
      35% of American adults with 10-year Framingham CVR of 10% or higher.

      To assess the ability of the CDS intervention to reduce CVR in adults, we randomized 18
      primary care clinics with 60 primary care physicians (PCPs) and approximately 18,000 eligible
      adults with baseline Framingham 10-year risk of a major CV event (either heart attack or
      stroke) of 10% or more into one of two experimental conditions: Group 1 includes 9 clinics
      (with 30 PCPs and 9,000 patients) that received prioritized clinical decision support (CDS)
      to reduce CVR at the time of each clinical encounter made by an eligible adult. Group 2
      includes 9 clinics (with 30 PCPs and 9,000 patients) that received no study intervention and
      constitute a usual care (UC) control group. The study formally tested the hypothesis that
      after control for baseline CVR, post-intervention 10-year Framingham CVR will be better in
      Group 1 than Group 2 at 12 months after start of the intervention. In addition, impact of the
      intervention on specific components of CVR (BP, lipids, glucose, aspirin use, and smoking)
      was assessed, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be quantified.

      This innovative project builds upon 10 years of prior work by our research team, and extends
      prior successful EHR clinical decision support interventions by introducing prioritization,
      by providing decision support to both patients and PCPs at the time of the office visit, and
      by extending the decision support across the broad and critically important clinical terrain
      of CVR reduction. The results of this project, whether positive or negative, will extend our
      understanding of how to maximize the clinical return on massive public and private sector
      investments now being made in sophisticated outpatient EHR systems. If successful, this
      decision support tool could be broadly used to both standardize and personalize care
      delivered by case managers, pharmacists, and other providers in a wide range of care delivery
      configurations.

    <description>Ten year cardiovascular risk was calculated at each post index visit from the most recent clinical and laboratory values in the EMR. The Framingham lipid equation was used when a lipid value was available in the previous 5 years; otherwise the Framingham BMI equation was used. The primary outcome was the annualized rate of change (slope) in 10-year CVR, estimated for each treatment group from the time and time-by-treatment parameters of a mixed regression model which predicted post-index CVR values from time elapsed since index, treatment group and the time by treatment interaction.</description>

    <description>The Prioritized Clinical Decision Support (CDS) intervention is a protocol driven CDS system linked within the EMR that identifies patients with high cardiovascular risk and provides tailored, prioritized decision support to the provider and patient at the point of care. The CDS was printed at intervention sites. It i) compiled most recent lab data (A1c, SBP, and LDL), BMI, smoking status, and aspirin use, (ii) calculated a 10-year risk for stroke or heart attack, (iii) prioritized clinical domains based on the absolute risk reduction for each component, (iv) compiled information related to renal and liver function, creatine kinase level, and previous diagnoses (CHF, CVD, DM), and (v) provided recommendations for intensification of therapy for A1c, SBP and/or LDL if not at goal.</description>

        <title>Predicted Annual Rate of Change in 10-year Risk of Fatal or Nonfatal Heart Attack or Stroke</title>
        <description>Ten year cardiovascular risk was calculated at each post index visit from the most recent clinical and laboratory values in the EMR. The Framingham lipid equation was used when a lipid value was available in the previous 5 years; otherwise the Framingham BMI equation was used. The primary outcome was the annualized rate of change (slope) in 10-year CVR, estimated for each treatment group from the time and time-by-treatment parameters of a mixed regression model which predicted post-index CVR values from time elapsed since index, treatment group and the time by treatment interaction.</description>

            <description>The Prioritized Clinical Decision Support (CV Wizard) intervention is a protocol driven clinical decision support system linked within the EMR that identifies patients with high cardiovascular risk and provides tailored, prioritized decision support to the provider and patient at the point of care. The CV Wizard was printed at intervention sites and i) compiled lab data (most recent A1c, SBP, and LDL levels), BMI, smoking status, and aspirin use, (ii) calculated a 10-year risk for stroke or heart attack using the Framingham Risk Score, (iii) prioritized clinical domains based on the absolute risk reduction for each component, (iv) compiled information related to renal and liver function, creatine kinase level, and previous diagnoses (CHF, CVD, DM), and (v) provided recommendations for intensification of therapy for A1c, SBP and/or LDL if not at goal. Recommendations were based on evidenced-based protocols including JNC-8, ADA, and Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI).</description>

            <non_inferiority_desc>The analysis used a time-by-condition mixed model to estimate the annual rate of change in post-index CV risk values by treatment group. The models included fixed effects for study arm (CDS vs. UC), time (years since index), and study-arm-by-time comparing the rate of change in CDS versus UC and a random clinic intercept. The intervention effect was the difference in rate of change in CDS versus UC clinics, with the study-arm-by-time interaction assessing statistical significance (P&lt;0.05).</non_inferiority_desc>

      <time_frame>We monitored rates of occurrence by study arm (blinded by study arm) every 6 months, from 6 months pre, through the end of the 24-month intervention period. Randomization occurred at the clinic level and all providers at the clinics had access to the CDS tool. We monitored all patients receiving care at randomized clinics regardless of their exposure to the intervention.</time_frame>
      <desc>We conducted passive safety surveillance for all patients in all randomized clinics using routinely collected EMR data to monitor for potential safety events. This means that the safety data population (N=11,551) is a larger population than the analysis population (N=7,914). We identified, a priori, events related to more intensive BP or lipid treatment: hypotensive or hypertensive urgency or emergency, syncope, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis.</desc>

          <description>The Prioritized Clinical Decision Support (CV Wizard) intervention is a protocol driven clinical decision support system linked within the EMR that identifies patients with high cardiovascular risk and provides tailored, prioritized decision support to the provider and patient at the point of care. The CV Wizard was printed at intervention sites and i) compiled lab data (most recent A1c, SBP, and LDL levels), BMI, smoking status, and aspirin use, (ii) calculated a 10-year risk for stroke or heart attack using the Framingham Risk Score, (iii) prioritized clinical domains based on the absolute risk reduction for each component, (iv) compiled information related to renal and liver function, creatine kinase level, and previous diagnoses (CHF, CVD, DM), and (v) provided recommendations for intensification of therapy for A1c, SBP and/or LDL if not at goal. Recommendations were based on evidenced-based protocols including JNC-8, ADA, and Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI).</description>
