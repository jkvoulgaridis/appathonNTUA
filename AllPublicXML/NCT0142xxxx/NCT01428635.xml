    <textblock>
      This phase II/III trial studies how well eltrombopag olamine works in treating
      thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis receiving
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Eltrombopag olamine may cause the body to make platelets
      after receiving treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of eltrombopag (eltrombopag olamine) for patients with chronic
      myeloid leukemia (CML) or myelofibrosis (MF) who have developed thrombocytopenia during the
      course of therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as measured by recovery of platelet
      count.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of eltrombopag for patients with CML or MF who have developed
      thrombocytopenia during the course of therapy with TKI.

      II. To determine the dose intensity of TKI after start of therapy with eltrombopag.

      III. To determine response to TKI after start of therapy with eltrombopag.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive eltrombopag olamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

    <description>The proportions of subjects with complete (platelet) response will be reported together with exact 95% confidence intervals. The denominator will include all subjects who received eltrombopag olamine. Platelet counts over time and in relationship to exposure to eltrombopag and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) will be summarized using descriptive statistics.</description>

             Administration (FDA) approved TKI; or CML patients in accelerated or blastic phase who
             are considered to be in this phase because of thrombocytopenia or because of clonal
             evolution and with no other criteria for accelerated/blastic phase or patients with
             myelofibrosis receiving treatment with FDA approved TKI and with peripheral blood
