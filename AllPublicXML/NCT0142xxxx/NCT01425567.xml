  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish a process by which critically ill infants with parenteral nutrition-associated
      liver disease can receive a fish oil-based intravenous lipid emulsion (Omegaven®) for
      compassionate use when no satisfactory alternative treatments are available.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria (having a direct bilirubin ≥4.0 mg/dL) and are
      consented will be discontinued from standard soybean-based lipid emulsion and started on
      Omegaven®. Omegaven® will be infused continuously via either a peripheral or central catheter
      at a dose of 1 gm/kg/day along with parenteral nutrition (PN).
