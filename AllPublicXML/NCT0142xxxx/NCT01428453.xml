      The study is designed to investigate the effects of rilapladib on biomarkers related to the
      Alzheimer's disease, and cognitive function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is in subjects with Alzheimer's disease and evidence of cerebrovascular disease
      (CVD) who are currently treated with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) and/or
      memantine. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group,
      repeat dose design, in which subjects (up to 60 randomized subjects per arm) will receive
      oral placebo or rilapladib (250 mg), once daily for 24 weeks in addition to their stable
      background AD therapy consisting of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) and/or
      memantine. Subjects will take 250mg of rilapladib or placebo once daily for a period of 24
      weeks. The total duration of participation for each subject will be approximately 30 weeks
      comprising approximately 4 weeks screening, 24 weeks treatment and 2 weeks follow-up. From
      the time of randomization and throughout the treatment period subjects will attend visits
      after 1 week, 4 weeks and thereafter every 4 weeks until Week 24. A follow-up visit will
      occur approximately 2 weeks after the final dose of study medication. Cognitive assessments
      will be performed at the screening visit, at the randomization (baseline) visit and at weeks
      12 and 24 of the treatment period. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be taken via lumbar
      puncture at baseline and Week 24 for biomarker analyses related to Alzheimer's disease. Blood
      samples will be collected throughout the study for pharmacokinetics and a range of biomarker
      analyses. A range of safety and tolerability assessments will also be performed (including
      vital signs, laboratory tests, eye examinations and ECGs).

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The WM/EF composite score was comprised of 5 functional tests including 1) Controlled oral word association which measured language fluency, planning and working memory, 2) Category naming: It measures semantic fluency, planning and working memory, 3) One-back: This is a measure of working memory. 4) Trail B: This is a measure of motor speed, visual scanning, and visual-motor integration. This test required attention and cognitive flexibility. 5) Go No-Go task: This test evaluate accuracy and reaction time for each response. The composite score calculated by standardizing the total score: sum of all responses obtained from these 5 functional test by using the formula (Total score of ITT population at baseline - Total score at Week 24) /standard deviation of mean total mean score at baseline. The observed composite score ranged from minimum -1.474 and maximum 1.596. Lower score means better cognitive status.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were randomized to either rilapladib or placebo from October-2011 to February-2013. The study duration was approximately 30 weeks (screening: 4 weeks, treatment: 24 weeks and follow-up: 2 weeks).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Total of 170 participants were screened, of which 124 were randomized in 24 centres. Out of 124 participants, one was excluded from safety population due to randomization error. Out of 123 participants, 2 were excluded due to unavailability of post-baseline efficacy data. Intention to treat (ITT) population consisted of 121 participants.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>CSF Abeta biomarkers (Abeta42, Abeta40) were assessed at Baseline visit (Day 0) and Week 24 (Day 168). Change from Baseline in CSF Abeta42 and Abeta40 are summarized. Baseline and Week 24 study visits were taken place at approximately the same time of day in the morning (preferably between 08:00 and 12:00) to improve the reliability of CSF. Baseline value was defined as the latest Day 0 value. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose (Week 24) visit value minus Baseline value. The data is presented in for adjusted mean and standard error of adjusted mean.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 0) in the Computerized Test Battery for Cognition (CogState) Battery Working Memory/Executive Function (WM/EF) Composite Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The WM/EF composite score was comprised of 5 functional tests including 1) Controlled oral word association which measured language fluency, planning and working memory, 2) Category naming: It measures semantic fluency, planning and working memory, 3) One-back: This is a measure of working memory. 4) Trail B: This is a measure of motor speed, visual scanning, and visual-motor integration. This test required attention and cognitive flexibility. 5) Go No-Go task: This test evaluate accuracy and reaction time for each response. The composite score calculated by standardizing the total score: sum of all responses obtained from these 5 functional test by using the formula (Total score of ITT population at baseline - Total score at Week 24) /standard deviation of mean total mean score at baseline. The observed composite score ranged from minimum -1.474 and maximum 1.596. Lower score means better cognitive status. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit minus Baseline value.</description>

Baseline and Week 24 study visits were taken place at approximately the same time of day in the morning (preferably between 08:00 and 12:00) to improve the reliability of CSF. Baseline value was defined as the latest Day 0 value. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose (Week 24) visit value minus Baseline value.

        <description>Plasma Lp-PLA2 was assessed at Baseline visit (Day 0) and Week 24 (Day 168). Percentage inhibition in plasma Lp-PLA2 activity ratio is summarized. Percentage inhibition was calculated by dividing change from Baseline in plasma LpPLA2 by Baseline LpPLA2 multiplied by -100. Baseline value was defined as the latest Day 0 value. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose (Week 24) visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>CogState battery overall composite score comprised of 8 functional tests 1) Controlled oral word association test measured language fluency, planning and working memory. 2) Category naming test measured semantic fluency, planning and working memory. 3) One-back test measured working memory. 4) Trail B test measured motor speed, visual scanning and visual-motor integration, required attention and cognitive flexibility. 5) Go No-Go task evaluated accuracy and reaction time for each response. 6) International shopping list immediate and delayed recall tests measured episodic memory. 7) Identification task test assessed visual attention. 8) Trail A test measured psychomotor speed and attention. Composite score= total score (sum of all responses from 8 functional test) by formula (Total score at baseline - Week 24) / SD of total score at baseline. Score ranged: -1.070 to 0.907. Lower score indicated the better cognitive status. Change from Baseline= post-dose visit minus Baseline value</description>
