  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      . New- onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication after cardiac
      surgery and its occurrence increases with age. POAF can result in clinically significant
      morbidity and mortality. The national trend in the US is that the population older than 65
      years is increasing, making healthcare expenditure related to POAF to be a major burden on
      health care system. Effective treatment of POAF is imperative in ensuring quality of care and
      reduction of costs.

      In 2021 there is a projected total of 377,763 cardiovascular surgeries in the US alone with
      approximately half of which will have POAF with longer postoperative length of stay (+3.9
      days) and higher discharge costs (+$13,993) than no-POAF patients (Reference: Ann Thorac
      Surg. 2015 Jan;99(1):109-14). Amiodarone, the currently used therapy, is often insufficient
      to prevent POAF and has multiple side-effects. In this study, we expect to improve the
      incidence of POAF by using a common acne drug (Minocycline) that is safe and that could be
      incorporated in clinical care of this disease.

      New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery (POAF) is commonly observed
      and it increases morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure. Amiodarone administration
      is proposed initial agent for prevention and treatment of POAF, but while useful, this drug
      has a number of adverse side-effects and relapse requiring anticoagulation therapy at
      hospital discharge is prevalent. Effective medications are needed with respect to management.
      Minocycline, an old tetracycline antibiotic, has additional effects including inhibition of
      atrial myocyte apoptosis.The finding that apoptosis of right atrial myocytes is thought to be
      one etiologic factor underlying POAF supports examining the hypothesis in this project that
      adding minocycline to amiodarone could favorably reduce POAF frequency rate. Minocycline has
      been used for over four decades and has a good safety profile, therefore this investigation
      is not a phase I trial. With a limited sample size, while the data of our MINAA Exploratory
      trial (the Minocycline Plus Amiodarone Versus Amiodarone Alone for the Prevention of Atrial
      Fibrillation After Cardiac Surgery) were not sufficient to draw definite conclusions, rather
      they suggested feasibility of such therapy in this cohort. In the current pilot study, we
      assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of minocycline plus amiodarone in preventing
      POAF with a larger cohort of two parallel groups (n=40, each) randomly assigned in a 1:1
      ratio.In this trial we compare intravenous minocycline 100 mg daily x 5 days starting
      intra-operatively combined with oral amiodarone (400 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 200 mg
      twice daily for the next 7 days), versus the same dose oral amiodarone alone, for prevention
      of POAF among adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafts, heart valve repair or
      replacement, or combined procedures. All patients receive 150 mg intravenous amiodarone
      intraoperatively and a 2nd similar dose of amiodarone bolus is permitted for tachyarrhythmia
      any time within 24 hours after surgery.The primary outcome is a newly detected POAF by
      telemetry, Holter monitoring, or by daily wireless ECG sensors within 6 weeks from the time
      of randomization. Composite secondary outcomes include death at 30 days, length of hospital
      stay, and other adverse events.To elucidate how minocycline causally elicits its
      pharmacologic effects, sera sampling of biomarkers such as NF-Kappa B, cleaved caspase-3, and
      NT-pro-BNP are measured pre-procedure, then on the 3rd and 5th postoperative days. If the
      proposed intervention is successful, it underscores what can ensue when the target evolves to
      the common population level requiring a nuanced approach pursued by Phase III-IV proposals

The recording of adverse events is collected through email or by telephone calls that are made by research coordinator. Minocycline related adverse events includes an unexplained rash, as well as increased liver enzymes.</description>

        Inclusion criteria are adults, including women and minorities &gt; 18 years of age, who are
        also willing to participate for the duration of the trial (6 weeks). All non-congenital
        cardiac operations are included: CABG, valve repair/replacement, or combination of CABG and
        heart valve operations. Patients should be able to access iPhones and download ECGs using
        their electronic Devices. Exclusion criteria Patients with prior (within 6 months) or
        current atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter, patients undergoing concomitant surgical AF
        ablation or a history of AF, transcatheter aortic valve replacement or other minimally
        invasive procedures, prior cerebrovascular event, cardiogenic shock or resuscitation,
        evidence of hepatic or renal dysfunctions (i.e., an alanine aminotransferase level that is
        ≥ twice the upper limit of the normal range, or either a serum creatinine level that is ≥
        2.0 mg/dL or need for preoperative dialysis) are excluded. Other exclusion criteria are the
        following: thyrotoxicosis, pregnancy, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD,
        with FEV1/FVC &lt;70%), recent history of drug or alcohol abuse, and intolerance to
        tetracycline or amiodarone. Because a core scientific basis of this trial concerning the
        role of underlying atrial tissue inflammatory/apoptotic activity, patients with
        inflammatory conditions such as lupus, severe arthritis, thyroiditis or inflammatory bowel
        disease are excluded; as are patients taking preoperative immunosuppressant agents,
        long-term (&gt;10 days) oral corticosteroids (prednisolone &gt; 10mg or other), or estrogen
        replacement; and finally patients with newly diagnosed cancer (&lt;5 years) are also excluded.
