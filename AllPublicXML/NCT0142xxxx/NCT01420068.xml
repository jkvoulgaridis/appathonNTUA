    <measure>Change in Weight Assessments From Baseline (Visit 2 of the Core Study) to Long Term (LT) Visit 18 (Week 104) for the Enrolled to Follow-up Set (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to LT Visit 18 (Week 104): 2 years (104 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participant weight was measured at Baseline (Visit 2 of the Core study), LT Visit 17, LT Visit 18 ([Week 104] only for participants identified in the core study as having primary hypertension), and LT Visit 19 ([Week 156] only for participants identified in the core study as having secondary hypertension). Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg in indoor clothing, but without shoes.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to LT Visit 18 (Week 104): 2 years (104 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participant height and weight was measured at Baseline (Visit 2 of the Core study), LT Visit 17, LT Visit 18 ([Week 104] only for participants identified in the core study as having primary hypertension), and LT Visit 19 ([Week 156] only for participants identified in the core study as having secondary hypertension).

    <measure>Change in Neurocognitive Assessments From Baseline (Visit 2 of the Core Study) to Long Term (LT) Visit 18 (Week 104) for the EFS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to LT Visit 18 (Week 104): 2 years (104 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>All participants who were determined to have secondary hypertension in the core study and had a Baseline (Visit 2) standardized neurocognitive assessment in the core study received follow-up neurocognitive assessments at LT Visit 18 and LT Visit 19 with the same tool. The neurocognitive assessment of development included assessment of the following abilities: Attention, Processing speed, Working memory, and Motor speed. For Numbers (Forward and Backward Raw Score), Visual Matching (Number Correct), Sequences (Total Raw Score): positive change indicates a numerical increase, which is considered a better outcome/improvement; negative change/numerical decrease is considered a worse outcome/decline. For Visual Matching (Time to Complete), Time Tapping (Right and Left Hands), and Timed Gait: positive change indicates a numerical increase, which is considered a worse outcome/decline; negative change/numerical decrease is considered a better outcome/improvement.</description>

          <title>Change in BMI Assessments From Baseline (Visit 2 of the Core Study) to Long Term (LT) Visit 18 (Week 104) for the EFS</title>
          <description>Participant height and weight was measured at Baseline (Visit 2 of the Core study), LT Visit 17, LT Visit 18 ([Week 104] only for participants identified in the core study as having primary hypertension), and LT Visit 19 ([Week 156] only for participants identified in the core study as having secondary hypertension). BMI was derived.</description>
          <population>The EFS consisted of all participants who signed the ICF for the second extension study. Number of participants is the number of EFS participants with non-missing measurement at LT Visit 18. Participants with missing data at LT Visit 18 were not included in the analysis.</population>

        <title>Change in Neurocognitive Assessments From Baseline (Visit 2 of the Core Study) to Long Term (LT) Visit 18 (Week 104) for the EFS</title>
        <description>All participants who were determined to have secondary hypertension in the core study and had a Baseline (Visit 2) standardized neurocognitive assessment in the core study received follow-up neurocognitive assessments at LT Visit 18 and LT Visit 19 with the same tool. The neurocognitive assessment of development included assessment of the following abilities: Attention, Processing speed, Working memory, and Motor speed. For Numbers (Forward and Backward Raw Score), Visual Matching (Number Correct), Sequences (Total Raw Score): positive change indicates a numerical increase, which is considered a better outcome/improvement; negative change/numerical decrease is considered a worse outcome/decline. For Visual Matching (Time to Complete), Time Tapping (Right and Left Hands), and Timed Gait: positive change indicates a numerical increase, which is considered a worse outcome/decline; negative change/numerical decrease is considered a better outcome/improvement.</description>

        <description>Participant weight and height was measured at Baseline (Visit 2 of the Core study), LT Visit 17, LT Visit 18 ([Week 104] only for participants identified in the core study as having primary hypertension), and LT Visit 19 ([Week 156] only for participants identified in the core study as having secondary hypertension). Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg in indoor clothing, but without shoes. BMI was derived.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to EOS (2 to 3 years). EOS was defined as LT Visit 18 (Week 104) and LT Visit 19 (Week 156) for participants with primary and secondary hypertension, respectively.</time_frame>
        <population>The EFS consisted of all participants who signed the ICF for the second extension study. Number of participants is the number of EFS participants with non-missing measurement at EOS.

        <title>Change in Neurocognitive Assessments From Baseline (Visit 2 of the Core Study) to EOS by Hypertension Group</title>
        <description>All participants who were determined to have secondary hypertension in the core study and had a Baseline (Visit 2) standardized neurocognitive assessment in the core study received follow-up neurocognitive assessments at LT Visit 18 and LT Visit 19 with the same tool. The neurocognitive assessment of development included assessment of the following abilities: Attention, Processing speed, Working memory, and Motor speed. For Numbers (Forward and Backward Raw Score), Visual Matching (Number Correct), Sequences (Total Raw Score): positive change indicates a numerical increase, which is considered a better outcome/improvement; negative change/numerical decrease is considered a worse outcome/decline. For Visual Matching (Time to Complete), Time Tapping (Right and Left Hands), and Timed Gait: positive change indicates a numerical increase, which is considered a worse outcome/decline; negative change/numerical decrease is considered a better outcome/improvement.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>This study only collected the occurrence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) occurring within the first 30 days after the participant had completed the first extension study. SAEs experienced after this 30 day period were reported to Novartis/Noden only if the investigator suspected a causal relationship to the study drug. Every SAE, within the above timeframe was to be reported to Novartis/Noden within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.</time_frame>

          <description>No study treatment (aliskiren or enalapril) was administered in this off-therapy non-interventional second extension study.

During Study CSPP100A2365E1, participants were to receive one of the following doses of enalapril based on their weight: low weight (≥20 to &lt;50 kg) participants - starting dose 2.5 mg with optional titration to 5 and then 10 mg; mid weight (≥50 to &lt;80 kg) participants - starting dose 5 mg with optional titration to 10 and then 20 mg; high weight (≥80 to ≤150 kg) participants - starting dose 10 mg with optional titration to 20 and then 40 mg.</description>
