    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether implementing a novel syringe and IV
      stopcock cap system impregnated with alcohol will reduce IV catheter bacterial contamination
      and infections in patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial contamination of patient intravenous stopcock sets is a common intraoperative event
      associated with increased patient mortality, possibly via an infectious mechanism. The most
      common type of intravenous tubing used in operating rooms is the open lumen stopcock set
      which lacks a barrier between the environment and intraluminal space, and thus the
      intravascular space of the patient. The stopcock connector can be easily contaminated by
      provider hands due to improper handling of the device and/or contaminated by soiled syringe
      tips subsequently connected to the device. Further, the stopcock connector is often left
      uncapped by the provider and directly exposed to the environment. Thus, common breaches in
      intraoperative aseptic practice of healthcare providers can lead to bacterial contamination
      of the endoluminal space of the open lumen device. The primary aim of the current study is to
      assess the efficacy of a passive bundle designed to decrease intravenous stopcock and tubing
      intraluminal bacterial contamination. This passive bundle includes two novel interventions, a
      DOCit station and HubScrub caps. The HubScrub is designed to clean the needleless connectors
      and open lumen stopcock systems. The DOCit station is designed to simultaneously clean the
      interior and exterior of needle-less luer connectors of syringes with isopropyl alcohol while
      also providing a method of storage and organization of multiple syringes. The investigators
      hypothesize that the application of this passive bundle to the standard open lumen system
      commonly employed by anesthesia providers in the operating room will significantly reduce
      bacterial contamination of standard 3-way open lumen stopcock sets and improve patient
      safety.

    <measure>Presence of Positive Bacterial Culture in IV Stopcock Due to Effluent Contamination</measure>
    <time_frame>Until positive, up to 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Open lumen ports were removed from the patient; sent directly to the anesthesiology microbiology laboratory; connected by the same clinical laboratory scientist to sterile catheters using sterile, aseptic technique; and injected directly into a BacT/Alert 3D system (bioMÃ©rieux Inc., Durham, NC) with 2 mL of sterile saline per port. BacT/Alert is a blood culture system that automatically monitors bacterial growth using colorimetry; a sensor inserted at the bottom of the bottle changes color on detecting the carbon dioxide produced by the growth of the bacteria. Catheters were then removed, and the bottles were directly incubated in the BacT/Alert system for 5 days or until positive. Once positive, the liquid in the bottle was examined to identify the organism.</description>

        <description>Open lumen ports were removed from the patient; sent directly to the anesthesiology microbiology laboratory; connected by the same clinical laboratory scientist to sterile catheters using sterile, aseptic technique; and injected directly into a BacT/Alert 3D system (bioMÃ©rieux Inc., Durham, NC) with 2 mL of sterile saline per port. BacT/Alert is a blood culture system that automatically monitors bacterial growth using colorimetry; a sensor inserted at the bottom of the bottle changes color on detecting the carbon dioxide produced by the growth of the bacteria. Catheters were then removed, and the bottles were directly incubated in the BacT/Alert system for 5 days or until positive. Once positive, the liquid in the bottle was examined to identify the organism.</description>
