  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this international study is to assess the effect of varying degrees of
      impaired hepatic function compared to a normal hepatic function (Child-Pugh classification)
      on the pharmacokinetics and safety of midostaurin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Midostaurin is developed for the treatment of patients with hematological and
      nonhematological malignancies. However, disease complications and various co-medications
      render a hepatic impairment study in the targeted patient population difficult.

      Metabolism and elimination of midostaurin is predominantly occurring in the liver. Patients
      with impaired hepatic function may have a higher risk to have a decreased elimination or
      metabolism of midostaurin which may lead to increased systemic exposure or toxicity, hence
      understanding the impact of an impaired hepatic function on midostaurin PK is important.

      Cumulative safety data from over 900 subjects exposed to midostaurin showed that the drug is
      well tolerated in patients and in healthy subjects, thus, it is appropriate and justifiable
      to study midostaurin in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.
