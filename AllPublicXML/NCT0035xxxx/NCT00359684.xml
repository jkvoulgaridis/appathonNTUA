  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystinosis is an inherited disease resulting in poor growth and kidney failure. There is no
      known cure for cystinosis, although kidney transplantation may help the renal failure and
      prolong survival. Both the kidney damage and growth failure are thought to be due to the
      accumulation of the amino acid cystine within the cells of the body. The cystine storage
      later damages other organs besides the kidneys, including the thyroid gland, pancreas, eyes,
      and muscle.

      The drug cysteamine (Cystagon) is an oral medication given to patients with cystinosis prior
      to kidney transplantation. The drug works by reducing the level of cystine in the white blood
      cells and muscle tissue. The drug may also decrease levels of cystine in the kidneys and
      other tissues.

      This study has several goals:

        1. &lt;TAB&gt;Long-term surveillance of cysteamine (Cystagon) treated patients.

        2. &lt;TAB&gt;Detection of new non-kidney complications of cystinosis.

        3. &lt;TAB&gt;Maintenance of a patient population for genetic testing (mutational analysis) of
           the cystinosis gene.&lt;TAB&gt;

      Patients with nephropathic cystinosis have been treated with the cystine-depleting agent
      cysteamine since 1978. This therapy prevents or delays renal deterioration, improves growth,
      and depletes parenchymal tissues of cystine. Based largely upon data produced through this
      protocol, the Food and Drug Administration approved cysteamine bitartrate for use in
      cystinosis patients on August 15, 1994. Cysteamine is available as CystagonR through Mylan
      Pharmaceuticals in 50 mg and 150 mg capsules and as ProcysbiR in 75 mg capsules. By virtue of
      the current protocol, patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for investigations
      every two years, except for cases of great interest or urgency. On each 1-3 day admission, a
      battery of tests is performed and the adequacy of cystine depletion by cysteamine is
      monitored. This protocol demonstrates the course of cystinosis patients treated with
      cysteamine, describes new complications of the disorder in poorly treated adults, and
      maintains NHGRI expertise in the field. Its monitoring and followup of patients over the
      course of 3 decades represents an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the natural
      history of this rare disease.
