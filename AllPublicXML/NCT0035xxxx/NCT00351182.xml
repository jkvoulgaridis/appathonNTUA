      New antibiotics are required that have antibacterial activity against doxycyline resistant O.
      tsutsugamushi, that can be safely used in pregnant women and children, that have a low
      possibility of inducing resistance and that do not induce cross resistant to other
      antibiotics. Telithromycin has been reported to be effective on Rickettsia, Batonella and
      Coxiella burnetii. Therefore, telithromycin may be considered as a substitute antibiotic that
      can be used safely in pregnant women and children for rickettsiosis or Orientia infection.
      Our study was designed to prove the clinical usefulness of telithromycin by comparing it with
      doxycycline for treating mild or moderate scrub typhus.

      Randomization and treatment assignment. After submitting a written, informed consent, the
      patients with an temperature of higher than 37.5°C and who met the eligibility criteria were
      randomly allocated to receive one of two oral regimens in accordance with a protocol that was
      determined by the last digit of a resident registration number (the patients with an odd
      number were treated by a5-daycourseofdaily 200-mg doses of doxycycline,and the patients with
      an even number were treated by a 5-day course of daily 800-mg doses of telithromycin).
      Therapy was started immediately after acomprehensive clinical examinationand the collection
      of specimens for laboratory tests.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        We conducted a multicenter prospective study of patients with possible scrub typhus. Adult
        patients (aged ≥18 years) who have had fever (temperature: ≥37.5°C) together with eschar or
        a maculopapular skin rash and ≥2 of the following symptoms: headache, malaise, myalgia,
        coughing, nausea, and abdominal discomfort, were enrolled after obtaining an informed
        consent from the patients or their guardians (10). Each patient was admitted between
        September, 2005 to December, 2005 to Chosun University Hospital or one of its two community
        branch hospitals (Jangheung Hospital and Chumdan Hospital), which are all located in
        southwest Korea.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria were an inability to take oral medications, pregnancy,
             hypersensitivity to the trial drugs, previous drug therapy with potential
             antirickettsial activity (e.g., rifampicin, chloramphenicol, macrolides,
             fluoroquinolones or tetracyclines) within 48 h prior to admission, severe scrub typhus
             (shock requiring vasopressor therapy for &gt;1 h, a stuporous or comatose level of
             consciousness, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or renal failure
             requiring immediate dialysis)
