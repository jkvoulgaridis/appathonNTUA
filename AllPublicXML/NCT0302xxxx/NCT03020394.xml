  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies have shown that NPPV can avoid tracheal intubation in 40% to 60% patients
      who have severe exacerbation of COPD. Recently, large-scale comparative effectiveness
      research (CER) also found that compared with invasive ventilation, NPPV can reduce mortality
      rates. But there's no high-quality clinical studies which can confirm this. Therefore,
      investigators believe that NPPV can avoid intubation in patients with severe exacerbation of
      COPD in ICU with perfect monitoring conditions and reasonable human resource allocation, in
      order to reduce IMV-related complications and improve patients' outcomes.

    <textblock>
      In part of the patients who were AECOPD with pH &lt;7.25 , preliminary studies have shown that
      NPPV can avoid tracheal intubation in 40% to 60% patients, and also reduce the incidence of
      VAP. Recently, large-scale comparative effectiveness research (CER) also found that compared
      with invasive ventilation, NPPV can reduce mortality rates. At present, there's no
      high-quality clinical studies which can confirm this, and clinical guidelines do not have a
      recommendation on the use of NPPV in these patients. Therefore, investigators believe that
      NPPV can avoid intubation in patients with severe exacerbation of COPD in ICU with perfect
      monitoring conditions and reasonable human resource allocation, as well as the progress of
      medical technology in NPPV in recent years, in order to reduce IMV-related complications and
      improve patients' outcomes.

    <description>Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is achieved by Philips Respironics V60/Vision ventilator. Choose bilevel positive airway pressure mode, and adjust the fraction of inspire oxygen(FiO2) or oxygen flow rate to maintain patient's oxygen saturation(SpO2) between 88% to 92%. Parameter adjustment and weaning of NPPV follow the protocols used before.</description>

    <arm_group_label>High flow nasal cannula</arm_group_label>
    <description>High flow nasal cannula of different models (large, medium and small) are selected depending on the size and comfort of the patient's nostrils. Adjusting the oxygen flow rate (O2 Flow) maintains the patient's SpO2 88% to 92%. The flow was initially adjusted to 25 L/min and the flow was gradually adjusted to the patient's maximum tolerance. The inspiratory gas temperature (31 to 37 Â°C) was set to the patient's maximum tolerance level. If the patient's condition deteriorates and the tracheal intubation standard is met , the patient is recommended to undergo invasive ventilation treatment, but the choice of the final respiratory support method should be decided by the attending physician, patient and family.</description>
