      The overall objective of the present study is to examine the effects of umbilical cord
      milking at birth in preterm infants to prevent and decrease anemia using a multi-center
      prospective randomized controlled trial comparing immediate cord clamping (standard at
      present) with umbilical cord milking.

      Anemia is a significant problem for pre-term infants and a major risk factor for preterm
      babies mortality and morbidity in neonatal intensive care unit(NICU). the majority of
      pre-term babies will require one or more blood transfusions during in NICU. Blood transfusion
      is a safe procedure but like all therapeutic interventions has risks associated with it and
      effort is made to reduce the number of transfusions that infants require during their stay on
      the neonatal unit.

      Delayed cord clamping has a beneficial effect on prevention of anemia in later infancy
      because of increased iron stores at birth. However there are controversies in incorporating
      delayed cord clamping practice in the management of third stage of labour globally.
      Concerning about the need for urgent resuscitation and temperature management, attendants
      encouraged to clamp the umbilical cord immediately so that post-natal resuscitation and care
      can start as soon as possible.However,umbilical cord milking allows for swift intervention
      and resuscitation and attention to thermal care and should take less than 10 seconds to
      complete.

      The specific aim of this study is to investigate the effects of umbilical cord milking on
      preventing and decreasing anemia in very pre-term infants.

      Primary:

      To study the effect of umbilical cord milking on hemoglobin (Hb), Hematocrit (Hct)and
      ferritin at birth, at seventh day and three months of age.

      Secondary:

      To study the effect of umbilical cord milking on short term clinical profile of neonates like
      jaundice, polycythemia etc.

      To evaluate the number of blood transfusions until 3 months corrected gestational age (CGA),
      To assess preterm infant complications such as lung function as assessed by oxygen dependency
      at 36 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA), and cardiovascular function as assessed by the
      need for volume expansion, inotropes, or clinically suspected patent ductus arteriosus(PDA
      )requiring intervention prior to discharge home,incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and
      late-onset sepsis,etc.
