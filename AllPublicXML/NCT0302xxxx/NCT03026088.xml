The individual question items (Likert scale 0-4) are first summed for each item under the various sections. Then, those summary scores are then standardized on a scale between 0 and 1 using the mean and standard deviation of the actual scores and finally, weighted to a scale between 0 and 100. The items contributing to a scale are scored so that a higher score represents better health, and they are averaged together to create the scale score. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively.</description>

        <description>MLHF questionnaire has 21 items. Questions assess the impact of frequent physical symptoms of heart failure and the effects of heart failure on physical and social functions. Each question had a possible score of 0 (best) to 5 (worst), for a total of 0 to 105. The higher the summed score, the worse is the impact of heart failure on a participant's quality of life.</description>

        <description>Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), an instrument composed by 8 subscales: Physical Functioning, Physical Role Function, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Emotional Role Function and Mental Health. The individual question items (Likert scale 0-4) are first summed for each item under the various sections. Then, those summary scores are then standardized on a scale between 0 and 1 using the mean and standard deviation of the actual scores and finally, weighted to a scale between 0 and 100. The items contributing to a scale are scored so that a higher score represents better health, and they are averaged together to create the scale score. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively.</description>

        <title>6-Minute Walk Test</title>
        <description>6-min walk test was a practical simple test that requires a 100-feet hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced training for technicians. Walking is an activity performed daily by all but the most severely impaired participants. This test measures the distance that a participant can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes.</description>
