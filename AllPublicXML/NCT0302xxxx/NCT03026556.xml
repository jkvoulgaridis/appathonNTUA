    <description>The event rate of overall stroke (hemorrhagic, ischemic, uncertain) in patients matched on propensity scores without index year.
Event rates were calculated as the total number of patients in each treatment group who had the outcome during follow-up divided by the total person-years at risk in the cohort.
Length of Follow-up: The post-index follow-up period began the day following the NOAC index date and ended on whichever of the following occurred earliest:
The day of discontinuation of the index NOAC exposure;
The day before a switch to an anticoagulant different from the index exposure;
The day before a change in dose for the index NOAC;
The end of continuous eligibility of a patient in the health plan (disenrollment);
The end of the study observation period; or
The date of death of the patient.</description>

        <title>Stroke Overall (Hemorrhagic, Ischemic, Uncertain)</title>
        <description>The event rate of overall stroke (hemorrhagic, ischemic, uncertain) in patients matched on propensity scores without index year.
Event rates were calculated as the total number of patients in each treatment group who had the outcome during follow-up divided by the total person-years at risk in the cohort.
Length of Follow-up: The post-index follow-up period began the day following the NOAC index date and ended on whichever of the following occurred earliest:
The day of discontinuation of the index NOAC exposure;
The day before a switch to an anticoagulant different from the index exposure;
The day before a change in dose for the index NOAC;
The end of continuous eligibility of a patient in the health plan (disenrollment);
The end of the study observation period; or
The date of death of the patient.</description>

        <description>The event rate of all-cause mortality in patients matched on propensity scores without index year.
Event rates were calculated as the total number of patients in each treatment group who had the outcome during follow-up divided by the total person-years at risk in the cohort.
Follow-up time was the time elapsed from the index date to the date of the outcome of interest, disenrollment, end of the observation period (available data), death, discontinuation of the NOAC, or switch to a different NOAC, whichever came first</description>
