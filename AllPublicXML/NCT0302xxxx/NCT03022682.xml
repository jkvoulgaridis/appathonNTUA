  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects over one third of US adults (&gt;72 million, with BMI ≥30 kg/m2), and the
      proportion of US adults with BMI ≥40 kg/m2 has doubled in the last 20 years. Obesity is
      associated with increased mortality through its linkage to comorbidities including diabetes,
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and psychosocial disturbances. Given
      its prevalence, impact on morbidity and mortality, and economic cost, limiting the spread of
      obesity and its consequences is one of the most important problems of our time.

      In this proposed study, investigators will recruit subjects from a wide range of body mass
      index (BMI), ethnicity and Diabetes risk to collect data and blood, stool and adipose tissue
      samples in the San Francisco bay area.

      The Inflammation, Diabetes, Ethnicity and Obesity (IDEO) cohort is recruiting 200 individuals
      from various ethnicities, covering a spectrum of weight and Diabetes risk. The study healthy
      lean, overweight and obese subjects and people who are slated to undergo any type of
      bariatric surgery for obesity or any other type of abdominal surgery at UCSF.

    <description>Adipose tissue samples are collected from all subjects, including aspirational subcutaneous biopsies from nonsurgical subjects and excisional biopsies, performed intra-operatively by surgical collaborators as required.
Participants also undergo anthropometric measurements, stool collection, blood sample collection for circulating blood cells, serum, and plasma.
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan for amount and distribution of body fat as well as bone density is performed.
Study subjects complete validated questionnaire inventories to measure bio-behavioral issues such as depression, stress, health locus of control, and dietary habits.</description>

             increasingly undergoing bariatric surgery.

          -  Patients with either diabetes type 2 or the metabolic syndrome will be included in the
             cohort.
