  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, randomized, crossover trial to investigate the relative
      bioavailability of tepotinib in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four volunteers will be randomized
      to one of the two treatment sequences: Sequence A: test, reference, Sequence B: reference,
      test. The reference treatment refers to the current Phase II film-coated tablet (5 * 100
      milligram (mg) tepotinib film-coated tablets) and the test treatment to the new Phase III
      film-coated tablet (1 * 500 mg film-coated tepotinib tablet).

        <title>Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Death, TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. The term TEAE is defined as AEs starting or worsening after the first intake of the study drug.</description>

Because 1 subject in each treatment sequence discontinued before receiving the second treatment, only 23 subjects received Test Treatment and 23 subjects received Reference Treatment.Thus, number of subjects analyzed per treatment is mentioned as 23.</population>

The parameters included heart rate (HR), RR, PR, QRS, QT and QTcB calculated by the Bazett formula.
