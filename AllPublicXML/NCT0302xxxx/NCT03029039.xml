  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis represents a serious public health issue characterized by a complex inflammatory
      response. In addition to their hemostatic role, platelets display inflammatory functions by
      secreting a variety of immunomodulatory factors and interacting with circulating immune
      cells. The investigators postulate that, in severe sepsis, platelets become activated and
      release amounts of different soluble inflammatory molecules that contribute to
      sepsis-associated inflammation. First, the investigators propose to assess whether severe
      sepsis impairs the ability of platelets to release soluble CD40L (sCD40L), an powerful
      platelet-derived immunomodulatory molecule, in ICU patients with S. aureus documented
      infection, ICU patients with documented infection involving other bacterial species, compared
      to ICU patients with inflammation of noninfectious origin and healthy blood donors. Then, the
      investigators wish to assess whether the bacterial species affects the release of platelet
      sCD40L and by an extensive screening of platelet soluble factors, the investigators propose
      to set up profiles of inflammatory molecules associated with the type of infection. Finally,
      the investigators will analyze platelets' activation state and their association with
      circulating immune, according to the type of infection. Therefore, this project is expected
      to assess to which extent the platelet inflammatory function is super-activated in severe
      sepsis and to identify new platelet-related biomarkers of sepsis.
