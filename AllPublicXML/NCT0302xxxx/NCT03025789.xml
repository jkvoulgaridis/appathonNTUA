    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of fexinidazole administered to patients with g-HAT at
      all stages of the disease. The aim of the present study is to provide additional information
      on the effectiveness and safety of fexinidazole and to assess its use under conditions as
      close as possible to those in real life, both in patients treated on an out-patient basis and
      in the hospital setting, depending on clinical status
