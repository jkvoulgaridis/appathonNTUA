    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate safety and efficacy of Occlutech® AFR device in patients with
      severe pulmonary hypertension (PH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll subjects with severe pulmonary hypertension until a maximum of 30
      patients have undergone implantation with the Occlutech® AFR device. Enrolment will be
      devided in 2 phases.

      Phase 1: At least 15 adult patients with age ≥ 18 years will be enrolled. Phase 2: Patients
      with age ≥ 6 years will be enrolled until a maximum of 30 patients is reached.

          3. The patient or his/her legal representative should have the ability to fluently speak
             and under-stand the language in which the study is being conducted. If the patient
             speaks a different language, then a sentence-to-sentence translation for unequivocal
             understanding must be provided.

          4. Written, informed consent by the patient or her/his legally-authorized representative
             for participation in the study.

          5. Patient agrees to comply with the follow-up schedule.

          6. Patient has had a successful BAS procedure and is in a stable hemodynamic state, as
             assessed by the investigator.

          7. Conventional treatment options for the patient are exhausted according to ESC and AHA
             guidelines.
