  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This biomarker study has been designed to assess the effects of different agents in both
      tumour tissue and peripheral samples to help inform the best combinations of DDR agents with
      immuno-oncology (IO) therapies. In the first instance 2 DDR agents will be assessed
      separately as monotherapy. Additional arms may be added later to evaluate other DDR agents
      and/or DDR and immunotherapy agents in combination or in sequence. The primary objective of
      the study is to investigate immune activation due to DDR inhibition by assessing tumour and
      blood samples of patients treated with study investigational agent(s).

      Patients are dosed for a minimum of nine days with drug. Surgery or biopsy can then take
      place at any time between Day 10 and Day 21 (depending on when it can be scheduled), but must
      occur with 24 hrs following three consecutive treatment days. During the treatment period,
      safety assessments must be completed at least weekly.

      Follow-up will be completed after surgical resection or biopsy has been completed and can be
      part of standard post-surgery follow-up. If this follow-up visit occurs prior to 30 days
      after the final dose, a further visit or telephone call must be conducted to assess that any
      toxicity has resolved and to check for late toxicity.
