  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Larotrectinib expanded access is for patients with cancer with a NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene
      fusion, who are ineligible for an ongoing larotrectinib clinical trial or have other
      considerations that prevent access to larotrectinib through an existing clinical trial. Gene
      fusion occurs when a gene is made by joining parts of two different genes. NTRK gene fusion
      can lead to the development of solid tumors in a variety of tissue types. The study drug
      larotrectinib blocks the action of the NTRK gene fusion.

      Expanded access is intended to treat individual patients with different types of cancers with
      a NTRK gene fusion who are unresponsive to current standard treatment for their condition and
      also are unable to participate in ongoing clinical trials.
