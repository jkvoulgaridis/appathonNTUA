  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition associated
      with significant disability, mortality and economic burden. MDD is ranked fourth in terms of
      disease burden as defined by the World Health Organization (2001). Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (CBT) and Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PDT) are found to be equally effective for
      patients with depression. However, many patients do not respond sufficiently to treatment and
      relapse rates are high. To be able to offer individualized treatment, a clinically important
      question is therefore whether some patients profit more from one of the two therapies. At
      present little is known on which patient characteristics (moderators) may be associated with
      differential outcomes of CBT and PDT and through what kind of therapeutic processes and
      mechanisms (mediators) improvements occur in each therapy mode. There are actually only
      theoretical assumptions sparsely supported by research findings on what moderates and
      mediates the treatment effects of CBT and PDT.

      Aims: The overall aim of this project is to examine putative moderators and mediators in CBT
      and PDT and develop more basic knowledge about their impact on outcomes of psychotherapy for
      patients with MDD.

      Methods and study design: The study is a randomized clinical trial. One hundred patients will
      be randomized to one of two treatment conditions. The patients will be treated over 28 weeks
      with either CBT (one weekly session over 16 weeks and 3 booster sessions (monthly) during the
      rest of the 28 week study period) or PDT (one weekly session in 28 weeks). The patients will
      be evaluated at baseline, during therapy, at the end of therapy, and at follow-up
      investigations 1 and 3 years after treatment termination. The outcome measures comprise a
      large range of clinical and process variables, including assessment tools measuring specific
      preselected putative moderators and mediators.

      Discussion: The clinical outcome of this trial may guide clinicians to decide what kind of
      treatment should be offered the individual patient. Moreover, it will shed light on what kind
      of mechanisms in psychotherapy that is followed by symptom improvement and increased
      psychosocial functioning.
