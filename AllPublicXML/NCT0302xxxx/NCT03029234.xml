             guidelines

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test within 21 days prior to enrollment and agree to use an effective method of
             contraception during and for 30 days following last dose of carfilzomib. This protocol
             defines a FCBP as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, or 2) has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in
             the preceding 24 consecutive months)

          -  Male subjects must use an effective barrier method of contraception during the study
             and for 3 months following the last dose of carfilzomib if sexually active with a
             FCBP. Male subjects must not donate sperm during treatment and for an additional 90
             days after last dose of carfilzomib. Male subjects with pregnant partners must
             practice sexual abstinence or use a condom during vaginal sex.

There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.

sCR: As for CR, and absence of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow (BM). CR: No immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and &lt; 5% plasma cells in BM. Normal serum free light chain (SFLC) ratio if disease measurable only by SFLC.
VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not electrophoresis or ≥ 90% decrease in serum M-protein with urine M-protein &lt;100 mg/24 hrs. If disease measurable only by SFLC, ≥ 90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (dFLC).
PR: ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and ≥ 90% reduction in urine M-protein or to &lt; 200 mg/24 hrs, or a ≥ 50% decrease in dFLC. A ≥ 50% decrease in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas present at baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Response was assessed every 28 days until disease progression; ORR was analyzed after all participants received at least 6 cycles or discontinued treatment; the data cut-off date was 5 November 2018; median follow-up time for progression was 8.9 months.</time_frame>

        <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of partial response (PR), very good PR (VGPR), complete response (CR), or stringent CR (sCR) based on the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria.
sCR: As for CR, and absence of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow (BM). CR: No immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and &lt; 5% plasma cells in BM. Normal serum free light chain (SFLC) ratio if disease measurable only by SFLC.
VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not electrophoresis or ≥ 90% decrease in serum M-protein with urine M-protein &lt;100 mg/24 hrs. If disease measurable only by SFLC, ≥ 90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (dFLC).
PR: ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and ≥ 90% reduction in urine M-protein or to &lt; 200 mg/24 hrs, or a ≥ 50% decrease in dFLC. A ≥ 50% decrease in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas present at baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Response was assessed every 28 days until disease progression; ORR was analyzed after all participants received at least 12 cycles or discontinued treatment; the data cut-off date was 15 March 2019; median follow-up time for progression was 13.1 months.</time_frame>

        <description>Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from first evidence of PR or better to disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause per the IMWG-URC criteria.
PD:

Serum M-component (absolute increase ≥ 0.5 g/dL) and/or
Urine M-component (absolute increase ≥ 200 mg/24 hours)
In patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase &gt;10 mg/dL)
Definite development of new or increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
Development of hypercalcemia attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder.
DOR was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method; Participants with no documented progression or death were censored at the date of their last disease assessment.
DOR was determined based on both investigator and independent review committee response assessments.</description>

DOR was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method; Participants with no documented progression or death were censored at the date of their last disease assessment.
DOR was determined based on both investigator and independent review committee response assessments.</description>

Participants also received 20 mg dexamethasone IV or orally on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23.
Participants received treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, initiation of new antimyeloma therapy, withdrawal of consent, subject noncompliance, or intercurrent illness or worsening of a chronic condition, whichever occurred first.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
