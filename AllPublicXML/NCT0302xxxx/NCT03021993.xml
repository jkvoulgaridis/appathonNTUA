  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of nivolumab in patients with oral
      cavity cancer (OCC) who are about to undergo surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OCC patients who are scheduled for surgery will be given Nivolumab prior to surgery to see if
      there are any changes in surgical outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newly diagnosed histologically proven locoregional OCSCC without evidence of distant
             metastases and a clinically determined T-stage of 2-4,

             OR

             Recurrent or persistent histologically proven locoregional OCSCC that was initially
             treated with surgery alone, and a clinically determined recurrent T-stage of 2-4.

             Note - OCSCC includes the subsites of oral tongue, floor of mouth, gingiva, retromolar
             trigone, and buccal mucosa.

             Note - To allow sufficient tumor tissue for the immunological analyses, patients with
             T-stage 1 OCSCC will be excluded

          2. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age
