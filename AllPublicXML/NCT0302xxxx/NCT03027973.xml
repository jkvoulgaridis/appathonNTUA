  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares two treatments for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding, ulipristal
      acetate (UPA) and tranexamic acid (TEA), on health-related quality of life. Half of the
      participants will receive UPA and a placebo, and the other half will receive TEA and a
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UPA is approved by Health Canada for the treatment of signs and symptoms of uterine fibroids
      in adult women of reproductive age who are eligible for surgery. UPA is considered
      investigational for this study, as it has not been approved by Health Canada for the
      treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in women who do not have uterine fibroids.

      TEA is approved by Health Canada for prevention or reduction of bleeding in different
      conditions, including heavy periods. This treatment is available as part of routine care for
      regular heavy menstrual bleeding and is being used as the comparison treatment in this study.
