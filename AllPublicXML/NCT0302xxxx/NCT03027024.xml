  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center post-market
      clinical follow up study whereby patient undergoing routine cataract surgery will have
      bilateral implantation of a recently introduced TGA (Therapeutics Goods Authority, Australia)
      approved trifocal intraocular lens FineVision Evo (PhysIOL, Liège, Belgium). The primary and
      secondary effectiveness data for visual acuity, defocus curves, contrast sensitivity and any
      adverse events will be collected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 8 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 5 postoperative) over a period of 3 months, same as the surgeon's standard
      follow up protocol for bilateral cataract surgery with IOL implantation. Subjects would have
      the option for unscheduled visits if required medically.

      Primary endpoint data will be collected at the final visit. Data analyses will be done in the
      end to support the study publication plan.

             realistic expectation.

          -  Availability, willingness and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with
             examination procedures
