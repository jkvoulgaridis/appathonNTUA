  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty subjects (10 patients and 10 age-matched control volunteers) will be recruited for
      this study. MRI scans will take place on a 3T MRI Scanner (Skyra or Prisma, Siemens Medical
      Solutions) located at The NYU Center for Biomedical Imaging. MRI scans will consist of a
      1-hour brain scan for both patients and controls. In the first 6 months of the study,
      investigators will develop and test a uMT-based APT imaging for brain tissue pH measurement
      and use a hypercapnia paradigm to validate the tissue pH changes between breathing room air
      and 5% CO2 (by increasing tissue acidity) inhalation. With implementation of hypercapnia MRI,
      pH-weighted imaging will be validated for its robustness and reproducibility.

      The contrast agent (Gd-DTPA, Gadavist) will be injected intravenously (IV) in the arm
      (patients only). The IV will be inserted by qualified medical professional at CBI. This
      contrast agent will be standard dose in accordance with its FDA approved labeling and dosing.
      Controls will NOT be administered the contrast agent.
