    <measure>Expansion Part: Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) for Treated Bleeds</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to at least 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model with efficacy period as an offset to account for the difference in follow-up times. A bleed is considered a &quot;treated bleed&quot; if it is directly followed (i.e., no intervening bleed) by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;, irrespective of time between treatment and the preceding bleed. A bleed and the first treatment thereafter and before a new bleed starts, are considered to be pairs, with the following exception: if multiple bleeds occur on the same calendar day, the subsequent treatment is considered to apply for each of these multiple bleeds. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location are counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurs within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Expansion Part: Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) for All Bleeds</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to at least 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of all bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model with efficacy period as an offset to account for the difference in follow-up times (i.e., the time that each participant stays in the study). In this outcome measure, all bleeds are included, irrespective of treatment with coagulation factors, with the following exception: bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded. As &quot;all bleeds&quot; comprises both treated and non-treated bleeds, the 72-hour rule was implemented separately for treated and non-treated bleeds. For treated bleeds, the 72-hour rule was implemented exactly as defined for the &quot;treated bleeds&quot; outcome measure. For non-treated bleeds, the 72-hour rule was implemented by calculating a treatment-free period of 72 hours from the bleed itself.</description>

    <measure>Expansion Part: Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) for Treated Spontaneous Bleeds</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to at least 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of treated spontaneous bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model with efficacy period as an offset to account for the difference in follow-up times (i.e., the time that each participant stays in the study). A bleed is classified as &quot;spontaneous&quot; if there is no other known contributing factor such as trauma or procedure/surgery. A &quot;treated spontaneous bleed&quot; is a spontaneous bleed that also fulfills the conditions of a treated bleed (see ABR for Treated Bleeds for the definition). Treated bleeds that fulfilled the 72-hour rule were included in the analysis of spontaneous bleeds. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded.</description>

    <measure>Expansion Part: Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) for Treated Joint Bleeds</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to at least 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of treated joint bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model with efficacy period as an offset to account for the difference in follow-up times (i.e., the time that each participant stays in the study). A &quot;joint bleed&quot; is defined as a bleed with type reported as &quot;joint&quot; and with at least one of the following symptoms: increasing swelling or warmth of the skin over the joint and/or increasing pain, decreased range of motion, or difficulty using the joint compared with baseline. A &quot;treated joint bleed&quot; is a joint bleed that also fulfills the conditions of a treated bleed (see ABR for Treated Bleeds for the definition). Treated bleeds that fulfilled the 72-hour rule were included in the analysis of joint bleeds, excluding bleeds due to surgery/procedure.</description>

    <measure>Expansion Part: Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) for Treated Target Joint Bleeds</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to at least 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of treated target joint bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model with efficacy period as an offset to account for the difference in follow-up times (i.e., the time that each participant stays in the study). A &quot;target joint bleed&quot; is defined as a joint bleed in a target joint, which is a joint location where at least 3 bleeds have occurred over the last 24 weeks prior to study entry. A &quot;treated target joint bleed&quot; is a target joint bleed that also fulfills the conditions of a treated bleed (see ABR for Treated Bleeds for the definition). Bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded.</description>

    <measure>Expansion Part: Change From Baseline to Week 25 in the Hemophilia A Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire Total Score for Adult Participants (≥18 Years of Age)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The Haem-A-QoL is a patient-reported questionnaire that was designed for adult participants with hemophilia. It consists of 46 items comprising 10 dimensions (physical health, sports and leisure, school and work, dealing with hemophilia, family planning, feelings, relationships, treatment, view of yourself, and outlook for the future) and a scale representing Total Score. Items are rated along five response options: never, rarely, sometimes, often, or all the time; although for some items there is also a &quot;not applicable&quot; option. Scale scores range from 0 to 100 with lower scores reflective of better quality of life. A decrease of 7 points or more on the Total Score was defined as the threshold for a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

    <measure>Expansion Part: Change From Baseline to Week 25 in the Hemophilia-Quality of Life-Short Form (Haemo-QoL-SF) Questionnaire Total Score for Adolescent Participants (12-17 Years of Age)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF was developed in a series of age-related questionnaires to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and adolescents with hemophilia. The short version for older children containing 35 items was selected for adolescents in this study. Items are rated along five response options: never, rarely, sometimes, often, or all the time. This version covers nine dimensions considered relevant for the children's HRQoL (physical health, feelings, view of yourself, family, friends, other people, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia, and treatment). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating better HRQoL. Given the small number of adolescent participants, the results of the Haemo-QoL-SF questionnaire should be interpreted with caution.</description>

    <measure>Expansion Part: Change From Baseline to Week 25 in the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a self-reported health status questionnaire that consists of six questions used to calculate a health utility score for use in health economic analysis. There are two components to the EQ-5D-5L: a five-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression used to obtain an Index Utility Score, as well as a visual analogue scale (VAS) that measures health state. The VAS is designed to rate the participant's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state. An increase in the VAS score of 7 points or greater was defined as the threshold for a meaningful improvement.</description>

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 40 kilograms (kg) at screening

          -  Diagnosis of severe congenital hemophilia A or hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors

          -  Participants using rFVIIa or willing to switch to recombinant activated factor VII
             (rFVIIa) as primary bypassing agent for the treatment of breakthrough bleeds

          -  FVIII inhibitor test during screening with titer results available prior to first
             administration of study drug

          -  Participants without FVIII inhibitors, that is with less than (&lt;) 0.6 Bethesda unit
             per milliliter [BU/mL];&lt; 1.0 BU/mL only for laboratories with an historical
             sensitivity cutoff for inhibitor detection of 1.0 BU/mL, who completed successful
             immune tolerance induction (ITI) must have done so at least 5 years before screening
             and must have no evidence of inhibitor recurrence (permanent or temporary) indicated
             by detection of an inhibitor greater than (&gt;) 0.6 BU/mL (&gt; 1.0 BU/mL only for
             laboratories with an historical sensitivity cutoff for inhibitor detection of 1.0
             BU/mL) since ITI

          -  History of illicit drug or alcohol abuse within 48 weeks prior to screening, in the
             investigator's judgment

          -  Participants who are at high risk for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) (for example,
             have a previous medical or family history of TMA), in the investigator's judgment

          -  Previous (within the last 12 months) or current treatment for thromboembolic disease
             (with the exception of previous catheter-associated thrombosis for which
             anti-thrombotic treatment is not currently ongoing) or signs of thromboembolic disease

          -  Other conditions (for example, certain autoimmune diseases) that may currently
             increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis

          -  History of clinically significant hypersensitivity associated with monoclonal antibody
             therapies or components of the emicizumab injection

          -  Known HIV infection with cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 cells counts &lt;200 cells per

             laboratory tests, or treatment that could interfere with the conduct of the study, or
             that would, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an additional unacceptable risk
             in administering study drug to the participant

          -  Pregnancy or lactation or intention to become pregnant during the study

          -  Women with a positive serum pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to initiation of

        <title>Expansion Part: Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) for Treated Bleeds</title>
        <description>The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model with efficacy period as an offset to account for the difference in follow-up times. A bleed is considered a &quot;treated bleed&quot; if it is directly followed (i.e., no intervening bleed) by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;, irrespective of time between treatment and the preceding bleed. A bleed and the first treatment thereafter and before a new bleed starts, are considered to be pairs, with the following exception: if multiple bleeds occur on the same calendar day, the subsequent treatment is considered to apply for each of these multiple bleeds. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location are counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurs within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded.</description>

In this outcome measure, all bleeds are included, irrespective of treatment with coagulation factors, with the following exception: bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded. As &quot;all bleeds&quot; comprises both treated and non-treated bleeds, the 72-hour rule was implemented separately for treated and non-treated bleeds. For treated bleeds, the 72-hour rule was implemented exactly as defined for the &quot;treated bleeds&quot; outcome measure. For non-treated bleeds, the 72-hour rule was implemented by calculating a treatment-free period of 72 hours from the bleed itself.</description>

A &quot;joint bleed&quot; is defined as a bleed with type reported as &quot;joint&quot; and with at least one of the following symptoms: increasing swelling or warmth of the skin over the joint and/or increasing pain, decreased range of motion, or difficulty using the joint compared with baseline. A &quot;treated joint bleed&quot; is a joint bleed that also fulfills the conditions of a treated bleed (see ABR for Treated Bleeds for the definition). Treated bleeds that fulfilled the 72-hour rule were included in the analysis of joint bleeds, excluding bleeds due to surgery/procedure.</description>

        <description>The Haem-A-QoL is a patient-reported questionnaire that was designed for adult participants with hemophilia. It consists of 46 items comprising 10 dimensions (physical health, sports and leisure, school and work, dealing with hemophilia, family planning, feelings, relationships, treatment, view of yourself, and outlook for the future) and a scale representing Total Score. Items are rated along five response options: never, rarely, sometimes, often, or all the time; although for some items there is also a &quot;not applicable&quot; option. Scale scores range from 0 to 100 with lower scores reflective of better quality of life. A decrease of 7 points or more on the Total Score was defined as the threshold for a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

        <title>Expansion Part: Change From Baseline to Week 25 in the Hemophilia-Quality of Life-Short Form (Haemo-QoL-SF) Questionnaire Total Score for Adolescent Participants (12-17 Years of Age)</title>
        <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF was developed in a series of age-related questionnaires to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and adolescents with hemophilia. The short version for older children containing 35 items was selected for adolescents in this study. Items are rated along five response options: never, rarely, sometimes, often, or all the time. This version covers nine dimensions considered relevant for the children's HRQoL (physical health, feelings, view of yourself, family, friends, other people, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia, and treatment). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating better HRQoL. Given the small number of adolescent participants, the results of the Haemo-QoL-SF questionnaire should be interpreted with caution.</description>

          <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF was developed in a series of age-related questionnaires to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and adolescents with hemophilia. The short version for older children containing 35 items was selected for adolescents in this study. Items are rated along five response options: never, rarely, sometimes, often, or all the time. This version covers nine dimensions considered relevant for the children's HRQoL (physical health, feelings, view of yourself, family, friends, other people, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia, and treatment). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating better HRQoL. Given the small number of adolescent participants, the results of the Haemo-QoL-SF questionnaire should be interpreted with caution.</description>
          <population>The analysis included all adolescent participants enrolled in the expansion part of the study. The number analyzed represents participants who completed the questionnaire at Baseline and Week 25.</population>

        <title>Expansion Part: Change From Baseline to Week 25 in the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a self-reported health status questionnaire that consists of six questions used to calculate a health utility score for use in health economic analysis. There are two components to the EQ-5D-5L: a five-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression used to obtain an Index Utility Score, as well as a visual analogue scale (VAS) that measures health state. The VAS is designed to rate the participant's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state. An increase in the VAS score of 7 points or greater was defined as the threshold for a meaningful improvement.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events of Changes From Baseline in Vital Signs</title>
        <description>The number of participants with adverse events of changes from baseline in vital signs is reported here. Vital signs measurements consisted of heart and respiratory rate, temperature, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures, with an abnormal vital sign value being outside of the normal range. An abnormal vital sign result is reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: is accompanied by clinical symptoms; results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption or discontinuation); results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy; or is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. At the clinical cut-off date for primary analysis (15 Dec 2017), the median observation time was 43.71 weeks (range: 41.7-45.7 weeks).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events of Abnormal Laboratory Values</title>
        <description>The number of participants with adverse events of abnormal laboratory values is reported here. An abnormal laboratory value is defined as a laboratory test result outside of the normal range for hematology or serum chemistries.
It is reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: is accompanied by clinical symptoms; results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption or discontinuation); results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy; or is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. At the clinical cut-off date for primary analysis (15 Dec 2017), the median observation time was 43.71 weeks (range: 41.7-45.7 weeks).</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline to study completion (up to approximately 4 years)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of emicizumab.</population>
