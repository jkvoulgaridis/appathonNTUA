  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is multi-center study ,planned as a single arm, open trial, aimed at evaluating the
      performance and safety of a colon cleansing device during a colonoscopy procedure in a poorly
      prepared colons.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total of 47 subjects are planned to be enrolled at 3 clinical sites (1 in Germany and 2 in
      the Netherlands).

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be screened for study participation at a
      baseline visit(visit 1). Subject who is eligible to the study will required to follow a
      specific reduced preparation instruction starting 2 days prior to the colonoscopy with the
      Motus Cleansing System (MCS) procedure.

      Following the procedure a telephone follow-up will be conducted at 48 hours (± 24 hours) and
      14 days (± 3 days) post MCS procedure to assess patient well-being and capture any Adverse
      Events (AE).

      <recruitment_details>patients indicated for screening/ surveillance or diagnosis colonoscopy enrolled at 3 clinical sites as follows:
Radboud University Medical Center(UMC)- Netherlands-16 cases
Erasmus Medical Center (MC)-Netherlands-16 cases
Mainz University Medical Center(UMC)-Germany- 15 cases
enrollment period : 20 December 2016 - 31 May 2017</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The patients had reduced preparation in order to mimic poor bowel cleansing. the study bowel preparation consisted of dietary restrictions (no dried fruit, seeds or nuts) starting 2 days prior to colonoscopy, a 24-hour clear liquid diet and a split dose of 20 mg Bisacodyl (10 mg in each dose).</pre_assignment_details>

            <groups_desc>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of MCS in cleansing a poorly prepared colon.
A sample size of 47 patients is required as per a McNemar test to determine that the paired discordant proportions are significantly different under the followings assumptions:
Probability of Type I Error (α) = 0.05, Power (1 - β) = 0.8 Proportion switching from + to - = 0, Proportion switching from - to + = 0.6 Potential of dropout 10% (i.e. 4 cases)</groups_desc>

          <description>Standard colonoscopy procedure with Motus Cleansing System
Motus Cleansing System (MCS): The MCS enables colon cleansing during standard colonoscopy using a standard colonoscope. The cleansing device, which is attached to the tip of the colonoscope and is connected to an external workstation, generates fluid jets within the colon thus dissolving the feces into small parts. The fecal matter &amp; fluids are drained through the evacuation pipe of the cleansing device into a collecting reservoir.</description>
