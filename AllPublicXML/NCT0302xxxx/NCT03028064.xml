  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB) is a common medical emergency. In an ageing
      population, antiplatelet drugs are increasingly being prescribed for treatment and
      prophylaxis against cardiovascular thrombo-embolic events. In many patients, platelet
      dysfunction mostly acquired is the principal cause of bleeding. To clinicians, the management
      of patients on antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants is a challenge. One has to carefully
      balance the bleeding against thrombo-embolic risks. Therefore measuring platelet function
      should be integral in the management plan. A quantitative measurement allows titration of
      platelet function in accordance with bleeding or thromboembolic risk. Platelet function has
      not been studied in a large cohort of patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. As
      a first step, the study will determine if platelet dysfunction is associated with clinical
      outcome. In this prospective, observational single centre cohort study of consecutive
      patients with overt signs of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, their platelet function
      by point of care tests (light transmittance aggregometry, verify now p2y12,the platelet
      function analysis system (PFA-100) upon their admissions. Patients will be followed up for 30
      days after trial enrollment. The primary endpoint is defined as significant bleeding that
      requires interventions (endoscopic, radiologic or surgery). Secondary end points include
      cardio- and cerebrovascular thrombo-embolic events and all cause deaths. A receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is calculated for each point-of-care test to evaluate if
      individual test can distinguish between patients with and without primary end point. This
      study aims to evaluate the capability of platelet function tests to predict clinical outcome
      in patients with AUGIB. Logistic regression models will then be built in search for
      independent correlates to the primary and secondary endpoints and to adjust for confounding
      variables.
