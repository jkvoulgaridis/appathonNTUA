      The safety profile of blinatumomab after frontline R-chemotherapy, consisting of either
      R-CHOP (14 or 21) or R-DA-EPOCH or R-CHOEP, will be determined. The study will consist of a
      screening period of up to 14 days, a standard of care (SOC) R-chemotherapy run-in period of
      approximately 21 weeks, a 12 to 16 week blinatumomab treatment period, a 30-day safety
      follow-up visit, and a long-term follow-up period that begins after the safety follow-up
      visit is completed until 1 year from the first dose blinatumomab.

    <measure>Overall Objective Response Rate (ORR) Expressed as the Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Metabolic Response (CMR) and Partial Metabolic Response (PMR) Using Lugano 2014 Criteria During Cycle 1 and During Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1: Day 78 (3 weeks following end of Cycle 1 IP treatment) Treatment Period: Either the Cycle 1 timeframe or approximately Day 128 (3 weeks after Cycle 2 ended) for participants who completed Cycle 2</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response assessment was performed by a central reader according to modified Lugano classification using PET/CT scan. Overall objective response rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR). CMR: a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake &lt;/=mediastinum), or 3 (uptake &lt;mediastinum but &lt;/=liver) with/without a residual mass on PET 5-PS, for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease in bone marrow; and normal/IHC-negative bone marrow morphology. PMR: a score 4 (uptake moderately greater than [&gt;] liver) or 5 (uptake markedly &gt;liver and/or new lesions) with reduced uptake compared with baseline and residual mass(es) of any size on PET 5-PS for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; and reduced residual uptake in bone marrow compared with baseline.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Duration of Response (as of the Database Snapshot Date of 22 October 2019)</measure>
    <time_frame>The median (range) follow-up time was 7.6 (4.4, 14.5) months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was calculated only for responders during cycle 1. For participants who had CR or PR on the PET/CT scan at the end of the run-in period, response was measured from the start of blinatumomab treatment. For participants who had stable disease at the end of the run-in period, duration was calculated from documentation of the first assessment of either PR or CR on blinatumomab.
Progression was defined as the first diagnosis of progressive metabolic response/progressive disease based on PET/CT scan per central or investigator review during the treatment period or relapse based on clinical tumor assessment during the long-term follow up period.
Response duration was calculated until the start of new anti-tumor treatment (excluding any stem cell transplantation), PD, or death, whichever was the earliest event. Participants who did not have new anti-tumor treatment (excluding stem cell transplantation), PD, or death were censored at the last tumor assessment date.</description>

        <description>Tumor response assessment was performed by a central reader according to modified Lugano classification using PET/CT scan. Overall objective response rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR). CMR: a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake &lt;/=mediastinum), or 3 (uptake &lt;mediastinum but &lt;/=liver) with/without a residual mass on PET 5-PS, for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease in bone marrow; and normal/IHC-negative bone marrow morphology. PMR: a score 4 (uptake moderately greater than [&gt;] liver) or 5 (uptake markedly &gt;liver and/or new lesions) with reduced uptake compared with baseline and residual mass(es) of any size on PET 5-PS for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; and reduced residual uptake in bone marrow compared with baseline.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Duration of Response (as of the Database Snapshot Date of 22 October 2019)</title>
        <description>Duration of response was calculated only for responders during cycle 1. For participants who had CR or PR on the PET/CT scan at the end of the run-in period, response was measured from the start of blinatumomab treatment. For participants who had stable disease at the end of the run-in period, duration was calculated from documentation of the first assessment of either PR or CR on blinatumomab.
Progression was defined as the first diagnosis of progressive metabolic response/progressive disease based on PET/CT scan per central or investigator review during the treatment period or relapse based on clinical tumor assessment during the long-term follow up period.
Response duration was calculated until the start of new anti-tumor treatment (excluding any stem cell transplantation), PD, or death, whichever was the earliest event. Participants who did not have new anti-tumor treatment (excluding stem cell transplantation), PD, or death were censored at the last tumor assessment date.</description>
        <time_frame>The median (range) follow-up time was 7.6 (4.4, 14.5) months</time_frame>

        <description>PFS was calculated as the time from the date of first IP infusion until the date of diagnosis of progression of DLBCL or the date of death, whichever was the earliest. The diagnosis of progression of DLBCL was defined as the first diagnosis of progressive metabolic response/progressive disease based on PET/CT scan per central or investigator review during the treatment period or relapse based on clinical tumor assessment during the long-term follow up period. Participants who were alive and did not have progression were censored at the last evaluable non-missing tumor assessment date prior to the analysis trigger date.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
