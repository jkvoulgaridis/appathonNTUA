      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the effect of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) treatment
      on the reduction of Anterior Uveitis (AU) flares in subjects with active axial
      Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and a documented history of AU.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The ASDAS is comprised of a number of assessments that are scored by the subject and physician and multiplied by a proven formula (van der Heijde et al, 2009) as listed:
0.121 × Back pain (Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI) Question 2 result)
0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Question 6 result)
0.110 × Patient's global assessment of disease activity (PtGADA)
0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Question 3 result)
0.579 × (natural logarithm (C-reactive protein (CRP) [mg/L] + 1))
Back pain, PtGADA, duration of morning stiffness, and peripheral pain/swelling are all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units).
The sum of these weighted components gives the ASDAS.</description>

    <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument which consists of 6 horizontal Numeric Rating Scales (NRSs), each with 10 units to measure the severity of the 5 major symptoms: fatigue, spinal pain, peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration) over the last week. To give each symptom equal weighting, the average of the 2 scores relating to morning stiffness is taken. The resulting 0 to 50 sum score is divided by 5 to give a final BASDAI score between 0 and 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.</description>
