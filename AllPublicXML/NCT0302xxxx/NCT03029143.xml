      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab
      intravenous (IV) dose optimization on mucosal healing compared with the standard vedolizumab
      IV dosing regimen over a 30 week treatment period in subjects with moderately to severely
      active ulcerative colitis (UC) and high vedolizumab clearance, based on a Week 5 predefined
      serum vedolizumab concentration threshold less than (&lt;) 50 microgram per milliliter
      (microg/mL) and who are Week 6 non-responders based on partial Mayo score.

      The drug being tested in this study is called Vedolizumab. Vedolizumab will be administered
      as an IV infusion. It is being tested in this study with new doses. This study will
      investigate the efficacy and safety of dose optimization of vedolizumab IV, compared with
      standard dosing of vedolizumab IV, over a 30-week treatment period.

      The study will enroll approximately 250 moderately to severely active subjects with UC in
      order to randomize approximately 100 non-responder subjects with high vedolizumab drug
      clearance. Subjects will receive induction therapy of vedolizumab IV 300 mg on Day 1 and Week
      2 (Lead-in Period). At Week 5, serum vedolizumab concentration will be measured. At Week 6,
      subjects will be assessed for clinical response based on partial Mayo score.

      Results of both Week 5 vedolizumab concentration and Week 6 clinical response will determine
      the treatment pathway. Those who are non-responders based on partial Mayo score at Week 6 and
      who are assessed as having high vedolizumab clearance, based on a predefined Week 5 serum
      vedolizumab concentration threshold (&lt;50 microg/mL) will be randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Vedolizumab IV Standard Treatment

        -  Vedolizumab IV Dose Optimized

      All randomized subjects will receive vedolizumab IV either 300 mg or 600 mg every 4 or 8
      weeks.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States of America and Canada. The overall
      time to participate in this study is 56 weeks. Subjects will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, and will be contacted by telephone, 6 months after last dose of study drug for a long
      term follow-up safety survey.

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Achieving Mucosal Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Mucosal healing is defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore less than or equal to (less than or equal to [&lt;=] 1) point. Mayo score is used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. It consists of 4 disease activity variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on sigmoidoscopy and physician's global assessment), each scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 is equal to (=) normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Achieving Clinical Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a complete Mayo score of &lt;=2 points and no individual subscore greater than (&gt;) 1 point. Mayo score is used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. It consists of 4 disease activity variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on sigmoidoscopy and physician's global assessment), each scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0= normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Achieving Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3 points and &gt;=30 percentage (%) from Baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of &gt;=1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of &lt;=1 point. Mayo score is used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. It consists of 4 disease activity variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on sigmoidoscopy and physician's global assessment) each scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0= normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Achieving Clinical Response Based on Partial Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response based on partial Mayo score is defined as a reduction in partial Mayo score of &gt;=2 points and &gt;=25% from Baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of &gt;=1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of &lt;=1 point. The partial Mayo score is a composite index of 3 disease activity variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician's gobal assessment), each scored on a scale from 0 = normal to 3 = severe disease. Partial Mayo score is calculated analogously to the complete Mayo score but excludes the sigmoidoscopy subscore. The total partial Mayo score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

Once Ctrough is &lt;90 microg/mL, the subject will move to the next lowest dose.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
