    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) - Physical Component Summary</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a generic health survey with 36 items that measure functional health and well-being from the subject's perspective. The survey is summarized into 8 dimensions/scales: physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH).
The Physical Component Summary is derived from 4 of the 8 health dimensions (aggregate of PF, RP, BP, and GH scales). The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. A higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidality was monitored throughout the study using the C-SSRS. The C-SSRS involves a series of probing questions to inquire about possible suicidal thinking and behavior. The composite endpoints (Suicidal Ideation, Suicidal Behavior, Suicidal Ideation or Behavior) included subjects who experienced any one of the events at least once during treatment.</description>

             study

          6. Subjects with a history of significant trauma to a knee, hip or shoulder within the
             previous year

          7. Subjects who have significant pain, other than or more than knee pain, including
             significant hip, back pain, that may confound the analgesic efficacy assessments of
             this study.

        <description>The mBPI-SF is a self-administered questionnaire. The pain interference subscale of the mBPI-SF consists of Question 6 which has 7 parts, all of which ask the subjects to rate the impact/interference of their pain on various functions, ie, general activity, mood, walking, normal work, relations with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a 0 to 10 NRS where 0 = does not interfere and 10 = completely interferes. The mean interference of pain scores could range from 0 to 10.</description>

        <title>Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) - Physical Component Summary</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a generic health survey with 36 items that measure functional health and well-being from the subject's perspective. The survey is summarized into 8 dimensions/scales: physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH).
The Physical Component Summary is derived from 4 of the 8 health dimensions (aggregate of PF, RP, BP, and GH scales). The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. A higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <title>Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) - Mental Component Summary</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a generic health survey with 36 items that measure functional health and well-being from the subject's perspective. The survey is summarized into 8 dimensions/scales: physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH).
The Mental Component Summary is derived from 4 of the 8 health dimensions,(aggregate of VT, SF, RE, and MH scales). The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. A higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
        <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The FAP (N=291) was the group of subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of the double-blind study drug, and had at least 1 efficacy assessment.</population>
