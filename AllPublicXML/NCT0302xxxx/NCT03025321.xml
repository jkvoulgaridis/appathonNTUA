  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive bilateral (left cathodal/ right anodal) transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
      (tDCS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) reduces craving and seems to decrease
      relapse risk in addiction. However, little is known about the relapse rates in cocaine
      addiction after tDCS, despite the need for neurobiological treatments to reduce the high
      relapse rates in this population. The current study explores the effects of repetitive tDCS
      in a larger sample (N=60) of cocaine addicted patients on number of relapse days after three
      months. We expect that a decrease in relapse risk after tDCS is associated with cognitive
      control functioning. Therefore, risky decision making and inhibitory control will be measured
      before and after the interventions, and at three months follow-up. Ecological momentary
      assessment (EMA) will be used as a reliable measure for relapse, craving and mood.

    <textblock>
      For this study, 60 cocaine addicted patients will receive real or sham bilateral tDCS (left
      cathodal/right anodal) over the DLPFC after one week in detox. The participants will receive
      this two times daily for 5 consecutive days. It is expected that this particular tDCS method
      will reduce relapse probability, as was previously seen in alcohol addicted patients.
      Furthermore, it is hypothesized that this therapeutic effect is associated with diminished
      craving and enhanced cognitive control. Craving, temptations and relapse, will be explored by
      means of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The mixed results in previous studies of tDCS
      on craving may be explained by the fact that craving in addiction is a momentary phenomenon
      which is difficult to reliably measure with more traditional methods like retrospective
      self-reports, for which EMA provides a solution. Cognitive control will be measured by means
      of inhibitory control during a Go/NoGo task and reward processing during a gambling task. The
      tasks will be performed at baseline, one day after the tDCS sessions and at three months
      follow up.
