      Title:

      Optimal Delay Time to Initiate Anticoagulation after Ischemic Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
      (START): a pragmatic, adaptive randomized clinical trial.

      Primary Objective:

      • To determine the optimal time to initiate anticoagulation with a Non-Vitamin K Oral
      Anticoagulant (NOAC) after ischemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the rates of primary adverse outcomes in a per protocol analysis

        -  To compare 30 day clinical outcomes by the modified Rankin scale among the
           time-to-treatment groups

        -  To compare 30 day clinical outcomes by the PROMIS-10 scale among the time-to-treatment
           groups.

        -  To compare 90 day clinical outcomes by the modified Rankin scale among the
           time-to-treatment groups

        -  To explore the optimal timing in subgroups of age, sex, outcome category, and NOAC
           choice

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term oral anticoagulation is standard for secondary stroke prevention in patients with
      atrial fibrillation (AFib). However, there is limited data and no consensus on the timing of
      when to initiate anticoagulation therapy, and concern that starting too soon risks
      symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. These data are derived almost exclusively from
      heparins and Vitamin K antagonists (e.g.,warfarin). Now that NOACs have become the mainstay
      of stroke prophylaxis in AFib and have more rapid and consistent anticoagulation and fewer
      strokes (hemorrhagic especially), the question of optimal timing of NOAC initiation is of
      increasing importance.

      The primary aim is to determine the time-to-treatment interval with the lowest associated
      risk for adverse events in the context of anticoagulation therapy with NOACs for acute stroke
      patients with non-valvular AFib. The question will be investigated with a prospective,
      adaptive, randomized, controlled &quot;dose-exploration&quot; trial with the time to treatment with
      NOAC therapy treated as the incremental &quot;dose&quot;.

      An adaptive, pragmatic trial will be performed that will not deviate from the treating
      physicians' usual practice except for randomizing the time to start the NOAC. Data collection
      will be limited to those fields necessary for the planned primary and secondary analyses.

      The composite primary outcome event will be any of the following within 30 days of the index
      stroke: Ischemic Events (symptomatic ischemic stroke or systemic embolism), Hemorrhagic
      Events (symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation of index ischemic stroke, other symptomatic
      intracranial hemorrhage, or major extracranial hemorrhage), or all-cause mortality.

      Four time-to-treatment intervals, i.e. study arms, between 2 and 14 days will be
      investigated: 60 hours, 132 hours, 228 hours, and 324 hours. An innovative adaptive design
      will be used which includes response adaptive randomization and modeling of ischemic and
      hemorrhagic outcome events. The ischemic and hemorrhagic events within the composite primary
      endpoint are modeled separately using their known monotonic property that the risk of an
      event increases (ischemic) or decreases (hemorrhage) as the time-to-treatment interval
      lengthens. Interim analyses will occur after every 100 subjects are randomized, where the
      primary outcome will be analyzed and new randomization probabilities will be calculated to
      favor the arms that have a better risk-profile.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. New disabling neurological deficit attributable to new ischemic stroke.

          2. Minimum lesion diameter of 1.5cm on qualifying imaging. If lesion not visible on
             imaging, NIHSS must be greater than 4.

          3. Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent).

          4. Not currently anticoagulated and/or will not be anticoagulated prior to starting their
             NOAC at the randomized time of initiation (except for DVT prophylaxis).

             Note: Patients who had been taking an anticoagulant prior to their qualifying index
             event (for any reason) are eligible for START, assuming the drug is no longer having a
             therapeutic effect in the patient's system by 48 hours from stroke onset.

          5. Treating physician plans to anticoagulate with a FDA-approved novel oral anticoagulant
             (NOAC): apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, or other FDA-approved NOAC.

          6. Qualifying brain CT or MRI scan &lt; 48hr from stroke onset (time last known well). If
             patient has been treated with thrombolytic or endovascular therapy for this stroke,
             then the qualifying scan is that which is performed after therapy to rule out
             clinically significant hemorrhagic transformation.

          7. Ability to randomize within 60 hours of symptom onset.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any clinical or imaging evidence of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in the
             previous 6 months.

             Note: Patients with hemorrhagic transformation of current or previous ischemic stroke
             may be included per Investigator`s judgment. Sporadic microbleeds may be included per
             Investigator`s judgment. As a general recommendation, a cerebral microbleed is
             considered to be ≤ 5mm, but sometimes up to 10mm, in greatest diameter on gradient
             recalled echo (GRE), or T2*, MRI sequences. Any blood visualized on a CT will be
             classified as a macrobleed.

          2. Infarct volume (estimated) is greater than 50% of middle cerebral artery territory on
             qualifying scan. If the full extent of the lesion is not visible, any patient with a
             NIHSS &gt; 23 must be excluded.

             Note: The lesion does not need to be restricted to the mCA, but if the lesion volume
             is estimated to be greater than half of the mCA territory, the patient should be
             excluded.

             Note: In non-EVT patients, any NIHSS following the index stroke may be used to qualify
             the patient for START. For example, a patient that presents with a NIHSS of 10 who
             then receives tPA and improves to a NIHSS of 2 is still eligible for START. For
             patients whom had endovascular therapy, the qualifying NIHSS assessment is that which
             is obtained with their qualifying scan following therapy.

          3. Anticipated need for major surgery over the next 30 days that would require delay,
             discontinuation, or extended suspension of anticoagulant of more than 5 days.

          4. Symptomatic edema expected from size and location of ischemic stroke.

          5. Decreased level of consciousness present or expected.

          6. Life expectancy less than 90 days.

          7. Follow-up in person or by telephone for 90 days is not feasible.
