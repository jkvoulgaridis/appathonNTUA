      This phase IV trial studies how well Gardasil 9 vaccine works in preventing human
      papillomavirus (HPV) infection in patients with hematologic malignancies who are undergoing
      donor stem cell transplant. Vaccines, such as Gardasil 9, may help the body build an
      effective immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the immunogenicity of recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine
      (GARDASIL 9) administered after allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) in patients with
      hematologic malignancy by comparing HPV 9-plex competitive Luminex immunoassay (9-plex cLIA)
      titers before and after GARDASIL 9 administration.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of GARDASIL 9 administered after allogeneic SCT
      in patients with hematologic malignancy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care allogeneic stem cell transplant. 6-12 months following
      transplant, patients receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine
      intramuscularly (IM) on day 0 and at 2 and 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up within 3 days.

    <measure>Antibody response defined as numerically elevated antibody titer of any type at 1 month post-dose 3 (month 7)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 month post-dose 3</time_frame>
    <description>Antibody response at 1 month post-dose 3 (month 7) will be compared with baseline antibody level. The study will use results from the 9-plex competitive Luminex immunoassay (9-plex cLIA) test to estimate the antibody response rate at dose 3 with 95% confidence interval (CI). Will apply Student t-test/Wilcoxon test to compare continuous variables between patients who obtained antibody response as defined in the primary endpoint (responders) and those who did not respond (non-responders), and the chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test to assess the association between response status and patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. Logistic regression analysis will be used to assess the multivariate relationship between patient demographic and clinical characteristics on the probability of antibody response.</description>

    <description>Safety and tolerability of recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine measured by occurrence of grade &gt;= 3 adverse events (AEs) that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine for all 3 vaccine administrations. The study will report the AE rate with a corresponding upper bound of a 1-sided 95% CI.</description>

    <time_frame>At 6 months post-dose 3</time_frame>
    <description>Antibody persistence at 6 months post-dose 3 will be compared with 1 month post-dose 3. The study will apply a paired t-test with noninferiority hypotheses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination completion rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The study will calculate the proportion of patients who are able to complete the 3 shot series of HPV vaccination. Will describe them in terms of demographics, and clinical characteristics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimation of antibody titers</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6-12 months post-transplant, and at 1 and 6 months post-dose 3</time_frame>
    <description>Antibody titer will be measured repeatedly by the 9-plex cLIA test. Appropriate transformation (e.g. log transformation) of antibody titer will be used in the analyses to satisfy the normality assumption of linear or linear mixed effect model. Geometric mean titers will be used to summarize antibody titer at each time point. Linear mixed effect models for repeated measures analysis will be employed to assess change in antibody titer over time and to compare antibody titer change over time between different patient groups adjusting for other important covariates including disease characteristics (tumor stage, site, pathology), and other patient prognostic factors. Interaction between time and patients' characteristics on the change of antibody titer will be also investigated.</description>
