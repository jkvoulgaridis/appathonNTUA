    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of intrathecal nivolumab, and
      how well it works in combination with intravenous nivolumab in treating patients with
      leptomeningeal disease. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety and/or recommended dose of intrathecal (IT) nivolumab in
      combination with systemic nivolumab treatment in patients with leptomeningeal disease (LMD).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival with combined intrathecal and systemic administration of
      nivolumab in this patient population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the immunological effects of this treatment on immune cells in the cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) to those observed in the peripheral blood and in non-LMD tumors.

      II. Evaluation of predictors (clinical, molecular, and/or immune) of the efficacy and safety
      of this regimen.

      III. To assess the effect of nivolumab on subsequent treatment. IV. To compare levels of
      nivolumab in the CSF and peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase Ib study.

      Patients receive nivolumab IT over 5 minutes on day 1. Beginning in cycle 2, patients also
      receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 2. Cycles repeat every 14 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 4 weeks and then every
      12 weeks thereafter.
