  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oseltamivirphosphate is hydrolysed to its active metabolite-the free carboxylate of
      oseltamivir. Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, serving as a competitive inhibitor of
      the activity of the viral neuraminidase (NA) enzyme upon sialic acid, found on glycoproteins
      on the surface of platelets. By blocking the activity of the enzyme, oseltamivir may prevent
      platelet destruction in liver.The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong
      University and other 4 well-known hospitals in China. In order to report the efficacy and
      safety of oseltamivirphosphate combined with high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of
      immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with high platelet desialylation level, compared to high-dose
      dexamethasone therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial
      of 50 newly diagnosed ITP adult patients with high platelet desialylation level from 5
      medical centers in China. One part of the participants are randomly selected to receiver
      HD-DXM (orally at 40 mg daily for 4d) combined with oseltamivir (orally at 75 mg twice for
      10d), the others are selected to receive HD-DXM (orally at 40 mg daily for 4d ) alone. If
      platelet counts remained &lt;30×109/L or there were bleeding symptoms by day 10, another 4-day
      course of HD-DXM was given (days 10-14).For the combination arm, patients with an initial
      response relapsed during the follow-up period, oseltamivir retreatment could be given for
      another 10 days at the discretion of the physician's advice and patients' will.

      Platelet count, bleeding , platelet desialylation level and other symptoms were evaluated
      before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order
      to report the efficacy and safety of oseltamivirphosphate combining with high-dose
      dexamethasone therapy compared to high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with
      newly diagnosed ITP .
