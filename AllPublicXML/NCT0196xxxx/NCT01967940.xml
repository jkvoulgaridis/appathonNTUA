  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide
      (TAF) versus placebo, each administered with the existing, failing antiretroviral (ARV)
      regimen. There are 2 parts to this study: Part 1 and Part 2.

      Part 1 consists of 2 cohorts, starting with a sentinel cohort, in which participants will be
      enrolled to receive open-label TAF in addition to their current failing ARV regimen. This
      cohort will then be followed by a randomized, double-blind, cohort to compare the addition of
      TAF or placebo in HIV-1 positive adults who are failing their current ARV regimen.

      In Part 2, all participants who complete Part 1 of the study will discontinue their failing
      ARV regimen and TAF or placebo for a 14-day washout period. Following the washout period, all
      participants who received TAF in Part 1 and have a &gt; 0.5 log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA will
      receive elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) single-tablet
      regimen (STR) plus atazanavir (ATV) once daily for 48 weeks. Participants who received TAF
      who have a ≤ 0.5 log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA will be discontinued from the study and will not
      be eligible to continue into Part 2 of the study. All participants who received placebo in
      Part 1 will be eligible to participate in Part 2 regardless of their viral load change. After
      completion of Part 2, all participants will be eligible to continue to receive E/C/F/TAF plus
      ATV in the extension phase until E/C/F/TAF becomes commercially available, or until Gilead
      Sciences terminates development of E/C/F/TAF in the applicable country.

          <description>Following a 14 day washout period, participants from the Randomized Cohort TAF group who had a &gt; 0.5 log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA and participants from the Randomized Cohort Placebo group were eligible to receive elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) (150/150/200/10 mg) single-tablet regimen (STR) plus atazanavir (ATV) 300 mg once daily for 48 weeks. After completion of Part 2, all participants were eligible to continue to receive E/C/F/TAF plus ATV in the extension phase until E/C/F/TAF became commercially available, or until Gilead Sciences terminated development of E/C/F/TAF in the applicable country.</description>
