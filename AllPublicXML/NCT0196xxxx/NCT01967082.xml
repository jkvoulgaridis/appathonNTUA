    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well APPSPIRE, a smartphone app, works in preventing students from
      smoking. Technology-driven intervention programs, such as the APPSPIRE app, have the
      potential to increase access to health behavior treatments and therapies, such as tobacco
      cessation support, and provide effective prevention messaging.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Develop a prototype of the APPSPIRE (phone application [app] of a smoking prevention
      interactive experience).

      II. At post assessment, students enrolled in the study will qualitatively provide information
      about the usability and usefulness for the prevention and cessation sites.

      III. Investigate frequency of use of and exposure to APPSPIRE modules via an objective
      measure of general use.

      IV. Investigate how feasible the program will be. V. Obtain a maintained use of APPSPIRE with
      high completeness and extent of completion.

      VI. Evaluate change in stage of change from baseline to about 1 and 4-month follow-ups among
      participants.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants attend an audio-taped focus group over 1 hour and are given the APPSPIRE app.
      After 1 and 4 months of using the app, participants complete a telephone survey over 1 hour
      to discuss how they liked the app and its usefulness.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Completeness with the Percentages of Participants surveyed.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Completeness will be measured as the percentage of participants who continue to use AppSPIRE until the 4 month follow up survey.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The extent of completion for the modules AppSPIRE.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of completion includes the various modules of AppSPIRE. High extent of completion is obtained if 75% of the participants have completed all modules of AppSPIRE.</description>
