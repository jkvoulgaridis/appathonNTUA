      Implementing a mobile-phone based system for drug use disorders in primary care settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to study the impact of a recovery support system called Seva
      on primary care organizations, where issues such as coordination of care, job satisfaction,
      and the cost of adopting and operating new technologies are critical. The study will also
      investigate how to best implement this kind of technology into health care delivery systems
      that care for people diagnosed with substance abuse.
