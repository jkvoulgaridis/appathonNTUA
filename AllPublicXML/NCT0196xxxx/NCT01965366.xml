  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from preliminary studies suggests that people with PTSD have heightened fear
      responses and that cortisol suppression reduces this heightened fear. Research has shown the
      drug dexamethasone (DEX), a cortisol suppressor, reduces the startle response in civilians
      with PTSD. This current research proposal represents a blinded, randomized,
      placebo-controlled efficacy study with the goal of determining whether a drug that suppresses
      the stress hormone cortisol will increase the efficacy of exposure therapy. Specifically, it
      is proposed that a dose of DEX, given the night before (approximately 10 hours before) each
      of 5 to 11 individual virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy sessions, will significantly
      enhance the rate of response and possibly the efficacy of treatment. Participants will be
      treated until they have experienced at least a 70% reduction in PTSD symptoms from baseline
      or up to 12 sessions or until they and their therapist agree treatment should be terminated,
      a minimum of 6 sessions to a maximum of 12 sessions. Comprehensive multi-modal outcomes will
      be assessed by independent assessors blind to subject condition on interviews, self-report
      measures, and psychophysiological measures. Participants will be assessed pre- and
      post-treatment and at a follow-up of 3, 6 and 12 months to assess long term effects.

    <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) provides a diagnostic measure of PTSD and a continuous measure of the severity, frequency, and intensity of the three symptom clusters (intrusion, avoidance, and arousal) and overall PTSD. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. Severity Rating: 0. Absent; 1. Mild / subthreshold;2. Moderate / threshold; 3. Severe / markedly elevated; 4.Extreme / incapacitating. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Scores may range from 0-80, with a higher score indicating more reported symptoms of PTSD.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and immediate post treatment (up to 12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) is a 17-item interview used to aid in the detection and diagnosis of PTSD. The structure and content of the PSS mirror the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. For each item, the interviewer assigns a rating to reflect a combination of frequency and severity (from O = &quot;not at all&quot; to 3 = &quot;5 or more times per week/very much&quot;). Scores range from 0-51, with higher scores indicating more reported symptoms of PTSD. A score of 13 or higher indicates the likelihood of PTSD.</description>

        <title>Change in The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)Scores</title>
        <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) provides a diagnostic measure of PTSD and a continuous measure of the severity, frequency, and intensity of the three symptom clusters (intrusion, avoidance, and arousal) and overall PTSD. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. Severity Rating: 0. Absent; 1. Mild / subthreshold;2. Moderate / threshold; 3. Severe / markedly elevated; 4.Extreme / incapacitating. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Scores may range from 0-80, with a higher score indicating more reported symptoms of PTSD.</description>

            <description>0.5 mg DEX + virtual reality exposure therapy
Virtual reality exposure therapy: Virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy is a form of exposure therapy in which participants are helped to confront their traumatic memories in a therapeutic manner. They describe the events out loud and their therapist attempts to match what they are describing in the virtual reality. This is done repeatedly, allowing distress associated with these memories to decrease. Material that emerges during the VRE exposure is processed, or discussed, after the exposure, allowing participants to think about themselves and the event differently.
0.5 mg DEX: A dose of DEX will be given the night before (approximately 10 hours before) each of 5 to 11 individual virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy sessions.</description>

        <description>The PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) is a 17-item interview used to aid in the detection and diagnosis of PTSD. The structure and content of the PSS mirror the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. For each item, the interviewer assigns a rating to reflect a combination of frequency and severity (from O = &quot;not at all&quot; to 3 = &quot;5 or more times per week/very much&quot;). Scores range from 0-51, with higher scores indicating more reported symptoms of PTSD. A score of 13 or higher indicates the likelihood of PTSD.</description>
