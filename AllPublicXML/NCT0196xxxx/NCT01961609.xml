  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to prove and quantify the hypothesis that secukinumab is effective,
      safe and well tolerated in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis
      in patients who are inadequate responders to anti-TNFα therapy in a United Kingdom (UK) and
      Republic of Ireland) specific population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no clear evidence or guidelines on appropriate treatment once a patient with
      moderate/severe psoriasis has failed to respond to anti-TNFα therapy, whether a single
      anti-TNFα therapy failure or multiple anti-TNFα therapy failures.

      Numerous double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, parallel-group, active and placebo
      controlled studies have already been designed and run for the Phase III secukinumab clinical
      development program, in accordance with Health Authorities guidelines and feedback, including
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). None of these
      specifically studied patients who have failed to respond to anti-TNFα therapy as defined by
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.

      Therefore, this study utilises a pragmatic, open-label, non-comparator design, which has been
      shown to be appropriate in similar studies looking at anti-TNFα therapy in patients failing
      on other therapies (Papp et al. 2012; Strober et al. 2011), to answer the question of whether
      secukinumab is an appropriate choice in patients who have failed to respond to anti-TNFα
      therapy (TNF-IR) per NICE definitions, whether a single anti-TNFα therapy failure or multiple
      anti-TNFα therapy failures.

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a combined assessment of lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs); each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area* area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2 body: 0.3 legs: 0.4). PASI 75 is defined as participants achieving ≥ 75% improvement from baseline.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study consisted of 3 periods: initiation, maintenance 1 and maintenance 2. During the initiation period, participants received secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg for 16 weeks.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>For both maintenance periods 1 and 2, after 16 weeks and 48 weeks, respectively, responders at both the 150 mg and 300 mg doses continued on their initiation doses during maintenance periods 1 and 2. Non-responders at 150 mg were uptitrated to 300 mg. Non-responders at 300 mg returned to routine treatment under the care of their usual clinician.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Secukinumab (AIN457) 300 mg</title>
          <description>Participants self-administered 300 mg secukinumab loading dose subcutaneously at Day 0 (initiation of study drug) and at weeks 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4, and then every 4 weeks. Following the Primary Endpoint at 16 weeks, participants meeting the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria of adequate response were eligible to continue on study treatment for a further 32 weeks. Participants not meeting this NICE criterion returned to routine treatment under the care of their usual Clinical Team. Following assessment at week 48, participants meeting the NICE criteria of adequate response were eligible to continue on study treatment for a further 24 weeks. Participants not meeting this NICE criterion returned to routine treatment under the care of their usual Clinical Team.</description>

        <description>PASI is a combined assessment of lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs); each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area* area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2 body: 0.3 legs: 0.4). PASI 75 is defined as participants achieving ≥ 75% improvement from baseline.</description>

          <description>PASI is a combined assessment of lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs); each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area* area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2 body: 0.3 legs: 0.4). PASI 75 is defined as participants achieving ≥ 75% improvement from baseline.</description>

Missing values with respect to response variables based on PASI score have been imputed with non-response throughout regardless of the reason for missing data (e.g. premature study discontinuation, missed visit, administrative issues).</population>

          <description>PASI is a combined assessment of lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs); each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area* area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2 body: 0.3 legs: 0.4). PASI 50 and PASI 90 are defined as participants achieving ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% improvement from baseline, respectively.</description>

          <description>PASI is a combined assessment of lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs); each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area* area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2 body: 0.3 legs: 0.4). PASI 50 and PASI 90 are defined as participants achieving ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% improvement from baseline, respectively.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)Total Scores - Maintenance 1 Period</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a ten item general dermatology disability index designed to assess health-related quality of life in adult participants with skin diseases. The measure is widely used: it has been tested across 32 different skin conditions and is available in 55 languages. It is a self-administered questionnaire which includes domains of daily activity, leisure, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, treatment and school/work activities. Each domain has 4 response categories ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). &quot;Not relevant&quot; is a valid score also and is scored as 0. The DLQI total score is a sum of all 10 responses. Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an instrument used to assess a participant's health status. The instrument includes a descriptive profile and a visual analog scale (VAS). The descriptive profile includes 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension had 3 response levels: no problems, some problems and severe problems. The VAS is a vertical scale that assesses the health status from 0 (worst possible health state) to 100 (best possible health state). This outcome measures the percent change in VAS score.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Change in EuroQOL 5-Dimension Health Status Questionnaire (EQ-5D) Health State Assessment Scores (From 0 to 100) - Maintenance 1 Period</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is an instrument used to assess a participant's health status. The instrument includes a descriptive profile and a visual analog scale (VAS). The descriptive profile includes 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension had 3 response levels: no problems, some problems and severe problems. The VAS is a vertical scale that assesses the health status from 0 (worst possible health state) to 100 (best possible health state). This outcome measures the percent change in VAS score.</description>
