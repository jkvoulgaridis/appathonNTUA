    <textblock>
      This type of study is called a radiolabeled study. For this study, LY3023703 (study drug) has
      been specially prepared to contain radiolabeled carbon [14C]. [14C] is a naturally occurring
      radioactive form of the element carbon. This study will help understand how the drug appears
      in the blood, urine, and stool after it is administered to healthy men. Information about any
      side effects that may occur will also be collected. This study will last up to 15 days for
      each participant, not including screening. Screening is required within 28 days prior to the
      start of the study.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to safety results from another trial of LY3023703. No participants in this study received
    study drug.
