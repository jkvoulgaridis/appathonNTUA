  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if investigators can change skin from one type to
      another. Specifically, investigators are interested in making normal skin into the thicker
      skin found on our palms and soles.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To change the skin identity investigators propose to take skin cells from a person's own sole
      or palm (these are called &quot;autologous skin fibroblasts&quot;), multiply them in the lab, inject
      the cells (now called a &quot;graft&quot;) back into the same person but at a different site of skin
      like the buttock, and then eventually remove the injected cells to see if they caused the
      skin to change.

      Investigators hope that information from this study will help with problems like skin
      break-down in patients with amputations and prosthetics. The skin at their stump was not
      meant to withstand the pressure and friction of prosthetics and this study is the first step
      in trying to convert stump skin to palm/sole-like skin.

    <description>Volar keratinocytes have larger area of the cytoplasm. We will quantitate the area of cytoplasm of non-volar keratinocytes to see if they increase selectively with volar fibroblasts as opposed to other fibroblasts injections or vehicle. The change in the area of cytoplasm of non-volar keratinocytes will be measured. The units of this measurement are a ratio of cytoplasmic area to total cellular area as a control.</description>

    <description>Fibrometers measure the firmness of the skin. We will measure all sites to see if the area injected with volar fibroblasts is more firm. The units of measurement is in Newtons.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  May be male or female

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, must be medically able to undergo the
             administration of study material determined by laboratory tests obtained within 2
             weeks before baseline for which the investigator identified no clinically significant
             abnormality.

          -  Be able to comprehend the informed consent document and provide consent for
             participation

          -  Females of childbearing potential must:

               -  have a negative pregnancy test at screening

               -  agree to not become pregnant or breastfeed for the period of the study through 1
                  month after completion of the study

               -  be willing to use a reliable form of contraception during the study

          -  Have healthy skin as determined by the PI or study Nurse Practitioner.

          -  Be willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, biopsy/injection procedures,
             wound care instructions treatment plan, and other study procedures for the duration of
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Having received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study entry

          -  An allergy history to any study materials including local anesthetic, antibiotics,
             antimycotics, dimethyl sulfoxide, human albumin, or bovine constituents, or hetastarch

          -  Specifically: subjects allergic to penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin will be
             excluded in addition to those listed above.

          -  Pregnant, lactating, or trying to become pregnant

          -  A history of keloid formation

             participation (for example, some forms of autoimmune conditions, metastatic cancer,
             infectious diseases such as HIV, HTLV I/II, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C). Biopsies taken
             from individuals with infections that are not allowed to enter the cell therapy core
             will make it such that these individuals cannot participate.

          -  Specifically we will exclude those with autoimmune diseases affecting the skin such as
             lupus.

          -  Having current skin diseases (i.e. extreme and active eczema, psoriasis, lichen
             planus) that the investigator feels is not safe for study participation

             steroids, but also those on chronic topical steroids in the area of investigation.

          -  Known bovine or meat sensitivity or severe allergies manifested by anaphylaxis to any
             product

          -  Known bleeding disorder
