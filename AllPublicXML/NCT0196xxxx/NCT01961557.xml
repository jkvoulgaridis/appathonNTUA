      Background:

      - Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in children. CP often causes crouch
      gait, an abnormal way of walking. Knee crouch has many causes, so no single device or
      approach works best for everybody. This study s adjustable brace provides many types of
      walking assistance. Researchers will evaluate brace options to find the best solution for
      each participant, and whether one solution works best for the group.

      Objective:

      - To evaluate a new brace to improve crouch gait in children with CP.

      Eligibility:

        -  Children 5 17 years old with CP.

        -  Healthy volunteers 5 17 years old.

      Design:

        -  All participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.

        -  Healthy volunteers will have 1 visit. They will do motion analysis, EMG, and EEG
           described below.

        -  Participants with CP will have 6 visits.

        -  Visit 1:

      &lt;TAB&gt;1. Motion analysis: Balls will be taped to participants skin. This helps cameras follow
      their movement.

      &lt;TAB&gt;2. EMG: Metal discs will be taped to participants skin. They measure electrical muscle
      activity.

      &lt;TAB&gt;3. Participants knee movement will be tested.

      &lt;TAB&gt;4. Participants will walk 50 meters.

      &lt;TAB&gt;5. Participants legs will be cast to make custom braces.

        -  Visit 2:

        -  Participants will wear their new braces and have them adjusted.

        -  Steps 1 3 will be repeated.

        -  EEG: Small metal discs will be placed on the participants scalp. They record brain
           waves.

        -  Participants will have electrical stimulation of their knees and practice extending
           them.

        -  Participants will take several walks with the braces in different settings.

        -  Visits 3 5: participants will repeat the walking and some other steps from visit 2.

        -  Visit 6 will repeat visit 2.

      Objective

      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate several configurations of a prototype Extension
      Assist Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthosis (EA-KAFO) in patients with cerebral palsy (CP), muscular
      dystrophy (MD), spina bifida (SB), or incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) who have knee
      extension deficiency. Three forms of assistance will be provided at the knee joint including
      a passive-damper component, functional electrical stimulation (FES) to the quadriceps, and a
      motorized assist. One form will provide controllable 9 resistance at the knee to strengthen
      muscles and promote knee extension after the 10 resistance is removed.These will be compared
      to traditional bracing which typically improves crouch by blocking some or all motion at one
      or both joints. We hypothesize that all assistive configurations will improve gait alignment
      and performance compared to the non-assisted conditions. We further hypothesize that a best
      solution for each participant will exist, but may vary across subjects due to the
      heterogeneity of these movement disorders. Preliminary data on brain activation using EEG
      will be collected during all walking conditions.

      Study population

      Thirty (30) subjects, age 5 and above, diagnosed with crouch gait from diplegic CP, (30)
      subjects, age 5 and above, with knee extension deficiency from MD, SB, or iSCI (15 from each
      group) and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers will be recruited.

      Design

      This protocol will evaluate an EA-KAFO prototype consisting of a custom fabricated brace
      combined with a modular knee joint with three modes of operation: hinge (no assist), a
      passive spring-damper, and an active motorized assist. Since crouch can also be precipitated
      at the ankle, the orthotic ankle joint has an adjustable dynamic resistance (ADR) mechanism
      that can be locked (passive assist) to simulate a standard brace, free, or provide variable
      resistance to assist knee extension. Additionally, we will combine quadriceps FES with the
      hinge and the passive damper to create two hybrid configurations. The hinge and the passive
      damper (Ultraflex ) knee modules, and ADR ankle brace are FDA-approved (Class I),
      commercially available devices. This protocol for evaluation of the active motorized joint
      module, the two hybrid configurations, and the controllable resistance device (PowerWalk by
      Agilik Technologies) has been reviewed by the FDA as a medical device study and was
      determined by the FDA to be non-significant risk. Healthy controls will come for one visit,
      and participants with movement disorders will complete 6-10 visits: 1) initial assessment and
      casting for custom leg brace; 2) EA-KAFO configuration; 3) initial data collection and
      practice; 4-5) accommodation to brace configurations; 6) final data collection. Additional
      accommodation visits may be added if necessary, up to the maximum of 10 total visits. Motion
      capture, force plates, and electromyography (EMG) will be used for gait analysis while
      electroencephalography (EEG) will measure brain activity during walking.

      Outcome measures

      The primary outcome is the amount of knee flexion during gait. The optimal solution for each
      individual will be that which provides the greatest reduction in peak knee angle. Secondary
      outcomes will include gait speed, knee extensor moment, and EEG activation profiles.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Age 5 years and above

          -  Either a healthy volunteer, have crouch gait with a diagnosis of spastic diplegic
             cerebral palsy, or have lower extremity weakness resulting in gait pathology from a
             diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, or incomplete spinal cord injury.

             observation during history and physical examination.

          -  Able to provide verbal/written assent.

          -  Less than 5 degrees of knee flexion contracture with hip extended in supine position.
             Hamstring contracture as assessed by straight leg raising test does not limit ability
             to participate in the study.

          -  Less than 10 degrees of plantar flexion contracture in neutral foot alignment.

          -  A measured foot-thigh angle of -10 to 25 degrees in prone position.
