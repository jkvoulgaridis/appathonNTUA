  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone health is a significant public health issue in the United States. An estimated 10
      million Americans age 50 and older are living with osteoporosis, and approximately 50% of
      women and 25% of men over age 50 will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture in their
      remaining lifetime. Recent research advancements have produced effective measures to improve
      and maintain bone health, including exercise, diet, screening tests, pharmacotherapies, and
      fall prevention strategies. These findings, however, have not been fully incorporated into
      the daily lives of adults, and many are unaware of the magnitude of bone-health problems.
      Thus, greater efforts must be made to effectively disseminate evidence-based research
      findings to improve bone health behaviors of the public. The Internet, with its increasing
      popularity, can be an effective tool in this endeavor. Despite a great deal of available
      online health resources, there has been a lack of research investigating effective methods to
      package and deliver these resources to yield positive public health outcomes. Expanding upon
      our prior findings and using an innovative approach combining two models of the social
      cognitive theory (SCT) and the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
      Implementation, Maintenance), in this proposal, we propose a large scale online study (N =
      866) that will compare the long-term impact of two SCT-based online bone health interventions
      in adults age 50 and older targeting two large online communities. The two interventions are
      (1) an 8-week SCT-based Online Bone Health (TO-BoneHealth) program and (2) a 12-month
      TO-BoneHealth Plus program, including the TO-BoneHealth program followed by biweekly
      theory-based eNewsletters with follow-up of each individual's bone health behaviors
      (&quot;booster&quot; intervention) for 10 months. The interventions' impact will be assessed on the
      following the modified RE-AIM framework: (a) Effectiveness (knowledge, selected bone health
      behaviors, fall incidence, initiation of a discussion about bone health with a primary care
      provider, eHealth literacy); (b) Reach (number of participants the program reached); (c)
      Implementation (program usage); and (d) Maintenance (participants' bone health behavior
      maintenance). With the rapid growth of online communities, findings from this study will
      significantly contribute to current eHealth practice and research and serve as a
      dissemination model for other health promotion projects targeting online communities.

          <description>The group will use the 8-week TO-BoneHealth program, which includes: (1) web learning modules, (2) moderated discussion boards, (3) an Ask-the-Experts section, and (4) a virtual library. In addition, a tool kit and video lecture library are also available to participants. The program will be closed after 8 weeks, and there will be no eNewsletter or bi-weekly follow-ups of bone health behavior goal attainment. After 8 weeks, participants will receive a monthly e-mail informing them of the upcoming surveys.
