  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term goal is to promote evidence-based patient-centered evaluation in the acute
      setting to more closely tailor testing to disease risk. To compare the use of risk
      stratification tools with usual clinical approaches to treatment selection or administration,
      we propose the following:

        1. Test if Chest Pain Choice safely improves validated patient-centered outcome measures in
           a pragmatic parallel patient randomized trial.

           Hypothesis: The intervention will significantly increase patient knowledge, engagement,
           and satisfaction with no increase in adverse events.

        2. Test if the decision aid has an effect on healthcare utilization within 30 days after
           enrollment.

      Hypothesis: The intervention will significantly reduce the rate of hospital admission, rate
      of cardiac testing, and total healthcare utilization.

    <measure>Test if Chest Pain Choice Safely Improves Patient Knowledge.</measure>
    <time_frame>Directly following intervention (on day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient knowledge was measured by immediate post-visit survey that included 8 questions about the patient's risk for acute coronary syndrome and the available management options.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test if the Decision Aid Has an Effect on Healthcare Utilization Within 30 Days After Enrollment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days of study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the effect of the decision aid on the frequency of hospital admission and cardiac testing within 30 days of enrollment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test if the Decision Aid Safely Improves Patient Engagement.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention (on day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>1) Patient engagement in the decision-making process as measured by the OPTION scale. The OPTION scale is composed of 12 items with a value of 0-4; they are summed, divided by 48, and then multiplied by 100. Scores range from 0-100, where higher scores are reflective of higher levels of patient engagement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 30 days of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>A MACE was defined as acute myocardial infarction, death due to a cardiac or unknown cause, emergency revascularization, ventricular arrhythmia, or cardiogenic shock.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Testing Within 45 Days (a Component of Healthcare Utilization)</measure>
    <time_frame>45 days</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to measuring the effect of the decision aid on the frequency of hospital admission and cardiac testing within 30 days, we measured the total number of tests of any type within 45 days. Although we pre-specified 30-day healthcare utilization, on further discussion among the investigative team the consensus was that we collected utilization data out to 45 days and reporting testing utilization at 45 days will provide more robust results.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the visit (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional conflict, which represents the degree of uncertainty patients experience related to feeling uninformed about the management options, is measured by the decisional conflict scale. The decisional conflict scale includes 16 items that are scored from 0-4; the items are summed, divided by 16, and then multiplied by 25. The scale is from 0-100, where higher scores are reflective of increased patient uncertainty about the choice.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Trust</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the visit (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The trust in physician scale consists of 9 items scored from 1-5; the items are subtracted by 1, summed, divided by 9, and then multiplied by 25. The scale ranges from 0-100, where higher values are reflective of higher levels of patient trust in their physician.</description>

    <description>The clinician will review the decision aid with the patient. The decision aid will be used as a tool to facilitate discussion and educate the patient regarding the rationale for their evaluation up to that point in the emergency department visit and their individual risk for a heart attack or pre-heart attack. The clinician will provide the patient with management options consistent with both the patient's values and preferences and the clinician's level of comfort.</description>

Although we pre-specified 30-day healthcare utilization, on further discussion among the investigative team the consensus was that we collected utilization data out to 45 days and reporting testing utilization at 45 days will provide more robust results.</description>

        <title>Decisional Conflict</title>
        <description>Decisional conflict, which represents the degree of uncertainty patients experience related to feeling uninformed about the management options, is measured by the decisional conflict scale. The decisional conflict scale includes 16 items that are scored from 0-4; the items are summed, divided by 16, and then multiplied by 25. The scale is from 0-100, where higher scores are reflective of increased patient uncertainty about the choice.</description>
