      This study is to assess the physician preference in the clinical performance of the GalaFLEX
      mesh in soft tissue reinforcement during elective (cosmetic) plastic surgery to the breast,
      in particular the breast lift mastopexy and breast reduction procedures

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome for study success is defined as ptosis correction and maintenance of the surgical correction</measure>
    <time_frame>1year</time_frame>
    <description>Correction of ptosis at 3 months must be Grade 0, Pseudoptosis, or Grade 1, and maintenance of ptosis correction at 12 months is demonstrated by a classification of ptosis Grade 1 or less</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Long term visibility: Mammography and ultrasound will be used to evaluate the presence of the mesh or potential for mesh interference in evaluation of the breast tissue.</measure>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator satisfaction with the surgical implantation/usage of GalaFLEX Scaffold based on a satisfaction questionnaire completed at procedural and follow up timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the role that GalaFLEX scaffold plays in MD's perception of the ability to obtain a successful result, MD's provide assessments of the surgical procedures such as mesh handling, ease of placement. At follow up timepoints, a satisfaction questionnaire is completed to assess satisfaction with overall procedural results</description>
