    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of soft tissue mobilization versus
      therapeutic ultrasound in subjects with neck and arm pain who demonstrate neural mechanical
      sensitivity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the immediate effects of soft tissue mobilization (STM) versus therapeutic
      ultrasound (US) in patients with neck and arm pain who demonstrate neural mechanical
      sensitivity. Twenty-three patients with neck and arm pain and a positive upper limb
      neurodynamic test (ULNT) were randomly assigned to receive STM or therapeutic US during a
      single session. Outcome measures were collected immediately before and after treatment, and
      at 2-4 day follow-up. Primary outcomes were the Global Rating of Change (GROC), range of
      motion (ROM) during the ULNT, and pain rating during the ULNT. Secondary measures included
      the Neck Disability Index (NDI), Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), Numeric Pain
      Rating Scale (NPRS), and active range of shoulder abduction motion combined with the wrist
      neutral or wrist extension.

    <description>Patients in the STM group received treatment in supine, with their head resting on one pillow and the involved UE positioned in abduction and external rotation to preload the neural structures of the upper limb. Manual pressure was applied to the soft tissues of the upper quadrant in a deep, stroking manner with the intention to improve the mobility of the soft tissues surrounding the pathway of the neural structures of the upper limb as well as any tender or tight tissues. The therapist spent approximately 7 minutes on the neck and scapular region, 4 minutes on the upper arm, and 4 minutes on the forearm and hand. The therapist was allowed to vary the time spent on each region according to his/her assessment of the patient's condition. The procedure lasted a total of 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Patients received therapeutic US applied for a period of 5 minutes to the most painful region of the neck, then a second 5-minute dose at the most painful region of the upper extremity. The US dose was 0.5 w/cm2, with sonation time 50% and frequency 1 MHz.40,52 The patient lay supine with the hand of the involved upper extremity placed on the abdomen and the elbow supported on a pillow. The two US doses and interaction time with the patient lasted a total of 15 minutes in an attempt to have equal patient/therapist contact between the two groups.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Active movement dysfunction that could be related to mechanical sensitivity of the
             neural structures of the upper limb. (i.e. painful shoulder abduction with elbow
             extension that is limited more when the wrist is extended than when the wrist is in
             neutral.)

          2. Positive response to upper limb neural provocation testing (ULNT 1) (see description
             below for details)

             median nerve.

             scalenes, cervical paraspinals, trapezius, deltoid, pectoralis major or minor, rotator
             cuff, biceps, triceps, coracobrachialis, brachialis, radiobrachialis, pronator teres,

             muscles.

             history of metabolic disease, prolonged history of corticosteroid use.

             response to deep tendon reflex testing), unsteadiness during gait, ataxia, disturbed
             vision, nystagmus, altered taste, positive Babinski's or Hoffman's reflexes.

          3. Cervical spine surgery within the last 3 months.

          4. Litigation associated with their neck and/or upper limb pain.

          5. Insufficient English language skills to complete the questionnaires and follow-up
             instructions.
