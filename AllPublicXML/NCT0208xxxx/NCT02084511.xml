    <description>Time-weighted sum of pain intensity difference (PID) from 0 to 8 hours post drug administration (SPID0-8h). SPID0-8h: possible range (-400; 800). The greater SPID0-8 the greater the reduction of pain intensity over the first 8 hours post drug administration.</description>

    <description>Time-weighted total pain relief (PAR) from 0 to 8 hours (TOTPAR0-8h). (TOTPAR0-8h)TOTPAR0-8h: possible range (0;32). The greater TOTPAR0-8h the more pain relief was experienced over the first 8 hours post drug administration.</description>

    <description>Time-weighted sum of PID from 0 to 2 hours (SPID0-2h). SPID0-2h: possible range (-100; 200). The greater SPID0-2 the greater the reduction of pain intensity over the first 2 hours post drug administration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Meaningful Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 hours post drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Time to meaningful pain relief was captured by a stopwatch started by the trial staff immediately after administration of study medication and stopped by the subject as soon as a meaningful pain relief was felt by the subject. If a subject did not have any meaningful pain relief up to 10 h, the time was censored at 10 h.
Kaplan-Meier estimates over time for each treatment and time to event endpoint 'Time to meaningful pain relief' were presented descriptively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Dose of Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 hours post drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The time to first dose of rescue medication was defined by the difference in time of the study drug intake and the time of first rescue medication use within the first 10 h after study drug administration.
Kaplan-Meier estimates over time for each treatment and time to event endpoint 'Time to first dose of rescue medication' were presented descriptively.
Subjects without intake of rescue medication within the first 10 hours after study drug administration were censored at 10 hours.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Healthy males according to the investigator's assessment, as based on the following
             criteria: a complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs
             (Blood Pressure,Pulse Rate), 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests

             could also be removed;

          5. Surgery will be conducted under local anaesthesia using 12% lidocaine (with
             epinephrine). Intravenous sedations and general anaesthetics are not permitted.

          6. Reliable, cooperative, and of adequate intelligence to record the requested
             information on the analgesic questionnaire form

          2. Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic
             blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg

          3. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          4. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged clinically relevant by the investigator

          5. Acute local infection at the time of surgery that could confound the post-surgical
             evaluation

          6. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders
