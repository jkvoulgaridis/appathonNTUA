  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of tapentadol oral solution, based on
      the total amount of supplemental opioid analgesic used over 12 hours or 24 hours after
      initiation of investigational medicinal product (IMP) in children and adolescents who had
      undergone surgery that would produce moderate to severe pain during opioid treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The supplemental opioid medication reflecting the standard of care was available as patient-
      or nurse-controlled intravenous (i.v.) morphine or hydromorphone. This supplemental opioid
      analgesic medication (SOAM) was given to control pain, as needed, in both the treatment and
      placebo groups.

      Children and adolescents 6 months and older were dosed with a dose regimen of 1.25 mg/kg body
      weight for the first 24 hours of treatment. 24 hours after the start of study medication (and
      based on clinical judgment), a dose reduction to 1.0 mg/kg was allowed.

      Participants 30 days to less than 6 months old were dosed with a regimen of 0.5 mg/kg for the
      first 24 hours of treatment. The dose of IMP could be reduced after 24 hours to 0.3 mg/kg (if
      there was a reduced need for analgesia according to the investigator's judgment).

      Participants aged from birth to less than 30 days old were dosed with a regimen of 0.1 mg/kg
      for the first 24 hours of treatment. The dose of the IMP could be reduced after 24 hours to
      0.075 mg/kg (if there was a reduced need for analgesia according to the investigator's
      judgment).

      The decision to maintain or alter the dose based on the effectiveness of the analgesia (pain
      killer) and the adverse event profile observed in each participant over the first 24-hour
      dosing period was made based on the investigator's judgment.

      In exceptional cases, if a participant had unbearable pain despite using nurse-controlled
      analgesia (NCA) or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), an additional bolus (defined as a
      clinician bolus) of morphine or hydromorphone could have been administered. The clinician
      bolus could have been given either using the NCA/PCA pump system or by an intravenous bolus
      injection. The opioid given as a clinician bolus or if the NCA/PCA intravenous line failed,
      had to be the same opioid used in the NCA/PCA pump system.

      Dosing with IMP was stopped if:

        -  A switch to exclusively oral opioid analgesic medication was indicated according to the
           local standard of care.

        -  Opioid analgesic medication was no longer needed.

        -  IMP had been administered for 72 hours.

      Safety evaluations included assessment of adverse events, physical examination, vital signs,
      laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and, only for children older
      than 6 years of age, a scale to assess suicidal ideation (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating
      Scale [C-SSRS]). The maximum study duration for each participant was 42 days.

      The evaluation of the safety and efficacy data was performed by age groups as aligned with
      European and United States agencies. Within the tapentadol treatment group, no analysis by
      tapentadol dose was conducted. Results for participants aged 2 years to &lt;18 years were
      provided to the Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency (EU PDCO) before
      recruitment of the children less than 6-month old required for the US Food and Drug
      Administration [FDA] analysis was completed. Participants from birth to &lt;2 years old were
      analyzed separately for the US FDA only and not included in the analysis of the population
      aged from 2 years to &lt;18 years.

    <masking_description>The trial was double-blinded to prevent bias. The blind was broken for the participants aged 2 years to &lt;18 years (Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency [EU PDCO] set) before recruitment of the &lt;6 month-old subjects for the United Sates Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) set (which comprised participants from birth to &lt;18 years) was completed. Participants not belonging to the EU PDCO set (&lt;2 years old) remained blinded (as independent randomization lists were used for participants aged &lt;2 years old) and were unblinded only after the data base was locked for all participants from birth to &lt;2 years old who were included in the US FDA &lt;2 years population.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Face, Leg, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) Total Score in Participants Aged Less Than 6 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 96 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The FLACC scale was used for children from birth to less than 6 years, or in older children who were not able to report their pain using the other scales. This tool includes 5 categories of pain behaviors: facial expression (F), leg movement (L), activity (A), cry (C), and consolability (C). Each of the 5 categories is scored 0, 1 or 2. The total score between 0 and 10 is the sum of the 5 individual categories. Higher scores represent worse condition.
The Pain intensity scores were obtained before and after first dose of IMP, and before each subsequent dose of IMP, whenever possible, up to end of treatment (96 hours).
Changes from baseline values were summarized descriptively for each time point.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Pain Intensity Using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) in Participants Aged 6 to Less Than 12 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 96 hours</time_frame>
    <description>For children aged 6 years (if possible) to less than 12 years, pain intensity was assessed by the use of the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). The FPS-R is a validated self-reported 6-point scale (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing very much pain. Facial representations were used to indicate how much the pain hurts. Higher scores represent worse condition.
Pain intensity scores were obtained before and after first dose of IMP, and before each subsequent dose of IMP, whenever possible.
Changes from baseline pain values were summarized descriptively for each time point up to end of treatment (96 hours).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 96 hours</time_frame>
    <description>For children and adolescents aged 12 years to less than 18 years, pain intensity was assessed by the use of a Visual analog scale (VAS). The participant was asked to draw a single line to indicate the current level of pain intensity on a 100 mm long scale by marking a point on the line in response to: &quot;My pain right now is&quot;. The mark was scored between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;. A value of 0 indicates &quot;no pain&quot;. A value of 100 indicates &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;. Pain intensity scores were obtained before and after first dose of IMP, and before each subsequent dose of IMP, whenever possible. Changes from baseline values were summarized descriptively for each time point.</description>

             A participant aged 6 months to less than 18 years old is excluded if the:

               -  Aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase is greater 3-times upper limit of
                  normal.

               -  Total bilirubin is greater 2-times upper limit of normal (except if the cause is
                  due to Gilbert's syndrome).

               -  Glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min.

             A participant aged from birth to less than 6 months old is excluded if:

               -  Aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase is &gt;3-times upper limit of normal.

               -  There is pathological jaundice in the opinion of the investigator.

               -  Glomerular filtration rate (calculated according to Schwartz et al. 1984) is:

                    -  &lt;20 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants &lt;1 week post-partum.

                    -  &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants 1 week to 8 weeks post-partum.

                    -  &lt;50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants &gt;8 weeks postpartum to &lt;6 months old.

         15. Participant has:

               -  Clinically relevant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG).

               -  Signs of pre-excitation syndrome.

               -  Brugada's syndrome.

               -  QT or corrected QT interval (QTc) interval &gt;470 ms for children aged 6 years to
                  less than 18 years old.

               -  QT or QTc interval &gt;460 ms for children aged from birth to less than 6 years old.

         16. Peri- or post-operative analgesia supplied by a continuous regional technique (e.g.,
             nerve block, wound infiltration catheter) or participant-controlled epidural analgesia
             that was terminated less than 6 hours before allocation/randomization to IMP.

         17. Participant has post-operative clinically unstable systolic and diastolic blood
             pressure, heart rate, respiratory depression, or clinically unstable upper or lower
             airway conditions (in the investigator's judgment), or a saturation of peripheral
             oxygen (SpO2) &lt;92% at the time of randomization (allocation/randomization to IMP).

         18. Female participant is breast-feeding a child.

         19. Participant requires continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation, at
             the time of allocation to IMP.

         20. The mother of a newborn participant or the breastfeeding mother of a participant was
             administered a prohibited medication.

        <title>Palatability of IMP After First Dose Assessed Using Facial 5-point Hedonic Scale</title>
        <description>Palatability of IMP after the first dose was assessed in participants aged 2 years to less than 18 years using 5-point hedonic scales in combination with verbal rating. A question &quot;How does the medication taste&quot; was asked and the verbal rating was from really good, good, a bit good/a bit bad, bad, and really bad. The pictorial scale of facial expressions was co-related with verbal rating range where 5 = really good, 4 = good, 3 = a bit good/a bit bad, 2 = bad, and 1 = really bad. Higher scores represent good palatability. Responses were summarized. Missing values were not imputed.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Face, Leg, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) Total Score in Participants Aged Less Than 6 Years</title>
        <description>The FLACC scale was used for children from birth to less than 6 years, or in older children who were not able to report their pain using the other scales. This tool includes 5 categories of pain behaviors: facial expression (F), leg movement (L), activity (A), cry (C), and consolability (C). Each of the 5 categories is scored 0, 1 or 2. The total score between 0 and 10 is the sum of the 5 individual categories. Higher scores represent worse condition.
The Pain intensity scores were obtained before and after first dose of IMP, and before each subsequent dose of IMP, whenever possible, up to end of treatment (96 hours).
Changes from baseline values were summarized descriptively for each time point.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Pain Intensity Using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) in Participants Aged 6 to Less Than 12 Years</title>
        <description>For children aged 6 years (if possible) to less than 12 years, pain intensity was assessed by the use of the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). The FPS-R is a validated self-reported 6-point scale (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing very much pain. Facial representations were used to indicate how much the pain hurts. Higher scores represent worse condition.
Pain intensity scores were obtained before and after first dose of IMP, and before each subsequent dose of IMP, whenever possible.
Changes from baseline pain values were summarized descriptively for each time point up to end of treatment (96 hours).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain Intensity Score in Participants Aged 12 to Less Than 18 Years</title>
        <description>For children and adolescents aged 12 years to less than 18 years, pain intensity was assessed by the use of a Visual analog scale (VAS). The participant was asked to draw a single line to indicate the current level of pain intensity on a 100 mm long scale by marking a point on the line in response to: &quot;My pain right now is&quot;. The mark was scored between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;. A value of 0 indicates &quot;no pain&quot;. A value of 100 indicates &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;. Pain intensity scores were obtained before and after first dose of IMP, and before each subsequent dose of IMP, whenever possible. Changes from baseline values were summarized descriptively for each time point.</description>

        <description>The time to first and time to second patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or nurse-controlled analgesia (NCA) after the first dose of IMP were summarized descriptively using time-to-event methods and are displayed by relevant treatment groups. Participants who completed the End of Treatment Visit (scheduled for 96 hours after first IMP) before their first/second use of NCA/PCA or participants who terminated treatment before their first/second use of NCA/PCA were censored at the End of Treatment Visit.
Time-to-event variables are reported using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Therefore, values might remain missing if the survival function does not reach a respective threshold. This is indicated by not applicable (NA).</description>

        <title>Time From First Dose of IMP Until Treatment Discontinuation Due to Lack of Efficacy</title>
        <description>The distributions of the time from the first dose of IMP to treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy were summarized descriptively using time-to-event methods.
Participants who reached the maximum duration of treatment (72 hours) were censored at 72 hours after first IMP intake. Participants who discontinued during the Treatment Period for reasons other than lack of efficacy were censored at the time of the decision to discontinue treatment.
Due to the low number of participants with events in the age group from 2 to &lt;18 years, the median time and the corresponding confidence interval could not be calculated. The number of participants who discontinued early due to lack of efficacy is presented instead.</description>

        <title>Palatability of IMP After Last Dose Assessed Using Facial 5-point Hedonic Scale</title>
        <description>Palatability of IMP after the last dose in participants aged 2 years to less than 18 years was assessed using 5-point hedonic scales in combination with verbal rating. A question &quot;How does the medication taste&quot; was asked and the verbal rating was from really good, good, a bit good/a bit bad, bad, and really bad. The pictorial scale of facial expressions was co-related with verbal rating range with 5 = really good, 4 = good, 3 = a bit good/a bit bad, 2 = bad, and 1 = really bad. Higher scores represent good palatability. Responses were summarized. Missing values were not imputed.

        <title>Acceptability of IMP After Last Dose Assessed Using Facial 5-point Hedonic Scale</title>
        <description>Acceptability of IMP in participants aged 2 years to less than 18 years was assessed using 5-point hedonic scales in combination with verbal rating. A question &quot;Swallowing the medication is...&quot; was asked and the verbal rating was from really good, good, a bit good/a bit bad, bad, and really bad. The pictorial scale of facial expressions was co-related with verbal rating range, with 5 = really easy, 4 = easy, 3 = a bit easy/a bit difficult, 2 = difficult, and 1 = really difficult. Higher scores represent better acceptability.
Responses were summarized. Missing values were not imputed. Acceptability data was not collected in participants &lt;2 years old.</description>

        <population>Full Analysis Set; 160 participants aged 2 to less than 18 years were included in the analysis. If by error a participant did not receive the allocated medication, the participant was evaluated as allocated following the intention-to-treat principle.</population>
