      In this study we will definitively test the decision support system in a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) among smokers with severe mental illness (SMI) psychotic disorders.
      The Specific Aims of the study are:

        1. To determine whether use of the web-based decision support system leads to higher rates
           of initiation of smoking cessation treatment than use of a computerized educational
           pamphlet. We will also assess effectiveness on secondary outcomes, including smoking
           behavior, urges and outcome expectancies; level of dependence; intentions to quit and to
           use cessation treatment; and abstinence.

        2. To assess whether cognitive ability moderates initiation of smoking cessation treatment.
           Since cognitive impairment impedes use of standard web-based interventions by this
           group, and cognitive impairments likely supersede other potential moderators (education
           and socioeconomic status), this aim will be key to determining the success of our
           intervention and will guide further revisions if they are needed.

        3. To explore the effects of the decision support system and baseline cognitive ability on
           abstinence over 6 months

             1. We will examine the impact of the DSS on 7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence
                at 6 months, and cumulative days of tobacco abstinence over 6 months.

             2. We will determine whether baseline cognition (scale scores) is associated with
                7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence at 6 months, and cumulative days of
                tobacco abstinence over 6 months.

    <textblock>
      Up to 80% of people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders smoke - a rate that is
      four times the rate in the general population. Cessation treatments are effective, but these
      smokers don't use them. In order to provide an easy-to-use, cost-effective strategy to engage
      this group of smokers into effective treatments, we developed a single-session, web-based,
      motivational decision support system, Let's Talk About Smoking. The system incorporates
      features that insure high usability among those who can't use current websites due to
      cognitive impairments and low computer skills. It provides compelling content that engages
      users into evidence-based cessation treatments.

      In this study we will definitively test the decision support system in a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) among smokers with severe mental illness (SMI) psychotic disorders.
      Our proposed study design will enable us to test whether this system, designed for those with
      cognitive impairments, is effective among people with a range of cognitive abilities. The
      Specific Aims of the study are:

        1. To determine whether use of the web-based decision support system leads to higher rates
           of initiation of smoking cessation treatment than use of a computerized educational
           pamphlet. We will also assess effectiveness on secondary outcomes, including smoking
           behavior, urges and outcome expectancies; level of dependence; intentions to quit and to
           use cessation treatment; and abstinence.

        2. To assess whether cognitive ability moderates initiation of smoking cessation treatment.
           Since cognitive impairment impedes use of standard web-based interventions by this
           group, and cognitive impairments likely supersede other potential moderators (education
           and socioeconomic status), this aim will be key to determining the success of our
           intervention and will guide further revisions if they are needed.

        3. To explore the effects of the decision support system and baseline cognitive ability on
           abstinence over 6 months

             1. We will examine the impact of the DSS on 7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence
                at 6 months, and cumulative days of tobacco abstinence over 6 months.

             2. We will determine whether baseline cognition (scale scores) is associated with
                7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence at 6 months, and cumulative days of
                tobacco abstinence over 6 months.

      <pre_assignment_details>After participating in an informed consent process, 184 subjects were assessed for eligibility. 11 were ineligible and 11 declined or were unable to proceed with the study for other reasons. 162 were randomized and proceeded to receive an intervention.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Let's Talk About Smoking</title>
          <description>These participants were randomized to use the Let's Talk About Smoking website. This web-based intervention (Let’s Talk About Smoking) is designed to increase motivation to quit smoking by using evidence-based treatment. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior [98], the decision support system addresses beliefs that are barriers to cessation and introduces new beliefs that facilitate use of cessation treatment. It uses messages with both gain and loss frames (benefits of use, costs of not using treatment) [140, 141]. It also provides facts with simple text and pictures about risks and benefits for each cessation treatment [142-144], encouraging users to make a choice based on information about treatment options. The system aims to change beliefs and attitudes related to cessation and cessation treatment.</description>

We have computerized a publicly available educational pamphlet (with advice to quit) for the usual care control condition [162] (Appendix B). This control program is designed with similar usability features to the intervention program, but does not contain any of the features believed to increase the efficacy of our active intervention (interactive assessment and feedback, video role models, etc).</description>

For each individual, we normalized each of their scale scores and calculated a mean of these scores. This mean served as the individual’s composite cognition score.</description>

          <title>Fagerstrom dependence score</title>
          <description>The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence is a standard instrument for assessing the intensity of physical addiction to nicotine. The test was designed to provide an ordinal measure of nicotine dependence related to cigarette smoking. It contains six items that evaluate the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and dependence.
Yes/no items are scored from 0 to 1 and multiple-choice items are scored from 0 to 3. The items are summed to yield a total score of 0-10. The higher the total Fagerström score, the more intense is the patient's physical dependence on nicotine.</description>

This web-based intervention (Let’s Talk About Smoking) is designed to increase motivation to quit smoking by using evidence-based treatment. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior [98], the decision support system addresses beliefs that are barriers to cessation and introduces new beliefs that facilitate use of cessation treatment. It uses messages with both gain and loss frames (benefits of use, costs of not using treatment) [140, 141]. It also provides facts with simple text and pictures about risks and benefits for each cessation treatment [142-144], encouraging users to make a choice based on information about treatment options.
