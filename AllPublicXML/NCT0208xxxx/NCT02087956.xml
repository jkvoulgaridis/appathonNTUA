  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether priority-based patient navigation will
      improve patient satisfaction, quality of life (QOL), and depression when compared to
      screening-and-referral for socioeconomically disadvantaged women's health patients with
      depression. The investigators goal is to establish patient-driven, effective, generalizable,
      and disseminable interventions to reduce depression-related disparities and improve outcomes.

      -  In this comparative effectiveness study, 200 participants who are patients at the
           University of Rochester Women's Health Practice or Highland Woman's Health and report
           significant depressive symptoms will be randomized to either PSP (Personal Support for
           Progress) or ESR (Enhanced Screening and Referral). Participants assigned to PSP will
           work with a patient navigator to prioritize their concerns, develop a personalized care
           plan, and implement their plan. Participants assigned to ESR will receive a personalized
           report of community resources that may be helpful for their identified needs.

        -  The investigators will use a simple 1:1 randomized design with treatment assignment
           being conducted using a random number generator. All analyses will follow an
           intent-to-treat protocol, such that all participants randomized will be followed for
           data collection and analyzed according to her randomized condition

        -  Each participant will be assessed 4 times for outcome changes: at baseline, post
           treatment (4 months), and two follow up ( at 7 and 10 months).

        -  Assessments are self report on iPads and they are linked directly to a Red Cap database.

    <description>We will use the WHOQOL-BREF measure. The WHOQOL-bref contains 26 items; the first two questions evaluate self-perceived quality of life and satisfaction with health.The remaining 24 questions represent four domains: physical, psychological, social relationships and environment.
The WHOQOL-bref contains five Likert style response scales: &quot;very poor to very good&quot; (evaluation scale), &quot;very dissatisfied to very satisfied&quot; (evaluation scale), &quot;none to extremely&quot; (intensity scale), &quot;none to complete&quot; (capacity scale) and &quot;never to always&quot; (frequency scale).The mean score in each domain indicates the individual's perception of their satisfaction with each aspect of their life, relating it with quality of life. The higher the score, the better this is perceived to be. Total score was computed by summing all 26 items. The possible range is from 26 to 130.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, post treatment (4 months after enrollment), 3 months and 6 months follow up (7 and 10 months after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Depression was measured by PHQ-9, a screen for major depressive disorder with good discriminant validity and sensitivity to change validated in Ob/Gyn settings, and with pregnant and postpartum women, and with women of color. Scale ranges 0-27. Higher the score, higher severity of depression and cutpoints of 5, 10, 15 and 20 representing mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Post treatment- 4 months after enrollment, 3 and 6 months follow-up (7 and 10 months after the enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) is an 8-item self-report instrument to assess subjective satisfaction with treatment which was administered to all participants post-treatment We analyzed 4 items: CSQ1: &quot;How would you rate the quality of service you have received?&quot;, CSQ 3: &quot;To what extent has our program met your needs?&quot;, CSQ 6: &quot;Have the services you received helped you to deal more effectively with your problems?&quot; and CSQ 7: &quot;In an overall, general sense, how satisfied are you with the service you have received?&quot; (1 = Excellent, 2 = Good, 3 = Fair, 4 = Poor). We are reporting on CSQ 1 outcome.</description>

        <title>Patient Quality of Life</title>
        <description>We will use the WHOQOL-BREF measure. The WHOQOL-bref contains 26 items; the first two questions evaluate self-perceived quality of life and satisfaction with health.The remaining 24 questions represent four domains: physical, psychological, social relationships and environment.
The WHOQOL-bref contains five Likert style response scales: &quot;very poor to very good&quot; (evaluation scale), &quot;very dissatisfied to very satisfied&quot; (evaluation scale), &quot;none to extremely&quot; (intensity scale), &quot;none to complete&quot; (capacity scale) and &quot;never to always&quot; (frequency scale).The mean score in each domain indicates the individual's perception of their satisfaction with each aspect of their life, relating it with quality of life. The higher the score, the better this is perceived to be. Total score was computed by summing all 26 items. The possible range is from 26 to 130.</description>

        <population>Results are presented for WHO-QOL total score. We had attrition of about 5% throughout the study, therefore number of analyzed at post treatment differs from initial number of participants.</population>

At the end of the four months, the patient and navigator will review the personal care plan, and the navigator will work with the patient as to how she can continue progress through accessing other supports and resources as needed.</description>
