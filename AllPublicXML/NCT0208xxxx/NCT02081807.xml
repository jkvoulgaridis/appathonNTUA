  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cohort study is the sequential expansion of the comparative effectiveness study of oral
      anticoagulants and plans to identify initiators of oral anticoagulants using electronic
      claims data from a commercial insurance database to quantify associations between
      anticoagulant choice (warfarin and dabigatran) and the occurrence of selected outcomes in
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke.

          <description>The rate of overall stroke (hemorrhagic, ischemic or stroke of uncertain classification ) in patients who are matched on propensity score and calendar quarter of initiation. Event rates were calculated as the total number of patients in each treatment group who had the outcome during follow-up divided by the total person-years at risk in the cohort. The outcome definition includes following: As primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis (Dx): 431.x Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), 433.x1 Occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries with cerebral infarction, 434.x1 Occlusion and stenosis of cerebral arteries with cerebral infarction, 436.x Acute, but ill-defined cerebrovascular events.</description>
          <population>Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and new initiators of dabigatran and warfarin during October 2010 to September 2015 who were enrolled for a minimum of 12 months in Optum Clinformatics database or MarketScan before treatment initiation and matched on propensity scores (PS). Primary analysis represented an 'as treated' approach.</population>

        <description>The rate of Major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who are matched on propensity score and calendar quarter of initiation. Event rates were calculated as the total number of patients in each treatment group who had the outcome during follow-up divided by the total person-years at risk in the cohort. The outcome definition includes following: ICD-9 diagnoses: 531.0x, 531.2x, 531.4x, 531.6x, 532.0x, 532.2x, 532.4x, 532.6x, 533.0x, 533.2x, 533.4x, 533.6x, 534.0x, 534.2x, 534.4x, 534.6x, 578.0 OR ICD-9 procedure code 44.43 (endoscopic control of gastric or duodenal bleeding) OR Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 43255 (upper gastrointestinal endoscopy including esophagus, stomach, and either the duodenum and/or jejunum as appropriate with control of bleeding, any method).</description>

        <description>The rate of major urogenital bleeding in patients who are matched on propensity score and calendar quarter of initiation. Event rates were calculated as the total number of patients in each treatment group who had the outcome during follow-up divided by the total person-years at risk in the cohort. The outcome definition includes following: ICD-9 diagnoses: Hematuria: ICD-9 Dx: 599.7, Excessive/frequent menstruation: ICD-9 Dx 626.2x and secondary diagnosis indicating acute bleeding: anemia (280.0, 285.1, 285.9). Across databases, only one event for dabigatran versus no event among warfarin initiators observed. Across database, four events for rivaroxaban versus no event among warfarin initiators observed. Across database, no events for apixaban and warfarin observed. Therefore HR estimate is not possible.</description>

          <description>The rate of major urogenital bleeding in patients who are matched on propensity score and calendar quarter of initiation. Event rates were calculated as the total number of patients in each treatment group who had the outcome during follow-up divided by the total person-years at risk in the cohort. The outcome definition includes following: ICD-9 diagnoses: Hematuria: ICD-9 Dx: 599.7, Excessive/frequent menstruation: ICD-9 Dx 626.2x and secondary diagnosis indicating acute bleeding: anemia (280.0, 285.1, 285.9). Across databases, only one event for dabigatran versus no event among warfarin initiators observed. Across database, four events for rivaroxaban versus no event among warfarin initiators observed. Across database, no events for apixaban and warfarin observed. Therefore HR estimate is not possible.</description>
