      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise
      intervention for helping individuals with elevated depressive symptoms to quit smoking. The
      investigators expect that this project will contribute much needed knowledge about the role
      that aerobic exercise can play in smoking cessation. The long-term goal of this program of
      research is to disseminate an effective, aerobic exercise (AE) intervention for smoking
      cessation that can be readily adopted by smokers with elevated depressive symptoms, including
      those with current major depressive disorder (MDD).
