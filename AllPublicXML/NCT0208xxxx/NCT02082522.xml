  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a combination of a drug, porfimer sodium (Photofrin), which is
      activated by a light from a laser that emits no heat. This technique works to allow the
      medical doctor to specifically target and destroy abnormal or cancer cells while limiting
      damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The activation of the drug is done by lighting the
      abnormal areas using a fiber optic device (very fine fiber like a fishing line that permits
      light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube with a light called cholangioscope for the
      bile duct. The light will activate the porfimer sodium concentrated in the abnormal tissue,
      leading to its destruction.

      This research study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDT with porfimer sodium
      administered with Standard Medical Care (SMC) compared to SMC alone on the overall survival
      time of patients with non-operable advanced cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer of the bile
      ducts. It will involve 200 patients across North America and Europe. Other countries may
      participate if needed. Participation will last at least 18 months.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a combination of a drug, porfimer sodium (Photofrin), which is
      activated by a light from a laser that emits no heat. This technique works to allow the
      medical doctor to specifically target and destroy abnormal or cancer cells while limiting
      damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The activation of the drug is done by lighting the
      abnormal areas using a fiber optic device (very fine fiber like a fishing line that permits
      light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube with a light called cholangioscope for the
      bile duct. The light will activate the porfimer sodium concentrated in the abnormal tissue,
      leading to its destruction.

      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is defined as primary malignant tumors of the bile ducts. The exact
      etiology remains unknown. These cancerous tumors block the bile flow and can be intrahepatic
      (IH) or extrahepatic (EH). The distinction between IH- and EH-CCA has become increasingly
      important, as the epidemiological features (i.e., incidence and risk factors), the biologic
      and pathologic characteristics and the clinical course are largely different. Unfortunately,
      most subjects are found to have metastases or unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis.
      Median survival for subjects with unresectable perihilar-CCA varies between five and eight
      months. The one-year survival is 50%, with 20% surviving at two years and 10% at three years.
      Unresected CCA is a rapidly fatal process with cholangitis being a significant cause of
      morbidity and mortality in these subjects.

      This study was designed to confirm the efficacy of PHOPDT + standard medical care (SMC)
      defined as stents plus gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy regimen on the overall survival of
      subjects with unresectable cholestasis perihilar Bismuth type III or IV - tumor TNM stage III
      or IVa CCA.

          <title>Photodynamic Therapy-Photofrin Plus SMC</title>
          <description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involved the i.v. injection of Photofrin (2 mg/kg) followed by the illumination of the tumor using a fiber optic device. Two days after the injection, a laser light (180 J/cm(2)) was applied to the tumor. A second light application was given 96-120 hours after Photofrin injection if PDT could not initially be performed on all sides of the tumor. Post illumination, all patients underwent stenting. Up to 3 additional courses of PDT using a light dose of 120 J/cm(2) could be given at 3-month intervals.
As per SMC, stenting procedure consisted of the placement of stents above the main tumors of the right and left hepatic bile ducts. The chemotherapy regimen comprised gemcitabine (1 000 mg/m(2)) followed by cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)), each administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (21 day-cycle) for four cycles. An additional 12 weeks of the same chemotherapy regimen could be administered if there was no disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</description>

            <description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involved the i.v. injection of Photofrin (2 mg/kg) followed by the illumination of the tumor using a fiber optic device. Two days after the injection, a laser light (180 J/cm(2)) was applied to the tumor. A second light application was given 96-120 hours after Photofrin injection if PDT could not initially be performed on all sides of the tumor. Post illumination, all patients underwent stenting. Up to 3 additional courses of PDT using a light dose of 120 J/cm(2) could be given at 3-month intervals.
As per SMC, stenting procedure consisted of the placement of stents above the main tumors of the right and left hepatic bile ducts. The chemotherapy regimen comprised gemcitabine (1 000 mg/m(2)) followed by cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)), each administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (21 day-cycle) for four cycles. An additional 12 weeks of the same chemotherapy regimen could be administered if there was no disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</description>

            <description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involved the i.v. injection of Photofrin (2 mg/kg) followed by the illumination of the tumor using a fiber optic device. Two days after the injection, a laser light (180 J/cm(2)) was applied to the tumor. A second light application was given 96-120 hours after Photofrin injection if PDT could not initially be performed on all sides of the tumor. Post illumination, all patients underwent stenting. Up to 3 additional courses of PDT using a light dose of 120 J/cm(2) could be given at 3-month intervals.
As per SMC, stenting procedure consisted of the placement of stents above the main tumors of the right and left hepatic bile ducts. The chemotherapy regimen comprised gemcitabine (1 000 mg/m(2)) followed by cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)), each administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (21 day-cycle) for four cycles. An additional 12 weeks of the same chemotherapy regimen could be administered if there was no disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</description>

            <title>Photodynamic Therapy-Photofrin Plus SMC</title>
            <description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involved the i.v. injection of Photofrin (2 mg/kg) followed by the illumination of the tumor using a fiber optic device. Two days after the injection, a laser light (180 J/cm(2)) was applied to the tumor. A second light application was given 96-120 hours after Photofrin injection if PDT could not initially be performed on all sides of the tumor. Post illumination, all patients underwent stenting. Up to 3 additional courses of PDT using a light dose of 120 J/cm(2) could be given at 3-month intervals.
As per SMC, stenting procedure consisted of the placement of stents above the main tumors of the right and left hepatic bile ducts. The chemotherapy regimen comprised gemcitabine (1 000 mg/m(2)) followed by cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)), each administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (21 day-cycle) for four cycles. An additional 12 weeks of the same chemotherapy regimen could be administered if there was no disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</description>

            <description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involved the i.v. injection of Photofrin (2 mg/kg) followed by the illumination of the tumor using a fiber optic device. Two days after the injection, a laser light (180 J/cm(2)) was applied to the tumor. A second light application was given 96-120 hours after Photofrin injection if PDT could not initially be performed on all sides of the tumor. Post illumination, all patients underwent stenting. Up to 3 additional courses of PDT using a light dose of 120 J/cm(2) could be given at 3-month intervals.
As per SMC, stenting procedure consisted of the placement of stents above the main tumors of the right and left hepatic bile ducts. The chemotherapy regimen comprised gemcitabine (1 000 mg/m(2)) followed by cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)), each administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (21 day-cycle) for four cycles. An additional 12 weeks of the same chemotherapy regimen could be administered if there was no disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</description>

Up to 3 additional courses of PDT using a light dose of 120 J/cm(2) could be given at 3-month intervals.
As per SMC, stenting procedure consisted of the placement of stents above the main tumors of the right and left hepatic bile ducts. The chemotherapy regimen comprised gemcitabine (1 000 mg/m(2)) followed by cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)), each administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (21 day-cycle) for four cycles. An additional 12 weeks of the same chemotherapy regimen could be administered if there was no disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</description>
