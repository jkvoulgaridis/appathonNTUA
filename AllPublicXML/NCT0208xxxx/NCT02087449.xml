      Evaluate E1 wear, Clinical Performance of E1 liner in THA in Korean Patient Population

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most successful surgical procedures in general.
      Yet, a few problems remain unsolved, and aseptic loosening is probably the most important of
      them. One of the main reasons for aseptic loosening in THA is the foreign body reaction
      caused by the wear particles. Since the late 1990s, the orthopedic industry has been
      developing highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) materials to capitalize on the increased
      wear resistance. In 2007, E1Â® Antioxidant Infused Technology was developed to reduce wear
      rate, maintain mechanical properties and prevent oxidative degradation.

    <description>Vitamin E doping of highly cross-linked polyethylene is a proposed method for insuring long-term oxidative stability of highly cross-linked ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene for use in total joint arthroplasty. In vitro research and development studies have shown that this material has improved wear performance, retention of mechanical properties, and a high resistance to oxidation due to the anti-oxidative properties of Vitamin E.</description>
