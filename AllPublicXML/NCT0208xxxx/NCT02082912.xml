      new motor skills.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disability after a stroke is common, leaving 65% of patients unable to use their affected
      hand in daily activities after 6 months. Frequently, these limitations can cause a decreased
      quality of life. The current standard for intense physical therapy most commonly consists of
      neurofacilitation techniques and/or task-specific training. Labor-intensive and costly
      therapy methods are critical barriers to achieving optimal functional outcomes in stroke
      survivors with motor impairments. Thus, there is a great need to find new ways to enhance the
      effectiveness of upper limb rehabilitation in patients following stroke.

      A promising approach to improving upper extremity motor function utilizing repetitive task
      practice (RTP) and behavioral shaping along with constraint of the less affected limb is
      constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). Two fundamental limitations of CIMT are the time
      necessary to deliver and oversee training and the excessive time in which the less affected
      limb must be constrained. RTP, in the context of CIMT appears to be effective in improving
      upper extremity motor function of patients with stroke. Alternative approaches such as
      robotic assisted therapy have been investigated. Recent evidence suggests that improvements
      in upper-extremity motor function, functional performance in daily tasks and quality of life
      are seen during a robotic-assisted physical therapy regimen.

      Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is important for inducing various forms
      of synaptic plasticity. Application of D-cycloserine (a antibiotic for treating tuberculosis)
      can enhance certain models of plasticity, such as long-term potentiation. Pharmacologic
      strategies that enhance NMDA neurotransmission and working memory represent a promising
      adjuvant therapy in motor rehabilitation of patients after stroke.

      The researchers for this study have brought these observations together to generate a working
      hypothesis that D-cycloserine will enhance certain features of motor learning, information
      processing speed, episodic and working memory and that this effect can be coupled with
      physical therapy to facilitate retraining of patients to use impaired limbs to a greater
      extent and faster than they otherwise might be able to do. The researchers specifically
      hypothesize that motor (re)learning and cognition can be improved in people with post-stroke
      hemiparesis by increasing the excitability and synaptic activity of the motor cortex by
      combining D-cycloserine and robotic-assisted physical therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to understand the important factors in rehabilitation therapy
      that help improve arm function after stroke. This information may help to ultimately reduce
      disability and improve quality of life in patients with stroke.

    <measure>Grip Strength of Affected Hand</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Hand-grip strength was assessed using the whole hand and was defined as the average of 3 trials using a calibrated Jamar dynamometer (Jamar Dynamometer, Asimow Engineering Co., Santa Monica, CA), with the elbow flexed to 90ยบ and the forearm in a neutral position. This is the standardized method for measuring hand-grip strength with a Jamar dynamometer recommended by the American Society of Hand Therapists. An increase in values means that grip strength is improving.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) Categories Meeting Change Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The percentages of Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) physical domain categories meeting criteria for Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) are presented here. The SIS has 59 items in 8 domains of function where respondents rate their degree of difficulty on a 5-point scale, plus a 9th category for stroke recovery (one item, scored from 0 to 100). Scores for each domain are generated so that total scores for each domain range from 0 - 100, where higher scores indicate less difficulty and more recovery. A change of more than 4.5 to 17.8 for the domains was considered a MCID. A higher percentage of SIS categories meeting the MCID criteria indicates increased improvement in that study arm.</description>

    <measure>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale. The CES-S has 20 items rated on a scale of 0 to 3. Total scores range from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms, and a score of 16 or above indicates depression. Baseline scores are presented in the Outcome Measure Data Table and the impact of the study arm at Day 30 is presented in the statistical analysis section.</description>

    <measure>Display Enhanced Testing for Concussions and Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) (DETECT) System Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Using a computer, helmet with heads-up-display, headphones with audio inputs, and an input unit with two buttons (&quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;), the DETECT system combines an immersive environment with neuropsychological tests to assess mTBI. The DETECT software consists of a series of tests evaluating information processing speed, episodic memory, and working memory. Performance is scored based on response type (correct, incorrect, and missing) and response time. Test results are displayed using an internal algorithm that is based on the probability of impairment. Mean baseline z-scores are presented in the Outcome Measure Data Table and the impact of the study arm at Day 30 is presented in the statistical analysis section. A z-score of 0 represents a healthy individual; scores above 0 are the number of standard deviations above the mean, indicating more errors, taking more time, and thus having a higher probability of mild cognitive impairment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Blocks Moved During the Box and Block Test (BBT) of Affected Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Change in functional motor task performance of the arm affected by the stroke was assessed with the Box and Block Test (BBT). The BBT involves dexterous manipulation of objects and voluntary motor control, which improves with upper limb recovery following stroke. The number of blocks moved within 60 seconds are counted. Baseline scores of the mean number of blocks moved are presented in the Outcome Measure Data Table and the impact of the study arm at Day 30 is presented in the statistical analysis section.</description>

        <description>Hand-grip strength was assessed using the whole hand and was defined as the average of 3 trials using a calibrated Jamar dynamometer (Jamar Dynamometer, Asimow Engineering Co., Santa Monica, CA), with the elbow flexed to 90ยบ and the forearm in a neutral position. This is the standardized method for measuring hand-grip strength with a Jamar dynamometer recommended by the American Society of Hand Therapists. An increase in values means that grip strength is improving.</description>

        <description>The percentages of Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) physical domain categories meeting criteria for Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) are presented here. The SIS has 59 items in 8 domains of function where respondents rate their degree of difficulty on a 5-point scale, plus a 9th category for stroke recovery (one item, scored from 0 to 100). Scores for each domain are generated so that total scores for each domain range from 0 - 100, where higher scores indicate less difficulty and more recovery. A change of more than 4.5 to 17.8 for the domains was considered a MCID. A higher percentage of SIS categories meeting the MCID criteria indicates increased improvement in that study arm.</description>

        <title>Display Enhanced Testing for Concussions and Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) (DETECT) System Score</title>
        <description>Using a computer, helmet with heads-up-display, headphones with audio inputs, and an input unit with two buttons (&quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;), the DETECT system combines an immersive environment with neuropsychological tests to assess mTBI. The DETECT software consists of a series of tests evaluating information processing speed, episodic memory, and working memory. Performance is scored based on response type (correct, incorrect, and missing) and response time. Test results are displayed using an internal algorithm that is based on the probability of impairment. Mean baseline z-scores are presented in the Outcome Measure Data Table and the impact of the study arm at Day 30 is presented in the statistical analysis section. A z-score of 0 represents a healthy individual; scores above 0 are the number of standard deviations above the mean, indicating more errors, taking more time, and thus having a higher probability of mild cognitive impairment.</description>

        <title>Number of Blocks Moved During the Box and Block Test (BBT) of Affected Arm</title>
        <description>Change in functional motor task performance of the arm affected by the stroke was assessed with the Box and Block Test (BBT). The BBT involves dexterous manipulation of objects and voluntary motor control, which improves with upper limb recovery following stroke. The number of blocks moved within 60 seconds are counted. Baseline scores of the mean number of blocks moved are presented in the Outcome Measure Data Table and the impact of the study arm at Day 30 is presented in the statistical analysis section.</description>
