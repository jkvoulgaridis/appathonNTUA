  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To identify barriers to successful transitions that are most meaningful to patients and
      families, and use these identified barriers to iteratively adapt an existing nurse home visit
      program to address these barriers. This study will also test the efficacy of a nurse home
      visit intervention in improving post-discharge outcomes through a randomized controlled
      trial.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Occurrence of Unplanned Re-hospitalization and/or Any Emergency/Urgent Care Visits Within 30 Days of Hospital Discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The dependent variable will be a dichotomized indicator of any occurrence of unplanned rehospitalization and/or any emergency department/urgent care visit within 30-days post-discharge (i.e. unplanned reutilization). Differences in this outcome between intervention and control groups will be evaluated using logistic regression with the stratification variables (neighborhood poverty and complex versus noncomplex teams) included in the model.</description>

    <measure>Post Discharge Coping Difficulty Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Post-Discharge Difficulty Coping Scale (Weiss, et. al) measured at 14 day post-discharge phone call. Post-Discharge Coping Difficulty Scale uses an 11 point scaling format (0-10) with total scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent greater coping difficulty.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Days Until Normalcy</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days until normalcy: measured at post discharge phone call. Parents asked to recall the number of days it took to &quot;return to a 'normal' routine&quot; including the return to work and school (with option of not yet be back to normal).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Red Flags Remembered</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This was measured at the 14 day post-discharge phone call survey. Parents were asked to recall &quot;any red flags or warning signs&quot; to indicate the &quot;child's condition was getting worse.&quot; The number of red flags recalled could range from 0-10 depending on the template used. The template was a home visit guideline for nurses to use that was specific to the child's illness. For example, if the child had bronchiolitis the nurse would use the template &quot;bronchiolitis/croup/pneumonia&quot; to guide them through the visit. Higher values (i.e., the greater number of red flags remembered) represent a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Red Flags Remembered</title>
        <description>This was measured at the 14 day post-discharge phone call survey. Parents were asked to recall &quot;any red flags or warning signs&quot; to indicate the &quot;child's condition was getting worse.&quot; The number of red flags recalled could range from 0-10 depending on the template used. The template was a home visit guideline for nurses to use that was specific to the child's illness. For example, if the child had bronchiolitis the nurse would use the template &quot;bronchiolitis/croup/pneumonia&quot; to guide them through the visit. Higher values (i.e., the greater number of red flags remembered) represent a better outcome.</description>
