  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study using a concierge model of customized adherence enhancement and
      long-acting injectable antipsychotic (CAL-Concierge) in 30 individuals with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder at risk for treatment non-adherence and for homelessness. Like the
      CAE-L approach, CAL-Concierge is expected to improve health outcomes among the most
      vulnerable of populations with schizophrenia but even more importantly, will demonstrate that
      it can be used to improve the efficiency and quality of care in typical practice settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychotropic medications are a cornerstone of treatment for individuals with schizophrenia,
      but rates of full or partial non-adherence exceed 60%. There is direct correlation between
      non-adherence and rates of relapse in schizophrenia; on average, non-adherent patients have a
      risk of relapse that is 3.7 times greater than their adherent counterparts. Long-acting
      injectable antipsychotic (LAI) medication can improve adherence but needs to be combined with
      a quality behavioral program to modify long-term attitudes and behaviors.

      A recently completed study funded by the Reuter Foundation and conducted by these
      investigators found that a novel customized psychosocial adherence enhancement intervention
      paired with LAI (CAE-L) reduced rates of homelessness, improved psychiatric symptoms and
      increased overall functioning in this very vulnerable group of individuals. CAE has been
      manualized and appears very acceptable to homeless people with serious mental illness.
      However, in spite of the very promising results, the CAE-L intervention has some important
      limitations that are barriers to its wide-spread future use in public health settings. These
      limitations are:

        1. CAE-L used a PhD-level psychologist to deliver the behavioral part of the program. Many
           public-sector clinical settings have a very limited number of such highly trained
           individuals. As an alternative, social workers could be an efficient way to deliver CAE.

        2. CAE-L used only haloperidol decanoate as the injectable medication. Unfortunately,
           akathisia-- a very distressing side effect, occurred in 40% of people. Use of a newer,
           better tolerated medication option could improve the investigators approach.

        3. Logistic barriers preventing people who were stabilized and doing well on CAE-L to
           continue their improved functioning once they transitioned back to regular care
           settings. It is clear that there needs to be a mechanism to facilitate the successful
           &quot;hand-off&quot; of individuals who have benefitted from CAE-L into maintenance therapy. A
           successful transition could have substantial financial and humanitarian cost-savings.

      To address these obstacles and in preparation for a large-scale randomized controlled trial
      of this novel, blended intervention the investigators propose to conduct a prospective study
      using a concierge model of customized adherence enhancement combined with a long-acting
      injectable antipsychotic (CAL-Concierge) in individuals with schizophrenia at risk for
      treatment non-adherence and for homelessness. Like the CAE-L approach, CAL-Concierge is
      expected to improve health outcomes among the most vulnerable of populations with
      schizophrenia but even more importantly, will demonstrate that it can be used to improve the
      efficiency and quality of care in typical practice settings.

    <measure>Change in Tablets Routine Questionnaire (TRQ, Past Week) From Screen to Week 25 Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Screen, Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The Tablets Routine Questionnaire (TRQ) determines the proportion of prescribed medication taken and is not dependent upon timing of medication provided that medication is consumed within the required day/24 hour period. This rating has demonstrated statistically significant association with past non-adherence, repeated past non-adherence, any non-adherence in the past month, and non-adherence in the past week. The TRQ format will be modified slightly to document all adherence values (an exact proportion) for each item. TRQ scores ranges from perfect adherence (0% missed) to missing all medication (100% missed). An average TRQ was calculated for individuals on more than one BD medication.</description>

        <description>The Tablets Routine Questionnaire (TRQ) determines the proportion of prescribed medication taken and is not dependent upon timing of medication provided that medication is consumed within the required day/24 hour period. This rating has demonstrated statistically significant association with past non-adherence, repeated past non-adherence, any non-adherence in the past month, and non-adherence in the past week. The TRQ format will be modified slightly to document all adherence values (an exact proportion) for each item. TRQ scores ranges from perfect adherence (0% missed) to missing all medication (100% missed). An average TRQ was calculated for individuals on more than one BD medication.</description>

        <title>Change in PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; Negative Symptoms Scale) From Screen to Week 25</title>
        <description>The PANSS is used to assess patients for positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The Negative Symptoms Subscale consists of 7 questions. Each item is rated on a scale of 1 (Absent) to 7 (Extreme). Total scores for the Negative Symptoms Subscale range from 7-49. Higher scores indicate more symptoms of psychopathology. There is no aggregate score for this measure, as the subscales are to be scored separately.</description>

        <title>Change in PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; Composite Scale) From Screen to Week 25</title>
        <description>The PANSS is used to assess patients for positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The Composite Scale is scored by subtracting the negative score from the positive score. This yields a bipolar index that ranges from -42 to +42. The bipolar composite scale simply expresses the direction and magnitude of difference between positive and negative syndromes. Scores &gt;0 indicate there are more positive symptoms of schizophrenia endorsed, and scores &lt;0 indicate there are more negative symptoms of schizophrenia endorsed. There is no aggregate score for this measure, as the subscales are to be scored separately.</description>

        <description>The AIMS is used to monitor for the development of involuntary movements that may occur as a result of certain psychotropic medication. It contains 14 items, 10 of which are rated on a scale of 0 (None) to 4 (Severe). The remaining four items are &quot;yes or no&quot; questions. Items 1 thru 7 are added for a total score, while item 8 is used as an overall severity index. Total scores range from 0 to 28. Higher scores indicate more adverse outcomes.Items 9 thru 12 provide additional information that may be useful in determining lip, jaw, and tongue movements.</description>

        <description>For the subjective examination scoring is on a 4-point scale (0=Absent;1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe). The evaluator takes into account the verbal report of the patient on: 1) the frequency and duration of the symptom during the day; 2) the number of days the symptom was present during the last week; and, 3) the subjective evaluation of the intensity of the symptom by the patient. The score for Parkinsonism (including akathisia), ranges from 0 to 102 (17 items), and is based on all items of the Parkinsonism examination: tremor (0-48), gait and posture (0-6), postural stability (0-6), rigidity (0-24), expressive automatic movements (0-6), bradykinesia (0-6), akathisia (0-6).

The evaluator takes into account the verbal report of the patient on: 1) the frequency and duration of the symptom during the day; 2) the number of days the symptom was present during the last week; and, 3) the subjective evaluation of the intensity of the symptom by the patient. Score for TD, ranging from 0 to 42, is based on the sum of all seven items in the TD objective examination. Higher scores indicate more severe symptomology.</description>
