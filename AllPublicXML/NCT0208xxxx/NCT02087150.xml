  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether Eustachian tube dilation in conjunction
      with medical management or medical management alone is effective for treating Eustachian tube
      dysfunction.

    <measure>Primary Efficacy Analysis: Number of Randomized Subjects With Tympanogram Normalization at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Week Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy analysis compares randomized subjects with tympanogram normalization (Types B or C normalized to Type A) in all indicated ears at 6 weeks in the investigational arm versus the control arm. Per protocol, tympanogram types are defined as follows: Type A: Peak compliance occurs between +50 and -100 daPa, with minimum peak height of 0.2ml. Indicates NORMAL middle ear function Type B: No sharp peak and a rounded line. Indicates ABNORMAL middle ear function Type C: Peak compliance occurs beyond -100 daPa. Indicates ABNORMAL middle ear function</description>

    <measure>Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Number of Randomized Subjects With MID Improvement From Baseline of 0.5 Points or More at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Week Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy endpoint will consist of comparison of subjects achieving at least a minimally important difference (MID) level improvement of 0.5 points on the ETDQ-7 at 6 weeks post-treatment in the investigational arm versus the proportion of subjects achieving at least an MID level improvement on the ETDQ-7 at 6 weeks post-randomization in the control arm The ETDQ-7 is a seven-item ETD specific validated quality of life survey. A mean item score of greater or equal to 2.1 indicates the presence of ETD.</description>

    <measure>Exploratory Endpoint: Number of Randomized Subjects With Normalized Tympanometry at 12.24,52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24, 52 Week Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of subjects experiencing normalization of tympanometry at 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks post-treatment in the investigational arm and evaluation of subjects experiencing normalization of tympanometry at 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks post-randomization in the control arm. As MM subjects were allowed to receive a crossover procedure after their 6-week follow-up visit, there is a limited number of MM subjects who completed the 12/24/52 visits.</description>

    <time_frame>12,24,52 Week Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of subjects achieving at least a MID level improvement of 0.5 points at 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks post-treatment in the investigational arm and evaluation of subjects achieving at least a MID level improvement at 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks post-randomization in the control arm.

    <measure>Exploratory Endpoint: WPAI at 6,12,24,52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6,12,24,52 Week Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of subjects' work and activity impairment before and after treatment in both the investigational arm and the control arm. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a 6-question patient-reported general health assessment of productivity and activity impairment. WPAI results are expressed as the percentage of impairment from 0 to 100 where higher numbers indicate greater impairment or less productivity. Due to an error in the WPAI electronic data collection form, 2 questions were not visible to many subjects resulting in a significant amount of missing data for all scores except non-work activity impairment. Therefore, only the non-work activity impairment results are presented. As MM subjects were allowed to receive a crossover procedure after their 6-week follow-up visit, there is a limited number of MM subjects who completed the 12/24/52 visits.</description>

        <description>The primary efficacy analysis compares randomized subjects with tympanogram normalization (Types B or C normalized to Type A) in all indicated ears at 6 weeks in the investigational arm versus the control arm. Per protocol, tympanogram types are defined as follows: Type A: Peak compliance occurs between +50 and -100 daPa, with minimum peak height of 0.2ml. Indicates NORMAL middle ear function Type B: No sharp peak and a rounded line. Indicates ABNORMAL middle ear function Type C: Peak compliance occurs beyond -100 daPa.

A mean item score of greater or equal to 2.1 indicates the presence of ETD.</description>
          <population>Primary Analysis Cohort (PAC): The PAC is defined as all randomized subjects who receive a study treatment for which they are randomized and have completed their primary analysis visits (i.e. completer analysis with baseline and 6 week tympanogram).</population>

        <description>Evaluation of subjects' work and activity impairment before and after treatment in both the investigational arm and the control arm. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a 6-question patient-reported general health assessment of productivity and activity impairment. WPAI results are expressed as the percentage of impairment from 0 to 100 where higher numbers indicate greater impairment or less productivity. Due to an error in the WPAI electronic data collection form, 2 questions were not visible to many subjects resulting in a significant amount of missing data for all scores except non-work activity impairment. Therefore, only the non-work activity impairment results are presented. As MM subjects were allowed to receive a crossover procedure after their 6-week follow-up visit, there is a limited number of MM subjects who completed the 12/24/52 visits.</description>

      <desc>AEs in MM subjects prior to crossover are reported in the &quot;Medical Management&quot; arm (n=80). AEs in MM subjects after a crossover ETBC procedure are reported in the &quot;Crossover MM&quot; arm (n=70). To provide a robust safety profile, events are additionally presented in an &quot;ALL ETBC&quot; safety cohort, which consists of all subjects treated with the ETBC in the lead-in phase (n=80), randomized ETBC arm (n=149), and randomized MM arm who crossed over (n=70) for a total of 299 subjects in the &quot;ALL ETBC&quot; arm.</desc>
