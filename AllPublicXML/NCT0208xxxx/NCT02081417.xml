    <textblock>
      Patient-Centered Trauma Treatment, i.e., treatment delivered by peers with lived-experience,
      has the potential to increase access to trauma treatment in underserved communities. This
      could positively impact the lives of millions of people as 70% of adults in the U.S have
      experienced a traumatic event and the consequences of trauma are devastating and far
      reaching, including chronic and comorbid physical and mental health problems. The most known
      consequences of trauma include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use
      disorders (SUDs). Seeking Safety (SS) is the most effective evidenced-based treatment for
      co-occurring trauma, PTSD and SUDs. While no specific degree or experience level is required
      to conduct SS, all the evidence comes from studies using trained clinicians to implement the
      treatment, including social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists. However, these
      research findings do not generalize to underserved communities that lack mental health
      professionals. Innovative approaches to treatment, such as peer-delivered services, are
      required to meet the demand for care in underserved areas. While the benefits of
      peer-delivered services have been well-documented in many areas, the value of peers in the
      provision of trauma-treatment is unknown. A theoretical basis supports the potential for
      peer-delivered trauma-treatment to be effective in addition to the strong therapist-patient
      bond, (i.e. therapeutic alliance (TA), which is an important predictor of treatment outcome
      and a typical result of peer-patient relationships.

      Our research question is whether there is a difference between peer-led SS (PL-SS) groups and
      clinician-led SS (CL-SS) groups in improving the lives of people with trauma, PTSD and SUDs?

      The investigators have three specific aims:

        1. Determine the effectiveness of PL-SS groups compared to CL-SS groups in decreasing
           substance use and PTSD symptoms and improving coping skills, overall mental health and
           physical health. Hypothesis: PL-SS compared to CL-SS groups will be as effective in
           improving outcomes.

        2. Compare levels of TA among PL-SS and CL-SS groups and examine the impact of TA on
           outcomes.Hypotheses: Levels of TA will be higher and will play more of a role in
           impacting outcomes in the PL-SS compared to CL-SS groups.

        3. Determine if the standard Seeking Safety Instructor Training (SS-IT) is adequate for
           peers. Hypothesis: Peers will identify topics that will enhance the SS-IT.

    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD Symptoms will be measured by the post-traumatic symptom checklist - civilian version. Responses are summed to yield a total severity score, with the full range for total scores being 17 to 85 (higher scores mean higher severity).</description>

    <measure>Change in Coping Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Coping Scale will be used to assess coping skills. The Coping Scale directly assesses the degree to which participants report using 17 specific coping skills from SS, scaled from 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). This scale was selected as it is the most widely used measure of coping in the SS literature. As a result we will be able to directly compare our findings to other studies. Higher scores indicate greater frequency of use of coping skills with the range of total scores being 0 to 90</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Drug and alcohol problem severity will be assessed using the drug and alcohol subscales of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). Items assess frequency of drug and alcohol use and abuse within the past 30 days, how bothered the individual is by his/her drug or alcohol problems, and the importance of treatment. Higher composite scores indicate more severe problems. The ASI questions focus on two distinct time periods: the past 30 days and lifetime. A number of studies have confirmed the reliability and validity of the ASI.</description>

    <description>Overall mental health and physical health will be assessed by the subscales of the SF-36 (short form 36). The SF-36 questions measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. It is a practical, reliable, and valid measure of mental and physical health that can be completed in five to 10 minutes. The SF-36 has proven useful in differentiating the health benefits produced by different treatments. The Component Summary Scores range from 0% to 100% with higher scores indicative of higher functioning</description>

        <description>The Coping Scale will be used to assess coping skills. The Coping Scale directly assesses the degree to which participants report using 17 specific coping skills from SS, scaled from 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). This scale was selected as it is the most widely used measure of coping in the SS literature. As a result we will be able to directly compare our findings to other studies. Higher scores indicate greater frequency of use of coping skills with the range of total scores being 0 to 90</description>

Higher composite scores indicate more severe problems. The ASI questions focus on two distinct time periods: the past 30 days and lifetime.

        <description>Overall mental health and physical health will be assessed by the subscales of the SF-36 (short form 36). The SF-36 questions measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. It is a practical, reliable, and valid measure of mental and physical health that can be completed in five to 10 minutes. The SF-36 has proven useful in differentiating the health benefits produced by different treatments. The Component Summary Scores range from 0% to 100% with higher scores indicative of higher functioning</description>
