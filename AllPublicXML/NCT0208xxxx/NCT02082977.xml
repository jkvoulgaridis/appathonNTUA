  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) for GSK2816126 given twice weekly by intravenous (IV) infusion. Part 1 will be
      conducted in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL),
      transformed follicular lymphoma (tFL), other Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), solid tumors
      (including castrate resistant prostate cancer) and multiple myeloma (MM) to determine the
      safety and tolerability of GSK2816126. Expansion cohorts (Part 2) are planned to further
      explore clinical activity of GSK2816126 at the RP2D in subjects with Enhancer of Zeste 2
      (EZH2) wild type and EZH2 mutant positive germinal center B-cell like diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL), tFL and MM.

    <measure>Part 1: Accumulation Ratio Following Administration of GSK2816126</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, (12, 18 on Day 1 only), 24, and 96 hours post-dose from start of infusion; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 hours from end of infusion on Cycle 1 of Day 1 and Day 15 (Each cycle was of 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Accumulation ratio was determined from the ratio of AUC (0-tau) on Cycle 1 Day 15/AUC (0-tau) on Cycle 1 Day 1 by dose cohort. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed. To assess accumulation ratio for a dose level based on ANOVA method, it was required that at least 2 participants had derived PK parameter AUC(0- tau) on both Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15. For dose 100mg, 200mg and 400mg, only 1 participant received treatment. For dose 50mg, 2 participants received treatment but there was one participant whose AUC(0- tau) on Cycle 1 Day 15 could not be derived due to discontinuation of treatment before Day 15. Hence, accumulation ratio could not be calculated for these 4 arms. Accumulation ratio of GSK2816126 was estimated by calculating the ratio of geometric least squares (GLS) means of the AUC between Day 15 and Day 1 for all dose levels and corresponding 90 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) for each ratio.</description>

    <description>Ratio of AUC(0-tau) on Day15/Day1 AUC(0-inf) was calculated to assess time invariance. Only those participants with data available at specified data points were analyzed. To assess time invariance based on ANOVA method, it is required that at least 2 participants in a dose level had AUC(0-inf) on Cycle1 Day1 and AUC(0-tau) on Cycle1 Day15. For dose 100mg, 200mg and 400mg, only 1 participant received treatment. For 50mg, 2 participants received treatment but there was one participant whose AUC(0-tau) on Cycle1 Day15 could not be derived due to discontinuation of treatment before Day15, so time invariance could not be calculated. For 1200mg, 4 participants received treatment, however, AUC(0-inf) derivation on Cycle1 Day1 for 3 out of 4 participants did not strictly conform to the prescribed acceptance criteria. Time invariance ratio of GSK2816126 was estimated by calculating ratio of GLS means of AUC between Day15 and Day1 for all dose levels and corresponding 90% CI for each ratio.</description>

          -  Invasive malignancy or history of invasive malignancy other than disease under study:
             any other invasive malignancy from which the subject has been disease-free for more
             than 2 years and, in the opinion of the principal investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor, will not affect the evaluation of the effects of this clinical trial
             treatment on currently targeted malignancy, can be included in this clinical trial;
             Curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer and any carcinoma-in-situ.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a 2-part study in participants with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma, other Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, solid tumors and multiple myeloma (MM). In Part 1 dose escalation, participants received 50 to 3000 milligrams (mg) of GSK2816126, and Part 2 was dose expansion.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study was terminated prior to the completion of Part 1 due to an unfavorable benefit risk profile. Part 2 was not conducted. Approximately 42 participants screened, of which 41 were treated in Part 1 including 20 participants with lymphoma and 21 with solid tumors, of these 22 completed, 5 died and 14 participants were withdrawn.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for evaluation of clinical chemistry parameters including direct bilirubin, chloride, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, urea/blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid. Baseline value was defined as the most recent, non-missing value from a local laboratory prior to the first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was defined as any visit value minus Baseline value. The summaries of worst case change from Baseline with respect to normal range have been presented for only those laboratory tests that are not gradable by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The number of participants with decreases to low, changes to normal or no changes from Baseline, and increases to high values have been presented.

        <title>Part 1: Number of Participants With Worst Case Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hematology parameters including basophils, eosinophils, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), monocytes, segmented (seg) neutrophils, red blood cell (RBC) count and reticulocytes. Baseline value was defined as the most recent, non-missing value from a local laboratory prior to the first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was defined as any visit value minus Baseline value. The summaries of worst case change from Baseline with respect to normal range have been presented for only those laboratory tests that are not gradable by CTCAE version 4.0. The number of participants with decreases to low, changes to normal or no changes from Baseline, and increases to high values have been presented. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for pharmacokinetic analysis including AUC (0-t) following single (Day 1) and repeat dose (Day 15) administration of GSK2816126. Pharmacokinetic analysis of GSK2816126 in Part 1 was conducted by non-compartmental methods. The analysis was performed on Pharmacokinetic Population which included all participants in the All Subject population for whom a blood sample for pharmacokinetics was analyzed and at least 1 non-missing values was obtained. NA indicates data was not available since geometric coefficient of variation could not be calculated for single participant. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Part 1: Accumulation Ratio Following Administration of GSK2816126</title>
        <description>Accumulation ratio was determined from the ratio of AUC (0-tau) on Cycle 1 Day 15/AUC (0-tau) on Cycle 1 Day 1 by dose cohort. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed. To assess accumulation ratio for a dose level based on ANOVA method, it was required that at least 2 participants had derived PK parameter AUC(0- tau) on both Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15. For dose 100mg, 200mg and 400mg, only 1 participant received treatment. For dose 50mg, 2 participants received treatment but there was one participant whose AUC(0- tau) on Cycle 1 Day 15 could not be derived due to discontinuation of treatment before Day 15. Hence, accumulation ratio could not be calculated for these 4 arms. Accumulation ratio of GSK2816126 was estimated by calculating the ratio of geometric least squares (GLS) means of the AUC between Day 15 and Day 1 for all dose levels and corresponding 90 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) for each ratio.</description>

        <description>Ratio of AUC(0-tau) on Day15/Day1 AUC(0-inf) was calculated to assess time invariance. Only those participants with data available at specified data points were analyzed. To assess time invariance based on ANOVA method, it is required that at least 2 participants in a dose level had AUC(0-inf) on Cycle1 Day1 and AUC(0-tau) on Cycle1 Day15. For dose 100mg, 200mg and 400mg, only 1 participant received treatment. For 50mg, 2 participants received treatment but there was one participant whose AUC(0-tau) on Cycle1 Day15 could not be derived due to discontinuation of treatment before Day15, so time invariance could not be calculated. For 1200mg, 4 participants received treatment, however, AUC(0-inf) derivation on Cycle1 Day1 for 3 out of 4 participants did not strictly conform to the prescribed acceptance criteria. Time invariance ratio of GSK2816126 was estimated by calculating ratio of GLS means of AUC between Day15 and Day1 for all dose levels and corresponding 90% CI for each ratio.</description>

        <title>Part 1: Percentage of Participants With Solid Tumors Achieving Best Overall Response Rate</title>
        <description>Overall response rate is defined as percentage of participants achieving complete response and partial response per RECIST version 1.1. Complete Response is the disappearance of all target/non-target lesions. Partial Response is at least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters. The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. The percentage of participants with solid tumors (including prostate) achieving best overall response rate have been presented. No participants with solid tumors were treated at doses below 800mg (i.e. 50mg, 100mg, 200mg, 400mg). Hence data could not be calculated for these 4 arms.</description>

          <title>Part 1: Percentage of Participants With Lymphoma Achieving Best Overall Response Rate</title>
          <description>Overall response rate is defined as percentage of participants achieving complete response and partial response per RECIST version 1.1. Complete Response is the disappearance of all target/non-target lesions. Partial Response is at least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters. The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. The percentage of participants with lymphoma achieving best overall response rate have been presented.</description>
