  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the influence of hepatic insufficiency on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of doravirine (MK-1439). In Part 1, PK of doravirine in participants
      with moderate hepatic insufficiency was compared with that of healthy control subjects
      matched with regard to mean age and weight. If a clinically meaningful increase in exposure
      of doravirine was observed in participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency in Part 1,
      study Part 2 was to evaluate PK of doravirine in participants with mild hepatic
      insufficiency.

The total score is the sum of the scores on 5 clinical measures of liver disease, each on a 3-point scale where 3 is greatest severity: total bilirubin, serum albumin, INR, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. The total Child-Pugh score ranges from 5 to 15, where a score of 7 to 9 represents moderate hepatic insufficiency.</description>
