    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well thoracic epidural analgesia or four-quadrant
      transversus abdominus plane block works in reducing pain in patients undergoing liver
      surgery. It is not yet known whether thoracic epidural analgesia or four-quadrant transversus
      abdominus plane block may help people to recover more completely and more quickly after
      surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare length of hospital stay between patients treated with thoracic epidural
      analgesia (TEA) versus (vs.) pre-incision ultrasound-guided, four-quadrant transversus
      abdominus plane (TAP) block after open liver resection within an enhanced recovery program.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the area under the curve of early (0-48 hour) post-operative pain scores and
      number of patients who experience severe postoperative pain between the TEA and TAP groups.

      II. To compare anesthetic-related complication rates and need to change modalities between
      TEA and TAP groups.

      III. To compare surgery-related complications (including 30-day readmission and 90-day
      mortality rates) between TEA and TAP groups.

      IV. To compare return to baseline symptom burden, functional and cognitive status between TEA
      and TAP groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo placement of thoracic epidural catheter before surgery. Patients
      receive hydromorphone hydrochloride and bupivacaine via thoracic epidural catheter every 10
      minutes or 3 hours as needed. Patients may receive fentanyl and bupivacaine or plain
      bupivacaine via thoracic epidural catheter.

      ARM II: Patients undergo placement of ultrasound-guided, four-quadrant transversus abdominus
      plane block. Patients receive plain bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine via TAP block.

    <description>The area under the curve for each patient will be computed using the trapezoidal method using the pain score by time curve as has been done in prior studies of this type at MD Anderson. Will be compared between groups. In addition, the number of patients experiencing severe pain (&gt;= 7/10) during the inpatient recovery period will be compared between study groups. Will be summarized using descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, median and range. Will be compared with 2-sample t- tests, Mann Whitney U tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests as indicated.</description>

    <description>Pain control modality complications will be prospectively recorded including epidural hematoma, epidural catheter migration/malfunction, injection/exit site cellulitis, epidural abscess, cerebrospinal fluid leak, prolonged ileus (defined as inability to tolerate regular diet by post operation day 5), imbalance and gait instability, altered mental status and delirium, and need to change pain control modality due to inadequate pain control. The rate of these complications will be compared between study groups. Will be tabulated with frequency and percentages.
