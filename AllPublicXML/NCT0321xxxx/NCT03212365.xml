  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plastic and reconstructive surgeons consistently create large, raw surfaces as part of their
      operative procedures. Thus, plastic &amp; reconstructive surgery patients are among those at
      highest risk for anticoagulant-associated bleeding adverse drug events (ADEs). This study
      seeks to optimize both the safety and effectiveness of post-operative enoxaparin by comparing
      aFXa levels, bleeding events, and VTE events among plastic &amp; reconstructive surgery patients
      randomized to receive two different enoxaparin dose regimens.

    <textblock>
      Plastic and reconstructive surgeons consistently create large, raw surfaces as part of their
      operative procedures. Thus, plastic &amp; reconstructive surgery patients are among those at
      highest risk for anticoagulant-associated bleeding adverse drug events (ADEs). Our
      preliminary data has shown that a fixed, or &quot;one size fits all&quot; dose of enoxaparin, an
      anticoagulant, can allow a high proportion of patients to have appropriately thinned blood,
      measured by anti-Factor Xa (aFXa) levels. Patients with adequate aFXa levels are known to
      have significantly decreased venous thromboembolism risk (VTE), which is desirable. However,
      30% of patients who receive fixed dose enoxaparin have blood that is too thin. Patients who
      are over-anticoagulated are significantly more likely to have ADEs including bleeding
      requiring return to the operating room, need for blood transfusion, or death. The optimal way
      to dose enoxaparin to minimize ADEs remains unknown. This study seeks to optimize both the
      safety and effectiveness of post-operative enoxaparin by comparing aFXa levels, bleeding
      events, and VTE events among plastic &amp; reconstructive surgery patients randomized to receive
      two different enoxaparin dose regimens.
