  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of long-term
      administration of vonoprazan tablets when used as maintenance therapy for reflux esophagitis
      in routine clinical settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this survey is called vonoprazan. Vonoprazan is being tested to
      treat patients who have reflux esophagitis.

      This survey will look at the safety and effectiveness of long-term administration of
      vonoprazan tablets when used as maintenance therapy for reflux esophagitis in routine
      clinical settings. The survey will enroll approximately 1000 participants.

      - Vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg

      This multi-center observational trial will be conducted in Japan.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Had One or More Adverse Drug Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Adverse drug reaction refers to AE related to administered drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopic Relapse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From the initiation of the maintenance therapy to Month 12 (or discontinuation of the therapy), up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic relapse rate was defined as a percentage of participants who met the criteria of Grade A to D in the modified Los Angeles (LA) classification. The modified LA classification graded endoscopic findings as follows- Grade N: normal mucosa; Grade M: minimal changes to the mucosa, such as erythema and/or whitish turbidity; Grade A: non-confluent mucosal breaks &lt;5 mm in length; Grade B: nonconfluent mucosal breaks ≥ 5 mm in length; Grade C: confluent mucosal breaks &lt;75% circumferential; Grade D: confluent mucosal breaks &gt;=75% circumferential.</description>
