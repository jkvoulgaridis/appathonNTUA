  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is done to test the safety of the new drug selitrectinib in children and
      adults with cancer having a change in a particular gene (NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3). The drug may
      treat cancer by interfering with the effect of the NTRK genes on cancer growth. The study
      also investigates how the drug is absorbed and processed in the human body, and how well and
      for how long the cancer responds to the drug. This is the first study to test selitrectinib
      in humans with cancer, for whom no other effective therapy exists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (Phase 1) and dose expansion (Phase
      2) .

      The primary objective of Phase 1 is to establish the recommended dose of selitrectinib to
      treat neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (NTRK) fusion cancers in patients a) aged 12 years and
      older and b) younger than 12 years. Secondary objectives of Phase 1 are to characterize the
      pharmakokinetic properties of the test drug, its safety and tolerability, and to assess the
      objective response rate (ORR) of NTRK-tumors.

      The primary objective of Phase 2 is to assess the overall response rate in NTRK fusion cancer
      patients as determined by an independent radiology committee (IRR). Secondary objectives of
      Phase 2 comprise the safety and efficacy of selitrectinib at the recommended dose.

               -  a) a documented NTRK fusion and a clinical history of relapse following a
                  response to a prior TRK inhibitor

               -  b) a documented NTRK fusion unresponsive to a prior TRK inhibitor

               -  c) a documented NTRK fusion and a clinical history of intolerance to a prior TRK
                  inhibitor

             may be enrolled based on an ETV6+ FISH test without identifying NTRK3.

          -  Performance Status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score ≤ 3 (age ≥ 16
             years) or Lansky Performance Score (LPS) ≥ 40% (age &lt; 16 years). If enrolled with
             primary CNS tumor to be assessed by RANO, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) (age ≥ 16
             years) or LPS (age &lt; 16 years) ≥ 50%.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 4 weeks.

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function.

          -  Patients with stable CNS primary tumor, brain metastases, or treated spinal cord
             compression are eligible if neurological symptoms have been stable for 7 days prior to
             the first dose of selitrectinib

          -  Ability to receive study drug orally or by enteral administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior exposure to second generation TRK inhibitor (e.g. selitrectinib, TPX-0005).
             Exception is in case patient presented intolerance to the second generation TRK
             inhibitor agent and the duration of exposure was less than 28 days. No previous
             treatment with selitrectinib is allowed.

          -  Concurrent treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer, consumption of
             grapefruit juice or Seville oranges, or drugs associated with QT prolongation.

          -  Clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or history of myocardial
             infarction within 3 months prior to planned start of selitrectinib, or prolongation of
             QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc interval) &gt;480 milliseconds within past 6
             months

          -  Major surgery within 7 days of enrollment

          -  Uncontrolled systemic bacterial, fungal or viral infection.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to selitrectinib or Ora-Sweet® SF and OraPlus® for patients
             receiving liquid formulation.
