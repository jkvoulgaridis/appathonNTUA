  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common form of malignancy world-wide. Surgery,
      chemotherapy and radiation are associated with a high burden of side effects; tumour
      recurrence within the neck continues to be a major cause of treatment failure. To our
      knowledge, this research is the first clinical study in human subjects to utilize magnetic
      resonance guided focused ultrasound to treat cancer of the neck. The goal is to evaluate the
      safety and technical feasibility of this therapy in order to guide future clinical
      applications such as ablation, radiosensitization or drug delivery that could ultimately
      improve clinical outcomes. A total of 10 patients will be treated with MR guided focused
      ultrasound.

      This is a single institution, prospective pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility
      of MR guided focused ultrasound treatment for cancer of the neck in 10 patients. The
      procedure will consist of a planning MRI scan and two treatment sessions where real time MRI
      thermometry is used in conjunction with a focused beam to heat the tissue to 40-42oC in the
      target field over a period of 20-30 seconds per treatment. All patients on the study will
      undergo palliative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. MRg-FU treatments will be delivered on
      fraction #1 and fraction #10 (50 Gy/20 regimen) or on fraction #1 and fraction #3 (35-45 Gy/5
      SBRT regimen). Palliative radiotherapy treatment will be administered to the treatment target
      lesion and in addition may encompass other tumour regions of the head and neck. The
      prescribed dose for patients who have not received previous radiotherapy will be between 50Gy
      over 4 weeks using IMRT or VMAT -based planning or 35-45 Gy in 5 fractions using SBRT
      technique; in previously irradiated patients, the dose will be determined at the discretion
      of the treating radiation oncologist. The patient will be assessed by a physician
      investigator and clinical research assistant (CRA) on the MRg-FU treatment dates, then 1 day,
      1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months afterward.
