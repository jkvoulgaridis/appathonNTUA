    <measure>Percentage of participants with Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score of clear or almost clear (0, 1) at Week 28.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is the physician's current assessment of the average thickness, erythema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with a ≥ 90% reduction from Baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>PASI90 denotes greater than or equal to 90% improvement in PASI score. PASI provides a quantitative assessment of psoriasis disease state based on the amount of body surface area that is affected and the degree of severity of erythema, induration, and scale, weighted by body part.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with a 100% reduction from Baseline PASI score (PASI 100) at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>PASI100 denotes greater than or equal to 100% improvement in PASI score. PASI provides a quantitative assessment of psoriasis disease state based on the amount of body surface area that is affected and the degree of severity of erythema, induration, and scale, weighted by body part.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>PASI75 denotes greater than or equal to 75% improvement in PASI score. PASI provides a quantitative assessment of psoriasis disease state based on the amount of body surface area that is affected and the degree of severity of erythema, induration, and scale, weighted by body part.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L at all visits collected</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized non-disease specific instrument for describing and valuing health-related quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Achievement of an increase of 0.1 or more points from baseline in European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) at all visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ‐5D‐5L has five dimensions: mobility, self‐care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. These dimensions are measured on a five‐level scale: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.</description>
