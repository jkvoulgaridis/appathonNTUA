  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
      of E-PrEP on reaching young men of color who have sex with men (YMCSM) at high-risk of HIV
      infection to reduce HIV acquisition. E-PrEP is a peer-designed social media-based health
      intervention to increase PrEP awareness, knowledge, and motivation as a tool for HIV
      prevention and to increase linkage to primary care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study examines a social media based peer-led and delivered intervention focused on
      increasing PrEP adoption in young men of color who have sex with men (YMCSM). While prior
      efficacy trials have included YMCSM 18-29, we will focus on PrEP in YMCSM outside clinical
      trial settings. Rather than an alternative medium for implementation of existing
      interventions designed for in-person contact, social media may be a true 'game changer' to
      engage hard to reach individuals. While many online behavioral interventions exist, including
      some that use social media, this will be one of the few studies to use and test social media
      to facilitate uptake of a biomedical intervention. E-PrEP will connect the target population
      (YMCSM) to a new prevention tool (PrEP) through rapid linkage to medical care, accelerating
      diffusion of PrEP. Given the paucity of data regarding social media-based interventions to
      change health-related behavior, E-PrEP may have a marked impact on future bio-behavioral
      interventions, especially those that include diffusion of innovation. Social media offers the
      power of scale and efficiency for large potential impact, even with relatively low-intensity
      interventions. Similarly, PrEP, if widely adopted in high-risk populations and offered with
      behavioral interventions, could markedly decrease HIV infection rates. Social media-based,
      peer-led approaches like E-PrEP could be used to enhance efforts by community-based and other
      organizations that employ internet-assisted or peer-outreach strategies to improve health.

      Primary Aim: To test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of E-PrEP for increasing PrEP
      adoption in a cluster-randomized controlled trial.

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This primary outcome is intention to use PrEP in the next month measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. This was assessed with a yes/no question (dichotomous variable). However, this variable does not include anyone who reported PrEP use at either 6 or 12 weeks.
This outcome will inform sample size calculations for a subsequent fully powered trial.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Using PrEP Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is the number of participants who self-report using PrEP at baseline, 6 weeks, or 12 weeks. This was measure by a yes/no question asking if the participant currently uses PrEP (dichotomous variable).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PrEP Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported PrEP related knowledge.
Participants were asked two questions about PrEP knowledge. For each question, they got one point if the answer was correct.
Scale range from 0-2. The score were added and the average of the sum was reported.
The higher the score, the higher the knowledge of PrEP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PrEP Stigma</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Any stigma the participant might have about PrEP or those who use PrEP
To measure PrEP Stigma we asked 3 questions, using a Likert scale (from 1-4; 1= Strongly Disagree, 4=Strongly Agree). The scores were summed for each participant. The scores range from 1-12, with higher scores indicating higher levels of PrEP Stigma.
The higher the score, the higher the level of PrEP stigma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Communication About PrEP</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Discussion of PrEP with friends, partners, or family. Communication about PrEP was measured with 2 questions, using a Likert scale ( from 1-5;1=Not at all, 5= Extremely). The scores of the 2 questions were summed for each participant.
The scores range from 1-10, with higher the score indicating higher the level of communication about PrEP (i.e. higher scores indicates participants communicating more about PrEP).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PrEP Barriers</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Any Barriers to PrEP uptake.
To measure barriers to PrEP uptake, 7 items were used. Each item was measured using a likert scale ( from 1-4; 1=Strongly Disagree, 4= Strongly Agree). The scores of each question were summed for each participant (scale scores ranged 1-28, with higher scores indicating higher levels of PrEP Barriers).
The higher the score, the higher the number of PrEP Barriers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy About Using PrEP</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported answer to questions about self-efficacy of using PrEP. There were two questions to measure self-efficacy of PrEP using a Likert scale (ranging from 1-5; 1=Not at all, 5=Extremely). The scores from both questions were summed for each participant. The scale range from 1-10 with higher scores indicating higher the levels of PrEP self-efficacy.</description>

Peer leaders recruited study participants via their existing online social networks to complete an online eligibility screener and baseline survey. Study participants were then directed to join a private online group, facilitated and moderated by the peer leader who had recruited them.
Content: The E-PrEP campaign focused on delivering information about PrEP. The materials were composed of 6 weeks of publicly available PrEP educations materials selected by peer advisors prior to the intervention (i.e. information on how to talk to your doctor about PrEP, where to get PrEP, side effects, etc.). The materials mapped out onto Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Information, Motivation, Behavior (IMB) domains.

            <description>We recruited Peer Leaders over a 5-week period and then randomly assigned them to the 2 arms. Peer Leaders were blinded to their study condition. Peer leaders recruited study participants via their existing online social networks to complete an online eligibility screener and baseline survey. Study participants were then directed to join a private online group, facilitated and moderated by the peer leader who had recruited them.
Content: The E-PrEP campaign focused on delivering information about PrEP. The materials were composed of 6 weeks of publicly available PrEP educations materials selected by peer advisors prior to the intervention (i.e. information on how to talk to your doctor about PrEP, where to get PrEP, side effects, etc.). The materials mapped out onto Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Information, Motivation, Behavior (IMB) domains. Peer leaders framed the E-PrEP materials in their own words when posting the materials to their online private group.</description>

Content: BxNow focused on a broad range of health topics prioritized by the peer leaders assigned to this arm, but did not include any contents about HIV or PrEP (i.e. depression, anxiety, suicide, intimate partner violence, drug use, awareness of sexually transmitted infections). BxNow was attention matched to the E-PrEP intervention timeline (6 weeks of materials) for both time and day of posts and frequency of posts. As with E-PrEP, standardized BxNow contents were delivered by peer leaders, framed using their own words.</description>

            <description>We recruited Peer Leaders over a 5-week period and then randomly assigned them to the 2 arms. Peer Leaders were blinded to their study condition. Peer leaders recruited study participants via their existing online social networks to complete an online eligibility screener and baseline survey. Study participants were then directed to join a private online group, facilitated and moderated by the peer leader who had recruited them.
Content: The E-PrEP campaign focused on delivering information about PrEP. The materials were composed of 6 weeks of publicly available PrEP educations materials selected by peer advisors prior to the intervention (i.e. information on how to talk to your doctor about PrEP, where to get PrEP, side effects, etc.). The materials mapped out onto Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Information, Motivation, Behavior (IMB) domains. Peer leaders framed the E-PrEP materials in their own words when posting the materials to their online private group.</description>

Peer leaders recruited study participants via their existing online social networks to complete an online eligibility screener and baseline survey. Study participants were then directed to join a private online group, facilitated and moderated by the peer leader who had recruited them.
Content: The E-PrEP campaign focused on delivering information about PrEP. The materials were composed of 6 weeks of publicly available PrEP educations materials selected by peer advisors prior to the intervention (i.e. information on how to talk to your doctor about PrEP, where to get PrEP, side effects, etc.). The materials mapped out onto Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Information, Motivation, Behavior (IMB) domains. Peer leaders framed the E-PrEP materials in their own words when posting the materials to their online private group.</description>

Content: The E-PrEP campaign focused on delivering information about PrEP. The materials were composed of 6 weeks of publicly available PrEP educations materials selected by peer advisors prior to the intervention (i.e. information on how to talk to your doctor about PrEP, where to get PrEP, side effects, etc.). The materials mapped out onto Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Information, Motivation, Behavior (IMB) domains.

        <title>Trust in the Peer by Participant</title>
        <description>The scale measure the level of trust the Participant had on the Peer's online post.
Trust in the Peer Leader was measured using 4 questions, each scored from 1-7 (1=Strongly Disagree, 7=Strongly Agree). The score for the 4 questions was summed for each participant. The score ranged from 1-28 with higher scores indicating a higher level of trust the participant had in their Peer Leader.</description>

            <description>We recruited Peer Leaders over a 5-week period and then randomly assigned them to the 2 arms. Peer Leaders were blinded to their study condition. Peer leaders recruited study participants via their existing online social networks to complete an online eligibility screener and baseline survey. Study participants were then directed to join a private online group, facilitated and moderated by the peer leader who had recruited them.
Content: The E-PrEP campaign focused on delivering information about PrEP. The materials were composed of 6 weeks of publicly available PrEP educations materials selected by peer advisors prior to the intervention (i.e. information on how to talk to your doctor about PrEP, where to get PrEP, side effects, etc.). The materials mapped out onto Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Information, Motivation, Behavior (IMB) domains. Peer leaders framed the E-PrEP materials in their own words when posting the materials to their online private group.</description>

            <description>We recruited Peer Leaders over a 5-week period and then randomly assigned them to the 2 arms. Peer Leaders were blinded to their study condition. Peer leaders recruited study participants via their existing online social networks to complete an online eligibility screener and baseline survey. Study participants were then directed to join a private online group, facilitated and moderated by the peer leader who had recruited them.
Content: BxNow focused on a broad range of health topics prioritized by the peer leaders assigned to this arm, but did not include any contents about HIV or PrEP (i.e. depression, anxiety, suicide, intimate partner violence, drug use, awareness of sexually transmitted infections). BxNow was attention matched to the E-PrEP intervention timeline (6 weeks of materials) for both time and day of posts and frequency of posts. As with E-PrEP, standardized BxNow contents were delivered by peer leaders, framed using their own words.</description>

          <title>E-PrEP- Peer-Led Intervention About PrEP</title>
          <description>8 Peer Leaders (PLs) will be randomly assigned to the E-PrEP arm. Each of the PLs will recruit at least 15 participants into a private social media group on one of several social media platforms. PLs will then deliver a behavioral intervention over a 6 week period, posting information and engaging participants in a discussion about PrEP, PrEP access, and other related health issues. All contents will be formatted to be both mobile device accessible.
Intervention contents and targets were informed by a systematic review of PrEP barriers and facilitators, a locally conducted qualitative study, and key informant and peer leader inputs. The contents were developed or adapted by study staff and peer leaders. Components and associated text have been designed to engage participants in online discussions about PrEP and related health and social topics. Posts will also include information about linkage-to-care, and insurance access. New contents will be posted almost daily.</description>

          <title>BxNow - General Health Campaign</title>
          <description>BxNow is an attention-matched control. Eight of the 16 PLs will be randomly assigned to the BxNow arm. The BxNow campaign will be a 6-week long social media intervention about general health wellness topics chosen and administered by the PLs assigned into this arm. Similarly to the intervention group, PLs in the BxNow arm will create private social media groups and recruit participants into these private groups. General health information in the BxNow arm will be posted with the same frequency as in the intervention arm.
BxNow - General Health Campaign: BxNow will focus on general health topics unrelated to HIV or sexual health (i.e. fitness, nutrition, smoking), as chosen by PLs. Contents will be developed or adapted by PLs and posted almost daily. Posts will also include information about linkage-to-care and insurance access. At the end of the intervention, BxNow participants will be exposed to E-PrEP components at the end of the trial.</description>
