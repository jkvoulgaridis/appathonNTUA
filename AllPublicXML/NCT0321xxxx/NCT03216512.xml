    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate performance on the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder ( ADHD) Battery of the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB),
      including spatial working memory, inhibitory control, and attention while using either a
      noise cancelling headphone or sham headphone control in the presence of standardized auditory
      distractors in children and adolescents with ADHD.

    <textblock>
      This will be a proof-of-concept, randomized, within-subject cross-over design with the
      administration of noise cancelling headphones or sham headphones on two separate study days.
      Following screening and a baseline assessment session with no headphones, participants will
      be assigned to complete each experimental session. During each session, they will undergo the
      CANTAB and Academic tasks. The order of sessions will be randomized and balanced across
      participants to be either noise-cancelling headphones first followed by sham headphones; or
      sham headphones first followed by noise-cancelling headphones. Eligible participants
      currently taking stimulant medications for ADHD will be asked to stop taking their medication
      on the day of the baseline visit and during the 2 experimental sessions.

        <title>Change in CANTAB ADHD Battery - Stop Signal Reaction Time Task</title>
        <description>Compare change from Baseline scores on the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB) ADHD battery with noise cancelling headphones and sham-controls. Results are reported as change from Baseline for each of 4 components of the ADHD battery.
Stop Signal Reaction Time Task: no minimum and maximum values as values are reaction times; higher scores indicate worse performance compared to Baseline</description>
