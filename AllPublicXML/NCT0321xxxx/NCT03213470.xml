  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial artery disease has been more detected with development of HR-MR. HR-MR can
      depict vascular wall directly and give us more information beyond the pre-existing imaging
      modalities such as digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, computed
      tomography angiography. Hence, HR-MR is considered to become promising imaging modality for
      intracranial artery disease and many studies have been published recently. However, there was
      not enough to differentiate various intracranial artery disease such as atherosclerosis,
      dissection, moyamoya disease, vasculitis, reversible vasoconstriction syndrome. In real
      clinical arena, intracranial artery disease is too difficult to diagnose and distinguish
      among the disease. Of the disease, usefulness of HR-MR has been consistently published in the
      detection and diagnosis of intracranial artery dissection recently. HR-MR seems to be the
      most important and reliable imaging method in intracranial artery dissection as of now.
      Therefore, intracranial artery dissection is necessary to study using HR-MR. Intracranial
      artery dissection is dynamic vascular pathology. The geometric change is the most common
      among intracranial artery disease. However, there was no report about the geometric change in
      HR-MR. The investigators acquired retrospective data about the natural course of intracranial
      artery dissection in HR-MR and are preparing for publishing an article. However, the data is
      not prospective and not intraindividual comparison. Therefore, reliability is not enough to
      convince the natural course. If the investigators got prospective and intraindividual data,
      definite natural course of intracranial artery dissection could be acquired and would be
      helpful to diagnose the dissection and differentiate from other vascular pathologies. The
      longitudinal information from this study could guide us as the important map on the confusing
      HR-MR findings. In addition, the previous retrospective study can be a stepping-stone to
      perform a prospective study, which can increase the success rate of the prospective study.
      The protocols for imaging follow-up are as followed: initial (optional), 1 month, 3 month, 6
      month (optional), 12 month
