  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center Phase I/II clinical trial of GTB-3550 (CD16/IL-15/CD33) tri-specific
      killer cell engager (TriKE™) for the treatment of CD33-expressing high risk myelodysplastic
      syndromes, refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia or advanced systemic mastocytosis. The
      hypothesis is that GTB-3550 TriKE™ will induce natural killer cell function by targeting
      malignant cells as well as CD33+ myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) which contribute to
      tumor induced immunosuppression. Because CD16 is the most potent activating receptor on NK
      cells, this single agent may induce a targeted anti-CD33+ tumor response.

    <description>Patients receive a single course of GTB-3550 TriKE™ at their assigned dose as 3 weekly treatment blocks. Each block consists of four consecutive 24 hour continuous infusions (over approximately 96 hours) of GTB-3550 TriKE™ followed by a 72 hour break after Block #1 and #2. All treatment is given as an inpatient. The assigned dose will be calculated on a weight obtained within 5 days prior to or on day of the 1st dose. The dose is not be recalculated for subsequent treatment blocks.</description>

    <description>The treatment schedule is identical to the dose finding component. The extended component uses a Simon's MiniMax two-stage design for continued enrollment using the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) established during Phase I with monitoring guidelines to stop the study early for excessive toxicity.</description>
