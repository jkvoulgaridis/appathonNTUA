  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether circulating Angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang (1-7)
      levels are associated with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction in mechanically ventilated
      subjects. It is also designed to further characterize the subject population for severity of
      RV dysfunction. This study will investigate the association of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)
      peptides and markers of RV function, as measured by echocardiography, in subjects requiring
      acute mechanical ventilation. Maximum 150 subjects will be enrolled for the study and they
      will be evaluated over three days period using standard of care investigations, including
      trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) and/or trans-esophageal echocardiography (TOE)
      echocardiography. The maximum total duration of this study for subjects is 28 days.

             arterial pressure of at least 40 mmHg for at least 15 minutes (mins)] which is not
             caused by new onset arrhythmias) or shock (manifested by evidence of tissue
             hypo-perfusion and hypoxia, including an altered level of consciousness, oliguria, or
             cool, clammy extremities).

        <description>Pulmonary circulatory dysfunction is defined as moderate dysfunction (pulmonary arterial systolic pressure [&gt;40 millimeters of mercury] or a dilated RV end diastolic RV/left ventricle [LV] area ratio [&gt;=0.6] but without septal dyskinesia). At risk Population consisted of participants who satisfied following criteria: 1. pulmonary arterial systolic pressure and ratio of RV to LV end-diastolic area recorded for all three study days [regardless of the Ang II and Ang(1-7) status] and/or; 2. databased acute cor pulmonale/pulmonary circulatory dysfunction and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) assessment during the study period (even if they do not have three days worth of study assessments for the echo outcomes) were evaluated for acute cor pulmonale/pulmonary circulatory dysfunction and ARDS incidence rates.
