  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-man study that will investigate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of ascending single doses of BAY1902607 using a placebo controlled,
      randomized, single center design. In addition the influence of food on the pharmacokinetics
      of BAY1902607 and the bioavailability between different pharmaceutical formulations will be
      investigated

    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e. any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a patient or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study. AEs (except for those in the 60 mg dose group) were considered to be treatment-emergent if they had started or worsened within the interval from first study drug administration until the follow-up visit. For the 60 mg dose group, AEs were considered to be TEAEs if they had started or worsened within one of the following intervals: 1) from first administration of study medication in treatment period 1 to 15 days thereafter, 2) from second administration of study medication in treatment period 2 to 15 days thereafter, 3) from third administration of study medication in treatment period 3 to follow-up visit.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects with severity of treatment-emergent adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were considered to be TEAEs if they had started or worsened within the interval from first study drug administration until the follow-up visit (except for the 60 mg dose group: from first study drug administration in treatment period 1 to 15 days thereafter; from second study drug administration in treatment period 2 to 15 days thereafter; from third study drug administration in treatment period 3 to follow-up visit). Classification of the intensity: Mild (usually transient and might have required only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention, did not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living), Moderate (usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention, interfered with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but posed no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject), Severe (required intensive therapeutic intervention, interrupted usual activities of daily living, or significantly affected clinical status).</description>
