      STUDY RATIONALE: Patients with hormone receptor (HR)+, HER2- node-negative breast cancers
      generally undergo surgical resection upfront, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, if needed,
      in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy. Because endocrine therapy is primarily delivered
      in the postoperative setting, the ability to assess the tumor response to this treatment
      modality is lost and very difficult to assess. This study offers the unique opportunity to
      assess the responsiveness of breast tumors to endocrine therapy while the tumors are still in
      vivo by treating patients with endocrine therapy before surgery and assessing molecular
      changes with treatment. By comparing pre- and post-treatment levels of molecular markers in
      individual tumors, the team expects to identify predictors of responsiveness to existing
      agents and identify new candidate therapeutic targets.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to determine the frequency of increased HER
      family of receptor tyrosine kinases protein expression in tumors, following treatment with
      neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and their correlation with Ki-67 tumor responses. The team will
      measure cancer cell protein levels of growth factor receptors of the human epidermal growth
      factor receptor (HER) family before and after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. The data will be
      used to inform a future randomized trial of combined endocrine and the most promising
      anti-HER targeted therapy.

    <description>Once enrolled, patients would be treated with the current standard-of-care endocrine therapy. Choice of endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen) would be decided by medical oncologist, following a review of the patient's medical history and menstrual status. The patient would be treated with endocrine therapy in a neoadjuvant setting for four weeks, with dosing continuing until surgery.</description>
