    <textblock>
      XIENCE 90 study is a prospective, single arm, multi-center, open label trial to evaluate the
      safety of 3-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in subjects at high risk of bleeding (HBR)
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the approved XIENCE family of
      coronary drug-eluting stents.

      The XIENCE family stent systems include commercially approved XIENCE Xpedition Everolimus
      Eluting Coronary Stent System (EECSS), XIENCE Alpine EECSS, XIENCE PRO^X EECSS [rebrand of
      the XIENCE Xpedition Stent System and is only available outside of the United States (OUS)],
      XIENCE PRO^A EECSS (rebrand of the XIENCE Alpine Stent System and is only available OUS) and
      XIENCE Sierra EECSS of coronary drug-eluting stents.

      A. Primary Objective:

      To show non-inferiority of the primary endpoint of all death or all MI (modified ARC) from 3
      to 12 months following XIENCE implantation in HBR subjects with HBR treated with 3-month DAPT
      compared to a historical control after propensity score adjustment.

      B. Secondary Objective:

        -  To show superiority of the major secondary endpoint of major bleeding (Bleeding Academic
           Research Consortium [BARC] type 2-5) from 3 to 12 months following XIENCE implantation
           in HBR subjects treated with 3-month DAPT compared to a historical control after
           propensity score adjustment.

        -  To evaluate stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) from 3 to 12 months following
           XIENCE implantation in HBR subjects treated with 3-month DAPT against a performance goal
           (PG).

      Approximately 2,000 subjects from approximately 100 sites globally will be enrolled, with at
      least 50% of subjects in the United States (US) and subject registration was capped at 300
      per site.

      All registered subjects will be followed at 3, 6 and 12 months post index procedure.

      The data collected from this study will be compared with the historical control of
      non-complex HBR subjects treated with standard DAPT duration of up to 12 months from the
      XIENCE V USA study, which is a US post-approval study to evaluate the safety of XIENCE V
      EECSS in &quot;all-comer&quot; population under real-world setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is considered at high risk for bleeding (HBR), defined as meeting one or more
             of the following criteria at the time of registration and in the opinion of the
             referring physician, the risk of major bleeding with &gt; 3-month DAPT outweighs the
             benefit:

               1. ≥ 75 years of age.

               2. Clinical indication for chronic (at least 6 months) or lifelong anticoagulation
                  therapy.

               3. History of major bleeding which required medical attention within 12 months of
                  the index procedure.

               4. History of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic).

               5. Renal insufficiency (creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl) or failure (dialysis dependent).

               6. Systemic conditions associated with an increased bleeding risk (e.g.
                  hematological disorders, including a history of or current thrombocytopenia
                  defined as a platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3, or any known coagulation disorder
                  associated with increased bleeding risk).

               7. Anemia with hemoglobin &lt; 11g/dl.

          2. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          3. Subject or a legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent
             as approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) of the
             respective clinical site prior to any study related procedure.

          4. Subject is willing to comply with all protocol requirements, including agreement to
             stop taking P2Y12 inhibitor at 3 months, if eligible per protocol.

          5. Subject must agree not to participate in any other clinical trial for a period of one
             year following the index procedure.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Up to three target lesions with a maximum of two target lesions per epicardial vessel.
             Note:

               -  The definition of epicardial vessels means left anterior descending coronary
                  artery (LAD), left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) and right coronary artery
                  (RCA) and their branches. For example, the patient must not have &gt;2 lesions
                  requiring treatment within both the LAD and a diagonal branch in total.

               -  If there are two target lesions within the same epicardial vessel, the two target
                  lesions must be at least 15 mm apart per visual estimation; otherwise this is
                  considered as a single target lesion.

          2. Target lesion ≤ 32 mm in length by visual estimation.

          3. Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with visually estimated
             reference vessel diameter between 2.25 mm and 4.25 mm.

          4. Exclusive use of XIENCE family of stent systems during the index procedure.

          5. Target lesion has been treated successfully, which is defined as achievement of a
             final in-stent residual diameter stenosis of &lt;20% with final TIMI-3 flow assessed by
             online quantitative angiography or visual estimation, with no residual dissection
             NHLBI grade ≥ type B, and no transient or sustained angiographic complications (e.g.,
             distal embolization, side branch closure), no chest pain lasting &gt; 5 minutes, and no
             ST segment elevation &gt; 0.5 mm or depression lasting &gt; 5 minutes.

        General Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subject with an indication for the index procedure of acute ST-segment elevation MI
             (STEMI).

          2. Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin,
             heparin/bivalirudin, P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor), everolimus,
             cobalt, chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers or contrast
             sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          3. Subject with implantation of another drug-eluting stent (other than XIENCE) within 9
             months prior to index procedure.

          4. Subject has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;30%.

          5. Subject judged by physician as inappropriate for discontinuation from P2Y12 inhibitor
             use at 3 months, due to another condition requiring chronic P2Y12 inhibitor use.

          6. Subject with planned surgery or procedure necessitating discontinuation of P2Y12
             inhibitor within 3 months following index procedure.

          7. Subject with a current medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12
             months.

          8. Subject intends to participate in an investigational drug or device trial within 12
             months following the index procedure.

          9. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year
             following index procedure. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site
             standard test.

             Note: Female patients of childbearing potential should be instructed to use safe
             contraception (e.g., intrauterine devices, hormonal contraceptives: contraceptive
             pills, implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices, injections with
             prolonged release.) It is accepted, in certain cases, to include subjects having a
             sterilised regular partner or subjects using a double barrier contraceptive method.
             However, this should be explicitly justified in special circumstances arising from the
             study design, product characteristics and/or study population

         10. Subject is part of a vulnerable population, defined as subject whose willingness to
             volunteer in a clinical investigation could be unduly influenced by the expectation,
             whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation or of retaliatory
             response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate.
             Examples of populations which may contain vulnerable subjects include: individuals
             with lack of or loss of autonomy due to immaturity or through mental disability,
             persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished persons, subjects in emergency
             situations, ethnic minority groups, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and those
             incapable of giving informed consent. Other vulnerable subjects include, for example,
             members of a group with a hierarchical structure such as university students,
             subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of the sponsor, members of
             the armed forces, and persons kept in detention.

         11. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet
             completed its primary endpoint.

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

          1. Target lesion is in a left main location.

          2. Target lesion is located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft.

          3. Target lesion is restenotic from a previous stent implantation.

          4. Target lesion is a total occluded lesion (TIMI flow 0).

          5. Target lesion contains thrombus as indicated in the angiographic images (per SYNTAX
             score thrombus definition).

          6. Target lesion is implanted with overlapping stents, whether planned or for bailout.

        Note: If there is more than one target lesion, all target lesions must satisfy the
        angiographic eligibility criteria. Non-target lesion (i.e., lesions that do not meet the
        angiographic criteria listed above) treatments are not allowed during the index procedure.
