        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has read and signed the Institutional Review Board approved consent form
             before treatment.

          -  Subject must be age 21 or above.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to follow study procedures and instructions.

          -  Subject affected by moderate to severe peri-implant disease.

          -  Treated chronic periodontitis and proper periodontal maintenance care.

          -  Dental implant must meet the following criteria to be selected for the study:

               1. Implant presenting Probing Depth ≥ 6 mm

               2. Radiographic implant bone loss more than 25% of the implant length (Apex of the
                  implant to implant platform) .

               3. Peri implant bone defect being a buccal dehiscence and semicircular bone
                  resorption to the middle of the implant body, buccal dehiscence and circular bone
                  resorption with lingual bone plate intact or circular bone resorption with buccal
                  and lingual bone plates intact

               4. Single tooth implant restoration or implant supported fixed partial denture.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects participating (currently or within 30 days prior to enrollment) in other
             clinical trials involving therapeutic intervention (either medical or dental).

          -  Subjects with poor oral hygiene as indicated by a score of greater than 50% on the
             O'Leary Plaque Index.

          -  Subjects with a systemic condition, which would preclude periodontal treatment,
             including but not limited to uncontrolled diabetes.

          -  Subjects with acute infectious lesions in the areas intended for treatment.

          -  Subjects taking chronic (i.e., &gt; 2 weeks), therapeutic doses of medications known to
             affect bone metabolism such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or
             bisphosphonates. Prophylactic aspirin (≤ 325 mg q.d.) for cardiovascular indications
             will be permitted in subjects.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or sexually-active female subjects who
             are of childbearing potential and are not using hormonal or barrier methods of birth
             control. (except for when a result of pregnancy test is negative)

          -  Subjects who are on any chronic antibiotic or steroidal therapy.

          -  Smoker using more than 10 cigarettes or equivalent per day.

          -  Smoker using cigar, smokeless tobacco use or e-cigarette.

          -  Subjects diagnosed with drug induced gingival hyperplasia (e.g. calcium channel
             blockers).

          -  Subjects with radiographic evidence of pathology in other areas of the mouth besides
             implant area to be treated.

          -  Implant mobility.

          -  Subjects with parafunctional habits and not wearing bite guard.
