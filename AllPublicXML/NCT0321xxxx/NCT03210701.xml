  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 21% of Canadians with HIV are unaware of their infection. There is a need to
      improve access to HIV testing to detect infections earlier so individuals can access care
      early and take steps to prevent transmission to others. Barriers to HIV testing include
      limited access or reluctance to go to traditional testing sites (doctor's offices and
      sexually transmitted infection clinics), and the lengthy wait time to receive test results
      from standard laboratory-based HIV testing (usually 1-2 weeks). These deterrents are
      particularly significant for those at highest risk of infection, who may be socially
      marginalized or stigmatized. In rural areas, HIV testing may only be available through
      doctor's offices and hospitals, yet many Canadians do not have access to a family physician.
      Pharmacists are among the most trusted and accessible healthcare providers, and are well
      positioned to improve access to HIV testing. Point of care tests for HIV are easy to
      administer and results are available within minutes, making them ideal for use in the
      community pharmacy setting. Point of care testing (POCT) by pharmacists can ensure
      individuals receive their test results, and facilitate timely linkages to care and treatment.
      This adaptation grant will look at factors influencing the acceptability and feasibility of
      pharmacist-provided rapid POCT for HIV in two Canadian provinces, including pharmacies in
      both urban and rural areas. The effectiveness of pharmacist-delivered POCT will be considered
      from a variety of perspectives including people living with or at risk of HIV, as well as
      pharmacists as the service providers.

      Background: There is a need to improve access to HIV testing to detect infections earlier so
      individuals can access care and prevent transmission. Barriers to testing include limited
      access or reluctance to go to traditional testing sites, and the lengthy wait time to receive
      results. Pharmacists are trusted, accessible health providers and are well positioned to
      offer HIV testing. Point of care tests (POCT) for HIV are easy to administer and results
      available within minutes, making them ideal for use in the pharmacy setting. HIV POCT may
      overcome barriers to standard testing for those at high risk and in healthcare
      resource-limited settings. Preliminary data suggest pharmacist-administered POCT can reach
      those who have never had an HIV test. Implementation and effectiveness of
      pharmacist-delivered POCT is the focus of this study. Study goals: To determine whether a
      multi-faceted HIV POCT program adapted for community pharmacies in two Canadian provinces is
      acceptable, feasible and effective in reaching those at high risk and those who have never
      been tested. Implementation and effectiveness of an integrated, contextualized model of HIV
      POCT in urban and rural pharmacies in Newfoundland (NL) and Alberta (AB) will be assessed.
      Participant characteristics, responses to satisfaction measures on the participant
      questionnaire, and pharmacist time to offer HIV POCT were analyzed using descriptive
      statistics. Pre-testing questionnaire data was used to calculate a Denver HIV Risk Score for
      each participant, as a means to predict their probability of having an undiagnosed HIV
      infection. ANOVA was used to assess differences in participants' Denver HIV Risk Scores
      between provinces, and urban versus rural testing sites, and multivariate analysis of
      variance (MANOVA) was used to assess differences in participant satisfaction with the testing
      experience based on province, urban/rural testing site, sex, and history of prior HIV
      testing. Fisher's Exact tests were used to assess whether history of prior HIV testing
      depended on province or urban/rural centre for testing. Qualitative data were analysed using
      a thematic analysis approach. Interview transcripts and extensive field notes were included
      for analysis from the participant interviews and pharmacist focus groups. Transcripts from
      participant interviews were coded using an open or emergent scheme where codes were developed
      and modified throughout the coding process. Descriptive codes were assigned to identify
      recurring concepts, and sub-themes were then identified and. Themes from the pharmacist focus
      groups were considered according to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour
      (COM-B) model to understand behaviour change, which considers opportunities and challenges in
      the context of professional capability, opportunity, and motivation to offer the HIV POCT
      program. Impact: This study will inform further modifications to the pharmacy HIV POCT model
      to optimize effectiveness and increase scalability prior to full adoption and implementation.
      This will form the basis for a subsequent grant application. Knowledge gained can be used to
      scale up effective testing programs to increase the number of high risk individuals getting
      tested. The pharmacy is a novel venue to offer HIV testing, and if successful could be a
      widely accessible option applicable to other provinces and other countries. This study will
      provide proof of concept for pharmacy based POCT for other sexually transmitted and
      blood-borne infections (STBBI) (once tests become available) and successful implementation
      may also lead to pharmacist-delivered pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programs, to further
      reduce HIV infection rates.

    <description>Once the testing was completed (see Outcome 3) prior to leaving, participants were asked to complete a de-identified, blinded questionnaire which assessed perception of the testing experience including factors that influenced their decision to be tested at the pharmacy &amp; whether they would have sought HIV testing elsewhere if not at the pharmacy.
Information was captured using a percentage continuous response scale from 0 to 100%. Participants were instructed to answer the questions by marking an &quot;x&quot; on the line at the point which represented their experience. For example, in response to the question &quot;How likely are you to buy a lottery ticket today?&quot;, the participant was instructed that if they were 50% certain, they would mark an &quot;x&quot; at the 50% notch on the line.
Questions were positively worded, with higher scores indicating higher agreement.
Not all patients answered all questions; reported data is based on the number of respondents for each question.</description>

    <description>Prior to initiating the testing process participants were asked to complete a de-identified, blinded questionnaire that included demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, relationship status, highest education attained, and income level) as well as information about HIV risk factors and previous HIV testing history.
Pre-testing questionnaire data on HIV risk factors was used to calculate a Denver HIV Risk Score (www.denverptc.org/resource.php?id=33) for each participant, as a means to predict their probability of having an undiagnosed HIV infection. Patients who score 30 points or greater on the Denver HIV Risk Score are considered at increased risk of undiagnosed HIV infection and should be offered routine screening.

        <title>Participant Satisfaction With Testing Experience</title>
        <description>Once the testing was completed (see Outcome 3) prior to leaving, participants were asked to complete a de-identified, blinded questionnaire which assessed perception of the testing experience including factors that influenced their decision to be tested at the pharmacy &amp; whether they would have sought HIV testing elsewhere if not at the pharmacy.
Information was captured using a percentage continuous response scale from 0 to 100%. Participants were instructed to answer the questions by marking an &quot;x&quot; on the line at the point which represented their experience. For example, in response to the question &quot;How likely are you to buy a lottery ticket today?&quot;, the participant was instructed that if they were 50% certain, they would mark an &quot;x&quot; at the 50% notch on the line.
Questions were positively worded, with higher scores indicating higher agreement.
Not all patients answered all questions; reported data is based on the number of respondents for each question.</description>

          <description>Once the testing was completed (see Outcome 3) prior to leaving, participants were asked to complete a de-identified, blinded questionnaire which assessed perception of the testing experience including factors that influenced their decision to be tested at the pharmacy &amp; whether they would have sought HIV testing elsewhere if not at the pharmacy.
Information was captured using a percentage continuous response scale from 0 to 100%. Participants were instructed to answer the questions by marking an &quot;x&quot; on the line at the point which represented their experience.

Pre-testing questionnaire data on HIV risk factors was used to calculate a Denver HIV Risk Score (www.denverptc.org/resource.php?id=33) for each participant, as a means to predict their probability of having an undiagnosed HIV infection. Patients who score 30 points or greater on the Denver HIV Risk Score are considered at increased risk of undiagnosed HIV infection and should be offered routine screening.
