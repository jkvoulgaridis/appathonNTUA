  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of single agent TAK-573
      in participants with relapsed/refractory MM in Phase 1, and to provide a preliminary
      evaluation of the clinical activity of TAK-573 as a single agent and in combination with
      dexamethasone in participants with relapsed/refractory MM in Phase 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-573 as single agent and in combination with
      dexamethasone. The study will determine the safety and tolerability of TAK-573 as single
      agent and in combination with dexamethasone in participants with relapsed/refractory MM. The
      study consists of 2 Phases, 1 and 2.

      The study will enroll approximately 51 and 100 participants in Phase 1 and 2 respectively.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups in each
      Phase:

        -  Phase 1 Schedule A: TAK-573 0.001 to 14 mg/kg

        -  Phase 1 Schedule B: TAK-573 TBD

        -  Phase 1 Schedule C: TAK-573 TBD

        -  Phase 1 Schedule D: TAK-573 TBD

        -  Phase 2: TAK-573 TBD

      The Phase 1 portion of the study will follow a 3+3 dose escalation design to evaluate
      once-weekly up to 4 different schedules of administration of TAK-573 starting at 0.001 mg/kg
      for DLT evaluation and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or an optimal biological
      dose (OBD) for assessments in Phase 2.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The maximum treatment
      duration in this study is up to 12 months and overall time to participate in the study is
      approximately up to 40 months. Participants will make 37 visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted every 12 weeks for post treatment follow-up. Participants will be followed up for
      survival until death, lost to follow-up, consent withdrawal, or study termination by the
      sponsor, whichever occurs first.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
