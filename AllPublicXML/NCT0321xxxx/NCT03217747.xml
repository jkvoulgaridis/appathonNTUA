      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of avelumab when given in different
      combinations with utomilumab, anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600, and radiation therapy in
      treating patients with malignancies that have spread to other places in the body.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, utomilumab, and anti-OX40
      antibody PF-04518600, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays
      to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. It is not yet known how well avelumab works in
      combination with these other anti-cancer therapies in patients with advanced malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For Arms D-F, to establish the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
      of different treatment combinations of avelumab when administered in combination with
      checkpoint agonist(s) with or without radiation in patients with metastatic solid tumors in
      order to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D).

      II. To correlate pre- and post-treatment CD8 expression with clinical benefit (complete
      response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD] for &gt; 6 months).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the different treatment combinations in patients with
      metastatic solid tumors by assessing objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST).

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of the different treatment combinations in patients with
      metastatic solid tumors by assessing progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response
      (DOR), and overall survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To understand the mechanism of action of the avelumab plus an immune modulator
      combination, as well as potential mechanisms of resistance.

      II. To characterize the effect of avelumab combinations on immune biomarkers in peripheral
      blood and tumor tissue obtained from subjects pre- and post-treatment.

      III. To compare the response in irradiated versus non-irradiated lesions in Arms D-F.

      IV. To investigate immune biomarkers that are potentially predictive of response and
      resistance with the combination of avelumab and an immune modulator.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 6 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive utomilumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle
      and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      each cycle and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      each cycle, utomilumab over 60 minutes on day 1, and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1
      and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM D: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days -14 to -1. Patients receive avelumab IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of beginning day 15 of cycle 1 and utomilumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM E: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days -14 to -1. Patients receive avelumab IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1 and anti-OX40 antibody
      PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15, and. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM F: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days -14 to -1. Patients receive avelumab IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1, utomilumab IV over 60 minutes
      on day 1, and anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 IV on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up at 30 days and then every
      12 weeks.

          -  Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation.

          -  Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

          -  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening (positive
             HBV surface antigen or HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) if anti-HCV antibody screening test
             positive).

          -  Vaccination (live attenuated virus) within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and
             while on trials is prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines.

          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 Grade &gt; 1); however,
             alopecia, sensory neuropathy grade =&lt; 2, or other grade =&lt; 2 not constituting a safety
             risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including colitis, inflammatory bowel
             disease, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent
             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             entry into this study.

          -  Medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with the patient's
             participation in the study or evaluation of the study results.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Men whose partner is a woman of child-bearing potential, (i.e. biologically able to
             conceive), and who is not employing two forms of highly effective contraception.
             Highly effective contraception (e.g. male condom with spermicide, diaphragm with
             spermicide, intra-uterine device) must be used by both sexes during the study and must
             be continued for 90 days after the end of study treatment. Women of child-bearing
             potential is defined as sexually mature women who are not surgically sterile or who
             have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (e.g., who
             has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          -  A diagnosis of active scleroderma, lupus, or other rheumatologic disease which in the
             opinion of the treating radiation oncologist precludes safe radiation therapy.

          -  Has had prior radiation therapy within the past 3 months where the high dose area of
             the prior radiation would overlap with the high dose area of the intended radiation
             based on the judgement of the treatment oncologist.
