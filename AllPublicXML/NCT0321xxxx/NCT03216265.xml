  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this POC clinical study is to investigate the impact of the test product
      (Developmental Cosmetic Moisturising Cream) on skin barrier function and skin moisturisation
      on the forearm and face after 4 weeks of twice daily application compared to no treatment in
      participants with dry sensitive skin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Areas on the volar forearm and each side of the face, will be selected for measurements of
      transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and corneometry to be conducted . A physical challenge and a
      regression period of 5 days is also included to evaluate skin barrier function and
      moisturisation.

      A regression period of 5 days (Days 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34) of no study product use following
      the 4 week treatment phase is also included to evaluate skin barrier function and
      moisturisation.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Measurements on Day 29, Test Product Treated Versus (vs.) Untreated Sites on the Forearm</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 seconds (sec), to ensure that a stable value has been established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 secs were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Corneometry on the Forearm and Face, Test Product Treated vs. Untreated Sites</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Day 1 (30 minutes and 6 hours post study product application), Day 2, 15, and 29</time_frame>
    <description>Corneometry was used to measure moisture content of stratum corneum using corneometer. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allows the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content. The Corneometer measurements was taken 5 times in total and then an average reading was calculated for each site and time point. An increase in corneometry values indicates an increase in the hydration status of the skin and vice versa.</description>

    <description>The protein content of each D-Squame disc was analysed using a SquameScan. SquameScan is the instrument used to indirectly measure the protein content extracted from the skin by D-squame tape strips. The determination was performed by measuring the optical absorption of the strip at about 850 nanometres (nm) (infrared light). The value displayed in % was proportionally related to the protein content. The protein content was analysed for each of the discs obtained the D-Squame stripping on the forearms and reported to 2 decimal places.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Measurements on Day 29, Test Product Treated Versus (vs.) Untreated Sites on the Forearm</title>
        <description>TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 seconds (sec), to ensure that a stable value has been established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 secs were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Measurements on Day 29, Test Product Treated vs. Untreated Sites on the Face</title>
        <description>TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 secs, to ensure that a stable value has been established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 secs were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Corneometry on the Forearm and Face, Test Product Treated vs. Untreated Sites</title>
        <description>Corneometry was used to measure moisture content of stratum corneum using corneometer. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allows the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content. The Corneometer measurements was taken 5 times in total and then an average reading was calculated for each site and time point. An increase in corneometry values indicates an increase in the hydration status of the skin and vice versa.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) on the Forearm and Face, Test Product Treated vs. Untreated Sites at Day 2 and 15</title>
        <description>TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 secs, to ensure that a stable value has been established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 secs were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

        <title>Standardised Area Under Curve (AUC1-29) of Change From Baseline in Corneometry Over Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Standardised AUC1-29 was calculated for each participant for change from baseline in corneometry on forearms and face over the treatment period; i.e. up to Day 29 using the trapezoidal rule and dividing by the number of days in the period. Corneometry was used to measure moisture content of stratum corneum using corneometer. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allows the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content. The Corneometer measurements was taken 5 times in total and then an average reading was calculated for each site and time point. An increase in corneometry values indicates an increase in the hydration status of the skin and vice versa.</description>

        <title>Change From Pre-challenge in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Measurements of D-Squame Discs Following 4, 8 and 12 Adhesive Discs Removal From Skin of Both Test Product Treated and Untreated Sites on the Forearm on Day 29</title>
        <description>A series of D-Squame discs were gently smoothed over the designated D-Squame Areas by applying a uniform pressure for 5 secs with a stamp to ensure consistent adhesion to the skin. Each disc was pulled off the skin with one fluent and decisive movement. There were maximum of 12 D-Squame discs (in groups of 4) removed from each forearm repeatedly. TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 secs, to ensure that a stable value has been established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 secs were averaged as the actual measurement values. TEWL was measured pre-challenge and after 4, 8 and 12 discs have been removed from the forearms. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

        <title>Protein Analysis (SquameScan) of D-Squame Discs (Total of 12 Adhesive Discs) From Skin of Both Test Product Treated and Untreated Sites on the Forearm on Day 29</title>
        <description>The protein content of each D-Squame disc was analysed using a SquameScan. SquameScan is the instrument used to indirectly measure the protein content extracted from the skin by D-squame tape strips. The determination was performed by measuring the optical absorption of the strip at about 850 nanometres (nm) (infrared light). The value displayed in % was proportionally related to the protein content.

          <description>The protein content of each D-Squame disc was analysed using a SquameScan. SquameScan is the instrument used to indirectly measure the protein content extracted from the skin by D-squame tape strips. The determination was performed by measuring the optical absorption of the strip at about 850 nanometres (nm) (infrared light). The value displayed in % was proportionally related to the protein content. The protein content was analysed for each of the discs obtained the D-Squame stripping on the forearms and reported to 2 decimal places.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Measurements on Days 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 in Test Product Treated vs. Untreated Sites on the Forearm and Face</title>
        <description>TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 secs, to ensure that a stable value was established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 secs were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

        <title>Change From Day 29 in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Measurements on Days 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 in Test Product Treated vs. Untreated Sites on the Forearm and Face</title>
        <description>TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 secs, to ensure that a stable value was established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 secs were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Standardised Area Under Curve (AUCday 29-34) of Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Over Regression Period (Days 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34) of Forearm and Face, Test Product Treated vs. Untreated Sites</title>
        <description>Standardised AUCday29-34 was calculated for each participant for change from baseline in TEWL on forearms and face over the regression period (Day31, 32, 33 and 34) using the trapezoidal rule and dividing by the number of days in the period. TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 secs, to ensure that a stable value was established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 secs were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Standardised Area Under Curve (AUCday 29-34) of Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Over Regression Period (Days 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34) of Forearm and Face, Test Product Treated vs. Untreated Sites</title>
          <description>Standardised AUCday29-34 was calculated for each participant for change from baseline in TEWL on forearms and face over the regression period (Day31, 32, 33 and 34) using the trapezoidal rule and dividing by the number of days in the period. TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 secs, to ensure that a stable value was established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 secs were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>
          <population>Analysis population was ITT (N=65) population included all participants who were randomized into the study and had at least one post-baseline clinical assessment available. Here, number analyzed signifies participants with available data for each specified category.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Corneometry Measurements on Days 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 in Test Product Treated Site vs. Untreated Site on the Forearm and Face</title>
        <description>Corneometry was used to measure the moisture content of stratum corneum using corneometer. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allows the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content. The Corneometer measurements were taken 5 times in total and then an average reading was calculated for each site and time point. An increase in corneometry values indicates an increase in the hydration status of the skin and vice versa.</description>

        <title>Change From Day 29 in Corneometry Measurements on Days 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 in Test Product Treated Site vs. Untreated Site on the Forearm and Face</title>
        <description>Corneometry was used to measure the moisture content of stratum corneum using corneometer. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allows the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content. The Corneometer measurements were taken 5 times in total and then an average reading was calculated for each site and time point. An increase in corneometry values indicates an increase in the hydration status of the skin and vice versa.</description>

        <title>Standardised Area Under Curve (AUCday29-34) Calculated Using Change From Baseline in Corneometry Over Regression Period (Days 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34) on the Forearm and Face</title>
        <description>Standardised AUCday29-34 was calculated for each participant for change from baseline in corneometry on forearms and face over the regression period using the trapezoidal rule and dividing by the number of days in the period. Corneometry was used to measure moisture content of stratum corneum using corneometer. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allows the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content. The Corneometer measurements was taken 5 times in total and then an average reading was calculated for each site and time point. An increase in corneometry values indicates an increase in the hydration status of the skin and vice versa.</description>

        <description>TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 secs, to ensure that a stable value has been established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 seconds were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>
