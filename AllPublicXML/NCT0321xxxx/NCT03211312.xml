  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to investigate the relevant risk factors of perioperation complications or
      mortality in older patients with cardiac diseases undergoing teeth extraction surgery and
      this study aims to quantify the risk factors and then to establish the predictive scoring
      systems.

      Hypothesis:Preoperative parameters could predict postoperative complications.

      This study intends to investigate the relevant risk factors of perioperative complications or
      mortality in older patients with cardiac diseases undergoing teeth extraction surgery and
      this study aims to quantify the risk factors and then to establish the predictive scoring
      systems.

      We hope that the benefits will include less patients becoming seriously postoperative
      complications and mortality after teeth extraction surgery.We also hope the information will
      help doctors understand the preoperative risks better and therefore make better informed
      decisions.This may also reduce the overall cost of surgery for patients and hospitals.
