      Subjects will undergo a 7±1 day outpatient, standard therapy phase during which sensor and
      insulin data will be collected. Subjects or their caregivers will manage their diabetes at
      home per their usual routine using the study CGM and remain on current MDI or pump therapy.
      This will be followed by a 5-day/4-night or from approximately 48 to 72 hours for children
      ages 2.0-5.9 years, hybrid closed-loop phase conducted in a supervised hotel/rental house
      setting.

      The study schedule will consist of a standard therapy data collection week followed by a
      hybrid closed-loop phase.

      Subjects will undergo a 7±1 day outpatient, standard therapy phase during which sensor and
      insulin data will be collected. Subjects or their caregivers will manage their diabetes at
      home per their usual routine using the study CGM and remain on current MDI or pump therapy.
      This will be followed by a 5-day/4-night or from approximately 48 to 72 hours for children
      ages 2.0-5.9 years, hybrid closed-loop phase conducted in a supervised hotel/rental house
      setting.

      The hybrid closed-loop phase will begin prior to lunch on Study Day 1.

      During the hybrid closed-loop phase, subjects will participate in specific setpoint
      challenges, meal challenges, and exercise.

      Hybrid closed-loop will be discontinued approximately 5 hours after breakfast time on Study
      Day 5. Subjects will be asked to complete a post-study questionnaire regarding their
      experience with the system. Subjects will be discharged home when stable and all discharge
      criteria are met. Subjects will consume a snack or meal after discontinuation of hybrid
      closed-loop before they leave the study site.
