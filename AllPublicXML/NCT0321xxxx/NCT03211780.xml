  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using the analysis of group velocity for a screening application and then higher order
      analysis based on the elastic and viscious components of the shear modulus may allow
      discrimination between extent of tumor invasion through the esophageal wall if appropriately
      correlated with pathological findings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Use of ultrasound-based vibrometry in this setting would allow for a relatively simple study
      and translation of clinical practice, as the same devices are already used in this setting,
      and operators have familiarity with the equipment. Incorporating another additional method to
      generate contrast for determining malignant tissue from normal based on biomechanical
      properties with the same probe would have benefit as an additional diagnostic modality.
