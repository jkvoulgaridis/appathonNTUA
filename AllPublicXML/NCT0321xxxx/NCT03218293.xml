  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPC) is suggested to protect the cerebral cell against
      ischemia in various settings. However, the effect of RIPC in patients with acute ischemic
      stroke who undergo thrombolysis has yet to be examined. In this single-center, randomized
      controlled trial, we examined the effect of RIPC on the resolution of nerve function
      deficient in response to thrombolysis. Patients in the RIPC group had five cycles of 5‑min
      cuff inflation followed by 3‑min deflation to the bilateral upper arm after thrombolysis. The
      primary endpoint was the recovery of nerve function deficient assessed by National Institutes
      of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS), Activities of Daily Living(ADL), Modified Rankin Scale(mRS),
      CT cerebral perfusion imaging (CTP) and CT angiography(CTA). Secondary endpoints included the
      following: angiogenesis assessed by the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).
