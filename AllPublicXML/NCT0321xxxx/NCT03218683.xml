    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, sequential group, dose-escalation
      study to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of
      ascending doses of AZD5991 in subjects with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies.

      Part 1 of the study is monotherapy dose escalation. Part 2 of the study is monotherapy
      expansion groups for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), AML/
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and multiple myeloma (MM) Part 3 is a sequential,
      dose-escalation study of the combination of AZD5991 and venetoclax in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory AML/MDS
