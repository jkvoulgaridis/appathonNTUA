  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer related fatigue (CRF) is a stressful and constant tiredness related to cancer and/or
      its treatment. CRF is the most intense during treatment and can severely interfere with
      activities of daily living, such as tasks that require physical strength or thinking clearly.
      Prevalence of CRF has been reported to be as high as 94% during chemotherapy and as high as
      34% five years after completion of treatment (Rotonda et al. 2013; Minton &amp; Stone 2008).
      There is currently no generally-accepted treatment for CRF. However, there is evidence to
      suggest that light therapy can help with CRF. Non-pharmacological interventions for CRF have
      also been studied but are costly to implement and involve significant patient burden,
      particularly among those in active treatment. Given the clinical impact of CRF, the goal of
      this project is to investigate a novel, low-cost and low-burden intervention for Breast
      Cancer patients using a particular kind of light treatment called systematic light exposure
      (sLE) to treat CRF. Two hundred forty-eight breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing adjuvant
      or neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be recruited from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,
      and City of Hope. The light will be administered by light glasses daily throughout entire
      duration of chemotherapy. Outcomes will be assessed at eight timepoints during chemo, and a
      series of follow up assessments at 1 week, 1-month, 3-months and 6-months post-chemotherapy.
      This study will have major public health relevance as it will determine if an
      easy-to-deliver, inexpensive, and low patient burden intervention effectively reduces CRF or
      prevents it from worsening during chemotherapy. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine if sLE
      prevents CRF from worsening in BC patients undergoing chemotherapy Aim 2: Determine whether
      sLE affects sleep, depression and circadian activity rhythms. Exploratory Aim 3: Investigate
      sLE normalizes circadian cortisol rhythms. Exploratory Aim 4: Examine whether the effects of
      sLE on fatigue are moderated/mediated by sleep quality, depression, and/or circadian rhythms.

    <measure>FACIT-Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-Fatigue Scale - The FACIT-Fatigue scale will be used both for selection of patients into the study and as an outcome measure of fatigue. Smith et al. (1999) report that this 13 item scale has excellent test-retest reliability (r = 0.90) and internal consistency reliability (alpha = 0.93-0.95). In addition, criterion related validity studies using objective measures of physical function as the outcome show that patient reported fatigue based on the FACIT- Fatigue can predict these objective measures. This measure is the main tool for measuring fatigue in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative. Cella (personal communication) has indicated that a FACIT-Fatigue score equal to or less than 33 constitutes clinically significant fatigue.</description>

    <measure>The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) - This 20 item self-report adult instrument is designed to measure common symptoms of depression that have occurred over the past week such as poor appetite, hopelessness, pessimism, and fatigue. Internal consistency using coefficient alpha is estimated to be 0.85 for the general, healthy population, and 0.90 among depressed patient samples.</description>

    <measure>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index consists of 19 self-rated items. Scale reliability is excellent using both an internal consistency criterion (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.85). The validity of the instrument is based on its ability to discriminate patients (those having either sleep problems and/or depressive symptoms) from controls (healthy participants without sleep complaints).</description>
