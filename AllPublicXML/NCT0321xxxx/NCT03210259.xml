  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to assess the PK similarity between patients receiving
      Humira® continuously vs those who alternate between BI 695501 and Humira®, in patients with
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to descriptively compare the safety,
      immunogenicity and efficacy profiles between patients receiving Humira® continuously vs those
      who alternate between BI 695501 and Humira®.

    <time_frame>At week 32</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is an established measure of clinical efficacy for psoriasis medications. The PASI is a tool which provides a numeric scoring for patients' overall psoriasis disease state, with scores ranging from 0 to 72. It is a linear combination of percent of surface area of skin that is affected and the severity of erythema, induration, and desquamation over four body regions (head, trunk, upper extremities and lower extremities). Higher PASI scores indicate more severe psoriasis. PASI is generally summarized as a dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an X percent(%) reduction from baseline (or PASIX), where X is 50, 75, 90, and 100. Results are reported for percentage of patients with a PASI75 response at Week 32. Analysis was done on per-protocol analysis set (PPS).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With a Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) Score ≤ 1 (Clear or Almost Clear) at Week 32</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 32</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is a 5-point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the physician's assessment of the average thickness, erythema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions. The assessment is considered &quot;static&quot;, which refers to the patient's disease state at the time of the assessments, without comparison to any of the patient's previous disease states (dynamic), whether at baseline or at a previous visit. A lower score indicates less body coverage and a higher score indicates more severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe). Results are reported for percentage of patients with a sPGA score of ≤ 1 (clear or almost clear) at Week 32. Analysis was done on per-protocol analysis set (PPS).</description>

             moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis (with or without psoriatic arthritis) for
             at least 6 months before the first administration of trial drug (a self-reported
             diagnosis confirmed by the Investigator is acceptable), and which has been stable per
             Investigator opinion for the last 2 months with no changes in morphology or
             significant flares at both screening and baseline:

               -  involved body surface area (BSA) ≥ 10% and

               -  PASI score ≥ 12 and

             when used consistently and correctly during the trial and for 6 months following
             completion or discontinuation from the trial medication. A list of contraception
             methods meeting these criteria is provided in patient information.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice
             (GCP) and local legislation prior to admission to the trial.

          -  Patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy according to
             Investigator judgement.

        Exclusion criteria

             evaluations according to Investigator's judgment.

          -  Prior exposure to any biologic therapies for any auto-immune diseases (eg: RA,
             Psoriasis, Crohns Disease, etc).

          -  Patients with a significant disease other than psoriasis and/or a significant
             uncontrolled disease (such as, but not limited to, nervous system, renal, hepatic,
             endocrine, hematological, autoimmune or gastrointestinal disorders). A significant
             disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may (i) put
             the patient at risk because of participation in the trial, or (ii) influence the
             results of the trial, or (iii) cause concern regarding the patient's ability to
             participate in the trial.

          -  Major surgery (major according to the Investigator's assessment) performed within 12
             weeks before enrollment or planned within 6 months after screening, e.g., total hip
             replacement.

          -  Any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years
             prior to screening, except appropriately treated (in the opinion of the Investigator)

             considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the trial.

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial, or less than 30
             days (or less than 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) since ending another
             investigational device or drug trial(s), or receiving other investigational
             treatment(s).

          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion,
             makes the patient an unreliable trial subject or unlikely to complete the trial.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant during the course of
             this trial or within the period at least 6 months following completion or
             discontinuation from the trial medication.

          -  Forms of psoriasis (e.g., pustular, erythrodermic and guttate) other than chronic
             plaque psoriasis. Drug-induced psoriasis (i.e., new onset or current exacerbation from

          -  Primary or secondary immunodeficiency (history of, or currently active), including
             known history of HIV infection or a positive HIV test at screening (per the
             Investigator discretion and where mandated by local authorities).

          -  Known chronic or relevant acute TB; IGRA TB test or PPD skin test will be performed
             according to the labelling for Humira®. If the result is positive, patients may
             participate in the trial if further work up (according to local practice/guidelines)
             establishes conclusively that the patient has no evidence of active TB. If latent TB
             is confirmed, then treatment must have been initiated before treatment in the study
             and continued according to local country guidelines.

          -  Known clinically significant (per Investigator opinion) coronary artery disease,
             significant cardiac arrhythmias, moderate to severe congestive heart failure (New York

          -  Any treatment (including biologic therapies) that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may place the patient at unacceptable risk during the trial.

          -  Known active infection of any kind (excluding fungal infections of nail beds), any
             major episode of infection requiring hospitalisation or treatment with intravenous
             (i.v.) antiinfectives within 4 weeks of the Screening Visit or completion of oral
             anti-infectives within 2 weeks of the Screening Visit.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 times upper
             limit of normal (ULN) at screening.
