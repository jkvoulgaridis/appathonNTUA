      This is a Phase I/II clinical study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AZD2811 monotherapy or with
      combination agent(s) in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients or
      treatment-naïve AML patients not eligible for intensive induction therapy. The study will
      also explore the potential clinical activity by assessing anti-tumour activity in patients.
      The study will be conducted in two parts, designated Part A, dose escalation, and Part B,
      dose expansion. Patients will be enrolled in either Part A or Part B according to the
      Investigator's judgment of the most appropriate treatment for the individual patient and slot
      availability.

      Part A - Dose Escalation

      Arm 1 - Day 1 and 4 monotherapy dose escalation:

      Approximately 48 evaluable treatment-naïve AML patients not eligible for intensive induction
      therapy or relapsed/refractory AML patients will be enrolled in Arm 1 and Arm 2 of the
      monotherapy escalation in Part A of this study.

      The dose escalation and de-escalation plan for evaluating AZD2811 will follow the Bayesian
      Adaptive Design scheme which combines prior expectations about the dose toxicity relationship
      and applies the data at the end of each cohort to recommend a dose and schedule for the next
      cohort. The total number of patients will depend upon the number of dose escalations,
      de-escalations, and schedule changes necessary. At least 3 and up to 6 evaluable patients
      will be required for each dose cohort.

      Patients will receive a single 2- or 4- hour IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 4 of each 28-day
      cycle. Dosing frequency and schedule may be adjusted during the study on the basis of
      emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data.

      Arm 2 - Day 1, 4, 15, and 18 monotherapy dose escalation:

      A Day 1, 4, 15, and 18 every 4 weeks or 28 days (Q4W) schedule will be investigated in Arm 2.
      The proposed starting dose for this schedule is 300 mg/infusion AZD2811 on Day 1, 4, 15 and
      18 (i.e. cumulative dose 1200 mg/Q4W). This starting dose is less than daily doses shown to
      be tolerated in the AML setting, and the cumulative cycle dose/Q4W does not exceed the
      highest dose shown to be tolerated (600 mg/infusion Day 1, 4 cumulative 1200 mg Q4W).

      Combination Escalation:

      AZD2811 can be escalated (in the combination setting) independent of the monotherapy dose
      explored, after thorough examination of the available safety data. The combination therapy
      exploration will not impact the dose to be further explored in the monotherapy setting nor
      will the monotherapy impact the dose in the combination setting. As such, the number of
      cohorts in the monotherapy setting can differ from the number of cohorts in the combination
      setting. The safety observations of the monotherapy will be considered by the Safety Review
      Committee (SRC) in the overall decision-making process for subsequent dose exploration
      decision.

      Azacitidine Combination:

      A starting dose of 400 mg of AZD2811 will be used for investigation in combination with the
      standard dose of the hypomethylating agent (HMA) azacitidine. In this dose escalation part,
      approximately 12-15 evaluable treatment-naïve AML patients not eligible for intensive
      induction therapy or relapsed/refractory AML will be enrolled and dosed in ascending doses of
      AZD2811 and standard dose of azacitidine at 75 mg/m² subcutaneously (SC) in all territories
      or optionally/alternatively by IV in the United States (US) as per national prescribing
      information.

      AZD2811 will be administered over 2 hours for doses up to and including 600 mg and over 4
      hours for doses exceeding 600 mg on Days 1 and 4 of each 28-day cycle. Patients will receive
      75 mg/m² of azacitidine on Days 1 through 7 or for 5 consecutive weekdays (Days 1 through 5)
      with a treatment holiday on the two weekend days (Days 6 and 7), and azacitidine dosing on
      the first 2 weekdays of the next week (Days 8 and 9) of each 28-day cycle.

      A rolling 6 design will be applied to the AZD2811 + HMA combination group which allows
      accrual of 3 to 6 patients concurrently onto a dose level based on the numbers of patients
      who are currently enrolled and evaluable, who experience a DLT, and who remain at risk of
      developing a DLT.

      Venetoclax Combination:

      Approximately 18-21 evaluable relapsed/refractory AML patients will be enrolled and dosed
      with AZD2811 and venetoclax. In cohort 1v, AZD2811 will be administered at 200 mg IV on Days
      1 and 4 every 28 days (Q4W) and venetoclax will be given 100 mg orally (PO) on Day 1 and 200
      mg (PO) with a meal and water on Days 2- 28 for the 1st cycle. The third patient in cohort 1
      (AZD2811 at 200 mg) will only be enrolled after the first 2 patients have received ≥ 2 weeks
      of treatment and have shown no evidence of toxicity observed to be compatible with a DLT, and
      further dose escalations of AZD2811 will occur at the discretion of the Safety Review
      Committee (SRC)

      The dose of AZD2811 can be escalated (in the combination setting) independent of the
      monotherapy dose explored, after thorough examination of the available safety data of the
      current and the previous cohorts. The combination therapy exploration will not impact the
      dose further explored in the monotherapy setting nor will the monotherapy impact the dose in
      the combination setting. As such, the number of cohorts in the monotherapy setting can differ
      from the number of cohorts in the combination setting. The safety observations of the
      monotherapy will be considered by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) in the overall
      decision-making process for subsequent dose exploration decision.

      Part B - Dose Expansion

      Part B will include up to 80 treatment-naïve AML patients not eligible for intensive
      induction therapy at the MTD in AZD2811 monotherapy (Group 1, 40 patients) and AZD2811 the
      combination setting (Group 2, 40 patients) in order to further explore the tolerability, PK
      and clinical activity at this dose.

             diseases (e.g., severe hepatic impairment, interstitial lung disease [bilateral,
             diffuse, parenchymal lung disease]); or other malignancy (like advanced malignant
             hepatic tumours); b) current unstable or uncompensated respiratory or cardiac
             conditions; c) uncontrolled hypertension; d) history of, or active, bleeding diatheses
             (e.g., haemophilia or von Willebrand disease); e) patients with inflammatory bowel
             disease (e.g., Crohn's or colitis ulcerosa); uncontrolled active systemic fungal,
             bacterial, viral, or other infection (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms
             related to the infection and without improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or
             other treatment); or f) IV anti-infective treatment within 2 weeks before first dose
             of study treatment unless clear evidence would indicate that despite the clinical
             symptoms no infection took place.

             excluding stable plaque psoriasis from the definition of active disease). Patients
             with a rash that is biopsy-proven leukaemia or with pressure ulcers are not excluded.
             Patients with petechiae from thrombocytopenia or patients with drug related rashes
             that are improving are not excluded.

          7. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol (Combination
             patients only).

                  to have a negative PCR result before enrolment. Those who are hepatitis B surface
                  antigen positive or hepatitis B polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive will be
                  excluded.

               -  Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR
                  result before enrolment. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded.

        Additional exclusion criteria - venetoclax combination:

          1. WBC count ≤ 25,000 cells/mm³ (25 x 10 exp 9/L); use of leukapheresis or hydroxyurea
             (48 hours) before venetoclax initiation is allowed to achieve this entry criterion.

          2. AML with known active central nervous system involvement.

          3. Chronic respiratory disease that requires continuous oxygen use.

          4. Previous venetoclax exposure that ended due to venetoclax toxicity.
