      The purpose of this 24-week study is to evaluate the impact of recovery coach intervention on
      rates of treatment retention, illicit opioid use, and readmission among hospitalized patients
      newly initiated on buprenorphine or methadone compared to the control intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) frequently utilize hospitals due to soft tissue
      infections and other conditions that require inpatient level of care. Prior studies have
      indicated that OUD patients are often amenable to initiating buprenorphine treatment and can
      be successfully linked to outpatient treatment. However, hospitalized OUD patients initiated
      on buprenorphine have much lower treatment retention rates at 6-months compared to OUD
      patients initiating treatment in the outpatient setting. As such, there is a great need to
      identify strategies to improve treatment retention in this patient population. There is a
      growing body of evidence for the benefits of recovery coaches, who provide peer-delivered
      support services in the community. Tracing their origin to mutual support groups to
      supplement traditional clinical services, recovery coaches are individuals with lived
      experience of recovery. Studies of recovery coaches have demonstrated greater treatment
      retention, reduced substance use, and reduced inpatient utilization. However, no prior
      studies have examined the impact of recovery coaches in improving medication-assisted
      treatment retention. As such, the aim of this 24-week study is to evaluate the impact of
      recovery coach intervention on rates of treatment retention, illicit opioid use, and
      readmission among hospitalized patients newly initiated on buprenorphine or methadone
      compared to the control intervention. Patients who are successfully initiated on
      buprenorphine or methadone, and are willing to engage in treatment after discharge, will be
      eligible to enroll. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24
      weeks.
