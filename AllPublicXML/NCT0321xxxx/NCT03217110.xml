      The purpose of this study is to examine whether cerebellar stimulation can be used to improve
      cognitive deficits and mood in patients with schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder,
      Parkinson's disease, and major depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our recent work found that patients with Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia have impaired
      frontal EEG rhythms in the theta and delta range (1-8 Hz).We have been using transcranial
      direct current stimulation to recover these rhythms as patients perform elementary cognitive
      tasks. We found that although we are able to modulate cerebellar and frontal activity with
      tDCS, this effect is minimal as the depth of the current is not great enough to modulate all
      cerebellar activity. Here we use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to modulate neural
      activity in the frontal cortex and recover cognitive function in patients with autism,
      schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease.

      The purpose of the study is to explore cerebellar stimulation as a potential new treatment to
      restore frontal activity and cognitive function in autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder
      and Parkinson's disease.Subjects will be brought in for 5 to 6 separate visits, with
      cerebellar or sham TMS stimulation twice per day for 5 days, as well as 3 follow-up
      visits.During these visits the patient will have cognitive, disease-specific and emotional
      testing, including EEG testing and MRI imaging. For those participants that received sham
      stimulation we will again use EEG to record how single pulses of magnetic or electrical
      stimulation influences other regions of the cerebellum and downstream brain regions. These
      data will provide insight into how the cerebellum may influence downstream brain regions and
      play a role in cognitive and motor performance. All data will be analyzed offline to
      determine if performance on the interval timing task and/or frontal brain rhythms change
      following transcranial magnetic stimulation as compared to the pre-stimulation blocks of
      trials. Additionally, we will analyze changes in their cognitive function, symptom ratings,
      functional and structural MRI, and mood following stimulation. Controls will receive both
      active and sham treatment for comparison.
