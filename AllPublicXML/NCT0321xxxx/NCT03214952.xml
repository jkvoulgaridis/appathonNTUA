      The drug being tested in this survey is called vonoprazan. Vonoprazan is being tested to
      treat patients who have gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, and reflux esophagitis.

      This survey will look at the safety and effectiveness of vonoprazan in patients with gastric
      ulcer, duodenal ulcer, and reflux esophagitis in the routine clinical setting. The survey
      will enroll approximately 3000 participants.

      - Vonoprazan 20 mg

      This multi-center survey will be conducted in Japan.

For reflux esophagitis, the usual adult dosage for oral use was administered for a total of 4 weeks of treatment, and if that dosing proved insufficient, the administration may have been extended, but for no longer than 8 weeks of treatment. Participants received vonoprazan as part of a routine medical care.</description>
