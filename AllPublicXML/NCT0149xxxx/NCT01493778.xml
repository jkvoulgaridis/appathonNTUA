    <description>The haemostatic effect of turoctocog alfa was summarised by frequency tables containing count of all bleeds and assessed on a predefined four point scale: Excellent, Good, Moderate and None. The analysis was based on the total number of bleeds and their response to treatment. The analysis was performed for the main phase (from Visit 2 to Visit 5 [50-55 exposure day], extension phase (from Visit 6 to end of trial; exposure day 100, expected to occur between 6 and 48 months of trial participation), the combined main and extension phase (from Visit 2 to end of trial) and for the inhibitor cohort.</description>

    <description>Annualised bleeding rate defined as number of bleeds in total per patient per year following treatment were estimated by a Poisson model allowing for over-dispersion. The Poisson estimate is presented with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The analysis was performed for the main phase (from Visit 2 to Visit 5 [50-55 exposure day], extension phase (from Visit 6 to end of trial; exposure day 100, expected to occur between 6 and 48 months of trial participation), the combined main and extension phase (from Visit 2 to end of trial) and for the inhibitor cohort.</description>

    <description>The number of injections of turoctocog alfa (N8) required per bleed was calculated as the number of injections of turoctocog alfa used in the time period from start of the bleed to stop of the bleed. The mean number of turoctocog alfa injections required to stop the bleed is presented. The analysis was based on the total number of bleeds. The analysis was performed for the main phase (from Visit 2 to Visit 5 [50-55 exposure day], extension phase (from Visit 6 to end of trial; exposure day 100, expected to occur between 6 and 48 months of trial participation), the combined main and extension phase (from Visit 2 to end of trial) and for the inhibitor cohort.</description>

    <description>The caregivers/parent reported treatment satisfaction is assessed by the parents using the haemophilia satisfaction questionnaire (HEMO-SAT). The questionnaire contained questions related to treatment that covered 6 domains (ease and convenience, efficacy, burden, specialist, centre and general satisfaction). Adults completing the questionnaire could achieve a score from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting greater treatment satisfaction. The scale range for each of the 6 domains was 0-100 with lower scores reflecting greater treatment satisfaction.
The scores of the domains at visit 3 (10th-15th ED), visit 5 (50th-55th ED) and end of trial (EoT) are presented.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at 40 sites in 15 countries: Algeria (1 site), Austria (2 sites), China (6 sites), Denmark (1 site), Greece (2 sites), Hong Kong (1 site), Hungary (1 site), Japan (2 sites), Lithuania (1 site), Poland (2 sites), Russian Federation (2 sites), Serbia (1 site), Spain (3 sites), Turkey (3 sites), United States (12).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Sixty (60) participants were enrolled in the trial and received at least one dose of turoctocog alfa.The trial consisted of two phases: the main phase including the screening visit (visit 1) and 4 subsequent visits, and an extension phase with a rolling visit schedule consisting of 6 planned visits including 4 dispensing visits) per year.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Turoctocog Alfa (N8) (Preventive+On-demand Treatment)</title>
          <description>Participants received turoctocog alfa doses of 15−60 IU/kg body weight (BW) administered as an intravenous injection for the prevention of bleeding. The investigator decided what dose of turoctocog alfa to give based on the participant's clinical profile. Participants who enrolled into the trial initiated the preventive treatment no later than their second birthday or after a maximum of 2 bleeding episodes requiring treatment, whichever came first. The trial consisted of two phases. In the main phase, an aggregated number of at least 50 participants received preventive treatment with turoctocog alfa until they reached a minimum of 50 exposure days (ED) or until they developed inhibitors. After that the participants continued in the extension phase where at least 50 participants achieved at least 100 ED, which translated into a maximum trial duration of up to 5 years (including any potential inhibitor treatment). The estimated total duration of the trial was approximately 7 years.</description>

          <title>Turoctocog Alfa (N8) (Preventive+On-demand)</title>
          <description>Participants received turoctocog alfa doses of 15−60 IU/kg body weight (BW) administered as an intravenous injection for the prevention of bleeding. The investigator decided what dose of turoctocog alfa to give based on the participant's clinical profile. Participants who enrolled into the trial initiated the preventive treatment no later than their second birthday or after a maximum of 2 bleeding episodes requiring treatment, whichever came first. The trial consisted of two phases. In the main phase, an aggregated number of at least 50 participants received preventive treatment with turoctocog alfa until they reached a minimum of 50 exposure days (ED) or until they developed inhibitors. After that the participants continued in the extension phase where at least 50 participants achieved at least 100 ED, which translated into a maximum trial duration of up to 5 years (including any potential inhibitor treatment). The estimated total duration of the trial was approximately 7 years.</description>

            <description>Participants who started preventive treatment in the main and extension phase are included in this arm. They received turoctocog alfa doses of 15−60 IU/kg body weight (BW) administered as an intravenous injection for the prevention of bleeding. The investigator decided what dose of turoctocog alfa to give based on the child’s clinical profile. The trial consisted of two phases. In the main phase, an aggregated number of at least 50 participants received preventive treatment with turoctocog alfa until they reached a minimum of 50 exposure days (ED) or until they developed inhibitors. After that the participants continued in the extension phase where at least 50 participants achieved at least 100 ED, which translated into a maximum trial duration of up to 5 years (including any potential inhibitor treatment). The estimated total duration of the trial was approximately 7 years.</description>

        <description>Resource utilisation and caregiver burden are analysed in terms of average number of days absent from work and use of mobility aids (e.g. wheelchair or crutches) as a consequence of bleeds. The analysis was performed for the main phase (from Visit 2 to Visit 5 [50-55 exposure day], extension phase (from Visit 6 to end of trial; exposure day 100, expected to occur between 6 and 48 months of trial participation), the combined main and extension phase (from Visit 2 to end of trial) and for the inhibitor cohort.</description>

            <description>Participants (children≤2 years) received turoctocog alfa doses of 15−60 IU/kg body weight (BW) administered as an intravenous injection as on-demand treatment while waiting to start on a preventive regimen. The investigator decided what dose of turoctocog alfa to give based on the participant's clinical profile. This treatment period included Visit 2 to first preventive dose.</description>

            <description>Participants received turoctocog alfa doses of 15−60 IU/kg body weight (BW) administered as an intravenous injection for the prevention of bleeding. The investigator decided what dose of turoctocog alfa to give based on the participant's clinical profile.

In the main phase, an aggregated number of at least 50 participants received preventive treatment with turoctocog alfa until they reached a minimum of 50 exposure days (ED) or until they developed inhibitors.</description>
