    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 21 of Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>The DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or higher hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity considered to be related to MEDI-573 that occurred during the DLT evaluation period (Days 1 to 21 of Cycle 1), with the exceptions of Grade 3 fever (occurred in the absence of neutropenia and resolved to normal or baseline within 24 hours of treatment and was not considered as SAE), Grade 3 rigors/chills that responded to optimal therapy, and Grade &lt; 4 hyperglycemia that resolved in &lt; 24 hours.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with use of study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. The TEAEs are defined as AEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug, or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug, up to 60 days after the last study drug or until the participants started another anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first (approximately 15 months).</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with use of study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. The TEAEs are defined as AEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug, or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug, up to 60 days after the last study drug or until the participants started another anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first (approximately 15 months).</description>
