      Purpose of the Study:

      To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of
      PVSRIPO when delivered intracerebrally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED). To obtain
      correlative mechanistic evidence of PVSRIPO's effects on infected WHO Grade IV malignant
      glioma tumors and to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in
      recurrent WHO Grade IV malignant glioma patients. To obtain information about clinical
      response rates to intratumoral inoculation of PVSRIPO. To estimate the efficacy of PVSRIPO
      administered at the optimal dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PVSRIPO is a genetically recombinant, non-pathogenic poliovirus:rhinovirus chimera with a
      tumor-specific conditional replication phenotype. It consists of the genome of the live
      attenuated poliovirus serotype 1 (SABIN) vaccine (PV1S) with its cognate internal ribosomal
      entry site (IRES) element replaced with that of human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2). PVSRIPO has
      been manufactured at NCI-Frederick, NCI, NIH.

      Catheter Implantation: PVSRIPO will be delivered directly into the tumor. A stereotactic
      biopsy will be performed prior to virus administration for frozen section confirmation of
      viable tumor and further analysis. The biopsy needle will be placed with stereotactic
      guidance by a Cosman-Robert-Wells, MRI-compatible, stereotactic head frame or similar
      frameless device. Immediately following the stereotactically-guided tumor biopsy, a catheter
      will be implanted in the operating room (OR) at a site the same or different from that used
      for the biopsy using sterile techniques. A CT may be used to confirm catheter placement
      post-operatively.

      Agent infusion: The entire volume of the agent to be delivered will be pre-loaded into a
      syringe by the investigational pharmacist and connected to the catheter under sterile
      conditions in the Neuro-Surgical Intensive Care Unit (NSICU) or neuro step down unit just
      prior to the beginning of infusion. Drug infusion will occur in the NSICU or neuro step down
      unit so that all other emergency facilities will be available. Patients will be infused
      through a Medfusion 3500 or 3010 infusion pump pre-programmed to a delivery rate of 500
      microliters/hour. The total amount of the inoculum delivered to the patient will be 3 ml. The
      virus injection procedure will be completed within 6.5 hours. The catheter will be removed
      following the post-PVSRIPO infusion MRI.

      Biopsy sampling and analyses: Biopsy material will be obtained from tumor tissue prior to
      virus administration. This tissue material will be subjected to routine histology to confirm
      tumor recurrence by the study neuropathologist, Dr. R. McLendon or his designate. Molecular
      genetic tests will also be conducted on extracts of tumor cells from the protocol-specified
      biopsy prior to PVSRIPO infusion. After acquiring sufficient tissue for standard clinical
      pathologic testing, up to three additional core biopsies will be obtained, if possible. The
      additional core biopsies will be used for genetic analysis, including full genome or full
      exome sequencing, as well as other molecular genetic testing. This testing will include, but
      is not limited to, DNA sequencing, gene amplification, and gene expression. Additional
      pathology tests on the protocol-specified biopsy tissue may be included, if a sufficient
      amount of tissue remains after standard clinical pathologic testing.

      Selected patients who benefited from the initial infusion of PVSRIPO within this protocol
      will be eligible for a second infusion. All procedures previously described will be followed;
      however, the addition of a single dose of lomustine 8 weeks after PVSRIPO administration will
      alter the schedule of events that was previously described.

      During the dose escalation phase of the study, the starting amount (dose level 1) of PVSRIPO
      to be delivered was 1.0 x 10^8 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50). Dose level 2 was 3.3
      x 10^8 TCID50, dose level 3 was 1.0 x 10^9 TCID50, dose level 4 was 3.3 x 10^9 TCID50, and
      dose level 5 wase 1.0 x 10^10 TCID50. 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID50) is the unit
      of measure of infectious virus titer.

      To minimize the number of patients treated at low-dose levels during the dose escalation
      phase, we used a two-step continual reassessment method (CRM) design that included an
      escalation step and a model-guided step. In the dose escalation phase, dose levels were
      rapidly escalated as preclinical data suggested that dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) would not
      occur at any of the five dose levels that were being evaluated. Decisions concerning dose
      escalation for subsequent patients were based upon the occurrence of DLT during the first 4
      weeks after treatment administration. Initially, each patient was observed for ≥ 4 weeks
      before the next patient was treated. Starting at dose level 1, one patient was to be treated
      at each higher dose level. If no DLT was observed within 4 weeks of administration, then the
      next patient was to be treated at the next higher dose. If no DLTs were observed among
      patients treated on the first four dose levels, subsequent patients were to be treated at
      dose level 5. The escalation step was to be interrupted if a patient assigned to one of the
      first 4 dose levels or more than 20% of patients treated at dose level 5 experienced a DLT.
      In that case, further dose escalation or de-escalation would be guided by the
      likelihood-based implementation of the CRM, in which the one-parameter hyperbolic tangent
      model would be used to estimate the probability of DLT at each of the 5 dose levels based
      upon available data. The highest dose level for which this estimated probability is less than
      20% would be identified as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      After completion of the dose escalation phase and determination of the MTD, the study
      protocol was amended to allow continued patient accrual to a dose expansion phase, in order
      to aid in the determination of the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), and to garner more
      information about patient safety. The RP2D of PVSRIPO is the safe, therapeutic dose where
      patients have not experienced undue side effects from PVSRIPO or from the management of
      cerebral inflammation secondary to PVSRIPO administration. To address difficulties tapering
      patients off of steriods, the dose was reduced to dose level 2 (3.3 x 10^8 TCID50) for the
      dose expansion phase. After 6 patients were treated at dose level 2 in the dose expansion
      phase, due to continued difficulties tapering patients off steroids, the protocol was amended
      to further reduce the dose to dose level -1 (5.0 x 10^7 TCID50) with the goal of limiting the
      occurrence of known possible side effects of prolonged steroid use in patients who otherwise
      benefit from this investigational therapy. After the treatment of 24 patients at dose level
      -1, despite the fact that these patients were able to remain off significant doses of
      steroids, the patients benefiting the most from PVSRIPO appeared to be those who had
      experienced minimal or easily controllable inflammation. Hence, the protocol was amended to
      reduce the PVSRIPO dose to dose level -2 (1.0 x 10^7 TCID50) with the goal of limiting the
      occurrence of undesirable burden from inflammation and its treatment on as many subjects (and
      caregivers) as possible. Based upon additional animal studies, dose level -2 (1.0 x 10^7
      TCID50) would also be a therapeutic dose. Reduction to dose level -2 was not due to concerns
      for the safety of the patients on dose level -1, but due to the observation that less
      inflammatory reaction appeared to be a predictor of better survival and treatment response.
      After treating 15 patients at dose level -2, based upon pre-clinical and clinical data
      collected on dose levels -1 and -2, there was no evidence of pre-clinically or clinically
      important differences between these dose levels. Therefore, the decision was made to treat
      all future study patients at dose level -1 (5.0 x 10^7 TCID50).

    <description>The MTD will be the highest dose level for which the probability that a dose escalation patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is estimated to be less than 20%. Any Grade 3 or 4 toxicity that is not reversible within 2 weeks, or any life-threatening event, or treatment-related death will be considered a DLT. Any grade 2 or higher serious autoimmune toxicities particularly those affecting vital organs (e.g. cardiac, renal, CNS) will be considered a DLT. 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID50) is the unit of measure of infectious virus titer.
The MTD was determined based on the first 9 patients treated with PVSRIPO- 1 at dose level 1 (1.0 x 10e8 TCID50 (50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose)), 1 at dose level 2 (3.3 x 10e8 TCID50), 1 at dose level 3 (1.0 x 10e9 TCID50), 2 at dose level 4 (3.3 x 10e9 TCID50), and 4 at dose level 5 (1.0 x 10e10 TCID50).</description>

             administration of the study agent.

          6. Disease Confirmation. At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the
             presence of recurrent tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis.

          7. Informed Consent. A signed informed consent form approved by the Duke University
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be required for patient enrollment into the
             study. Patients must be able to read and understand the informed consent document and
             must sign the informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational
             nature of this study.

          8. Brain MRI. Able to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy. Because of the unknown risk of virus administration potentially affecting a
             developing fetus or growing infant, females who are pregnant or breast-feeding during
             the study period will be excluded. Adults of reproductive potential not employing an
             effective method of birth control will be excluded. Sexually active women of child
             bearing potential, whose partner is male, must use medically accepted birth control.
             Sexually active men, whose partner is a female of child bearing potential, must use a
             medically accepted birth control.

          2. Disease Status. Because patients will receive drug intracerebrally, patients with an
             impending, life-threatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on the assessment of
             the study neurosurgeons, Allan Friedman, John Sampson, or Peter Fecci, or their
             designate, will be excluded.

          3. Medical Conditions. Because the potential toxicities from the agent being studied in
             this protocol may be similar to some known diseases or may be more dangerous in the
             context of certain known diseases, the following patients will be excluded to avoid
             confounding the study results:

               -  Patients with an active infection requiring intravenous treatment or having an
                  unexplained febrile illness (Tmax &gt; 99.5 F/37.5 C).

               -  Patients with known immunosuppressive disease or known human immunodeficiency
                  virus infection.

               -  Unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as severe heart (New York
                  Heart Association Class 3 or 4) or known lung (FEV1 &lt; 50%) disease, uncontrolled
                  diabetes mellitus.

               -  Albumin allergy. Albumin is added to the agent as a stabilizer. Patients with a
                  known allergy will be excluded.

               -  Current or history of anaphylactic reaction to gadolinium. Gadolinium is used as
                  contrast for the MRI.

          4. Previous Poliomyelitis. A history of neurological complications due to poliovirus
             infection would imply previous virus replication in the CNS. Based on animal studies,
             previous exposure to poliovirus administered intracerebrally can reduce subsequent
             virus replication in the CNS.

          5. Prior Therapy. Patients who have not recovered from the toxic effects of prior
             chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy will be excluded. Guidelines for this recovery
             period are dependent upon the specific therapeutic agent being used:

               -  Patients may not have received chemotherapy or bevacizumab ≤ 4 weeks [except for
                  nitrosourea (6 weeks) or metronomic dosed chemotherapy such as daily etoposide or
                  cyclophosphamide (1 week)] prior to starting the study drug unless patients have
                  recovered from side effects of such therapy.

               -  Patients may not have received immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the
                  study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy.

               -  Patients may not be less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive
                  d disease outside of the radiation field or 2 progressive scans at least 4 weeks
                  apart or histopathologic confirmation

               -  Patients must have completed all standard of care treatments including surgical
                  procedure and radiation therapy (at least 59Gy):

                    -  If the MGMT promoter in their tumor is known to be unmethylated, patients
                       are not mandated to have received chemotherapy prior to participating in
                       this trial.

                    -  If the MGMT promoter in their tumor is known to be methylated or the MGMT
                       promoter status is unknown at the time of screening, patients must have
                       received at least one chemotherapy regimen prior to participating in this
                       trial.

          6. Location and Extent of Tumor. Because of the potential toxicities from the agent,
             patients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum or spinal cord,
             radiological evidence of multifocal disease, or leptomeningeal disease. Patients with
             evidence of diffuse subependymal disease or tumor in the brainstem, cerebellum, spinal
             cord, or CSF will be excluded. Since the study agent is a local treatment, patients
             with radiological evidence of active (growing) multifocal disease, tumors extending
             into or crossing the corpus callosum or leptomeningeal disease, will be excluded.

          7. Subjects must not have diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia. Patients with the following
             will be excluded:

               -  Undetectable anti-tetanus toxoid IgG (except for retreatment)

               -  Known history of agammaglobulinemia

          8. Patient on greater than 4mg per day of dexamethasone within the 2 weeks prior to
             admission for PVSRIPO infusion

          9. Patient has worsening steroid myopathy (history of gradual progression of bilateral
             proximal muscle weakness, and atrophy of proximal muscle groups)

         10. Patients with prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the
             exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin

        Eligibility Criteria for Retreatment:

        Subjects can be considered for PVSRIPO retreatment if they meet some of the pertinent
        inclusion and exclusion criteria above. In addition, the subject must also satisfy the
        following criteria:

          -  Patient must have benefited from initial treatment with PVSRIPO (i.e. be at least 12
             months following their initial PVSRIPO infusion).

          -  Patient must have a recurrence of their supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma
             based on imaging studies with measurable disease (≥ 1 cm of contrast-enhancing tumor).

          -  At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the presence of recurrent
             tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis, unless already proven within
             the last 3 months via tissue sampling (biopsy or resection).

          -  The patient must have received a new boost immunization with trivalent inactivated
             IPOL™ (Sanofi-Pasteur) at least 1 week and no more than 4 weeks prior to
             re-administration of the study agent. The boost immunization may be obtained locally,
             prior to signing consent, as long as the patient has been informed about this study
             procedure via phone script.

          -  A new signed informed consent form for retreatment approved by the Duke University
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be required for retreatment. Patients must be
             able to read and understand the informed consent document and must sign the informed
             consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study.

        <description>The MTD will be the highest dose level for which the probability that a dose escalation patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is estimated to be less than 20%. Any Grade 3 or 4 toxicity that is not reversible within 2 weeks, or any life-threatening event, or treatment-related death will be considered a DLT. Any grade 2 or higher serious autoimmune toxicities particularly those affecting vital organs (e.g. cardiac, renal, CNS) will be considered a DLT. 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID50) is the unit of measure of infectious virus titer.
The MTD was determined based on the first 9 patients treated with PVSRIPO- 1 at dose level 1 (1.0 x 10e8 TCID50 (50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose)), 1 at dose level 2 (3.3 x 10e8 TCID50), 1 at dose level 3 (1.0 x 10e9 TCID50), 2 at dose level 4 (3.3 x 10e9 TCID50), and 4 at dose level 5 (1.0 x 10e10 TCID50).</description>
