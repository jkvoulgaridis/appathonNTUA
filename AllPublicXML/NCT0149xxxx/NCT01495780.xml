  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote Health Monitoring (RHM) is the assessment of one's own symptoms at home between doctor
      visits, using things like at-home breathing tests, electronic diaries to answer
      questionnaires, and other monitoring devices. The hypothesis of this study is that the health
      and quality of life of people with COPD who do RHM for one year will be better than people
      with COPD who do not do RHM. Subjects who are at least 40 years old, have been diagnosed with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic bronchitis or emphysema,
      and are current or former smokers will be invited to participate. This study is paid for by
      eResearch Technology (eRT).

      Subjects will complete 2 visits at UCLA, separated by one year of RHM. All subjects will
      participate in RHM. RHM will involve daily monitoring at home using a few electronic devices:
      blood oxygen levels, symptoms, medication use, breathing tests, and activity monitoring.
      Visits will include physical exam and medical history, ECG, questionnaires, breathing tests,
      and exercise tests.

    <description>Subjects assigned to this arm will conduct daily at-home health monitoring using several electronic devices that will transmit data back to the study team. Everyday, subjects will measure pulse oximetry (SpO2) using a finger clip, answer questions about symptoms and medication use, answer a quality of life questionnaire, perform breathing tests, and record physical activity (using a physical activity monitor that will be mailed to the study team). Wearing the activity monitor is optional and will only occur during months 1, 6, and 12.</description>

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 weeks of enrolment.

          -  Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) prescribed for greater than 12 hours a day.
