  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of canagliflozin compared to placebo on
      progression of albuminuria in participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus receiving standard
      care but with inadequate glycemic control and at elevated risk of cardiovascular events.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in adult participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM),
      receiving standard of care for hyperglycemia and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, who have
      either a history of a prior CV event or 2 or more risk factors for a CV event. Participants
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to canagliflozin or matching placebo to be taken
      once daily. Canagliflozin will be provided at a dose of 100 mg/day through Week 13 and then
      increased at the discretion of the investigator to a dose of 300 mg/day, if the participant
      requires additional glycemic control and is tolerating the 100 mg dose.

      The study consists of a 2-week screening period and a double-blind treatment period lasting
      between 78 and 156 weeks; study completion is targeted for when the last subject randomized
      has approximately 78 weeks of follow-up or when 688 major adverse cardiovascular events are
      accumulated between CANVAS and CANVAS-R. A total of 5,700 participants are targeted to be
      recruited into the study. Participants can be either drug naïve to antihyperglycemic agents,
      using monotherapy, or using combination of antihyperglycemic therapy for the control of blood
      glucose levels.

      The completion target was reached in February 2017.

    <description>Progression defined as the development of micro-albuminuria (Urine Albumin Creatinine Ratio [UACR] 30 to 300 milligram per gram [mg/g]) or macroalbuminuria (Albumin/creatinine ratio [ACR] of greater than [&gt;] 300 mg/g) in a participant with baseline normoalbuminuria (ACR less than [&lt;] 30 mg/g) or the development of macro-albuminuria in a participant with baseline microalbuminuria with an ACR increase greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent from baseline. Participants with macroalbuminuria at baseline (ACR&gt;300 mg/g) were excluded from the analysis. Event rate was estimated based on the time to the first occurrence of the event.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 5,813 participants were randomized. However, 1 participant was randomized twice and only the first randomization was included in the Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set. Thus 2,905 and 2,907 participants were randomly assigned to the placebo and canagliflozin groups in the ITT analysis set, respectively.</pre_assignment_details>
