    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 75% Improvement (Response) From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement was missing.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) With at Least 2 Point Reduction From Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the Investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall or prior disease. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examines all of the lesions on the participant and assigns a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equals the overall sPGA score.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in the Psoriasis Affected Body Surface Area (BSA) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>BSA is a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the subject's hand (entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. The PASI is a validated instrument that has become standard in clinical trials for psoriasis. The PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting a greater disease severity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 50% Improvement From Baseline (Response) Reduction in the PASI-50 at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI-50 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 50% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus Visual Analogue Scale 100-mm (VAS) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure the amount of itching and discomfort a participant experiences. Participant's assessment of pruritus (Itch) asked: On average, how much itch have you had because of your condition in the past week? Higher scores correspond to more severe symptom or disease. The participant places a vertical line on a 100-mm VAS on which the left-hand boundary represents no itch at all and the right-hand boundary represents the worst itch imaginable. The distance from the vertical line to the left-hand boundary is recorded. VAS scores range from 0 to 100 mm, where higher scores correspond to worse pruritis (itch).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was developed as a practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains 10 items dealing with the participants skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the participant is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score has a possible range from 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item general health status instrument often used in clinical trials and health services research. It consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations-physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life (better functioning)</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) in the Placebo Controlled Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants must have had a diagnosis of chronic, stable plaque psoriasis at least 6 months prior to screening and which was considered inappropriate for topical therapy (e.g, based on the severity of the disease and extent of affected area) or could not be adequately controlled/treated with topical therapy to qualify for the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Treatment assignments were stratified according to whether the participants had a psoriatic arthritis (PsA) diagnosis by Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria (yes/no) at screening, whether they participated in the sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling, and whether they had participated in the intensive PK sampling.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 75% Improvement (Response) From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) at Week 16</title>
        <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement was missing.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) With at Least 2 Point Reduction From Baseline to Week 16</title>
        <description>The sPGA is a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the Investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall or prior disease. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examines all of the lesions on the participant and assigns a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equals the overall sPGA score.</description>

        <description>PASI-50 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 50% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</description>

        <description>The pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure the amount of itching and discomfort a participant experiences. Participant's assessment of pruritus (Itch) asked: On average, how much itch have you had because of your condition in the past week? Higher scores correspond to more severe symptom or disease. The participant places a vertical line on a 100-mm VAS on which the left-hand boundary represents no itch at all and the right-hand boundary represents the worst itch imaginable. The distance from the vertical line to the left-hand boundary is recorded. VAS scores range from 0 to 100 mm, where higher scores correspond to worse pruritis (itch).</description>

        <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was developed as a practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains 10 items dealing with the participants skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the participant is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score has a possible range from 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

          <description>SF-36 is a 36-item general health status instrument often used in clinical trials and health services research. It consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations-physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life (better functioning)</description>

        <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

        <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>
