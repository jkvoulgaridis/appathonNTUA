  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if systemically infused allogeneic bone marrow
      derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) home to sites of prostate cancer in men with localized
      adenocarcinoma of the prostate that are planning to undergo a prostatectomy. Investigators
      plan to systemically infuse MSCs 4, 6 or 8 days prior to enrolled subjects' planned
      prostatectomies. Investigators will then quantify the relative amount of donor MSC DNA to
      recipient DNA present in patients' explanted prostate specimens. This will be accomplished
      via BEAMing digital PCR. This trial will provide the foundation for future studies aimed at
      engineering MSCs to deliver a toxin to sites of metastatic prostate cancer.
