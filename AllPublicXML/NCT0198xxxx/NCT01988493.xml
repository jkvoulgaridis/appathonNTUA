        <title>Phase 2: Time to Progression (TTP) Based on Tumor Assessment by Investigator</title>
        <description>TTP was defined as the time in months from randomization to date of the observation of radiological PD (based on RECIST v1.1) assessed by the investigator. PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or the presence of new lesions. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

          <title>Phase 2: Progression-free Survival (PFS) Based on Tumor Assessment by the Investigator</title>
          <description>Progression-free survival (assessed by the Investigator) time was defined as the time in months from randomization to either first observation of radiologically confirmed progression disease by the investigator or occurrence of death due to any cause within 84 days of either randomization or the last tumor assessment. PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or the presence of new lesions. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. PFS was measured using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates.</description>
