    <textblock>
      This study is a placebo-controlled 12 week trial of DCS augmentation of once-weekly CBT
      sessions in 60 schizophrenia subjects with antipsychotic-resistant delusions. In addition to
      testing efficacy, this trial will characterize DCS effects in terms of time course and
      persistence of response and will examine DCS effects on memory consolidation and cognitive
      flexibility as possible mediators of DCS enhancement of CBT for delusions.

      This study consists of a placebo-controlled 12 week trial of DCS augmentation of once-weekly
      CBT sessions in 60 schizophrenia subjects with antipsychotic-resistant delusions. In addition
      to testing efficacy, this trial will characterize DCS effects in terms of time course and
      persistence of response and will examine DCS effects on memory consolidation and cognitive
      flexibility as possible mediators of DCS enhancement of CBT for delusions. This study will be
      conducted by the Schizophrenia Research Group of the NYU Langone Medical Center at One Park
      Avenue 8th Floor and the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Bellevue Hospital located in New
      York, NY.

      Upon signing consent, patients will undergo screening procedures to assess eligibility. A
      diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder will be
      determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID) completed by a research
      clinician using all available clinical data and will be confirmed by consensus diagnosis. A
      comprehensive medical history and physical exam, including measurement of vital signs, will
      be performed. A psychiatric history, including diagnosis, treatment history, current
      medications, and substance use will also be performed. A research assistant will complete the
      demographics and administer the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms-Delusions (SAPS-D).

      At screening only, a fasting blood sample will be obtained to perform routine laboratory
      tests including electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, liver function tests, fasting glucose,
      calcium, phosphate, magnesium, albumin and CBC with differential. Urinalysis will be
      performed to identify unstable medical illness. A urine toxicology screen will be performed
      and a urine pregnancy test will be done for women of child bearing potential.

      Subjects who meet study eligibility criteria will complete the Logical Memory Test portion of
      the Weschler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III) one week before the baseline visit.

      The baseline visit will include the following assessments: SAPS-D, Psychotic Symptom Rating
      Scales (PSYRATS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative
      Symptoms (SANS), Calgary Depression Rating Scale (CDRS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI),
      Heinrich's Quality of Life Scale (Heinrich's QOL), Peter's Delusion Inventory (PDI),
      Birchwood Insight Scale (BIS), Drug and Alcohol Questionnaire (DAUQ), and the Pittsburg Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI) . At the baseline visit the following cognitive assessments will be
      administered: the Logical Memory Test of the WMS-III, The Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST),
      Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), and the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB).

      The clinical battery of assessments including the PSYRATS, BPRS, SANS, CDRS, CGI, and
      Heinrich's QOL will be performed on weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36. The delusions section only of
      the PSYRATS will be performed on weeks 2, 3, 6, and 10. The Logical Memory Test will be
      administered on screening visit 2, baseline, week 3, and week 4. The Alternative Beliefs
      Exercise will occur on weeks 3, 4, and 12. The WCST and VFT will be given to participants at
      the baseline visit and week 12. Side effects will be assessed using the Systematic Assessment
      for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE)on weeks 3, 4, 8, and 12.

      Beginning at week 1, participants will engage in hour long sessions of Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy for delusions. This treatment course will continue weekly from week 1 until week 12
      (12 sessions).

      For the first two sessions of CBT during weeks 1 and 2, both the experimental and the placebo
      group will receive a placebo pill by mouth one hour before CBT sessions. Starting week 2, the
      placebo and experimental groups will receive their respective drugs one hour before CBT
      sessions from weeks 3-12 (placebo by mouth to placebo group, 50 mg D-cycloserine by mouth to
      experimental group).

      The primary outcome of interest in the study is the change in PSYRATS Delusions Subscale
      total score compared to placebo from baseline to week 12. Secondary outcome measures include
      changes as defined by a 20% reduction in PSYRATS Delusions Subscale total score from baseline
      after 2 weeks of DCS treatment versus placebo as well changes as defined by maintenance of a
      20% or greater reduction in the PSYRATS Delusions Subscale total score from baseline at a 3
      and 6 month follow up as compared to placebo.

    <measure>Change in Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale-Delusions (PSYRATS-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the Delusions subscale total of the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale (PSYRATS) from Baseline to Week 12. The Delusions subscale is a composite score of 6 items each rated from 0-4 with 4 indicating more severe symptomology. The Delusions subscale has a possible range of 0-24.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Logical Memory Test-WMS-III</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after Baseline, and 7 days after Screening visit 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Logical Memory Test of the Wechsler Memory Scale is a measure of verbal declarative memory. We are using it to evaluate memory consolidation by analyzing the number of thematic elements recalled after a delay of 7 days. Participants are read two different stories—one at Screening visit #2 and one at Baseline. They are asked to recall specific items and narrative themes after 7 days. Scores range from 0-7, 7 indicating perfect thematic recall, and 0 indicating no thematic elements were remembered and worse thematic recall.
We hypothesize that improved memory consolidation (assessed with the Logical Memory Test) tested 7 days after the first dose of D-cycloserine will predict improvement of delusional scores measured by the PSYRATS-D.
The reported outcome (change in Logical Memory Test score) was calculated by subtracting the screening visit 2 score from the baseline score for each participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alternate Beliefs Exercise (ABE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3 to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Alternate Belief Exercise is a measurement of cognitive flexibility. The scores range from 0-21, and a higher score indicates an increased number of alternative beliefs reported.
This outcome measurement reports the change in number of alternate beliefs generated from weeks 3 to 4 as a predictor of improvement of the PSYRATS Delusions Subscale total score at 12 weeks. Thus a higher score in this outcome measurement indicates a greater number of alternative beliefs reported at week 4 as compared to week 3. This implies greater cognitive flexibility at week 4 as compared to week 3 directly after drug administration.</description>

        <title>Change in Logical Memory Test-WMS-III</title>
        <description>The Logical Memory Test of the Wechsler Memory Scale is a measure of verbal declarative memory. We are using it to evaluate memory consolidation by analyzing the number of thematic elements recalled after a delay of 7 days. Participants are read two different stories—one at Screening visit #2 and one at Baseline. They are asked to recall specific items and narrative themes after 7 days. Scores range from 0-7, 7 indicating perfect thematic recall, and 0 indicating no thematic elements were remembered and worse thematic recall.
We hypothesize that improved memory consolidation (assessed with the Logical Memory Test) tested 7 days after the first dose of D-cycloserine will predict improvement of delusional scores measured by the PSYRATS-D.
The reported outcome (change in Logical Memory Test score) was calculated by subtracting the screening visit 2 score from the baseline score for each participant.</description>

        <title>Change in Alternate Beliefs Exercise (ABE)</title>
        <description>The Alternate Belief Exercise is a measurement of cognitive flexibility. The scores range from 0-21, and a higher score indicates an increased number of alternative beliefs reported.
This outcome measurement reports the change in number of alternate beliefs generated from weeks 3 to 4 as a predictor of improvement of the PSYRATS Delusions Subscale total score at 12 weeks. Thus a higher score in this outcome measurement indicates a greater number of alternative beliefs reported at week 4 as compared to week 3. This implies greater cognitive flexibility at week 4 as compared to week 3 directly after drug administration.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 3 to Week 4</time_frame>
        <population>Two participants were randomized and took medication (placebo or DCS) at week 3, but were lost to follow up between week 3 and week 4. One participant was randomized at week 3 but did not take medication or complete the ABE exercise at week 3. These three participants are not included in the reported data.</population>

          <title>Change in Alternate Beliefs Exercise (ABE)</title>
          <description>The Alternate Belief Exercise is a measurement of cognitive flexibility. The scores range from 0-21, and a higher score indicates an increased number of alternative beliefs reported.
This outcome measurement reports the change in number of alternate beliefs generated from weeks 3 to 4 as a predictor of improvement of the PSYRATS Delusions Subscale total score at 12 weeks. Thus a higher score in this outcome measurement indicates a greater number of alternative beliefs reported at week 4 as compared to week 3. This implies greater cognitive flexibility at week 4 as compared to week 3 directly after drug administration.</description>
          <population>Two participants were randomized and took medication (placebo or DCS) at week 3, but were lost to follow up between week 3 and week 4. One participant was randomized at week 3 but did not take medication or complete the ABE exercise at week 3. These three participants are not included in the reported data.</population>
