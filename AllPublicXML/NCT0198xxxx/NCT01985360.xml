      The purpose of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to determine the best management strategy for
      patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), at least moderate inducible ischemia and
      advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;30
      ml/min/1.73 m² or on dialysis). This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial of 777
      randomized participants with advanced CKD. Participants were assigned at random to a routine
      invasive strategy (INV) with cardiac catheterization (cath) followed by revascularization (if
      suitable) plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) or to a conservative strategy (CON) of OMT, with
      cath and revascularization reserved for those who fail OMT. The trial is designed to run
      seamlessly in parallel to the main ISCHEMIA trial as a companion trial.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

      A. Primary Aim. The primary aim of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to determine whether an invasive
      strategy of cardiac cath followed by optimal revascularization, in addition to OMT, will
      reduce the primary composite endpoint of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in
      participants with SIHD and advanced CKD over an average follow-up of approximately 2.8 years
      compared with an initial conservative strategy of OMT alone with catheterization reserved for
      those who fail OMT. The primary endpoint is time to centrally adjudicated death or nonfatal
      myocardial infarction (MI).

      B. Secondary Aims. Major: To compare the incident of the composite of death, nonfatal MI,
      resuscitated cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure, and
      angina symptoms and quality of life, as assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, between
      the INV and CON strategies. Other secondary aims include: comparing the incidence of the
      composite of death, nonfatal MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for
      heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke; composite of death, nonfatal MI, or
      stroke; composite endpoints incorporating cardiovascular death; composite endpoints
      incorporating other definitions of MI as defined in the clinical event charter; individual
      components of the primary and major secondary endpoints; stroke and health resource
      utilization, costs, and cost effectiveness.

      A major secondary aim of ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to compare the quality of life (QOL)
      outcomes—patients' symptoms, functioning and well-being—between those assigned to an invasive
      strategy as compared with a conservative strategy. In the protocol, angina frequency and
      disease-specific quality of life measured by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) Angina
      Frequency and Quality of Life scales, respectively, are described as the tools that will be
      used to make this comparative assessment. Recent work has indicated that it is possible to
      combine the information from the individual domain scores in the SAQ into a new Summary Score
      that captures the information from the SAQ Angina Frequency, Physical Limitation and Quality
      of Life scales into a single overall score. The advantages of using a summary score as the
      primary measure of QOL effects of a therapy are a single primary endpoint comparison rather
      than two or three (eliminating concerns some may have about multiple comparisons) and a more
      intuitive holistic (patient-centric) interpretation of the effectiveness results. With these
      advantages in mind, the ISCHEMIA leadership has agreed that the SAQ Summary Score will be
      designated as the primary way this secondary endpoint will be analyzed and interpreted, with
      the individual SAQ scores being used in a secondary, explanatory and descriptive role. A key
      subgroup analysis will be to stratify the results among those with daily/weekly angina
      (baseline SAQ Angina Frequency score ≤60), monthly angina (SAQ Angina Frequency score 61-99)
      and no angina (SAQ Angina Frequency score = 100).

      BACKGROUND:

      Among patients with advanced CKD, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death,15-30
      times higher than the age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate in the general population.
      The projected 4-year mortality is &gt;50% in patients with advanced CKD and is worse than that
      for patients in the general population who have cancers, heart failure, stroke or MI.
      Participants with advanced CKD are 5-10 times more likely to die than to reach end stage
      renal disease (ESRD). Despite this, ~80% of contemporary coronary artery disease (CAD) trials
      exclude participants with advanced CKD. Most of the treatments aimed at reducing
      cardiovascular events in advanced CKD are therefore extrapolated from cohorts without
      advanced CKD. Participants with advanced CKD and cardiovascular disease are undertreated with
      less frequent use of statins and revascularization therapies, and the optimal management
      approach to these patients is unknown. Participants with advanced CKD are notably
      underrepresented in contemporary trials comparing revascularization with medical therapy in
      SIHD patients, such as the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes
      (BARI 2D) trial or the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug
      Evaluation (COURAGE) trial,making any assessment about the efficacy of revascularization plus
      medical therapy vs. initial medical therapy alone in this cohort problematic.

      Participants with advanced CKD are at increased risk for complications of the assigned
      invasive procedure, specifically contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), dialysis, major
      bleeding and short-term risk of death. However, there is controversy in the medical
      literature regarding the incidence (&lt;1% to &gt;30%), effective treatment (saline hydration,
      N-acetyl cysteine, or sodium bicarbonate), and prognosis of contrast induced AKI (&lt;0.5% to
      &gt;5% requiring dialysis). In addition, although contrast induced AKI have been associated with
      increase in short-term mortality, residual confounding in these studies makes interpretation
      difficulty. Moreover, it is unknown if these short-term increased risks are offset by
      long-term benefits. Limited observational studies in the CKD cohort suggest a long-term
      survival benefit of revascularization when compared with medical therapy alone, despite an
      increase in short-term risks. However, the medical therapy in these trials was not optimized,
      drug eluting stents were rarely used and there is undoubtedly inherent selection and
      ascertainment bias with observational studies. The above has resulted in clinical equipoise
      in the management of these patients, with the rates of revascularization only around 10-45%.
      The results of ISCHEMIA-CKD will have profound implications for guidelines, health policy,
      and clinical practice.

    <description>Narrowed blood vessels can be opened without surgery using stents or can be bypassed with surgery.

    <description>Artery narrowing is bypassed during surgery with a healthy artery or vein from another part of the body. This is known as coronary artery bypass grafting, or CABG (said &quot;cabbage&quot;). The surgery creates new routes around narrowed and blocked heart arteries. This allows more blood flow to the heart.</description>
