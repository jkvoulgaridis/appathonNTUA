  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to conduct a 1-year double blind randomized control trial comparing
      candesartan to lisinopril in 140 individuals with hypertension and executive mild cognitive
      impairment in their effects on executive function, neuroimaging markers, and vascular
      indicators.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Hypertension is associated with cognitive impairment even in the absence of clinical
           dementia. To date, no specific treatment is available for this pattern of mild cognitive
           impairment related to hypertension.

        -  Objectives or purpose: The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of
           candesartan on executive function decline and on changes in cerebral perfusion,
           cerebrovascular reserve and microvascular brain injury. The study also intends to
           identify potential underlying mechanisms related to vascular structure and function,
           including atherosclerosis, vascular inflammation, vascular stiffness, and endothelial
           progenitor cells, by which candesartan may affect the cognitive and cerebrovascular
           outcomes.

        -  Study methodology:This is a double blind randomized clinical trial that will be
           conducted in 140 individuals (70 in the candesartan group, 70 in the lisinopril group).
           Our target population is subjects: 55 years or older with hypertension and Executive
           Mild Cognitive Impairment.

        -  Endpoints to be measured:Our measures include cognitive function, cerebral perfusion and
           reserve, markers of vascular brain damage, atherosclerosis, stiffness, vascular
           inflammation and endothelial function.

        -  Description of intervention, follow-up, and duration of study: Eligible participants
           will undergo randomization into 2 groups and will be seen frequently until their blood
           pressure is controlled (&lt;140/90 mmHg). Participants will be seen at 3, 6 and 12 months
           afterwards.

Both groups will also receive (unblinded) , if needed to achieve blood pressure control, HCTZ 12.5mg→ 25mg, Amlodipine 2.5mg→ 5mg →10mg and metoprolol succinate extended release 12.5mg→ 25mg→ 50mg. Antihypertensive medications will be increased every 2 weeks until control is achieved.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. age: 55 years or older;

          2. Hypertension: SBP≥140 mm Hg or DBP≥ 90 mm or receiving antihypertensive medications.

          3. Executive MCI will be defined using these criteria:

               1. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score less than or equal to 26

               2. Executive dysfunction: A performance at the 10th percentile or below on at least
                  one of four screening tests for executive function: Trail Making Test, Part B
                  (TMT-B), modified Stroop interference, Digit Span and Digit Sequencing, and
                  Letter fluency.

               3. Minimal Functional limitation as reflected by the Functional Assessment
                  Questionnaire (FAQ)≤7

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Intolerance to study drugs;

          2. SBP &gt;200 or DBP &gt;110 mm Hg;

          3. Renal disease or hyperkalemia

          4. Active medical or psychiatric problems

          5. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure;

          6. History of stroke in the past 3 years;

          7. Inability to perform the study procedures

          8. Women of childbearing potential

          9. diagnosis of dementia

         10. In those who lack decision capacity, a study surrogate who can sign on their behalf
             will be required. Since we are enrolling only those with MCI, we anticipate that most
             participants will have decision capacity

         11. Current use of Lithium, as most antihypertensive classes may lead to increased lithium
             toxic levels.
