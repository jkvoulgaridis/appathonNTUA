  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research protocol is intended to allow for bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and
      blood specimens to be collected for research purposes, specifically allowing subjects the
      option of sedation during the bone marrow procedure. Samples will be banked for future
      research related to cancer and other diseases. Researchers hope this protocol will improve
      the collection of research correlative and translational biopsy specimens for clinical
      research.

        Male and females, 18 years of age and older who are scheduled to undergo a bone marrow
        aspirate and/or bone marrow biopsy as part of their participation on another research
        study, who are allowing their samples to be collected and used for research purposes,
        and/or who might benefit from the administration of moderate sedation. Therefore, there are
        no restrictions with regards to diagnosis, though most patients will have hematologic
        malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, amyloidosis, myelodysplastic syndromes,
        myeloproliferative diseases).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Planned procedure including a bone marrow aspirate and/or bone marrow biopsy

          -  The procedure is planned for the purpose of obtaining a research specimen (as part of
             another research study or as part of this stand-alone sample collection protocol.).
             Procedures with a dual purpose (i.e. to obtain both clinically-indicated specimens and
             research specimens) are permitted, but procedures to obtain clinical specimens only
             are not permitted.

          -  All subjects must provide written informed consent for the biopsy procedure, the
             collection of bone marrow and blood specimens for research purposes and (if planned)
             the administration of sedation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate sedation may not be administrated to subjects with a clinical
             contraindication to its provision, or if the investigator believes that administration
             of moderate sedation would constitute under risk to the subject.
