Symptomatic progression was defined as increase/worsening of average symptomatic burden index (ASBI) (mean of 6 major lung cancer specific symptom scores);Worsening defined as 10% increase of scale breadth from baseline.

        <description>Progression-free survival (assessed by the Investigator) time was defined as the time in months from randomization to either first observation of radiologically confirmed progression disease (PD) by the investigator or occurrence of death due to any cause within 84 days of either randomization or the last tumor assessment. PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or the presence of new lesions. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm). PFS was measured using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates.</description>

          <title>Phase 1b: Apparent Total Body Clearance From Plasma (CL/F) of Tepotinib and Gefitinib</title>
          <description>The CL/f is a measure of the rate at which it was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose was influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. The CL/F from plasma was calculated using the formula: Dose divided by area under the concentration time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf).</description>
          <population>The Pharmacokinetic set included all participants who had received at least 1 dose of the tepotinib or gefitinib and who had provided at least 1 plasma concentration measurement of tepotinib or gefitinib after the first dose. Here, &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; signifies participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

Treatment-related TEAE was defined as having a &quot;Possible&quot; or &quot;Related&quot; relationship to study treatment, as assessed by the Investigator. As per NCI-CTCAE, Grade 3 is Severe, Grade 4 is Life-threatening and Grade 5 or Death. Number of participants with Grade 3/4 TEAEs and Grade 3/4 treatment-related TEAEs were reported.</description>

        <description>Number of participants with death due to progressive disease (PD), adverse event (AE) related to study treatment, AE not related to study treatment were reported. An AE was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. PD defined as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of target lesions recorded since treatment started and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or the presence of new lesions. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Number of participants with deaths due to PD, AE related to study treatment, AE not related to study treatment were reported.</description>

The score ranges from Grade 0 to Grade 5, where Grade 0 = Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction, Grade 1 = Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature (like light house work, office work), Grade 2 = Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities, Grade 3 = Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours and Grade 4 = Completely disabled.

CR:disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR:at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD:an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of target lesions recorded since treatment started and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or the presence of new lesions.

        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life (QoL) in cancer participants. It consisted of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial impact. The EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score ranges from 0 to 100; High score indicates better GHS/QoL. Score 0 represents: very poor physical condition and QoL. Score 100 represents: excellent overall physical condition and QoL.</description>

        <population>Quality of life (Qol) evaluable population set included ITT participants in the treatment group in which they actually received the treatment with a baseline and at least 1 evaluable on-treatment QoL questionnaire. Here &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Phase 2: Time-to-Symptom Progression (TTSP)</title>
        <description>TTSP was measured from randomization to symptomatic progression by lung cancer symptom scale (LCSS) used to measure symptom changes relevant to quality of life (QoL).It consisted of 9 items focused on cancer symptoms (loss of appetite, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, blood in sputum, pain, symptoms of cancer, illness affecting normal activity, QoL).For each symptom score distance from left boundary to point where participant has marked line was measured in millimeters (mm).Total scale length was 100 mm. Symptomatic progression was defined as increase/worsening of average symptomatic burden index (ASBI) (mean of 6 major lung cancer specific symptom scores);Worsening defined as 10% increase of scale breadth from baseline. Score 0 indicate no/minimum symptoms;100 indicates maximum level of symptoms.</description>
