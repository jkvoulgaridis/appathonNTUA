  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess in an exploratory manner, the pronostic utility for locoregional control,
      progression-free and distant metastasis-free survival of a pre-therapy and post-therapy blood
      DNA test of HPV E6 and E7 DNA for subtypes 16 and 18 in p16+ and/or HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer
      patients. This will entail analysis of both initial pre-therapy HPV level as a continuous
      variable and initial post-therapy HPV level as a dichotomous variable.

             soft palate, glossotonsillar sulcus.

          -  No or minimal smoking history (&lt;/= 10 pack-year, no smoking in the past 12 months last
             10 years based on documented history and/or subject report)

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Subjects are capable of giving informed consent or have an acceptabl;e surrogate

          -  Enrollment on any other tumor or tissue banking study is allowed.

          -  Patients who have had blood drawn as part of another study, including the IRB-approved
