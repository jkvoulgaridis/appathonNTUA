      In our research, the investigators use the non-invasive 1230 nm ultra-fast laser as the light
      source, and utilize the non-linear light microscopic system to observe your skin. This
      microscopic system is successfully developed by the Graduate Institute of Photonics and
      Optoelectronics, National Taiwan University, and has not been commercialized yet. In the
      past, observations by this technology were performed on the skin of five subjects. The early
      stage of the skin clinical trial was approved by Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan
      University Hospital. After the trial, the tested sites of subjects were evaluated by a
      dermatologist immediately, several hours, 24 hours, 3 days, and 1 week. There were no
      inflammatory symptoms, no skin color change, no pigmentation, no wound, no blister formation,
      and no ulceration reported. According to the subjects' experiences, they felt no discomfort
      during the experiment. After the experiment, there were no inflammatory symptoms and signs in
      the observed skin areas. Therefore, the preliminary trial showed that this technology is safe
      for the subjects.

      The investigators invite you to join our experiment during January 2010 and December 2016. In
      our research, the investigators use the non-invasive 1230 nm Cr:Forsterite laser as the light
      source, and utilize the harmonic-generation light microscopic system to observe the skin of
      your forearm or the lesion. During the inspection process, please hold the skin area to be
      inspected on the supporting device, and a sucking disc before the microscope objective is
      adopted to stabilize the site to be observed. Near-infrared light with 1230 nm wavelength
      will be projected on your skin, and the reflected imaging signals are collected by the
      microscope. The investigators will expose the experimental skin area to the laser for no more
      than 30 minutes. The power of the laser the investigators use is limited within 1.5W (the
      power of an ordinary light bulb is 60-100W), and the total energy projected on the skin will
      be no more than 270J, which is equal to the total energy of a light bulb illuminating for 3-5
      seconds. After the experiment, the investigators will examine your inspected skin area
      immediately. The entire process will be around one or two hours, including experiment
      explanation, laser exposure, and evaluation of health condition.

      If you are a patient with suspected melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, or squamous cell
      carcinoma, and already had skin biopsy or had tumor removed by surgery, without affecting
      pathological diagnosis and staging, the investigators will take 0.5x0.5x0.2cm3 chucks of
      tumor and surrounding normal skin from the specimen removed by surgery for observation of the
      harmonic-generation microscope. This process will not affect your following diagnosis and
      therapy.
