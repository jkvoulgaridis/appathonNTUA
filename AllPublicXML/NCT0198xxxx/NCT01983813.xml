  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will examine whether a centralized Prevention Health &amp; Cardiovascular Risk Service
      (PHCVRS) run by clinical pharmacists at the University of Iowa can be implemented in primary
      care offices and whether it can improve the care delivered to patients at risk for developing
      cardiovascular disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of clinical pharmacists in primary care has improved the control of several chronic
      cardiovascular conditions. However, many private physician practices lack the resources to
      implement team-based care with pharmacists. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether
      a centralized, remote, clinical pharmacy service could improve guideline adherence and
      secondary measures of cardiovascular risk in primary care offices in rural and small
      communities.

      This study was a prospective trial in 12 family medicine offices cluster randomized to either
      the intervention or usual care. The intervention was delivered for 12 months, and subjects
      had research visits at baseline and 12 months. The primary outcome was adherence to
      guidelines, and secondary outcomes included changes in key cardiovascular risk factors and
      preventative health measures. We enrolled 302 subjects.

Assessment and counseling for medication adherence, side effects, and lifestyle modifications to decrease risk of cardiovascular disease.
Collaborative communication with the participant's physician to address gaps in screening or therapy, update medication list, and recommend medication changes.
Each participant in this arm will also have access to an online Personal Health Record that can be used to track medications, diagnosed conditions and laboratory values related to cardiovascular disease risk.</description>

Appropriateness of the proposed research for the dataset(s) being requested
Completion of the IRB requirements to obtain the datasets.
Requests that include datasets must have IRB approval (waiver, expedited review, convened review). Some datasets require that the researcher's IRB provide an expedited (Chairman) or convened review for the proposed project. In these cases, an IRB approval is needed because although obvious identifiers have been redacted, the wealth of individual level data that remain (demographic, anthropometric, medical history, personal history, outcomes) means that the possibility of direct identification of a study subject cannot be eliminated.
