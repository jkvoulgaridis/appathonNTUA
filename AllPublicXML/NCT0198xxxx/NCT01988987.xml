  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy-associated diabetes, known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), is associated
      with an increased lifetime risk of developing diabetes mellitus (DM) or pre-diabetes. Up to
      30% of women with GDM will continue have abnormal blood glucose tests 6 or more weeks after
      delivery. Early diagnosis and treatment of continued impaired glucose metabolism or DM is
      essential because serious health problems can result.

      Current guidelines recommend a 75-gram, 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) 6 or more weeks
      after delivery for women diagnosed with GDM in order to identify those with continued DM or
      impaired glucose metabolism. However, approximately half of these women do not get glucose
      testing after delivery. The ability to test women while they are still hospitalized after
      having a baby could greatly increase diagnosis, care and treatment of women with abnormal
      glucose metabolism.

      Our objective is to determine if a 75-gram, 2-hour GTT administered to women with GDM two to
      four days after delivery can identify those who will have an abnormal GTT at 6-12 weeks after
      delivery.

      This will be a prospective cohort study conducted at Winthrop-University Hospital. Women 18
      years old or older who delivered a child or fetus within the previous 4 days at either
      hospital who also were diagnosed with GDM during the pregnancy will be eligible for
      participation. Women will be excluded if they have issues that would interfere with
      administration of a GTT, are unable /unwilling to provide informed consent, or cannot follow
      up. Anticipated enrollment will be 250 women at each study site.

      While still hospitalized two to four days postpartum, subjects will undergo a 75-gram, 2-hour
      GTT and have blood tested for hemoglobin A1c and glucose levels. They will be reminded to do
      the recommended GTT 6-12 weeks after delivery. Maternal, neonatal, and obstetric
      characteristics will be collected, including the any GTT results. The results of the
      in-hospital GTT will be compared to the result of the GTT taken 6-12 weeks postpartum and
      tested for correlation.
