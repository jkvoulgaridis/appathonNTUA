  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to test whether 6 months of supervised weekly Kundalini
      yoga classes and a brief daily meditation homework assignment can improve memory and thinking
      in older adults with mild memory complaints when compared to weekly classes of memory
      training with daily homework assignments.

      The purpose of this pilot study intervention is to investigate brain mechanisms of response
      to memory enhancement training (MET) compared to Kundalini yoga and &quot;Kirtan Kriya&quot; meditation
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that will be acquired from each subject at
      baseline and at 12 weeks (post-randomization).

      Overall, the investigators anticipate recruiting 66 adults with memory complaints and
      diagnosed with MCI for adults 55 years old and older. Subjects will either receive: (1) MET
      class for 60 minutes per week; or (2) Kundalini yoga and &quot;Kirtan Kriya&quot; meditation class for
      60 minutes per week. All assessments will be completed immediately after the interventions
      for a total of 10 visits in 12 weeks and a follow-up visit at 6 months (24 weeks)to monitor
      the overall benefit of the intervention.

    <measure>Cognitive Measures - Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) Total Recall Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome measures were administered by a cognitive battery of neuropsychological and included memory and executive functioning. Verbal memory was measured with the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) total recall scores. The HVLT form contains 12 nouns, four words each from one of three semantic categories (e.g., precious gems, articles of clothing, vegetables, etc.), to be learned over the course of three learning trials. When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score. Total scores range from 0-36 with higher scores indicating better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI measures severity of illness and global improvement. The CGI is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients). CGI global improvement scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcomes measures included mood assessments with the GDS, a self-assessment scale often used in geriatric depression trials. The GDS is a 30-item screening tool used to identify depression in older adults. In scoring the Geriatric Depression Scale, each item is scored 0 or 1. The total score on the scale ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating worse outcome.</description>

    <description>FMRI scans will be obtained at baseline and after 12 weeks follow up. Default mode network findings were analyzed and significant effects were identified for yoga and memory enhancement training groups.</description>

Verbal memory was measured with the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) total recall scores. The HVLT form contains 12 nouns, four words each from one of three semantic categories (e.g., precious gems, articles of clothing, vegetables, etc.), to be learned over the course of three learning trials. When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score. Total scores range from 0-36 with higher scores indicating better outcome.</description>
