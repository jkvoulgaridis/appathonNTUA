  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NeuroVISION Study will characterize the incidence, impact, and risk factors of covert
      stroke in adults undergoing noncardiac surgery. We will determine the incidence of acute
      covert stroke using an MRI study of the brain in the days following noncardiac surgery. We
      will characterize the epidemiology and the impact of covert stroke in patients undergoing
      noncardiac surgery, and its association with cerebral deoxygenation.

      At the University of Wisconsin a planned sub study of NeuroVISION is being conducted aiming
      to enroll 100 patients with additional cognitive testing, MRI sequences and a preoperative
      MRI scan.

      At Hamilton Juravinski Hospital, Hamilton General Hospital, Auckland City Hospital and Prince
      of Wales Hospital a planned sub study of NeuroVISION (PAFS - Perioperative Atrial
      Fibrillation and Postoperative Stroke) is being conducted aiming to enroll 400 participants.
      The purpose of this sub-study is to determine the prevalence of AF(Atrial Fibrillation)
      before surgery (i.e. &quot;background&quot; AF), as well of the incidence of AF after surgery using the
      Icentia CardioSTAT &quot;patch-like&quot; single lead heart rhythm monitor.

    <description>Our primary objective is to characterize the impact of postoperative covert stroke on neurocognitive function 1 year after elective noncardiac surgery, as measured by a decrease of two or more points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale from preoperative baseline test to the 1-year follow-up.</description>

    <description>We will detect acute postoperative covert stroke using an MR study of the brain that will be performed between postoperative days 2 and 9.</description>

    <measure>Physical function after surgery as assessed using the Modified Rankin Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Physical function will be measured using the Modified Rankin Scale. The Modified Rankin Scale is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death. A higher score is worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical function after surgery as assessed using the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADL) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Physical function will be measured using the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADL) Scale. The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale refers to people's daily self-care activities. It consists of 8 activities. A lower score is worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the EQ-5D questionnaire to assess the patients' health-related quality of life. EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life. The first part contains the EQ-5D descriptive system, comprising of 5 questions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. A higher score is worse. The second part is a vertical, visual analogue scale with the end-points of &quot;best imaginable health state&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot;. Scale runs from 0 to 100. A lower score is worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the 5-question version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-5) to measure depressive symptoms. The 5-question version of the Geriatric Depression Scale scoring will be from 0 to 5. The higher values indicate increasing depressive symptoms.</description>
