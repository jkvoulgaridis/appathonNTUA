      Narrative: Tobacco smoking remains the single biggest cause of premature death in the United
      States and the leading cause of cancer and death from cancer. There is therefore an urgent
      need to find effective but practical ways of helping smokers to quit and stay quit. This
      randomized trial aims to evaluate two promising methods of helping smokers to quit and to
      stay quit.

      Design: This is a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial with two stages.

      In Stage 1, 225 smokers will be recruited and at assessment they will be randomly allocated
      to receiving feedback on their &quot;Lung Age&quot; as estimated by their Forced Expiratory volume of
      air from lungs in one second (FEV1), and exhaled carbon-monoxide (CO) (Intervention group 1)
      or to have these measured but not fed back in a manner designed to enhance motivation to quit
      (Control group 1). All participants will be provided with group counseling (6 weekly
      sessions, with the target Quit Date on the day of the second group meeting), and transdermal
      nicotine patches.

      Main outcome measure: Stage 1, Past week tobacco abstinence biochemically validated by
      exhaled CO &lt; 10 ppm at visit 7 (4 weeks after Target Quit Date).

      In Stage 2 (starting visit 7), all participants attending visit 7 (28 days after their Target
      Quit Date), will be randomly allocated to receiving either the Forever Free relapse
      prevention materials (Intervention 2) http://www.smokefree.gov/pdf.html or the Surgeon
      General's Guide &quot;How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease&quot; (Control 2)
      http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2010/consumer_booklet/index.htm.

      All randomized participants will receive a follow-up phone call a week later to remind them
      to read and use the materials they have been given, and will attend a follow up visit (8), 6
      months after their initial Target Quit Date.

      Main outcome measure: Stage 2. Among those who have not smoked in the previous week at visit
      7, sustained tobacco abstinence (including no tobacco use in prior 7 days), validated by
      exhaled CO &lt; 10 ppm at the 6 month visit(8) AND not smoking for any 7 consecutive days during
      the prior 5 months (definition of a relapse in this study).

      Hypothesis: Smokers who are provided with lung age feedback at assessment will have higher
      quit rates 28 days after the target quit date.

    <description>In the intervention group, if the lung age is equal to or less than the individual's chronological age, he or she will be briefly informed that the test result was normal and that it is important to avoid potential future lung problems by stopping smoking. For those in the intervention group with a &quot;normal&quot; FEV-1, the intervention will focus on their exhaled carbon-monoxide.
If their lung age is greater than their chronological age, they will be given their &quot;lung age&quot; in years, and provided with a graph describing the possible decline in lung age if they continued to smoke and a full explanation.
Those in the Intervention Group will have their exhaled carbon-monoxide (CO) result explained in more detail. Non-smokers typically have an exhaled carbon-monoxide level of 0-4 parts per million, whereas smokers typically have a CO level of 8-50 ppm. CO levels return to normal within a few days of stopping smoking. Participants are provided with a full explanation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must report smoking at least 5 cigarettes per day for the previous 6
             months AND sometimes smoke at least 10 cigarettes in one day.

          2. Participants must want to quit smoking and be ready to make a quit attempt within the
             next 30 days.

          3. Participants must plan to remain in the intervention catchment area for at least 8
             months.

          4. Age &gt;18 years. Nicotine patches are not currently approved by FDA for those under age
             18.

          5. Participants must be willing to attend and provide data at the 8 study visits,
             including an assessment visit at which a blood sample will be drawn, 6 group treatment
             sessions, respond to follow-up telephone calls, and a 6-month follow-up visit.

          6. Participants must be able to read and write in English.

          7. Nicotine is known to be harmful to the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose. For this reason women of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry and for the standard duration of transdermal nicotine therapy (10
             weeks). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
             partner is participating in this study, the patient should inform the treating
             clinician immediately.

          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of severe allergic reaction while using a nicotine patch.

          2. Currently using a drug/medicine as an aid to smoking cessation (e.g. Zyban, Chantix,
             nicotine replacement).

          3. Currently pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or nursing, because nicotine is known to
             be harmful to the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose.

          4. Had a heart attack, stroke, continuing arrhythmias or angina (chest pains) or abnormal
             electrocardiogram within the past 4 weeks.

          5. Uncontrolled serious mental illness or substance abuse.

          6. Uses non-cigarette tobacco products and does not plan to quit all tobacco.

            <title>Feedback on Lung Age and Exhaled Carbon Monoxide</title>
            <description>Lung Age feedback and exhaled carbon monoxide (CO): In the intervention group, if the lung age is equal to or less than the individual's chronological age, he or she will be briefly informed that the test result was normal and that it is important to avoid potential future lung problems by stopping smoking. For those in the intervention group with a &quot;normal&quot; FEV-1, the intervention will focus on their exhaled carbon-monoxide. If their lung age is greater than their chronological age, they will be given their &quot;lung age&quot; in years, and provided with a graph describing the possible decline in lung age if they continued to smoke and a full explanation. Those in the Intervention Group will have their CO result explained in more detail. Non-smokers typically have an exhaled carbon-monoxide level of 0-4 parts per million, whereas smokers typically have a CO level of 8-50 ppm. CO levels return to normal within a few days of stopping smoking. Participants are provided with a full explanation.</description>
