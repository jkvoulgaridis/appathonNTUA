    <textblock>
      In pre-clinical study we found that the thioredoxin reductase activity of serum harbours huge
      difference between cancer patients and non-cancer patients, the enzyme activity elevated
      remarkably among cancer patients, and after any kind of treatment serum thioredoxin reductase
      activity declined remarkably, so we hypothesis that serum thioredoxin reductase activity
      could be a warning marker for early progression of first-line treatment for advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer

      This is a cooperative research project involving patients in Medical Oncology Department of
      Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine Central South University, and the
      State Key Laboratory for Natural Medicine and Biomimetic Drugs Perking University. The
      primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity using blood in subjects
      received platinum based chemotherapy, to study the warning progression ability of thioredoxin
      reductase in blood. The secondary objective is to compare the warning progression activity of
      blood thioredoxin reductase reductase activity with carcinoembryonic antigen in subjects
      received platinum based first-line chemotherapy. Blood will be collected before chemotherapy,
      after every 2 cycles of chemotherapy, every 3 months after all first-line chemotherapy till 2
      years, then every 6 months till 3 years, or collect blood till tumor progression, evaluation
      CT results every time collecting blood samples.
