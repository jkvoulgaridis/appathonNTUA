  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure are reported to have lower levels of hydrogen sulfide in their
      blood, even though sulfur is available naturally in the diet. Hydrogen sulfide is a molecule
      that has been shown to have a number of beneficial effects and thus the low levels may
      contribute to the disease. This trial is testing whether a medical food product of synthetic
      sulfur molecules, SG1002, can overcome this deficit in blood levels of hydrogen sulfide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with heart failure have been shown to have a deficit in circulating hydrogen sulfide
      levels, which, since sulfur is not readily bioavailable and is declining in food substances,
      cannot be treated adequately by diet alone. This deficit in circulating hydrogen sulfide is
      thought to lead to increases in oxidative stress and with this, associated problems that can
      contribute to heart failure. This is a study to evaluate the safety and ability of multiple
      doses of oral SG1002 in subjects with heart failure to reverse the deficits in circulating
      hydrogen sulfide. The primary objective is to assess the safety and the ability of multiple
      doses of twice daily administration of SG1002 compared with placebo to increase circulating
      levels of hydrogen sulfide. Initially, a dose escalation study will be carried out for 21
      days in 4 normal subjects, randomized 3:1 active:placebo. Subjects will receive a 200 mg dose
      BID for 7 days and in no adverse events, escalate to 400 mg for 7 days then 800 mg for 7
      days. Safety parameters will be assessed for each dose, along with pharmacokinetic analysis
      and markers of oxidative stress and heart failure. Following completion of the normal healthy
      subjects, 10 heart failure subjects will be randomized 4:1 active:placebo and tested as
      described above.

    <description>At the start of each dose, blood samples will be obtained and circulating hydrogen sulfide levels will be assessed over a 24 hour period to determine whether SG1002 can overcome the deficits reported in heart failure patients. Peak hydrogen sulfide levels were measured during the first 4 hours post-administration when maximum concentrations of hydrogen sulfide were reached.</description>

    <description>BNP levels were measured for the each subject prior to treatment and after 7 days on each treatment dose, thus representing a change in BNP over the 21 day treatment period. Increased BNP levels are associated with worsening heart failure.</description>

          <description>BNP levels were measured for the each subject prior to treatment and after 7 days on each treatment dose, thus representing a change in BNP over the 21 day treatment period. Increased BNP levels are associated with worsening heart failure.</description>
          <population>Levels of BNP were recorded at baseline and every 7 days in the placebo group or the SG1002 dose escalation group.</population>
