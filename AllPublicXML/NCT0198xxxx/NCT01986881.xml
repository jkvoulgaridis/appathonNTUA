    <textblock>
      A study of the cardiovascular outcomes following treatment with ertugliflozin in participants
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established vascular disease. The main objective of
      this study is to assess the cardiovascular safety of ertugliflozin. This trial includes a
      pre-defined glycemic sub-study in participants receiving background insulin with or without
      metformin, a pre-defined glycemic sub-study in participants receiving background sulfonylurea
      monotherapy, and a pre-defined sub-study in participants receiving background metformin with
      sulfonylurea (all fully-enrolled).
