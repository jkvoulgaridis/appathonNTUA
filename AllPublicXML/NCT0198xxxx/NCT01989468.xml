  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score for 28 Joints (DAS28-CRP) (Utilizing hsCRP) in Subjects Treated With Secukinumab Versus Placebo at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-CRP is a measure of disease activity based on 28-Swollen and Tender Joint Count [proximal interphalangeal joints (10 joints) metacarpophalangeal joints (10) wrists (2) elbows (2) shoulders (2) knees (2)], CRP, and the Patient's Global Assessment of disease activity. Values range from 2.0 to 10.0 where higher values mean a higher disease activity. DAS28-CRP &lt; 2.6 is interpreted as remission.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Achieving a Psoriatic Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) Response in Subjects on Secukinumab Versus Placebo at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PASI takes into account the extent of the disease, as well as the severity of erythema, scaling, and thickness in different body areas affected by psoriasis. A PASI75 represents an improvement in the PASI score of at least 75% as compared with baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physical Function Component of the Short-form Health Survey (SF-36-PCS) in Subjects Treated With Secukinumab Versus Placebo at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life across eight domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) can be computed. In this study, SF-36 PCS is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. The SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores (1) physical component summary=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from Baseline= post-Baseline - Baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Achieving a Psoriatic Area and Severity Index 90 (PASI90) Response in Subjects Treated With Secukinumab Versus Placebo at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PASI takes into account the extent of the disease, as well as the severity of erythema, scaling, and thickness in different body areas affected by psoriasis. A PASI90 represents an improvement in the PASI score of at least 90% as compared with baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI Score) in Subjects Treated With Secukinumab Versus Placebo at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ measures physical disability and functional status. It has 4 dimensions: disability, pain, drug side effects and dollar costs. In this trial, only the disability dimension was used. The disability dimension consists of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing 8 common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and activities. Participants choose from four response categories: 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty) and 3 (unable to do). Within each of the 8 categories, only the item indicating the most severe impairment contributes to the category score. The HAQ score is calculated by summing the computed scores for each category and dividing by the number of categories answered. It ranges from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients With Dactylitis at Week 24 in the Subset of Patients Who Had Dactylitis at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of dactylitis was assessed by dactylitis count (number of fingers and toes with dactylitis, with a range of 0-20). If dactylitis is present with any finger or toe, the patient is counted as a patient with dactylitis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients With Enthesitis at Week 24 in the Subset of Patients Who Had Enthesitis at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of Enthesitis was assessed using a validated enthesitis index that uses 6 sites for evaluation of enthesitis: lateral epicondyle humerus L + R, proximal achilles L + R and medial condyle femur. If enthesitis is present at any of the 6 sites, the subject is counted as a subject with enthesitis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms (1:1:1) and planned to be treated for 156 weeks. Placebo non-responders had the option to be re-randomized at Week 16 and placebo responders had the option to be re-randomized at Week 24. Thus, of the 137 original placebo patients 64 were re-randomized to AIN457 150 mg and 65 to AIN457 300 mg.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A screening period (SCR) running up to 10 weeks before randomization was used to assess eligibility.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Physical Function Component of the Short-form Health Survey (SF-36-PCS) in Subjects Treated With Secukinumab Versus Placebo at Week 24</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life across eight domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) can be computed. In this study, SF-36 PCS is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. The SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores (1) physical component summary=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from Baseline= post-Baseline - Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI Score) in Subjects Treated With Secukinumab Versus Placebo at Week 24</title>
        <description>The HAQ measures physical disability and functional status. It has 4 dimensions: disability, pain, drug side effects and dollar costs. In this trial, only the disability dimension was used. The disability dimension consists of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing 8 common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and activities. Participants choose from four response categories: 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty) and 3 (unable to do). Within each of the 8 categories, only the item indicating the most severe impairment contributes to the category score. The HAQ score is calculated by summing the computed scores for each category and dividing by the number of categories answered. It ranges from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI Score) in Subjects Treated With Secukinumab Versus Placebo at Week 24</title>
          <description>The HAQ measures physical disability and functional status. It has 4 dimensions: disability, pain, drug side effects and dollar costs. In this trial, only the disability dimension was used. The disability dimension consists of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing 8 common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and activities. Participants choose from four response categories: 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty) and 3 (unable to do). Within each of the 8 categories, only the item indicating the most severe impairment contributes to the category score. The HAQ score is calculated by summing the computed scores for each category and dividing by the number of categories answered. It ranges from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
