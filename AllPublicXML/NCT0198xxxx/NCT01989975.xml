      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance, patient satisfaction and safety of
      connectivity gateway device CareLink Connect, transferring CGM (Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring) data from a VEO insulin pump to CareLink online (every 5th minute) and thereby
      making it available for patients or Care Partners individual web connected devices such as
      smartphones, tablets and PCs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject between the age of 12 - 65 years that has a clinical diagnosis of insulin
             requiring diabetes for at least 1 year

          2. Subject is currently using a Paradigm® Veo™ Medtronic insulin pump for at least 3
             months and willing to continue to use for the duration of the study.

          3. Subject has sufficient Continuous Glucose Monitoring use experience, as determined by
             the Investigator, and is willing to continuously use CGM for the duration of the
             study.

             Guidelines to evaluate the patients experience are:

             i. Subject has a minimum of 30 days of CGM use within a year prior to enrollment.

             ii. Subject has experience with and is able to, or has a Care Partner who can:

               1. Insert/change sensor,

               2. Recharge the transmitter.

               3. Read sensor data in real-time on the insulin pump screen.

          4. Subject is willing to, or has a Care Partner who can, perform at least the minimum
             required (2 per day) Blood Glucose readings to maintain CGM Sensor calibration.

          5. Subject, if under the age of 18, has a Care Partner who is willing to participate to
             the study, attend the study visit with the subject, and complete user's feedback
             questionnaires and Care Partner diary. Care Partners are optional for patients of 18
             years of age or older.

          6. Subject and/or Care Partner have access to a computer with Internet access.
