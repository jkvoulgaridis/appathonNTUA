  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a forearm rotation orthosis combined
      with the occupational therapy task-oriented approach on functional performance for persons
      with a hemiparetic arm.

      Hypotheses of this study are:

        1. participants who wear the forearm rotation orthosis will demonstrate significantly
           greater improvement in functional performance and active range of motion of forearm
           rotators compared to those who do not;

        2. all participants who receive the occupational therapy task-oriented approach
           intervention will demonstrate significant improvement in functional performance; and

        3. all participants who receive the occupational therapy task-oriented approach
           intervention will demonstrate improvement in motor function of the upper extremity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction often have difficulty incorporating
      their affected limb effectively and efficiently into functional tasks due to muscle weakness
      and/or spasticity. This may further interfere with their performance of everyday activities
      and restrict life roles. Traditional rehabilitation interventions emphasize spasticity
      reduction. However, active movement and muscle strength of forearm supination are found
      strongly related to motor function, rather than spasticity. In contrast, task-oriented
      movement training trials have demonstrated promising evidence that persons with CNS
      dysfunction benefit from the training in improvement of motor function and increase
      functional use of the affected limb.

      Orthotic intervention is one therapeutic option for this population. Most orthotic designs
      for this population are static, developed for sympton reduction or deformity prevention, and
      aimed at the wrist and hand. However, its effects on spasticity reduction remain
      controversial. Given that static orthotics may interfere with functional performance and
      further develop the learned nonuse of the affected limb, a dynamic or mobilization orthosis
      would be appropriate for enhancing functional performance. Moreover, an orthosis that assists
      forearm rotation is speculated to enhance functional performance. This study will examine the
      efficacy of a forearm rotation orthosis combined with the occupational therapy task-oriented
      approach on functional performance for persons with a hemiparetic arm.

    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) - Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 8, and 15</time_frame>
    <description>Used to evaluate participants' self-perceived functional performance. In this structured interview, participants are asked to select 5 tasks to perform and then rate their perception of how well they are able to complete each task on a scale of 1 (unable to perform) to 10 (able to perform extremely well). Total scores are an mean of individual task scores and also range from 1 (unable to perform tasks) to 5 (able to perform tasks extremely well). Collected data will be used to measure changes within and between groups on self-perceived performance between week 1 and 8, week 1 and 15, as well as week 8 and 15.</description>

        <title>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) - Performance</title>
        <description>Used to evaluate participants' self-perceived functional performance. In this structured interview, participants are asked to select 5 tasks to perform and then rate their perception of how well they are able to complete each task on a scale of 1 (unable to perform) to 10 (able to perform extremely well). Total scores are an mean of individual task scores and also range from 1 (unable to perform tasks) to 5 (able to perform tasks extremely well). Collected data will be used to measure changes within and between groups on self-perceived performance between week 1 and 8, week 1 and 15, as well as week 8 and 15.</description>

          <title>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) - Satisfaction</title>
          <description>Used to evaluate participants' self-perceived satisfaction with performance. In this structured interview, participants are asked to select 5 tasks to perform and then rate their satisfaction of how well they are able to complete each task on a scale of 1 (unsatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied). Total scores are an mean of individual task scores and also range from 1 (unsatisfied) to 5 (completely satisfied). Collected data will be used to measure changes within and between groups on self-perceived satisfaction with performance between week 1 and 8, week 1 and 15, as well as week 8 and 15.</description>

        <title>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) - Time</title>
        <description>This test will be used to quantitatively assess participants' motor function of the upper extremity. Participants will be asked to complete 15 tasks, each within a 120-second window. The number of seconds required to complete the task is recorded. If the participant exceeds 120 seconds, no additional time will be added and 120 seconds will be recorded. The total score is calculated as a mean of score (in seconds) from the 15 tasks. Collected data will be used to measure changes within and between groups between week 1 and 8, week 1 and 15, as well as week 8 and 15.</description>
