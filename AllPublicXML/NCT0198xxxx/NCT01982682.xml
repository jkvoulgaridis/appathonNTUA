      This phase II trial studies how well total-body irradiation, donor lymphocyte infusion, and
      cyclophosphamide before donor stem cell transplant works in treating patients with high-risk
      hematologic malignancies. Giving total-body irradiation, donor lymphocyte infusion, and
      chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer and abnormal
      cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When
      certain stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone
      marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.
      Removing the T cells from the donor cells before transplant and giving tacrolimus and
      mycophenolate mofetil may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1) To assess 1 year relapse free survival in high risk patients undergoing hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant (HSCT) using the Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) 2 step approach with 2
      days inserted between the last fraction of total-body irradiation (TBI) and the infusion of
      donor T cells (donor lymphocyte infusion [DLI]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess regimen related toxicity in this updated conditioning regimen,
           graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence and severity, and overall survival in
           patients undergoing treatment on this protocol.

        2. To assess the consistency and pace of engraftment.

        3. To assess the pace of T cell and B cell immune recovery.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients undergo TBI twice daily (BID) on days -10 to -8, undergo DLI
      on day -6, and receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ selected allogeneic HSCT on
      day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) beginning on day -1 with
      taper beginning by day 42, and mycophenolate mofetil IV BID on days -1 to 28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.

    <description>Will be reported descriptively. Successful engraftment is defined as ANC (absolute neutrophil count, the number of white blood cells (WBCs) that are neutrophils) ≥ 0.5x109/L for at least 30 days and Platelet engraftment &gt; 20,000 with no transfusion x 7 days.</description>

    <measure>Count of Participants That Experienced Death as a Result of Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after HSCT</time_frame>
    <description>Graft versus host disease was clinically characterized based on 4 stages of progression for three major body areas, skin, liver, gut. Subjects who experienced life threatening reactions in their skin, liver and gut ultimately experienced functional impairment and expired.
Life threatening reactions in the Skin were characterized by desquamation (the shedding of the outer layers of skin) and bullae (a bubblelike cavity filled with air or fluid, in particular).
Life threatening reactions in the Liver were characterized by Bilirubin, &gt; 15 mg/dl Life threatening reactions in the Gut were characterized by Pain +/- ileus (a painful obstruction of the ileum or other part of the intestine.)</description>

    <description>An excess amount of residual T-lymphocytes in the Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Collection (PBSC) product may increase the risk of GVHD. The ideal amount of T-cells left in the PBSC product is no greater than 5x104/kg. Every effort will be made to keep T-cell amounts to below this threshold. The median pace of T-cell immune recovery at 28 days will be monitored by collecting cluster of differentiation (CD24) and (CD38).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. This treatment is for patients with high risk hematologic malignancies. High risk is
             defined as:

               -  Any patient with a hematologic malignancy with residual disease after treatment
                  with 1 or more chemotherapy regimens in whom achievement of remission with
                  additional chemoradiotherapy is felt to be unlikely

               -  Patients without morphologic evidence of disease but with high risk features
                  which would predict for relapse despite remission at HSCT such as adverse
                  cytogenetics, 3rd or greater CR (complete response), or failure to recover
                  peripheral blood counts to normal ranges. While these patients do not have
                  detectable disease by current methods, like all patients they have non-detectable
                  disease which in their case is highly aggressive.

          2. Patients must have one related donor who is HLA (human leukocyte antigen) mismatched
             in the GVHD direction at two or more HLA loci

          3. Patients must adequate organ function:

               -  LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) of &gt;50 %

               -  Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (adjusted for
                  hemoglobin) &gt;50 % of predicted and forced expiration to the full FEV-1 &gt;50 %

               -  Adequate liver function as defined by a serum bilirubin &lt;1.8, AST (aspartate
                  aminotransferase) or ALT (alanine aminotransferase) &lt; 2.5X upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine clearance of &gt; 60 ml/min

          4. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of &gt; 80% on the modified (KPS) tool

          5. Patients must be willing to use contraception if they have childbearing potential

          6. Able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Modified (KPS) Karnofsky Performance status of &lt;80%

          2. &gt; 5 Comorbidity Points on the Hematopoietic cell transplantation - specific
             comorbidity (HCT-CI) Index (See Appendix B)

          3. Class I or II antibodies against donor human leukocyte antigens (HLA)

          4. HIV positive

          5. Active involvement of the central nervous system with malignancy

          6. Psychiatric disorder that would preclude patients from signing an informed consent

          7. Pregnancy, or unwillingness to use contraception if they have child bearing potential

          8. Patients with life expectancy of &lt; 6 months for reasons other than their underlying
             hematologic/oncologic disorder

          9. Alemtuzumab treatment within 8 weeks of HSCT admission

         10. Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) level of &gt; 2 ugm/ml

         11. Patients with active inflammatory processes including T max &gt;101 or active tissue
             inflammation are excluded

         12. Inability to tolerate cyclophosphamide or undergo total body irradiation at the doses
             specified in the treatment plan

        <description>Graft versus host disease was clinically characterized based on 4 stages of progression for three major body areas, skin, liver, gut. Subjects who experienced life threatening reactions in their skin, liver and gut ultimately experienced functional impairment and expired.
Life threatening reactions in the Skin were characterized by desquamation (the shedding of the outer layers of skin) and bullae (a bubblelike cavity filled with air or fluid, in particular).
Life threatening reactions in the Liver were characterized by Bilirubin, &gt; 15 mg/dl Life threatening reactions in the Gut were characterized by Pain +/- ileus (a painful obstruction of the ileum or other part of the intestine.)</description>
