  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient anatomy and position during the course of radiation therapy can vary from those used
      for treatment planning; a function of patient movement, uncertainty in positioning system,
      and organ motion. Traditionally, treatment margins are designed to compensate for
      interfraction prostate setup variability. This approach has the potential to lower the
      overall effectiveness of treatment because the prostate gland is a continuously moving target
      whose motion cannot be accurately accounted for solely on the basis of interfraction
      movement. More recently, the dosimetric relevance of intra-fraction prostate motion has been
      recognized, and may be compensated for by continuous real-time adaptive radiation therapy
      afforded by the Calypso 4D Localization Systemâ„¢. In the current study, the investigators
      propose to characterize intrafraction prostate motion. The investigators hypothesize that
      intrafraction prostate motion is correlated with respiratory motion.
