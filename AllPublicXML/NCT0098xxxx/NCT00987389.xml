    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether plasma exchange as well as
      immunosuppressive therapy are effective in reducing death and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
      The trial will also study whether a reduced cumulative dosing regimen of glucocorticoids is
      as effective as a standard disease regimen.

      The FDA-OOPD is one of the funding sources for this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are
      syndromes of primary systemic vasculitis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies
      (ANCA). Together, these syndromes are grouped as ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis (AAV).

      Plasma exchange, a method of rapidly removing potentially pathogenic ANCA and other mediators
      of inflammation and coagulation, has shown promise as an adjunctive therapy in AAV to improve
      early disease control and improve rates of renal recovery in severe disease. Glucocorticoids
      (steroids) are a standard of care in the treatment of AAV. High doses of glucocorticoids
      early in disease, although reduce disease activity due to their anti-inflammatory and
      immunosuppressive properties, also increase the risk of infection, particularly in the
      elderly and in the presence of uremia. There is no randomized trial data to guide
      glucocorticoids dosing.

      Patients with severe new or relapsing AAV and pulmonary hemorrhage and/or renal disease will
      be eligible for this trial.

      Subjects participating in this study will be randomized to receive one of the following
      groups;

        1. Plasma exchange - 7 exchanges and, either standard or low-dose glucocorticoids or

        2. No plasma exchange and, either standard or low-dose glucocorticoids

      All studies will receive standard remission-induction therapy with either cyclophosphamide or
      rituximab.

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life Using the EQ-5D Index Descriptive System</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQoL-5 Dimensions consist of 2 elements: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of following 5 dimensions: 1.Mobility, 2.Self-Care, 3.Usual Activities, 4.Pain/Discomfort and 5.Anxiety/Depression. Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels: 1: no problems; 2: slight problems; 3: moderate problems; 4: severe problems; 5: Unable to do. The digits for each of 5 dimensions were combined in a 5-digit number describing the participant's health state: e.g. state 11111 indicates no problem on any of the 5 dimensions. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is a health state equivalent to death; negative values are valued as worse than death) to 1 (perfect health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>704 subjects were enrolled into the study and randomized to either plasma exchange or no plasma exchange, and randomized to receive either standard dose GC or reduced dose GC.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Plasma Exchange With Standard Glucocorticoids</title>
          <description>Plasma Exchange: Plasma exchange is a procedure whereby blood is taken from the body and separated by a machine into blood cells and plasma, which is the liquid part of blood. The plasma is discarded and the blood cells are returned to the body with a plasma substitute.
Glucocorticoids: During the study, a standard glucocorticoids dose regimen will be compared to a reduced glucocorticoids dose regimen. All subjects' patients will receive the same glucocorticoids dose for the first two weeks then will follow a standard regimen.</description>

Glucocorticoids: During the study, a standard glucocorticoids dose regimen will be compared to a reduced glucocorticoids dose regimen. All subjects' patients will receive the same glucocorticoids dose for the first two weeks then the dose will decrease following either a standard regimen or a reduced regimen.</description>

        <title>Health-related Quality of Life Using the EQ-5D Index Descriptive System</title>
        <description>EuroQoL-5 Dimensions consist of 2 elements: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of following 5 dimensions: 1.Mobility, 2.Self-Care, 3.Usual Activities, 4.Pain/Discomfort and 5.Anxiety/Depression. Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels: 1: no problems; 2: slight problems; 3: moderate problems; 4: severe problems; 5: Unable to do. The digits for each of 5 dimensions were combined in a 5-digit number describing the participant's health state: e.g. state 11111 indicates no problem on any of the 5 dimensions. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is a health state equivalent to death; negative values are valued as worse than death) to 1 (perfect health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility.</description>
