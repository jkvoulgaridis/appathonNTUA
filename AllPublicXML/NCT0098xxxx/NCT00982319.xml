  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of a broccoli sprout preparation on
      specific factors in breast tissue that are related to breast cancer risk and to assess
      whether sulforaphane a key component of broccoli sprouts increases the levels of protective
      enzymes in breast tissue. In addition, the investigators will also examine how acceptable the
      broccoli sprouts preparation is to the study participants.

      A double-blind randomized Phase II chemoprevention trial of BSE versus placebo will be
      conducted in up to 35 women diagnosed with DCIS on core biopsy prior to their definitive
      surgery (study diagram below). The primary study endpoint will be a decrease in the mean
      proliferative rate measured by Ki67%.

      Women diagnosed with DCIS on core or incisional/excisional biopsy scheduled for definitive
      surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital will be recruited for this study. Participants will be
      placed on a cruciferous free diet for the 14 days prior to their surgical date and drink a
      randomized intervention beverage (mango juice with or without broccoli sprout extract).
      Additionally participants will provide 2 blood and 2 urine sample collections, report
      medication use and adverse events using prepared forms and complete a daily diet check list
      during the 14 day intervention. On the day of definitive breast surgery, 1-2 grams of breast
      tissue (including normal adjacent breast tissue) will be collected during surgery.

    <description>Pathologists score the slides without knowledge of treatment assignment at the end of the study. All pre-post samples from one individual will be evaluated together. Quality control for these stains is performed routinely in the immunohistochemistry lab (using lymphoid tissue for Ki67). Initial scoring is performed where possible on a minimum of 3000 cells, by counting the number of positive cells divided by the total number of cells. DCIS lesions will be scored separately to adjacent normal tissue. The rationale for selecting Ki67 as a measure of cellular proliferation includes the robustness of the staining reaction, correlation with the S phase fraction of the cell cycle and mitotic index and that it can be successfully ascertained from core breast biopsies provided there is an adequate yield of epithelial cells. A negative value reflects a decrease in ki67 positive cells, therefore a decrease in cellular proliferation.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Mean Proliferative Rate Measured by Ki67%</title>
        <description>Pathologists score the slides without knowledge of treatment assignment at the end of the study. All pre-post samples from one individual will be evaluated together. Quality control for these stains is performed routinely in the immunohistochemistry lab (using lymphoid tissue for Ki67). Initial scoring is performed where possible on a minimum of 3000 cells, by counting the number of positive cells divided by the total number of cells. DCIS lesions will be scored separately to adjacent normal tissue. The rationale for selecting Ki67 as a measure of cellular proliferation includes the robustness of the staining reaction, correlation with the S phase fraction of the cell cycle and mitotic index and that it can be successfully ascertained from core breast biopsies provided there is an adequate yield of epithelial cells. A negative value reflects a decrease in ki67 positive cells, therefore a decrease in cellular proliferation.</description>

Broccoli sprout extract (sulforaphane): Women newly diagnosed with DCIS on core biopsy prior to definitive surgery will be randomized to either a prepartion of broccoli sprout extract and mango juice or a placebo preparation of mango juice alone. All women will be on a cruciferous free diet for the duration of the study (14 days) and complete a daily dietary check list. Twelve hour urine collections and blood samples will be collected at various time points during the study. Acceptability of the 14 day dose will be evaluated by monitoring indices of compliance, including urinary measurements of ITC excretion, the daily food check list and a questionnaire administered at the end of the study.</description>
