          <description>Participants received IV infusion of MEDI- 551 12 mg/kg on Days 2 and 8 during Cycle 1 and on Day 1 during Cycle 2 (28-day cycle) in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22. From Cycle 3 onwards, only MEDI- 551 8 mg/kg was administered on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle. The treatment was continued until the participants experienced unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, reached complete response or withdrew consent.</description>

          <description>Duration of objective response (DOR) is the first documentation of objective response to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or relapse according to IWG criteria. PD is defined as any new lesion or increase by &gt;=50% of previously involved sites from nadir. For nodal masses: appearance of a new lesion(s) &gt; 1.5 cm in any axis, &gt;= 50% increase in SPD of more than one node, or &gt;= 50% increase in longest diameter of a previously identified node &gt; 1 cm in short axis lesions PET positive if FDG-avid lymphoma or PET positive prior to therapy. For spleen: &gt; 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previous lesions. For bone marrow: New or recurrent involvement. Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate DOR.</description>
          <population>Evaluable population for efficacy included all participants who received any treatment of MEDI-551 and completed at least one post-baseline disease assessment. The DOR were calculated for participants with objective response.</population>

        <description>Disease control includes CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for at least 8 weeks according to IWG criteria. The CR is disappearance of all evidence of disease. Nodal masses; FDG-avid or PET positive prior to therapy; mass of any size permitted if PET negative. FDG-avid or PET negative; regression to normal size on CT. Spleen; not palpable, nodules disappeared. Bone marrow; infiltrate cleared on repeat biopsy; if indeterminate by morphology, IHC was negative. PR is regression of measurable disease and no new sites. Nodal masses: &gt;= 50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 largest dominant masses; no increase in size of other nodes (a) FDG-avid or PET positive prior to therapy; one or more PET positive at previously involved site (b) Variably FDG-avid or PET negative; regression on CT. Spleen and liver: &gt;= 50% decrease in SPD of nodules; no increase in size of liver or spleen. For bone marrow: irrelevant if positive prior to therapy. SD is failure to attain CR/PR or PD.</description>

          <population>Evaluable population for efficacy included all participants who received any treatment of MEDI-551 and completed at least one post-baseline disease assessment. TTR were calculated for the participants with objective response.</population>

        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is measured from the start of MEDI-551 treatment until the first documentation of disease progression, relapse or death, whichever occurs first. The PFS was censored on the date of last disease assessment for participants who have no documented PD/relapse or death prior to data cutoff, dropout, or the initiation of alternative anticancer therapy. Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate PFS.</description>

        <title>Duration of Objective Response for Part A</title>
        <description>The DOR is the first documentation of objective response to the first documented PD or relapse according to IWG criteria. PD is defined as any new lesion or increase by &gt;=50% of previously involved sites from nadir. For nodal masses: appearance of a new lesion(s) &gt; 1.5 cm in any axis, &gt;= 50% increase in SPD of more than one node, or &gt;= 50% increase in longest diameter of a previously identified node &gt; 1 cm in short axis lesions PET positive if FDG-avid lymphoma or PET positive prior to therapy. For spleen: &gt; 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previous lesions. For bone marrow: New or recurrent involvement. Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate DOR.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 of all Cycles, then every 2 months during the first year of treatment and then every 6 months until end of treatment (unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdraws consent, whichever occurred first) (approximately 9 years)</time_frame>

For spleen; not palpable, nodules disappeared. For bone marrow; infiltrate cleared on repeat biopsy; if indeterminate by morphology, IHC was negative. PR is regression of measurable disease and no new sites. For nodal masses: &gt;= 50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 largest dominant masses; no increase in size of other nodes (a) FDG-avid or PET positive prior to therapy; one or more PET positive at previously involved site (b) Variably FDG-avid or PET negative; regression on CT. For spleen and liver: &gt;= 50% decrease in SPD of nodules; no increase in size of liver or spleen. For bone marrow: irrelevant if positive prior to therapy.

          <title>Trough Serum Concentration of MEDI-551 by Treatment Cycle</title>
          <description>Trough serum concentration (Ctrough) is defined as lowest concentration reached by a drug before the next dose is administered. The Ctrough concentration of MEDI-551 by treatment cycle is reported.</description>
          <population>Pharmacokinetic population included all participants who received at least one dose of MEDI-551 and had at least one measurable serum concentration of MEDI-551. The “Number of Participants Analyzed” denotes the number of participants evaluated for specific day.</population>
