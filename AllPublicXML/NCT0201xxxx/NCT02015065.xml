  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      -Some people with wild-type gastrointestinal stromal tumors (WT-GIST) have a deficiency in
      one of their proteins called succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). Vandetanib is a cancer drug that
      has been approved to treat thyroid cancer and has been used with some success in other tumors
      that have a similar loss of SDH. Researchers want to see if this drug can also decrease tumor
      growth in people with WT-GIST.

      Objectives:

      -To test whether the study drug will benefit people with WT-GIST.

      Eligibility:

      -Adults and children 3 years old and older with WT-GIST.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will test participants tumor tissue to confirm it is the wild type of GIST.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.
           They will also have electrical recording of the heart (Eastern Cooperative Oncology
           Group (ECOG)) and scans of the tumor.

        -  Participants will take the study drug in 28-day cycles. Their doctor will decide how
           many cycles they can complete.

             -  They will take the study drug once every day and record it in a diary.

             -  On Day 14, they will also visit their doctor to look for side effects.

        -  Before cycles 2, 3 and 4, participants will have a physical exam, urine tests, blood
           pressure check, and blood tests. These tests will then be done periodically for as long
           as they are in the study.

        -  Before cycle 4, scans will be done to check the size of the cancer. Most of these will
           be repeated every 3-6 cycles.

        -  When they stop taking the study drug, participants will return to the clinic for a
           physical exam and blood tests.

      Background:

        -  Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the
           gastrointestinal tract, resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. KIT
           and platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutations have been
           identified as tumor initiating events in 85% of adult patients with GIST, but 85% of
           GISTs in pediatric patients lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations (wild-type) and imatinib is
           not as effective in eliciting objective responses.

        -  Recent work in the Pediatric and Wild-Type (wt) GIST Clinic at the National Cancer
           Institute (NCI) led to the identification of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) germline
           mutations in 12% patients with wt-GIST (6/34). SDH protein expression evaluated using
           immunohistochemistry (IHC) was markedly decreased or absent in 18/18 patients with
           pediatric wt-GIST. Thus the majority of wt-GIST are SDH-deficient. Vandetanib (ZACTIMA;
           ZD6474; AstraZeneca) is an oral small molecule antineoplastic drug that inhibits
           vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), estimated glomerular filtration
           rate (EGFR), and rearranged during transfection (RET)-dependent signaling. Preliminary
           preclinical data demonstrate marked growth inhibition of SDH-mutant/deficient renal cell
           carcinoma cell lines when treated with vandetanib.

      Objective(s):

      -Primary: To assess the clinical activity (radiographic response Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) of vandetanib in children and adults with wt-GIST using RECIST
      (v1.1).

      Eligibility:

      -Adults and children with measurable localized or metastatic wt-GIST confirmed in a Clinical
      Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratory will be eligible for trial participation.
      Patients must have measurable disease by RECISTv1.1 and adequate organ function.

      Design:

        -  This phase II trial will determine whether daily oral vandetanib is active in patients
           with wt-GIST. Vandetanib activity will be assessed primarily by radiographic response of
           measurable disease using RECISTv1.1.

        -  Vandetanib will be administered orally once daily continuously in the absence of
           toxicity or disease progression, using a 28-day cycle.

        -  Patients will be carefully monitored for toxicity and response. A small, optimal
           two-stage phase II design with a target response rate of 25% will be used. Nine
           evaluable patients will be enrolled initially. If 1 or more of the first 9 have a
           response, then accrual would continue until a total of 24 patients have enrolled. If
           there are 3 or more responses in 24 (12.5% or more) patients, then this would be
           sufficiently interesting activity to warrant further study.

    <description>Clinical activity will be assessed primarily by radiographic response of measurable disease using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Complete Response is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study); (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable Disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

    <description>The count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events was assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned.</description>

        must sign an informed consent document for this trial, indicating that they are aware of
        the investigational nature of the proposed treatment, the risks and benefits of
        participating and the alternatives to participating, prior to the conduct of any study
        procedures.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Presence of any of the following will prevent a subject from participation:

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females because vandetanib may be harmful to the developing
             fetus or nursing infant and has been found to be embryotoxic, fetotoxic and
             teratogenic in rats.

          -  Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents or who have received an
             investigational agent within 28 days prior to enrollment (does not apply to

             of these electrolyte abnormalities with supplements is allowed. (Serum calcium above
             the CTCAE Grade 1 upper limit. In cases where the serum calcium is below the normal
             range, the calcium adjusted for albumin is to be obtained and substituted for the
             measured serum value. Exclusion is to then be based on the calcium adjusted for
             albumin values falling below the normal limit: Corrected Calcium = Ca + 0.8 x (4-serum

        <title>Number of Participants With a Clinical Activity-radiographic Response</title>
        <description>Clinical activity will be assessed primarily by radiographic response of measurable disease using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Complete Response is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study); (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable Disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

One cycle = 28 days. If vandetanib was tolerated at 200mg daily the dose was increased to 300mg daily. Because of excessive toxicity at the 300mg daily dose the study was amended to maintain a dose of 200mg daily in patients 18 years and older after cycle 3.</description>
