      Aim 1: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the personalized continuation treatment
      strategy.

      Aim 2: Estimate variances of primary and secondary outcomes with the continuation treatment.

      Aim 3: Conduct exploratory hypothesis-generating analyses to inform further development of
      the personalized continuation treatment strategy to be tested in a subsequent R01 proposal.

      Male and female adolescents (ages 12-18) will be eligible for the study if they completed
      acute phase treatment and showed at least a partial response to treatment (CGI-I of minimally
      improved or better (CGI-I &lt; 3)). Adolescents will enter continuation treatment having either
      received 12 sessions of IPT-A, 16 sessions of IPT-A, or 12 sessions of IPT-A plus
      fluoxetine.This is a continuation of the study &quot;An Adaptive Treatment Strategy for Adolescent
      Depression (PTAD)&quot; NCT01802437

    <measure>Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks, 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDRS-R is a clinician-administered semi-structured interview designed to assess present episode and lifetime history of psychiatric diagnoses based on DSM-IV criteria. This survey contains 17 items; 3 items are rated on a scale from 0 to 5, 5 items are rated on a scale from 0 to 6, and the remaining 9 items are rated on a scale from 0 to 7. Total score is a raw sum of the 17 item scores and ranges from 0 to 108. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks, 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGAS is a numeric scale used by mental health clinicians to rate the general functioning of youths under the age of 18. Scores range from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks, 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BDI-II is a 21-item self-report multiple-choice inventory that assesses the severity of depressive symptoms reflective of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria over the prior week. Items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. Total scores are a sum of the 21 item scores ranging from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate more severe depression symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Adjustment Scale - Self Report (SAS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks, 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS-SR is a 42-item self report measure of role performance in the past 2 weeks. Items are rated on a 5-point scale. Total scores are calculated by summing the 42 item scores and dividing by the total number of items answered. Total scores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater impairment of functioning.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will receive interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A) only.
During the Continuation IPT-A sessions, the therapist will continue to emphasize the interpersonal strategies that were learned and practiced during the acute phase, and address any current interpersonal problems before they result in a recurrence of depressive symptoms. Adolescents who have responded to acute phase treatment (CGI-I = much improved or very much improved) will attend 4 biweekly IPT-A sessions followed by 2 monthly sessions.</description>

Adolescents who have responded to acute phase treatment (CGI-I = much improved or very much improved) will attend 4 biweekly IPT-A sessions followed by 2 monthly sessions and will continue their acute phase fluoxetine dosing regimen and will meet with the psychiatrist on a monthly basis.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will receive interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A) and fluoxetine treatment.
Adolescents who received only IPT-A during acute phase and who showed a partial response (CGI-I = minimally improved) will attend 8 weekly IPT-A sessions followed by 2 monthly sessions and will begin treatment with fluoxetine during the continuation phase.The dosage schedule will be 10mg per day for the first week and 20mg per day for the following 5 weeks. If no treatment response is observed by the 6th week, the dosage can be increased to 40mg per day. Pharmacotherapy sessions will be scheduled weekly for the first 4 weeks and biweekly thereafter. Pharmacotherapy sessions will include assessment of vital signs, adverse effects, safety, and symptomatic response.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will receive interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A) and fluoxetine treatment.
Adolescents who received IPT-A and fluoxetine during the acute phase and were partial responders (CGI-I = minimally improved) will attend 8 weekly IPT-A sessions followed by 2 monthly sessions and will have their fluoxetine dose increased to 60mg. Partial responders will meet with the psychiatrist biweekly for the first 2 months and monthly for the second 2 months.</description>

        <description>The CDRS-R is a clinician-administered semi-structured interview designed to assess present episode and lifetime history of psychiatric diagnoses based on DSM-IV criteria. This survey contains 17 items; 3 items are rated on a scale from 0 to 5, 5 items are rated on a scale from 0 to 6, and the remaining 9 items are rated on a scale from 0 to 7. Total score is a raw sum of the 17 item scores and ranges from 0 to 108. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity.</description>
