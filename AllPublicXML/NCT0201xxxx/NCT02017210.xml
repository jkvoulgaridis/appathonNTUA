  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are overweight and/or obese are at risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
      However, research has shown that some overweight and/or obese individuals remain
      insulin-sensitive and metabolically healthy despite their unhealthy body weight.

      The investigators hypothesise that overweight and/or obese people who were deemed
      insulin-sensitive in previous studies will maintain their insulin sensitivity and metabolic
      health over time. The investigators also hypothesise that the preservation of insulin
      sensitivity will be accompanied by key metabolic health markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While obesity is a risk factor for metabolic disease, sub cohorts with obesity not
      complicated by the metabolic syndrome have been described. These so called &quot;metabolically
      healthy obese&quot; may have reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause
      mortality compared with individuals with obesity who present with components of the metabolic
      syndrome.

      Longitudinal studies with diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk endpoints reported that
      individuals with obesity who are metabolically healthy (MHO) held an intermediate health
      status, such that they were still worse off than the healthy normal-weight individuals. While
      there have been studies evaluating the stability of the MHO phenotype over time, no study has
      reported the durability of insulin-sensitivity per se, as measured by the gold-standard
      hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. In the present study, we aimed to trace the change in
      insulin resistance/sensitivity, and to uncover predictors of insulin resistance in older age.
      The secondary aims were to trace the change in body composition, fat distribution and
      metabolic markers over time in a well-phenotyped cohort studied approximately 5-6 years
      apart.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The study is limited by the small sample size, and the potential bias relating to populations likely to volunteer to studies which may have affected the findings. Furthermore, some data were missing for some individuals.</limitations_and_caveats>
