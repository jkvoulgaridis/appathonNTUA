          -  To be included in the study- participants are required to have a &amp; b.(mentioned below)

               1. Pain with one of the two tests

                    -  Neer's sign: passive overpressure at full shoulder flexion with the scapula
                       fixed

                    -  Hawkins test: passive internal rotation at 90 degree of shoulder flexion in
                       the scapular plane and in progressive degree of horizontal adduction

               2. Pain with one of the two tests

                    -  Painful arc: active shoulder abduction

                    -  Jobe's test: The examiner passively elevates the patient's shoulder to 90
                       degrees of abduction with internal rotation. The examiner then applies a
                       downward pressure against the arm

             osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint, severe skeletal abnormalities decreasing the
             subacromial space and etc.

          -  Presence of shoulder pain with limitation of both active and passive movements of the
             glenohumeral joint of 25% in at least 2 directions (abduction, flexion, external
             rotation, internal rotation), as compared with the contralateral shoulder or with
