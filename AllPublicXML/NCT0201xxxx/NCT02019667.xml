      Objective:

      To perform a clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the GABA(B)
      receptor antagonist SGS-742 in patients with SSADH deficiency.

      Study Population:

      Twenty-two children and adults with SSADH deficiency.

      Design:

      Double-blind, cross-over, phase II clinical trial. SGS-742 is a GABA (B) receptor antagonist
      that has shown to be safe and well-tolerated in clinical trials in adults with cognitive
      impairment. In addition, preliminary data in the SSADH knockout mouse model suggest efficacy
      in this specific syndrome. The primary outcome measure will be a change in the Auditory
      Comprehension subtest of the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Language Module score; the
      secondary outcome measure will be a change in cortical excitation and inhibition measured by
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Additional evaluations will include neurological and
      neuropsychological examinations, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and CSF collection to
      measure GABA levels. The trial will have a baseline phase in which each patient will undergo
      a neurological examination and a neuropsychological evaluation. During the subsequent
      treatment phase, patients will be randomized to SGS-742, supplied by IRIX Pharmaceuticals,
      and based on weight given a maximum tolerated dose not to exceed 600 mg t.i.d. orally, or
      placebo, each for 6 months. Patients will then have repeat TMS, neurological and
      neuropsychological evaluations, followed by cross-over to the alternate treatment arm, and
      re-evaluation after 6 months.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome measures for drug efficacy will be performance on neuropsychological
      testing and responses to parent questionnaire. The secondary outcome measure will be TMS
      parameters of cortical excitation and inhibition. The outcome measures for safety will
      include clinical examination and neuropsychological tests.

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS) Test at the End of the Study Drug and Placebo Treatment Periods</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and six months</time_frame>
    <description>The ABAS questionnaire was completed by the participant's parent or caregiver at the end of each six month treatment period.The ABAS provides a comprehensive picture of adaptive skills across the lifespan. The questionnaire addresses Conceptual, Social and Practical skills including communication, self-direction, use of leisure time, health, safety and self-care. The General Adaptive Composite score ranges from &lt;40 to &gt;160 with a lower score representing lower adaptive behavior. The difference between Placebo and Baseline and Study Drug and Baseline were obtained. These values were averaged across individuals to report a mean and a standard deviation of the baseline-to-treatment period change. The means for each treatment can be compared to have a baseline-adjusted treatment effect interpretation. A positive change represents an improvement in adaptive skills compared with baseline and a negative change represents a decline in adaptive skills compared with baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline of TMS Measurement of Motor Threshold at the End of the Study Drug and Placebo Treatment Periods</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique which applies magnetic pulses to the brain via a coil inducing an electrical current in the brain. Stimulation is typically applied at a sufficient intensity to trigger action potentials in nearby neurons. The motor threshold is defined as the minimum percentage of the stimulator output that evoked a motor evoked potential of more than 50µV in at least 5 out of 10 trials. Motor threshold was measured at the end of the study drug period and the end of the Placebo period. The differences between Placebo and Baseline, and SGS and Baseline were obtained. A decrease from baseline value indicates increased cortical excitability and an increase from baseline value indicates reduced cortical excitability. These values were averaged across individuals to report a mean and standard deviation of this baseline-to-treatment period change. The mean for each treatment can be compared to have a baseline-adjusted treatment effect.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline of TMS Measurement of Intracortical Facilitation at the End of the Study Drug and Placebo Treatment Periods</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique which applies magnetic pulses to the brain via a coil inducing an electrical current in the brain. Stimulation is typically applied at a sufficient intensity to trigger action potentials in nearby neurons. Intracortical facilitation (ICF) and inhibition (ICI) were studied using a paired stimulus paradigm. The motor threshold (MT) was first established. The conditioning stimulus (70% MT) followed by the test stimulus (120% MT) was delivered at an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 10 ms for ICF. Each run consisted of 10 trials, and the amplitude ratio of the mean conditioned Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) to control MEP was determined. A larger amplitude ratio indicates greater cortical excitability. The differences between Placebo and Baseline, and SGS and Baseline were obtained. These values were averaged across individuals to report a mean.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS) Test at the End of the Study Drug and Placebo Treatment Periods</title>
        <description>The ABAS questionnaire was completed by the participant's parent or caregiver at the end of each six month treatment period.The ABAS provides a comprehensive picture of adaptive skills across the lifespan. The questionnaire addresses Conceptual, Social and Practical skills including communication, self-direction, use of leisure time, health, safety and self-care. The General Adaptive Composite score ranges from &lt;40 to &gt;160 with a lower score representing lower adaptive behavior. The difference between Placebo and Baseline and Study Drug and Baseline were obtained. These values were averaged across individuals to report a mean and a standard deviation of the baseline-to-treatment period change. The means for each treatment can be compared to have a baseline-adjusted treatment effect interpretation. A positive change represents an improvement in adaptive skills compared with baseline and a negative change represents a decline in adaptive skills compared with baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of TMS Measurement of Motor Threshold at the End of the Study Drug and Placebo Treatment Periods</title>
        <description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique which applies magnetic pulses to the brain via a coil inducing an electrical current in the brain. Stimulation is typically applied at a sufficient intensity to trigger action potentials in nearby neurons. The motor threshold is defined as the minimum percentage of the stimulator output that evoked a motor evoked potential of more than 50µV in at least 5 out of 10 trials. Motor threshold was measured at the end of the study drug period and the end of the Placebo period. The differences between Placebo and Baseline, and SGS and Baseline were obtained. A decrease from baseline value indicates increased cortical excitability and an increase from baseline value indicates reduced cortical excitability. These values were averaged across individuals to report a mean and standard deviation of this baseline-to-treatment period change. The mean for each treatment can be compared to have a baseline-adjusted treatment effect.</description>

        <population>We were unable to obtain Motor Thresholds for all participants at all three timepoints, resulting in different N for each time period. All available data is reported.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline of TMS Measurement of Intracortical Facilitation at the End of the Study Drug and Placebo Treatment Periods</title>
        <description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique which applies magnetic pulses to the brain via a coil inducing an electrical current in the brain. Stimulation is typically applied at a sufficient intensity to trigger action potentials in nearby neurons. Intracortical facilitation (ICF) and inhibition (ICI) were studied using a paired stimulus paradigm. The motor threshold (MT) was first established. The conditioning stimulus (70% MT) followed by the test stimulus (120% MT) was delivered at an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 10 ms for ICF. Each run consisted of 10 trials, and the amplitude ratio of the mean conditioned Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) to control MEP was determined. A larger amplitude ratio indicates greater cortical excitability. The differences between Placebo and Baseline, and SGS and Baseline were obtained. These values were averaged across individuals to report a mean.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of TMS Measurement of Long Interval Intracortical Inhibition (Long ICI) at the End of the Study Drug and Placebo Treatment Periods</title>
        <description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique which applies magnetic pulses to the brain via a coil inducing an electrical current in the brain. Stimulation is typically applied at a sufficient intensity to trigger action potentials in nearby neurons.Intracortical facilitation and inhibition were studied using a paired stimulus paradigm. The motor threshold (MT) was first established. The conditioning stimulus (70% MT) followed by the test stimulus (120% MT) was delivered at 100 ms for long ICI. Each run consisted of 10 trials, and the amplitude ratio of the mean conditioned Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) to control MEP was determined. A larger amplitude ratio indicates greater cortical excitability. The differences between Placebo and Baseline, and SGS and Baseline were obtained. These values were averaged across individuals to report a mean.</description>

        <population>We were unable to obtain Motor Thresholds for all participants at all three timepoints, resulting in different N for each time period. All available data is reported.</population>
