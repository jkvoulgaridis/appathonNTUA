  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a costly health condition affecting more than 10% of Canadian
      adults. Excessive and unbalanced loads passing through the knee joint have been implicated in
      the progression of OA. Typical conservative treatment of OA has focused on increasing daily
      activity, without consideration for the underlying joint loading. This study aims to compare
      a 4-month walking program that aims to increase the angle of the foot (toe-out angle) during
      walking - a measure shown to reduce joint loading and OA disease progression - while
      increasing walking time/distance, with a standard walking program that aims to increase
      walking time/distance. It is predicted that the walking program focusing on increasing
      toe-out will provide greater reductions in self-reported knee pain and a greater reduction in
      unfavorable knee joint loading.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 17 and From Baseline to Week 21 in Pain as Measured by Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 17, 21</time_frame>
    <description>Average pain over the previous week will be assessed using an 11-point numerical rating scale (0 = no pain; 10 = maximum pain). Higher scores mean a worse outcome. Change was calculated as the value at 17 weeks and at 21 weeks minus the value at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 17 and From Baseline to Week 21 in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 17, 21</time_frame>
    <description>Lower-limb impairments will be measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The WOMAC is a 24-item self-report questionnaire that quantifies pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). It is a valid, reliable, and responsive disease-specific self-report instrument and has been used in many knee OA studies. Minimum value of the WOMAC pain subscale is 0 and maximum value is 20. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 17 and From Baseline to Week 21 in Knee Joint Loading: First Peak Knee Adduction Moment</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 17, 21</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a gait analysis, where 10-15 trials of walking will be collected. Participants will walk in bare feet and at their own, self-selected speed while analyzed using three-dimensional motion analysis. Kinematic (joint angle) and kinetic (joint loading) data will be collected synchronously using high-speed digital cameras and floor-mounted force platforms. A total of 5 &quot;acceptable&quot; (clean force platform strikes and no observable deviation in walking characteristics) will be analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 17 and From Baseline to Week 21 in Foot Progression Angle (FPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 17, 21</time_frame>
    <description>FPA indicates orientation of the foot with respect to the forward progression of the body. Positive values correspond to a toe-in orientation, whereas negative values correspond to a toe-out orientation. Therefore, a positive change value indicates more toe-in versus a negative change value indicates more toe-out.</description>

        <description>Lower-limb impairments will be measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The WOMAC is a 24-item self-report questionnaire that quantifies pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). It is a valid, reliable, and responsive disease-specific self-report instrument and has been used in many knee OA studies. Minimum value of the WOMAC pain subscale is 0 and maximum value is 20. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 17 and From Baseline to Week 21 in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale.</title>
          <description>Lower-limb impairments will be measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The WOMAC is a 24-item self-report questionnaire that quantifies pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). It is a valid, reliable, and responsive disease-specific self-report instrument and has been used in many knee OA studies. Minimum value of the WOMAC pain subscale is 0 and maximum value is 20. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>Participants will undergo a gait analysis, where 10-15 trials of walking will be collected. Participants will walk in bare feet and at their own, self-selected speed while analyzed using three-dimensional motion analysis. Kinematic (joint angle) and kinetic (joint loading) data will be collected synchronously using high-speed digital cameras and floor-mounted force platforms. A total of 5 &quot;acceptable&quot; (clean force platform strikes and no observable deviation in walking characteristics) will be analyzed.</description>

            <description>Participants will complete 4 months of a home-based progressive walking program with toe-out gait modification aimed at improving physical activity level. This group will perform continuous treadmill walking during regular sessions with a study therapist and will be instructed to perform a toe-out gait with the aid of a mirror during walking. Focus will also be on increasing the time and distance of walking. These goals will be emphasized for the home-based portion of the intervention as well.
Progressive walking program with toe-out gait modification: Participants in this study group will perform continuous treadmill walking for a minimum of 30 minutes at each session, but the emphasis will be to increase toe-out angle by 10 degrees over that exhibited at baseline. A mirror will be provided for biofeedback and participants will be instructed on its use for achieving the target toe-out angle. Increased walking time and distance will be encouraged the same as for the control group.</description>

        <description>Lower-limb impairments will be measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The WOMAC is a 24-item self-report questionnaire that quantifies pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). It is a valid, reliable, and responsive disease-specific self-report instrument and has been used in many knee OA studies. The WOMAC physical function subscale minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 68. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

This group will perform continuous treadmill walking during regular sessions with the study therapist with focus on increasing the time and distance of walking. This goal will be emphasized for the home-based portion of the intervention as well.
Progressive walking program: At each scheduled visit, participants will perform treadmill walking for a minimum of 30 minutes depending on the individual’s baseline activity level and the stage of the intervention. Emphasis will be solely on increasing walking time and distance to achieve the target of a 40% increase in daily activity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 17 and From Baseline to Week 21 in Knee Joint Loading: Knee Flexion Moment</title>
          <description>Participants will undergo a gait analysis, where 10-15 trials of walking will be collected. Participants will walk in bare feet and at their own, self-selected speed while analyzed using three-dimensional motion analysis. Kinematic (joint angle) and kinetic (joint loading) data will be collected synchronously using high-speed digital cameras and floor-mounted force platforms. A total of 5 &quot;acceptable&quot; (clean force platform strikes and no observable deviation in walking characteristics) will be analyzed.</description>
          <population>Participants lost to follow-up. Gait modification group lost 3 participants by week 17 and 2 additional participants by week 21 making a total loss of 5. Walking Only group lost 6 participants by week 17 and 2 additional participants by week 21 making a total loss of 8.</population>

          <title>Gait Modification Group</title>
          <description>Participants will complete 4 months of a home-based progressive walking program with toe-out gait modification aimed at improving physical activity level. This group will perform continuous treadmill walking during regular sessions with a study therapist and will be instructed to perform a toe-out gait with the aid of a mirror during walking. Focus will also be on increasing the time and distance of walking. These goals will be emphasized for the home-based portion of the intervention as well.
Progressive walking program with toe-out gait modification: Participants in this study group will perform continuous treadmill walking for a minimum of 30 minutes at each session, but the emphasis will be to increase toe-out angle by 10 degrees over that exhibited at baseline. A mirror will be provided for biofeedback and participants will be instructed on its use for achieving the target toe-out angle. Increased walking time and distance will be encouraged the same as for the control group.</description>
