  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      overweight and obese subjects with cardiovascular (CV) disease and/or multiple CV risk
      factors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 12,000 subjects will be randomized to two treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1,
      stratified by the presence of established CV disease (approximately 80%) or CV risk factors
      without established CV disease (approximately 20%). Subjects will receive lorcaserin HCl 10
      mg BID or placebo BID. The study will consist of 2 phases: Prerandomization and
      Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase will last up to 30 days and consist of one visit
      during which subjects will be screened for eligibility. The Randomization Phase will consist
      of two periods: Treatment and Follow-up. The Treatment Period will last for approximately 5
      years with approximately 18 visits and Follow-up period is 30 (+ or - 10 days) from the end
      of treatment visit.

          <description>Improvement in renal function was defined as first occurrence of regression of albuminuria or regression of CKD. Regression of albuminuria was defined as when participants with macroalbuminuria at baseline developed microalbuminuria or nonalbuminuria (ACR &lt;30 mcg/mg in spot urine), or participants with microalbuminuria at baseline became nonalbuminuric, and ACR value decreased &gt;= 30% from previous assessment during treatment. Regression of CKD defined as when participants with CKD Stage 1 or higher at baseline improved to normal or lower stages by NKF guidelines (eGFR &gt;=90 with albuminuria at baseline improved to eGFR &gt;=90 without albuminuria, or eGFR 60 to 89 at baseline became eGFR &gt;=90 with or without albuminuria, or eGFR between 30 to 59 at baseline improved to &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 BSA) during treatment. The outcome data was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimate and Greenwood Formula.</description>
