      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of a single
      application of Ha44 Gel 0.74% w/w for the treatment of head lice. Secondary purpose is to
      evaluate PK of Ha44 and benzyl alcohol under conditions of maximal exposure in pediatric
      population.
