    <measure>Time to Arthrodesis (Fusion) for Each Spinal Level (Unit), as Measured by X-rays.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>There were 29 patients and 43 total spinal levels (unit) treated at baseline. Time to arthodesis was measured as the mean time to achieve fusion. At each time point fusion was evaluated, the first time point fusion was achieved was considered fusion.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used by surgeons, clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain. The questionnaire is self-completed and covers 10 topics about pain intensity, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Scores are from 0-100 and a lower score represents a better score.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes: Worst Leg Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a commonly used outcome measure for research studies. It is presented as a 100-mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;0&quot;/no pain at all&quot; and &quot;100/worst pain imaginable.&quot; The study in this scale is used for the worst leg pain. A lower score represents a better score.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes: Measure of EQ-5D™ Visual Analog Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D-5l has a descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. Only the EQ VAS Score was analyzed in the study. The EQ VAS scored from 0-100 and a lower score represents a better score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Outcomes: Maintenance of Lower Extremity Neurological Function</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Posterolateral fusion study in which one spinal level is treated with both the study and control arm. One posterolateral spinal side is Evo3 and the other posterolateral spinal side is local autograft.
NA (Not Applicable): Neurological function data was not able to be analyzed as there was a limitation of the method in the ability to distinguish between left and right side neurological function. Neurological function is indistinguishable between the right and left side of the lower extremities using the methods in the protocol and analysis of neurological function therefore would have made no impact on the outcome of the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Are 18 (eighteen) years of age or older at the time of surgery.

          2. Require spinal fusion using Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF), Posterior
             Lumbar Fusion (PLF) or Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF), with or without the
             use of an interbody spacer, at 1 to 3 levels between L3-S1.

          3. Willing and able to return for the scheduled follow-up visits, follow post-operative
             instructions and undergo the required radiographic exams (A/P, Lateral Neutral and

             months post-surgery (3 months ± 2 weeks, 6±1 months, 12±2 months and if required 24±3
             months post-surgery), including one CT-scan at 12±2 months.

          4. Unresponsive to conservative care over a period of at least 6 months or has signs
             and/or symptoms that mandate urgent surgical intervention.

          1. Are long term users of medications (i.e. steroids greater than 8 days) that are known

         11. Use of any other bone graft or bone graft substitute in addition to or in place of
             Accell Evo3 and/or local autograft.

         12. Use of routine prophylactic NSAIDS for 3 months post-operatively, but low dose
             concomitant pain medications e.g. aspirin should be continued and recorded on the
             Concomitant Pain Medications case report form (CRF).

         13. Have a known sensitivity Polymyxin Sulfate B, Bacitracin, Gentamycin and/or Iodine.

         18. Active or latent infection in or around the surgical site.

         19. Accell Evo3 is contraindicated when there is significant vascular impairment proximal

             affect bone or wound healing, or when stabilization of the defect is not possible.

        <description>The ODI is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used by surgeons, clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain. The questionnaire is self-completed and covers 10 topics about pain intensity, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Scores are from 0-100 and a lower score represents a better score.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D-5l has a descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. Only the EQ VAS Score was analyzed in the study. The EQ VAS scored from 0-100 and a lower score represents a better score.</description>

        <description>Posterolateral fusion study in which one spinal level is treated with both the study and control arm. One posterolateral spinal side is Evo3 and the other posterolateral spinal side is local autograft.
NA (Not Applicable): Neurological function data was not able to be analyzed as there was a limitation of the method in the ability to distinguish between left and right side neurological function. Neurological function is indistinguishable between the right and left side of the lower extremities using the methods in the protocol and analysis of neurological function therefore would have made no impact on the outcome of the study.</description>
