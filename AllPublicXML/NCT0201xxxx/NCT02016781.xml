      This study is designed as a multicenter trial, with biological assignment to one of two study
      arms; Arm 1: Reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (RIC-alloHCT), Arm 2: Non-Transplant Therapy/Best Supportive Care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: MDS is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic precursors and stem cells, which may
      evolve to a terminal phase resembling acute leukemia. A subject of clinical urgency for
      researchers, clinicians, patients, and health care underwriters such as Medicare, is the role
      of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in the treatment of older patients
      with higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The use of reduced intensity conditioning
      (RIC) regimens has extended HCT to the care of older patients with acute myelogenous leukemia
      (AML) and lymphoma and a number of retrospective and phase II trials for patients with MDS
      now show the curative potential of RIC alloHCT in selected patients.

      This protocol is designed to evaluate the relative benefits of RIC alloHCT compared to
      non-transplant therapies focusing on overall survival. This will be done by having patients
      biologically assigned to the alloHCT arm or the hypomethylating therapy/best supportive care
      arm and following them for survival at 3 years.

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leukemia-free survival (LFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>LFS is defined as the time from the date of patient consent to the date of progression to AML or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Observation is censored at the date of last follow-up for patients known to be alive without leukemia. Progression to AML is defined as &gt; 20% leukemic blasts in bone marrow or in the peripheral blood.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants on HCT arm with disease relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease relapse for patients with MDS is defined as: Satisfying criteria for evolution into acute leukemia; or reappearance of pre-transplant morphologic abnormalities, detected in bone marrow specimens; or reappearance of pre-transplant cytogenetic abnormality in at least one metaphase on each of two separate consecutive examinations at least one month apart, regardless of the number of metaphases analyzed; or institution of any therapy to treat relapsed disease (institution of any therapy not meant for maintenance or prevention), including withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy or DLI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for the CEA will be the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from the third party payer perspective with two time horizons: (1) within trial (at 3 years post-enrollment), and (2) lifetime using simulating modeling.
The secondary endpoint for the CEA is the cost per QALY from the societal perspective, a broader measure that captures health insurer direct medical care costs and patient out-of-pocket direct medical and direct non-medical costs. Patient productivity costs (captured as part of QALY calculations) will be reported separately.</description>

                       transplantation.

               9. Patients must be considered to be suitable RIC alloHCT candidates at the time of
                  enrollment based on medical history, physical examination, and available
                  laboratory tests. Specific testing for organ function is not required for
                  eligibility but, if available, these tests should be used to judge eligibility.

              10. Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with the following will be ineligible for registration onto this study:

                  treated with curative surgery &lt; 5 years previously will not be allowed unless
                  approved by the Protocol Officer or one of the Protocol Chairs.

               5. Prior autologous or allogeneic HCT
