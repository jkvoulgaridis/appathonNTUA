    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of tumor samples and MRI imaging in patients with colorectal
      cancers. A tumor sample, MRI scans, and treatment outcome data will be used for research
      purposes to see if it is possible to predict patients' response to treatment.

      The quality of the immune environment in colorectal cancer biopsy samples correlates with
      disease-free survival and overall survival more so than current staging conventions. This
      study will use a scoring system called 'immunoscore' to characterize the immune enviroment.
      Researchers hypothesize that the immunoscore will correlate with outcomes of colorectal
      patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

    <description>Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis will be performed on parameters of interest on both pre-treatment biopsy specimens as well as post-operative specimens. The pre-treatment sample will be used to establish the immunophenotype score. The primary analysis will evaluate the ability of immunophenotype score to correlate with pathologic response.</description>

    <description>Patients with a diagnosis adenocarcinoma of the rectum will provide a tumor sample from their diagnostic biopsy and surgical procedure for research purposes, including RNA gene expression analysis. In addition to a standard MRI, patients will have an Intravoxel Incoherent Motion MRI (IVIM) and a Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for research purposes.</description>

    <description>At the end of a standard MRI, we will perform IVIM, which is a diffusion-weighted imaging sequence that simultaneously characterizes the microscopic diffusivity of water and the macroscopic transport of water via bulk flow. IVIM may more accurately reflect the properties of the tumor microenvironment including vascular permeability, interstitial fluid pressure, and response to neoadjuvant therapy.</description>

    <description>Following a standard MRI scan, Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) will be done. DCE-MRI is an indicator-dilution experiment in which the delivery and transcapillary transfer of a contrast agent, typically one of a number of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA), is used to assess a number of parameters characterizing tissue physiology. In locally advanced rectal cancer patients, use of DCE-MRI for determining pathologic response has produced equivocal results but more promising data has been published recently in the cervical cancer literature.</description>

      Patients who enroll in the study will all undergo a biopsy as part of their standard of care
      evaluation. Biopsies samples will be obtained and sent to pathology for paraffin embedded
      blocks for diagnostic evaluation and for subsequent research. Patients will also have tissue
      stored in RNA later for subsequent microarray analysis.

    <ipd_description>This project is being done to contribute pathology samples and patient outcome data to a larger data set intended to validate an algorithm to predict patient outcome based on pathology data obtained at diagnosis. As part of this project, pre-existing samples will be used. There will be new slides made from the samples that will be stained to identify immune response. Pathology analysis and images of the slides will be provided (without patient identifiers) along with de-identified patient outcome data to a central coordinating center.</ipd_description>
