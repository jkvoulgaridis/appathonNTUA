      In a study of Cardiac sarcoidosis, a serious heart condition, a radiotracer is being used to
      examine inflammation.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac sarcoidosis is a serious medical condition which affects the heart. The purpose of
      this study is to characterize the relationship between the FDG PET findings and other markers
      of inflammation including using a new targeted PET radiotracer, 11C-PBR28, and analysis of
      blood specimens.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study will be the ratio of 11C-PBR28 PET activity in myocardial regions with inflammation indicated by FDG PET and/or edema indicated by increased T2 signal with cardiac MRI compared to the 11C-PBR28 PET activity in myocardial segments which appear normal on FDG PET and cardiac MRI. The primary outcome is thus the intensity of uptake in abnormal regions as a percentage of the intensity of uptake in normal segments.</description>

    <measure>The Ratio of 11C-PBR28 PET Activity in Cardiac Regions With Fibrosis</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour scan</time_frame>
    <description>As a secondary outcome of this study we will evaluate the ratio of 11C-PBR28 PET activity in regions with fibrosis indicated by decreased myocardial perfusion on 82Rb PET and/or late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI without imaging signs of active inflammation compared to 11C-PBR28 PET activity in myocardial segments which appear normal on 82Rb PET, FDG PET and cardiac MRI. This outcome will thus be expressed by 11C-PBR28 PET uptake in fibrotic regions as a percentage of uptake in normal segments
We will also evaluate the concordance between extracardiac activity seen in 11C-PBR28 and FDG PET, and when available, histopathology of contemporaneous biopsy specimens.</description>

    <description>Subjects will have a blood sample drawn to evaluate the presence of a specific genetic variation which would prevent the new type of imaging test we are evaluating from working and we will test the inflammatory cells in the blood for the same purpose.
All participants who proceed will have to return on at least one additional day to undergo a positron emission tomography (PET) scan similar to the scan your doctor ordered. we will use 11C-PBR28 as the radiotracer. This study will evaluate whether 11C-PBR28 can show areas of inflammation due to cardiac sarcoidosis. On either the same day or a different day, you will also undergo a cardiac MRI.</description>

    <description>Subjects will have a positron emission tomography (PET) CT scan using 11C-PBR28 as a radiotracer. This study will evaluate inflammation due to cardiac sarcoidosis. The CT scan will improve the images. The total scan time will be about 30 minutes. There will also be some time required for prep, such as inserting an intravenous (IV) catheter in an arm or forearm. Including prep time, the scan will take approximately two hours.
Subjects will also undergo a cardiac MRI. Cardiac MRI uses strong magnetic fields to make pictures of the heart. We will use gadolinium containing contrast material, given through an intravenous (IV) catheter to highlight areas of scar in your heart which may be due to cardiac sarcoidosis. This scan will take about 60 minutes.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or older

          2. must have undergone a cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) scan using
             18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for clinical reasons (i.e. referred by your doctor)
             within the preceding 30 days which showed evidence of active inflammation in your
             heart.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. If you have two copies of a genetic variation called rs6971 which will prevent this
             tracer from generating high-quality images you may not participate. If you consent, a
             blood sample will be drawn to check whether you have this genetic variation.

          2. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. If you are female and still experience menstrual periods,
             you must be willing to use contraception until your participation in the study is
             complete.

          3. Allergy or intolerance to contrast dye containing gadolinium

          4. Claustrophobia which would prevent you from completing an approximately one hour MRI
             scan

          5. Inability to lie flat with your arms by your head

          6. Abnormal kidney function (estimated GFR(glomerular filtration rate) &lt;60 ml/min/1.73
             m2)

          7. Implanted pacemaker, defibrillator or other medical devices which are not safe for 3
             Tesla MRI

          8. Metal in the eyes or shrapnel in the body

          9. If you are clinically unstable you may not participate in this study. For example, if
             you have potentially life threatening abnormal heart rhythms which are not controlled
             by medication or other treatments, you cannot participate. Also, if you need
             medications to increase your blood pressure or cardiac function due to weak heart
             muscle, you cannot participate.

          <description>Subjects will have a blood sample drawn to evaluate the presence of a specific genetic variation which would prevent the new type of imaging test being evaluated.
All participants who proceed will have to return on at least one additional day to undergo a positron emission tomography (PET) scan similar to the scan that their treating doctor ordered. 11C-PBR28 will be used as the radiotracer. On either the same day or a different day, a cardiac MRI will be performed.</description>
