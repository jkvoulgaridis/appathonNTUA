    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of oral abiraterone acetate
      plus oral prednisone and oral abiraterone acetate plus oral prednisone plus oral exemestane,
      each compared with oral exemestane alone, in postmenopausal women with estrogen
      receptor-positive (ER+) metastatic (spreading) breast cancer that has relapsed after
      treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all participants will know
      the identity of the assigned study drug) study divided into three phases, screening,
      treatment, and follow-up. During screening, potential patients will be assessed for study
      eligibility after providing signed informed consent. The treatment phase will comprise a
      series of 28-day cycles with continuous study treatment until breast cancer progression, when
      an end-of-treatment visit will be completed before the follow-up phase begins. The duration
      of participation in the study for an individual patient may be up to approximately 7 years,
      including follow-up evaluations. Patients will be evaluated for the safety and effectiveness
      of study treatments. During the treatment phase, patients will take the following study drugs
      by mouth once daily: abiraterone acetate, 1 g/day, as four 250-mg tablets, on an empty
      stomach, and patients must not eat for at least 1 hour after abiraterone acetate; prednisone
      (prednisolone when prednisone is not available), 5 mg/day; and exemestane, 25 mg/day, as a
      single tablet. The treatment phase will consist of a series of 28-day cycles with continuous
      study treatment until breast cancer progression. At the planned interim analysis, the Data
      Review Committee has recommended that further randomization to the abiraterone acetate alone
      group be stopped and that the study is to be continued otherwise.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to first occurrence of disease progression (either radiographic or clinical), or death from any cause. PFS was determined using radiographic progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) on measurable lesions captured by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical disease progression was considered only when disease progression could not be confirmed by CT or MRI, such as when the disease site is skin, bone marrow, or central nervous system.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease achieving a best overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST. CR: disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions. PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions or persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease achieving a best overall response of a CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months based on RECIST. Stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumour marker level above the normal limits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of objective response was measured from the first time that the CR or PR was achieved to the first observation of disease progression (either radiographic or clinical) based on the RECIST criteria.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to first occurrence of disease progression (either radiographic or clinical), or death from any cause. PFS was determined using radiographic progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) on measurable lesions captured by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical disease progression was considered only when disease progression could not be confirmed by CT or MRI, such as when the disease site is skin, bone marrow, or central nervous system.</description>
