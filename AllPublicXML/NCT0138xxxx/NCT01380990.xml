  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a historically controlled, non-randomized Phase I/II clinical trial to assess the
      safety and efficacy of autologous transplantation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor
      cells (HSPCs), obtained from infants affected by ADA-SCID, following transduction of the
      HSPCs with a lentiviral vector (LV) carrying the human ADA complementary DNA (cDNA) under the
      control of the elongation factor 1 alpha shortened (EFS) promoter. Subjects treated in the
      trial receive the infusion of autologous, transduced cells following marrow cytoreduction
      with busulfan. The outcomes are compared to those observed in a historical control group of
      patients who received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

      This Phase I/II clinical trial will be performed at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH),
      London, United Kingdom.

             erythrocytes and/or leucocytes or in cultured foetal cells derived from either
