    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of
      ridaforolimus (MK-8669) after administration of single and multiple 40 mg doses in Chinese
      participants with advanced cancer. Part 2 of the study is optional; participants can continue
      to receive the study treatment in a weekly regimen of daily oral doses of ridaforolimus 40 mg
      for five consecutive days followed by two days off-treatment.

    <description>A laboratory AE (LAE) is defined as any unfavorable &amp; unintended change in the chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of study product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. A clinical AE (CAE) is defined similarly but also includes changes in structure or function of the body. Serious AEs (SAEs) are those that result in one or more of the pre-specified outcome(s) that meet the criteria of seriousness, including death, life-threatening, significant disability, or hospitalization, etc. Drug-relatedness was determined by the investigator based on clinical judgement.</description>

In Part 2, participants received a weekly treatment regimen consisting of 5 consecutive days (Days 1-5) of ridaforolimus 40 mg via oral enteric-coated tablet and 2 consecutive days (Days 6-7) off study treatment. This weekly treatment regimen was repeated every subsequent week for the remainder of participation in Part 2.</description>

Serious AEs (SAEs) are those that result in one or more of the pre-specified outcome(s) that meet the criteria of seriousness, including death, life-threatening, significant disability, or hospitalization, etc. Drug-relatedness was determined by the investigator based on clinical judgement.</description>

        <title>Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Ridaforolimus: Day 1, Day 19</title>
        <description>Cmax is the peak blood plasma concentration following a dose of ridaforolimus. The (geometric) mean was calculated based on the back-transformed least-squares mean and the 95% confidence interval was determined from a linear mixed-effect model, containing a fixed effect for day and a random effect for participant, performed on natural log-transformed values. The geometric means and back-transformed 95% confidence intervals after a single dose of ridaforolimus and after multiple doses of ridaforolimus are presented for Cmax.</description>
