    <textblock>
      The objective of this feasibility research study is to gather preliminary clinical data
      regarding the safety and potential clinical benefit of noninvasive neurostimulation of the
      vagus nerve with the AlphaCoreâ„¢ system for the relief of acute bronchoconstriction due to
      asthma.

      The purpose of the study was to collect initial safety and efficacy information of use of the
      AlphaCore System by clinicians in an emergency setting as an adjunctive treatment to standard
      of care for the relief of acute bronchoconstriction. After consent was obtained and screening
      completed, subjects were stimulated two times, 30 minutes apart, for 90 seconds each.
      Subjects were assessed prior to and immediately post the first stimulation and at 15, 30, 60,
      and 90 minutes; follow was also conducted at day 7 and day 30.

    <description>Improvement in FEV1 was defined as an increase of at least 12% compared with baseline (pre-first stimulation). The 30 minute measure was taken immediately after the second stimulation.
(FEV1 measured as a percentage of normal, where greater that 80% is normal and less than 40% is severe degree of obstruction.)</description>

    <description>Improvement in dyspnea was defined as at least 1.5 point decrease on a 10 point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) compared with baseline (pre-first stimulation). Where 0 = no dyspnea and 10 = very severe dyspnea. The 30 minute measure was taken immediately after the second stimulation.</description>

          <description>Improvement in FEV1 was defined as an increase of at least 12% compared with baseline (pre-first stimulation). The 30 minute measure was taken immediately after the second stimulation.
(FEV1 measured as a percentage of normal, where greater that 80% is normal and less than 40% is severe degree of obstruction.)</description>
