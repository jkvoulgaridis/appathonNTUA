    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of four doses of BMS-663068 with Raltegravir (RAL) + Tenofovir Disoproxil
      Fumarate (TDF). At least 1 dose of BMS-663068 can be identified which is safe, well
      tolerated, and efficacious when combined with RAL + TDF for treatment-experienced HIV-1
      infected subjects. PHENOSENSE® is a registered trademark of Monogram Biosciences.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt; 50 Copies Per Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with plasma HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL at Week 24 using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm was assessed to evaluate the antiviral activity. Treatment comparisons were not performed as this was an estimation study. Response rates were tabulated by treatment arm with exact Clopper-Pearson binomial 95 percentage confidence intervals (CI). Virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on-treatment within the snapshot window of the visit of interest. Intent-To-Treat-Exposed (ITT-E) Population includes all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.</description>

    <description>Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment or suspected transmission of an infectious agent via the study drug were categorized as SAE. AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy were also reported as safety assessment. Safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. Summaries of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation or withdrawal through Week 24 included AEs with onset on or after the start of study treatment (i.e. study date of first study treatment intake) up to and including the end of the Week 24 visit snapshot window.</description>

    <description>Change from monotherapy Baseline in log10 HIV RNA to assess the antiviral activity of temsavir following administration of selected doses of FTR administered orally to HIV-1-infected participants for 7 days. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value on or before the date of first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at indicated time point minus Baseline value. ITT-E Monotherapy Population comprised of participants that were randomized and participated in the monotherapy sub-study and received at least one dose of FTR Monotherapy.

      <recruitment_details>Participants with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) were randomized in ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 to 5 treatment arms of the study. Four groups with distinct dose of Fostemsavir (FTR, also referred BMS-663068) with Raltegravir (RAL) Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF). There was a reference group with ritonavir (r) boosted atazanavir (ATV), RAL and TDF.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 581 participants were screened, 254 were enrolled of which 2 participants withdrew consent and 1 was randomized in error. A total 251 participants were randomized and treated of which 32 were in Monotherapy sub-study (only FTR) and continued to Primary study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Percentage of participants with plasma HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL at Week 24 using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm was assessed to evaluate the antiviral activity. Treatment comparisons were not performed as this was an estimation study. Response rates were tabulated by treatment arm with exact Clopper-Pearson binomial 95 percentage confidence intervals (CI). Virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on-treatment within the snapshot window of the visit of interest. Intent-To-Treat-Exposed (ITT-E) Population includes all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CD4+ T-cell Count</title>
        <description>Blood was collected and CD4+ cell count assessment by flow cytometery was carried out at Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 24, 48 and 96 to evaluate the immunological activity of multiple doses of BMS-663068/GSK3684934. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value on or before the date of first dose of study treatment and those values are absolute values. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at indicated time point minus Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

Genotypic substitution included assessment of Reverse Transcriptase (RT) substitution, Protease Inhibitor (PI) substitution and Integrase RAL substitution as per International Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Society-USA (IAS-USA) list. ITT-E Resistance Tested through Week 24 population included participants who met the criteria for Resistance testing, and the confirmatory value or value at discontinuation occurred at or before the end of the Week 24 Snapshot analysis window. The criteria for resistance tested was participant who had virologic failure or met the following criteria a) Participants who achieved viral suppression (plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL) and have confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 400 c/mL at any time during the study. b) Participants who were discontinued before achieving viral suppression (plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL) after Week 8 with last plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;=400 c/mL.</description>

        <description>Virologic failure is defined clinically as confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 50 copies/mL at Week 24 or later or virologic rebound defined as confirmed HIV-1 RNA &gt;=50 copies/mL at any time after prior confirmed suppression to &lt;50 copies/mL OR confirmed &gt;1 log10 copies/mL increase in HIV-1 RNA at any time above nadir level where nadir was &gt;= 50 copies/mL . The phenotypic resistance to a drug is defined as a fold change (i.e, ratio of the IC50 of the clinical isolate to the IC50 of the reference strain) greater than the cut-off for reduced susceptibility. Maximum change from Baseline in Temsavir IC50 fold change based on all on-treatment values has been presented. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value on or before the date of first dose of study treatment and those values are absolute values. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at indicated time point minus Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in IC50 Fold Change Among Participants With VF at Week 48</title>
          <description>Virologic failure is defined clinically as confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 50 copies/mL at Week 24 or later or later or virologic rebound defined as confirmed HIV-1 RNA &gt;=50 copies/mL at any time after prior confirmed suppression to &lt;50 copies/mL OR confirmed &gt;1 log10 copies/mL increase in HIV-1 RNA at any time above nadir level where nadir was &gt;= 50 copies/mL. The phenotypic resistance to a drug is defined as a fold change (i.e, ratio of the IC50 of the clinical isolate to the IC50 of the reference strain) greater than the cut-off for reduced susceptibility. Maximum change from Baseline in Temsavir IC50 fold change based on all on-treatment values has been presented. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value on or before the date of first dose of study treatment and those values are absolute values. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at indicated time point minus Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed.</description>
