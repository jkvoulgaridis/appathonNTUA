  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HGT-FIR-086 is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm study to evaluate the
      Pharmacokinetics, tolerability,safety, and efficacy on reproductive hormones, of a single
      subcutaneous (SC) administration of icatibant in approximately 30 pediatric subjects with
      Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) during an initial acute attack.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study HGT-FIR-086 will enroll 30 subjects from 2 to less than 18 years of age, divided into 2
      groups: prepubertal and pubertal/postpubertal. At least 10 prepubertal children and at least
      20 adolescents (including 10 treated during a HAE attack) must be enrolled in the study.

      After a qualifying screening period, the PK, safety/tolerability, and efficacy of treatment
      with SC icatibant will be evaluated in at least 20 subjects (10 prepubertal and 10
      pubertal/postpubertal subjects) who present with cutaneous, abdominal, or laryngeal symptoms
      of an acute attack of HAE. The PK and safety/tolerability of SC icatibant will be evaluated
      in at least 10 additional pubertal/postpubertal subjects who meet screening criteria and
      receive treatment with SC icatibant in the absence of a current acute HAE attack.

      The planned duration of active participation for subjects who present with an initial attack
      of acute HAE will consist of treatment with a single subcutaneous injection of icatibant on
      Day 1 through follow up at day 90.

      After having received initial treatment with icatibant, either during or in the absence of an
      attack, at least 10 pubertal/postpubertal subjects who subsequently experience an acute HAE
      attack may continue to receive treatment with icatibant as a single SC administration per
      attack for a total of 3 eligible icatibant-treated attacks.

      The period of active participation in the study for prepubertal subjects will be
      approximately 90 days, while that for pubertal/postpubertal subjects could be a maximum of
      approximately 270 or 360 days (3 separate active periods of approximately 90 days for those
      treated with icatibant during an attack; 4 separate active periods for those treated without
      an attack), with each active period separated by periods of inactive participation of
      variable duration.

    <description>Rescue medication was any medication used after the administration of icatibant which, in the opinion of the investigator, was immediately necessary to alleviate acute symptoms which are judged by the investigator as resultant from the current HAE attack. Time to first use of rescue medication prior to the onset of symptom relief was calculated from the time of study drug administration to the first use of rescue medication prior to the onset of symptom relief. This analysis was not performed since as per protocol, &quot;This analysis will only be performed if there are at least 5 participants for a given attack who used rescue medication prior to attaining symptom relief&quot;.</description>

        <title>Time to Onset of Symptom Relief (TOSR) for Composite Investigator-Assessed Symptom Scores for Icatibant Exposure Number 1</title>
        <description>The TOSR was defined as the duration of time in hours from study drug administration to the earliest time post-treatment at which there was at least a 20 percent (%) improvement in the average post-treatment symptom score with no worsening of any single component score for the initial icatibant exposure. The investigator used a symptom score to assess the severities of symptoms of acute cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) using the following 5-point scale: 0=none (absence of symptoms), 1=mild (no to mild interference with daily activities), 2=moderate (moderate interference with daily activities), 3=severe (severe interference with daily activities) and 4=very severe (very severe interference with daily activities).

          <title>Time to Onset of Symptom Relief (TOSR) for Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) Scores for Icatibant Exposure Number 2 and 3</title>
          <description>The TOSR was defined as the earliest time at which the post-treatment score improved by at least one level. Participants of 4 years age and older self-assessed their HAE-related pain using the FPS-R instrument. FPS-R is a self-reported measure used to assess the intensity of children's pain and it is scored using a 0 to 10 scale (0=no pain to 10=very much pain). TOSR for participants who received subsequent icatibant administration by HCP administration or by caregiver/ self-administration was reported.</description>
          <population>Efficacy population consisted of participants who were treated with icatibant for their first and any additional attacks during the study. Here the number of participants analyzed signifies participants with FPS-R data.</population>

        <description>The TOSR was defined as the earliest time at which a 20% improvement was seen in the total post-treatment score. Participants of 4 years age and younger underwent investigator assessment of HAE-related pain (cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal) using the FLACC comportmental pain scale. Each of the 5 categories was scored from 0 to 2. Face(F): 0 (no particular expression/smile) - 2 (frequent to constant frown clenched jaw quivering chin); Legs(L): 0 (normal position/relaxed) - 2 (kicking/legs drawn up); Activity(A): 0 (lying quietly, normal position, moves easily) - 2 (arched rigid/jerking); Cry(C): 0 (No cry [awake/asleep]) - 2 (crying steadily/screams/sobs or frequent complaints); Consolability(C): 0 (content/relaxed) - 2 (difficult to console/comfort), resulting in a total score between 0 and 10.</description>

        <description>Time to minimum symptoms was defined as the duration of time in hours from study drug administration to the earliest time at which post-treatment score improved to zero (or no pain). Participants of 4 years of age and older self-assessed their HAE-related pain using the FPS-R instrument. FPS-R is a self-reported measure used to assess the intensity of children's pain and it is scored using a 0 to 10 scale (0=no pain to 10=very much pain). Time to minimum symptom for participants who received initial icatibant administration was reported.</description>

        <population>Efficacy population consisted of participants who were treated with icatibant for their first and any additional attacks during the study. Here the number of participants analyzed signifies participants with FPS-R data.</population>

Each of the 5 categories was scored from 0 to 2. (F) Face: 0 (no particular expression/smile) - 2 (frequent to constant frown clenched jaw quivering chin); (L) Legs: 0 (normal position/relaxed) - 2 (kicking/legs drawn up); (A) Activity: 0 (lying quietly, normal position, moves easily) - 2 (arched rigid/jerking); (C) Cry: 0 (No cry [awake/asleep]) - 2 (crying steadily/screams/sobs or frequent complaints); (C) Consolability: 0 (content/relaxed) - 2 (difficult to console/comfort), resulting in a total score between 0 and 10.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worsened Intensity of Clinical Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Symptoms Between 2 and 4 Hours After Treatment With Icatibant Exposure Number 2 and 3</title>
        <description>The investigator used a symptom score to assess the severities of symptoms of acute cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal attacks of HAE using the following 5- point scale: 0=none (absence of symptoms), 1=mild (no to mild interference with daily activities), 2=moderate (moderate interference with daily activities), 3=severe (severe interference with daily activities) and 4=very severe (very severe interference with daily activities). The number of participants with a worsened severity of HAE symptoms at 4 hours post-dose from 2 hours post-dose were reported.</description>
        <time_frame>From 2 hours post-dose to 4 hours post-dose</time_frame>
        <population>Efficacy population consisted of participants who were treated with icatibant for their first and any additional attacks during the study. The number of participants analyzed signifies participants evaluable for this endpoint.</population>
