    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to end of study (up to Day 85)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) without regard to possibility of causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was considered as medically important event. TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period (time from the first dose of study drug up to the end of study visit [Day 85]). Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; at Day 29/ Week 4 (End of Treatment Period)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 29/ Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response is an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Participants with IGA score of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; at Week 4 are reported.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Body Surface Area (BSA) Affected by Atopic Dermatitis to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 29/ Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>BSA affected by AD was assessed for each section of the body (the possible highest score for each region was: head and neck [9%], anterior trunk [18%], back [18%], upper limbs [18%], lower limbs [36%], and genitals [1%]). It was reported as a percentage of all major body sections combined.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 29/ Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 29/ Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>SCORAD was a clinical tool for assessing the severity of AD developed by the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD index). Consensus Report of the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis. Dermatology (Basel) 186 (1): 23-31. 1993. Extent and intensity of eczema as well as subjective signs (insomnia, etc.) are assessed and scored. Total score ranges from 0 (absent disease) to 103 (severe disease).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in 5-D Pruritus Scale to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 29/ Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-D Pruritus was a 5-question tool used in clinical trials to assess 5 dimensions of background itch: degree, duration, direction, disability, and distribution. Each question corresponded to 1 of the 5 dimensions of itch. Participants rated their symptoms over the preceding 2-week period on a scale of 1 (least affected) to 5 (most affected). Total score ranges from 1 (least affected) to 25 (most affected).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Weekly Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 29/ Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]).</description>
