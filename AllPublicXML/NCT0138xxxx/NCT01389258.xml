  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of OsseoSpeed™ TX 3mm
      diameter implant in a Chinese population by evaluation of marginal bone level alteration,
      implant stability and implant survival in the posterior maxilla up to 3 years after loading.
      Hypothesis: Early loading of the 3 mm implant is a safe and predictable procedure.
