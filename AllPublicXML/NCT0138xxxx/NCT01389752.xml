    <textblock>
      The study involves a single oral dose of 18 mg (2 x 9mg tablets) LY2216684 taken on 2
      occasions, once with activated charcoal and once without activated charcoal.

      The study will evaluate the effect of charcoal on the absorption of LY2216684. Side effects
      will be documented. There will be 2 study periods each lasting up to 5 days. There will be at
      least 7 days between the two doses and a follow up will occur at least 7 days after the last
      dose. Screening is required within 30 days prior to the start of the study.

    <description>The AUC0-∞ of LY2216684 was measured. The AUC was calculated for LY2216684 administered alone (reference) and LY2216684 co-administered with charcoal (test). Geometric Least Squares (LS) means were calculated according to the following model: Log(PK) = sequence + period + treatment + subject + random error for AUC.</description>
