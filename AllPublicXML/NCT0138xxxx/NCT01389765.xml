      This study will evaluate the effect of food on LY2216684. There will be 2 study periods each
      lasting up to 5 days. There will be at least 7 days between the two doses and a follow up
      will occur at least 7 days after the last dose. Screening is required within 30 days prior to
      the start of the study.
