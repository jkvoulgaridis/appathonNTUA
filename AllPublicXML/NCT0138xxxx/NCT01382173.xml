      Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), laboratory analyses and patient reported outcomes,
      the overall aim of this study is to investigate structural injuries and biochemical
      alterations in the acutely injured knee and to relate these findings to clinical outcomes at
      various time points.

        We will recruit approximately 150 patients annually over 3-4 years with the goal of
        including at least:

          -  200 knees with isolated or combined ACL injuries

          -  50 isolated meniscus tears

          -  50 primary patellar dislocations

          -  50 contusions without ligamentous, cartilage or meniscus injury.

        Patients will be recruited using two different strategies:

          1. Those seeking medical care at the orthopedic emergency room (ER) at Helsingborg
             hospital

          2. Those referred to the orthopedic outpatient health care unit of Helsingborg hospital
             due to an acute knee injury by their primary health care unit will be scheduled for a
             clinical visit for baseline assessment (visit 1) within four weeks from their injury.
             To facilitate recruitment, primary care units in the local area of Helsingborg will be
             offered an opportunity to refer all patients with rotational knee trauma and effusion
             directly to the orthopedic outpatient care unit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 12-40 years at inclusion (inclusion of patients younger than 18 will require
             parental approval)

          2. A history of knee injury not more than 4 weeks prior to inclusion

          3. Agreement and informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any MRI contra-indications (such as extreme obesity, metal implants, claustrophobia
             etc.)

          2. Pregnancy

          3. A history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a disorder of the coagulative system

          4. General disease that effects physical function or systemic medication/abuse of
             steroids

          5. Any other condition or treatment interfering with the completion or assessment of the
             trial.
