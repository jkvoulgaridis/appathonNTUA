  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of enzastaurin (LY317615), on a protein
      (enzyme CYP2C9) which is involved in the metabolic pathway of warfarin in participants with
      solid tumors or lymphomas. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be
      collected. This is a drug interaction study so the treatment of the disease will not be the
      main purpose of the study.

      This is a Phase 1, open label, fixed sequence, 2 period study conducted in participants with
      solid tumors or lymphomas. The duration of participation in this study will be up to
      approximately 38 days not including screening, after which participants will be allowed to
      continue receiving enzastaurin. There is no planned duration for the extension phase of this
      study; participants will be allowed to continue to receive enzastaurin until fulfilling one
      of the criteria for discontinuation, such as unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

          <title>Pharmacodynamics: Maximum International Normalised Ratio (INRmax) Following Concomitant Administration of Warfarin and Enzastaurin</title>
          <description>INRmax is the maximum INR over the time points after administration of warfarin and enzastaurin. INR is the ratio of the actual prothrombin time over normal prothrombin time. Geometric Least Squares (LS) mean model was used that was estimated from a mixed-effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) that included predose measurement of INR in warfarin alone (Period 1) as a covariate, treatment as a fixed effect, participant as a random effect and a random error term. (See Outcome Measure 8 for statistical analysis comparing reporting groups Warfarin and Warfarin co-administered with Enzastaurin)</description>
