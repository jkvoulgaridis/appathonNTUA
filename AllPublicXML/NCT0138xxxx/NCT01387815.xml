  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Canadian post-marketing observational study (PMOS) utilizing a prospective cohort
      design that compared the real - life effectiveness of adalimumab to topical and traditional
      systemic agents in the management of psoriasis and its impact on the patient's quality of
      life and societal burden of illness.

    <textblock>
      This was a Canadian post-marketing observational study (PMOS) utilizing a prospective cohort
      design. Participants were entered into one of two study cohorts (adalimumab cohort or
      topical/traditional systemic cohort) at the time of change of their psoriasis treatment for
      any reason and were followed for a maximum of 24 months with recommended assessments at 3, 6,
      12, 18 and 24 months after baseline. Treatment of the participants and follow up were
      according to the physician's judgment, regional regulations, and the product monograph.
      Off-label use was not permitted, and these participants were not included in the study. Dose
      changes including escalation were allowed as per the physician's judgment for participants
      that were treated as per indication when they were enrolled in the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) Score ≤1 at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Physician global assessment (PGA) score is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. The PGA uses a 6-point scale. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories:
0 (Clear): No evidence of scaling or plaque elevation; erythema may be present;
1 (Minimal): scaling may be present, up to moderate erythema, minimal plaque elevation;
2 (Mild): Fine scaling, up to moderate erythema, slight plaque elevation;
3 (Moderate): Coarse scale dominates, moderate erythema, moderate plaque elevation;
4 (Severe): Coarse non-tenacious scale dominates, severe erythema, marked plaque elevation;
5 (Very Severe): Very coarse thick tenacious scale predominates, very severe erythema, severe plaque elevation.
A higher score indicates greater disease severity. Percentages based on the total number of intent to treat (ITT) participants who attended each visit.</description>

    <measure>Body Surface Area of Psoriasis Involvement: Change From Baseline to Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Body Surface Area (BSA) is an indicator of disease severity and the affected area is expressed as a percentage of the total body surface area.The BSA affected by psoriasis was measured by the physician selecting the participant's right or left hand as the measuring device. For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus 5 digits was to be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1% BSA. Measurement of the total area of involvement by the physician was aided by imagining if scattered plaques were moved so that they were next to each other and then estimated the total area involved. A decrease in BSA affected by psoriasis indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) Total Score: Change From Baseline to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 1 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on participant's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on participant's life. The higher the score, the more the participant's quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference.</description>

    <description>The DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 1 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on participant's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on participant's life. The higher the score, the more the participant's quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. Percentage based on the total number of ITT participants who attended each visit.</description>

    <measure>Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ) Total Score: Change From Baseline to Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ) is a self-administered questionnaire comprised of 25 questions.
The WLQ evaluates the participant's overall ability to work in the last two weeks. It comprises 25 questions each with a range of 100% ('all of the time') to 0% ('none of the time') where 6 represents non-applicability to the patient's line of work.
The WLQ Productivity Loss Score indicates the percentage decrement in work output due to health problems. The WLQ Productivity Loss score is based on a weighted sum of the scores from the 4 WLQ scales (Time, Physical, Mental-Interpersonal, and Output). The resulting score (known as the WLQ Index) is in the form of the natural log of work productivity. The final step needed to generate the WLQ Productivity Loss Score is to convert the WLQ Index score to a percentage. The higher the score, the greater the work limitation.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) Score ≤1 at Month 6</title>
        <description>The Physician global assessment (PGA) score is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. The PGA uses a 6-point scale. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories:
0 (Clear): No evidence of scaling or plaque elevation; erythema may be present;
1 (Minimal): scaling may be present, up to moderate erythema, minimal plaque elevation;
2 (Mild): Fine scaling, up to moderate erythema, slight plaque elevation;
3 (Moderate): Coarse scale dominates, moderate erythema, moderate plaque elevation;
4 (Severe): Coarse non-tenacious scale dominates, severe erythema, marked plaque elevation;
5 (Very Severe): Very coarse thick tenacious scale predominates, very severe erythema, severe plaque elevation.
A higher score indicates greater disease severity. Percentages based on the total number of intent to treat (ITT) participants who attended each visit.</description>

        <title>Time to Achieving PGA ≤ 1</title>
        <description>The PGA is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. The PGA uses a 6-point scale. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories:
0 (Clear): No evidence of scaling or plaque elevation; erythema may be present;
1 (Minimal): scaling may be present, up to moderate erythema, minimal plaque elevation;
2 (Mild): Fine scaling, up to moderate erythema, slight plaque elevation;
3 (Moderate): Coarse scale dominates, moderate erythema, moderate plaque elevation;
4 (Severe): Coarse non-tenacious scale dominates, severe erythema, marked plaque elevation;
5 (Very Severe): Very coarse thick tenacious scale predominates, very severe erythema, severe plaque elevation.
A higher score indicates greater disease severity.</description>

        <title>Body Surface Area of Psoriasis Involvement: Change From Baseline to Month 6</title>
        <description>The Body Surface Area (BSA) is an indicator of disease severity and the affected area is expressed as a percentage of the total body surface area.The BSA affected by psoriasis was measured by the physician selecting the participant's right or left hand as the measuring device. For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus 5 digits was to be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1% BSA. Measurement of the total area of involvement by the physician was aided by imagining if scattered plaques were moved so that they were next to each other and then estimated the total area involved. A decrease in BSA affected by psoriasis indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) Total Score: Change From Baseline to Month 3</title>
        <description>The Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 1 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on participant's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on participant's life. The higher the score, the more the participant's quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference.</description>

        <title>DLQI Total Score: Change From Baseline to Month 12</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 1 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on participant's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on participant's life. The higher the score, the more the participant's quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference.</description>

        <title>DLQI ≤1: Percentage of Participants at Month 6</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 1 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on participant's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on participant's life. The higher the score, the more the participant's quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. Percentage based on the total number of ITT participants who attended each visit.</description>

        <title>DLQI ≤1: Percentage of Participants at Month 18</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 1 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on participant's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on participant's life. The higher the score, the more the participant's quality of life is impaired. A 5-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. Percentage based on the total number of ITT participants who attended each visit.</description>

        <title>Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II): Change From Baseline to Month 6</title>
        <description>The Beck Depression inventory assesses the presence and severity of depression and responsiveness to treatment. It consists of 21 items converging on 2 scales measuring somatic and affective components of depression. The questions assess hopelessness and irritability, cognition such as guilt or feelings of being punished, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and loss of interest in sex.
The total score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 63 with the following suggested score interpretations: minimal range = 0-13, mild depression = 14-19, moderate depression = 20-28, and severe depression = 29-63.
The higher the score, the greater the severity of the depression.</description>

          <title>BDI-II: Change From Baseline to Month 12</title>
          <description>The Beck Depression inventory assesses the presence and severity of depression and responsiveness to treatment. It consists of 21 items converging on 2 scales measuring somatic and affective components of depression. The questions assess hopelessness and irritability, cognition such as guilt or feelings of being punished, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and loss of interest in sex.
The total score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 63 with the following suggested score interpretations: minimal range = 0-13, mild depression = 14-19, moderate depression = 20-28, and severe depression = 29-63.
The higher the score, the greater the severity of the depression.</description>

          <description>The SF-12 questionnaire is a shortened form (12 items) of the SF-36 Health Survey generic quality of life questionnaire that assesses eight health concepts: 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality (energy and fatigue); 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health (psychological distress and well-being). Items 1-4 comprise the physical component of the SF-12. Scores on each item were summed and averaged (PCS Score; range = 0-100); a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ) Total Score: Change From Baseline to Month 6</title>
        <description>The Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ) is a self-administered questionnaire comprised of 25 questions.
The WLQ evaluates the participant's overall ability to work in the last two weeks. It comprises 25 questions each with a range of 100% ('all of the time') to 0% ('none of the time') where 6 represents non-applicability to the patient's line of work.
The WLQ Productivity Loss Score indicates the percentage decrement in work output due to health problems. The WLQ Productivity Loss score is based on a weighted sum of the scores from the 4 WLQ scales (Time, Physical, Mental-Interpersonal, and Output). The resulting score (known as the WLQ Index) is in the form of the natural log of work productivity. The final step needed to generate the WLQ Productivity Loss Score is to convert the WLQ Index score to a percentage. The higher the score, the greater the work limitation.</description>

          <title>WLQ Total Score: Change From Baseline to Month 24</title>
          <description>The WLQ is a self-administered questionnaire comprised of 25 questions. The WLQ evaluates the participant's overall ability to work in the last two weeks. It comprises 25 questions each with a range of 100% ('all of the time') to 0% ('none of the time') where 6 represents non-applicability to the patient's line of work.
The WLQ Productivity Loss Score indicates the percentage decrement in work output due to health problems. The WLQ Productivity Loss score is based on a weighted sum of the scores from the 4 WLQ scales (Time, Physical, Mental-Interpersonal, and Output). The resulting score (known as the WLQ Index) is in the form of the natural log of work productivity. The final step needed to generate the WLQ Productivity Loss Score is to convert the WLQ Index score to a percentage. The higher the score, the greater the work limitation.</description>

        <title>Topical Treatment Patient Reported Treatment Compliance: Number of Missed Doses Since Last Visit Assessed at Month 3</title>
        <description>Psoriasis treatment compliance by the participant was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire and interview by the treating physician at Month 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24. Participants were asked to complete the baseline set of questionnaires while at the physician's office. Thereafter, participants completed the questionnaires themselves and either mailed them to the data management center or returned them to the treating physician. The questions included the number missed since the last visit of: applications for topical medication; phototherapy sessions; doses of traditional systemic agents; and adalimumab injections.</description>
