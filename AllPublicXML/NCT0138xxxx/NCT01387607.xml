    <measure>Change From Baseline in Endpoint Mean Pain Score During the Double-blind Treatment Period at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of mean pain score was based on participant's daily pain diary. The daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The participants rated their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self-assessment was performed daily at awakening. The endpoint mean pain score was defined as the mean of the Week 14 pain diary entries in the double-blind treatment phase. Baseline was defined as the mean of last 7 pain diary entries up to and including Day 1.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Endpoint Mean Pain Score During the Double-blind Treatment Period at Week 14</title>
        <description>Assessment of mean pain score was based on participant's daily pain diary. The daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The participants rated their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self-assessment was performed daily at awakening. The endpoint mean pain score was defined as the mean of the Week 14 pain diary entries in the double-blind treatment phase. Baseline was defined as the mean of last 7 pain diary entries up to and including Day 1.</description>

The participants rated their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self-assessment was performed daily at awakening. The endpoint mean pain score was defined as the mean of the Week 14 pain diary entries in the double-blind treatment phase. Baseline was defined as the mean of last 7 pain diary entries up to and including Day 1.</description>

        <description>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was a 20-item participant-reported outcome instrument designed to assess health status, progress, and outcomes in participants with fibromyalgia. It contained 10 subscales. There were 11 questions that are related specifically to physical functioning. The remaining items assessed pain, fatigue, stiffness, difficulty working, and symptoms of anxiousness and depression. Score range for each subscale was 0 to 10. The 10 subscales were combined to yield a total score with range from 0 to 100. The total score provided an estimation of fibromyalgia impact with higher scores indicating greater impairment.</description>

        <description>Assessment of mean pain score was based on participant's daily pain diary. The daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The participants rated their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self-assessment was performed daily at awakening. Weekly mean pain score was calculated as mean value of the observations within the window for each week during the double-blind treatment phase. A participant with at least 30% reduction in weekly mean pain score from baseline to Week 14 was defined as a 30% responder.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With at Least 30% Reduction in Weekly Mean Pain Score From Baseline to Week 14</title>
          <description>Assessment of mean pain score was based on participant's daily pain diary. The daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The participants rated their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self-assessment was performed daily at awakening. Weekly mean pain score was calculated as mean value of the observations within the window for each week during the double-blind treatment phase. A participant with at least 30% reduction in weekly mean pain score from baseline to Week 14 was defined as a 30% responder.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS)-Sleep Scale was a participant-rated questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yields 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9-item overall sleep problems index. Range of quantity of sleep parameter was 0 to 24 and somnolence was 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more of the attribute.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Sleep Interference Score at Week 14</title>
        <description>The Daily Sleep Interference Scale was an 11-point numerical scale ranging from 0 (does not interfere with sleep) to 10 (completely interferes [unable to sleep due to pain]). Participants were asked to describe how their pain had interfered with their sleep during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self-assessment was performed daily upon awakening. Baseline Mean Sleep Interference score was defined as the mean of all available last 7 sleep interference score diary entries up to and including Day 1.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Discontinuation Due to AEs</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device. A Serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were events between first dose of study drug and up to follow-up visit (Study Day 105) that were absent before treatment or that worsened after treatment. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs.</description>
