  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in phase 1 and to determine the combined response
      rate of clinical response CR and very good partial response (VGPR) in phase 2 of oral (PO)
      ixazomib administered twice-weekly in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose
      dexamethasone in a 21-day cycle in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDDM).

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. Ixazomib was tested to slow disease
      progression and improve overall survival in participants who have newly diagnosed multiple
      myeloma (NDMM). This study looked at the safety, tolerability and response in participants
      when administered in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone.

      The study enrolled 64 patients. Participants were assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups:

        -  Phase 1 Ixazomib 3 mg

        -  Phase 1 Ixazomib 3.7 mg

        -  Phase 2 Ixazomib 3 mg

      All participants were administered with Ixazomib capsules, orally, twice-weekly on Days 1, 4,
      8, and 11 along with lenalidomide capsules, orally, once daily on Days 1-14 and
      dexamethasone, capsules, orally, once daily on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 for up to 16
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity as induction therapy
      during Phase 1. Participants with stable or responding disease continued receiving ixazomib
      capsules, orally, twice weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in 21-day treatment cycles as
      maintenance therapy until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

      This multi-center trial conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in
      this study was 2037 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and a final
      visit after 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>The RP2D of ixazomib was determined after the evaluation of the available data from the phase 1 portion of the trial which included, but was not limited to analyses of efficacy results, toxicity characterization, all grades peripheral neuropathy, and treatment discontinuation.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

        <title>Phase 1: Percentage of Participants Experiencing 1 or More Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

Abnormal laboratory value was assessed as an AE if the value lead to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or was considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. As per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE), Grade 3 = AE with severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = AE with life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated and Grade 5 = Death related to AE.</description>

          <title>Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Resulting in Study Drug Discontinuation</title>
          <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <description>The accumulation ratio (Rac) was estimated as the ratio of AUC (0-72) on Day 11 to the AUC (0-72) on Day 1. AUC (0-72) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 72 hours post-dose for ixazomib.</description>
