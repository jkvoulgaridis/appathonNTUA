  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sunitinib and everolimus are two new treatments approved in 2011 for patients with pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). In addition, some traditional chemotherapies are often used to
      treat pancreatic NETs. Traditional chemotherapy is also known as &quot;cytotoxic therapy&quot; and
      works by killing cells that are actively dividing. There have been no studies to compare the
      different types of treatment. Since the patient is eligible for treatment with either
      sunitinib, everolimus or traditional chemotherapy it can help us identify factors that may
      help future patients benefit from these therapies.

    <description>A total of 30 patients with well differentiated pancreatic NETs who have known liver metastases and who are planned to initiate therapy with either targeted (everolimus or sunitinib) or traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy will be recruited for this study. We plan to recruit approximately 10 patients for each therapy (everolimus, sunitinib, cytotoxic chemotherapy). Evidence of metastatic disease will be determined at the discretion of the oncologist based on available imaging, surgical and pathologic evidence.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with either sunitinib, everolimus, or traditional chemotherapy according to standard of care. Follow-up with imaging (either MRI or CT) will be performed approximately every 3 months. Unidimensional tumor measurement on standard CT and MRI sequences will be performed, according to guidelines from RECIST v1.1, which will be used to assess for progression of disease. Patients will be followed for up to 5 years. Upon evidence of disease progression, patients will be asked to undergo a post-treatment biopsy. If medically possible and safe, they will stay on the drug until the time of biopsy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathologic evidence of well differentiated pancreatic NET

          -  Evidence of measurable disease by RECIST 1.1. Both patients with synchronous disease
             and those with prior resected primary cancers will be eligible.

          -  Patient â‰¥18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent.

          -  Planned initiation of active therapy with everolimus ,sunitinib or traditional
             cytotoxic chemotherapy.

        Patients can be included in this study, regardless of prior therapy, but cannot undergo
        concurrent therapy, such as hepatic artery embolization

          -  Available archival tissue with adequate FFPE tissue for analysis verified by a
             pathologist (in cases of biopsies less than 2 cm and/or less than 70% tumor content 10
             slides will be required for adequate DNA preparation. For larger biopsies and any
             resections, 5 slides are sufficient for DNA extraction).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a history of a second active malignancy with evidence of metastases.
             Patients with a history of resected prior malignancy are allowed.

          -  Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would, in the opinion
             of the treating investigator, interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the
             trial.
