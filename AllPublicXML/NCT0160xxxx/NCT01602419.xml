    <measure>Tolerability Assessment of Wilate Infusions by Reason for Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>During and immediately after each infusion of Wilate during the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability was assessed using a 3-point verbal rating scale (excellent; satisfactory; unsatisfactory) according to overall feeling during and after Wilate therapy and occurrence of ADRs.
Tolerability was assessed for infusions given for on-demand and prophylactic treatment, but not for infusions administered for surgeries or for the purpose of thrombogenicity assessment. In some instances, however, investigators also recorded the tolerability of infusions given for surgical prophylaxis. For infusions administered for surgeries, only those with available tolerability assessments are presented. Wilate infusion may have been administered to a patient for more than one reason and may be included in more than one category (e.g., if a patient was under Wilate prophylaxis, they could also receive Wilate for the treatment of a bleeding episode [BE] or surgery or menstruation).</description>

    <measure>Patient and Investigator Efficacy Analysis Assessment of the Treatment of Bleeding Episodes (BEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During and immediately after treatment of each BE.</time_frame>
    <description>Document the efficacy of Wilate in the treatment of acute BEs, breakthrough BEs in patients receiving prophylactic treatment, and menstrual BEs.

    <measure>Efficacy Analysis for the Prevention of Breakthrough Bleeds During Prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the study for each patient (study duration: mean [±SD]: 805 days [±247]; median [range]: 797 days [144-1185]).</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy was rated on a 4-point scale (excellent; good; moderate; none) according to the number of breakthrough bleeds per month. The treatment regimen for prophylactic treatment was at the discretion of the investigator and differed for each patient, as did the duration of prophylactic treatment. The prophylaxis efficacy population (EFF-P) was subdivided into 2 groups, prophylaxis on a continuous basis (EFF-PC population) and prophylaxis on an intermittent basis (EFF-PI population). In total, 25 patients received Wilate for prophylaxis and of these, 17 patients received prophylaxis on a continuous basis, which was defined as: (1) patients having received continuous prophylaxis over a period of at least 3 months, with no treatment gaps longer than 14 days; or (2) patients having received continuous prophylaxis for at least 1 year with an average of 1 infusion/per week (these patients may have had gaps of more than 14 days).</description>

    <measure>Safety: Frequency of VWF Inhibitors at Baseline and Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>Optional antibody tests were performed at baseline and 3-4 days (preferable 7 days) after Wilate injection.</time_frame>
    <description>Optional testing for anti-VWF antibodies/VWF inhibitor was performed at the baseline and follow up visits. VWF inhibitor testing was only performed if anti-VWF antibody results were positive. VWF antibody testing was performed using an ELISA assay, and inhibitor testing using a Bethesda assay. Both assays were considered experimental, since no standardized laboratory assays were available. Results displayed here are for confirmatory inhibitor testing.</description>

    <measure>Safety: Patients With Thrombogenicity Values &gt;2 Times the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)</measure>
    <time_frame>Optional thrombogenicity tests were performed at baseline and 1, 3 and 24 hours after each administration of Wilate.</time_frame>
    <description>Thrombogenicity testing was optional. Thrombogenicity markers (prothrombin fragments 1 + 2; D-dimer) were evaluated at baseline and during follow up. Samples with prothrombin F1+2 and/or D-dimer values at least 2 times above the upper limit of normal were recorded as high.</description>

          <description>A total of 120 patients were enrolled in this study.
Of the 120 patients enrolled into the study, 9 were excluded because they had not received any treatment with Wilate, leaving 111 patients in the safety (SAF) population. Of these 111 patients, 7 did not have a confirmed diagnosis of von Willebrand Disease (VWD) and 2 had another bleeding disorder, leaving 102 patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Of these 102 patients, 11 were excluded from the efficacy (EFF) population for the reasons summarised below.</description>

          <title>Type of VWD</title>
          <description>Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by missing or defective von Willebrand factor (VWF) which is a clotting protein. There are three types of VWD: Type 1, 2 and 3. Type 1 VWD patients have a quantitative deficiency of VWF. Levels of VWF in the blood range from 20%–50% of normal; symptoms are usually mild. Type 2 VWD patients have a qualitative deficiency in VWF. Symptoms are mild to moderate. Type 3 VWD patients have a quantitative deficiency of VWF. Symptoms are typically severe, and include spontaneous bleeding episodes, often into their joints and muscles.</description>

        <title>Tolerability Assessment of Wilate Infusions by Reason for Administration</title>
        <description>Tolerability was assessed using a 3-point verbal rating scale (excellent; satisfactory; unsatisfactory) according to overall feeling during and after Wilate therapy and occurrence of ADRs.
Tolerability was assessed for infusions given for on-demand and prophylactic treatment, but not for infusions administered for surgeries or for the purpose of thrombogenicity assessment. In some instances, however, investigators also recorded the tolerability of infusions given for surgical prophylaxis. For infusions administered for surgeries, only those with available tolerability assessments are presented. Wilate infusion may have been administered to a patient for more than one reason and may be included in more than one category (e.g., if a patient was under Wilate prophylaxis, they could also receive Wilate for the treatment of a bleeding episode [BE] or surgery or menstruation).</description>
        <time_frame>During and immediately after each infusion of Wilate during the study.</time_frame>

        <title>Efficacy Analysis for the Prevention of Breakthrough Bleeds During Prophylaxis</title>
        <description>Efficacy was rated on a 4-point scale (excellent; good; moderate; none) according to the number of breakthrough bleeds per month. The treatment regimen for prophylactic treatment was at the discretion of the investigator and differed for each patient, as did the duration of prophylactic treatment. The prophylaxis efficacy population (EFF-P) was subdivided into 2 groups, prophylaxis on a continuous basis (EFF-PC population) and prophylaxis on an intermittent basis (EFF-PI population). In total, 25 patients received Wilate for prophylaxis and of these, 17 patients received prophylaxis on a continuous basis, which was defined as: (1) patients having received continuous prophylaxis over a period of at least 3 months, with no treatment gaps longer than 14 days; or (2) patients having received continuous prophylaxis for at least 1 year with an average of 1 infusion/per week (these patients may have had gaps of more than 14 days).</description>
