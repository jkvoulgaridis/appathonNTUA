  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo-controlled study to be conducted in two parallel study arms for
      a six month period (three doses). Between 75 and 100 eligible patients will be enrolled.
      Patients will receive afamelanotide (16 mg implants) or placebo according to the following
      dosing regimen:

        -  Group A will be administered afamelanotide implants on Days 0, 60 and 120

        -  Group B will be administered placebo implants on Days 0, 60 and 120

      The number and severity of phototoxic reactions, the type and duration of sun exposure,
      treatment-emergent adverse events and the use of concomitant medication will be recorded by
      patients in study diaries between Days 0 and 180. Quality of life will be measured using the
      DLQI and EPP-QoL at Days 0, 60, 120 and 180. Participants will visit the clinic on Days 60,
      120 and 180 for assessments of adverse events.

      A subset of patients will be photoprovoked on the lower back and dorsal surface of the hand
      and the minimal symptom dose (MSD) will be determined on Days 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Afamelanotide is a man-made drug being studied for use as a preventative medication for
      Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP) sufferers. It is a synthetically produced analogue of
      human alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and is available in Europe.

      The purpose of this study is to look at the type and duration of sun exposure when patients
      are exposed to light. This study will also look at how the drug is tolerated when taken by
      people with EPP.

      The study will involve the use of an implant, which comes in the form of a small rod to be
      administered under the skin. The implant may contain the study drug afamelanotide or a
      placebo (inactive medication).

      Over 620 subjects have been treated with afamelanotide to date with no serious safety
      concerns identified. For this study, afamelanotide has been formulated as a controlled
      release depot injection (implant). This means that the afamelanotide will be released slowly
      into the body over a few days.

      This study aims to confirm the photoprotective properties if afamelanotide demonstrated in
      the earlier Phase II and phase III studies.

    <measure>Duration of Direct Sunlight Exposure Between 10:00 and 18:00 Hours on Days When no Pain Was Experienced (Pain Score of 0).</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of direct sunlight exposure between 10:00 and 18:00 hours on days when no pain was experienced (e.g.11-point Likert pain score of 0). Time was recorded in a patient diary using 15 minute time blocks.
The pain score is measured by the 11-point Likert Pain scale with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10.
Likert Pain scale of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.</description>

    <description>Time in direct sunlight exposure between 10:00 and 18:00 hours on days when no or mild pain was experienced (Likert scores of 0 to 3).
The pain score is measured by the 11-point Likert Pain scale with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10.
Likert Pain scale of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 60, Day 120, and Day 180 or early termination.</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of life of participant is measured using DLQI and EPP QoL. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a simple practical measure for routine clinical use.
The DLQI ranges from 0 (no impact on life) to 30 (significant impact on life) . The Erthropoietic protoporphyria quality of life measure (EPP-QoL) scores range from 0 (worst imaginable QoL) to 100 (best possible QoL).</description>

    <description>A subset of subjects was photoprovoked on the dorsal surface of the hand (predilection place) and lower back and the minimum symptom dose (MSD) determined on Days 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120.
The amount of radiation required to provoke the first clinical symptom was recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Severity of Phototoxic Reaction Experienced by Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The phototoxicity - phototoxic pain secondary endpoint has been divided into two secondary outcome measures.
The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary. On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The maximum severity of a phototoxic reaction was determined by the highest daily 11-point Likert scale score that occurred during that phototoxic reaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Number Phototoxic Reactions Experienced by Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The phototoxicity - phototoxic pain secondary endpoint has been divided into two secondary outcome measures.
The number of episodes was the endpoint. The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary. On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert Pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The number of phototoxic reactions was determined by counting the number of episodes on which participants report a 11-point Likert scale score of 4 or more for one or more consecutive days.</description>

        <description>The phototoxicity - phototoxic pain secondary endpoint has been divided into two secondary outcome measures.
The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary. On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The maximum severity of a phototoxic reaction was determined by the highest daily 11-point Likert scale score that occurred during that phototoxic reaction.</description>

The number of episodes was the endpoint. The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary. On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert Pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The number of phototoxic reactions was determined by counting the number of episodes on which participants report a 11-point Likert scale score of 4 or more for one or more consecutive days.</description>
