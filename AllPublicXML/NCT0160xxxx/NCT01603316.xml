  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have found that many patients getting treatment for cancer have trouble
      getting enough to eat, or do not always have enough money for food. When a patient has these
      problems it can lead to difficulties with completing cancer treatment. Across New York City,
      there are many hospitals that offer their patients food pantry services on location. The
      investigators would like to compare how food pantries within the hospital and two other food
      assistance options: monthly food vouchers and weekly grocery deliveries maybe possible
      solutions to this problem. The patient will be randomly assigned to one of the three
      different food program groups, which means everyone has an equal chance in being in any
      group, like a flip of a coin. The investigators hope to learn how to best help patients with
      trouble getting food and to see if this will help with completing cancer treatment.

      The original RCT composed of study arms: 1) hospital -based food pantry (control), 2) food
      voucher program plus access to the food pantry, and 3) grocery delivery program plus access
      to the food pantry will remain open to accrual at Ralph Lauren Cancer Center. The other three
      sites of the original RCT, Lincoln Hospital, Queens Cancer Center and Brooklyn Hospital, have
      reached target accrual. Our modified RCT, to be carried out among an expanded cohort of
      cancer patients is composed of study arms : 1) Food Voucher Program (Voucher); 2) Home
      Grocery Delivery Program (Delivery); and 3) Medically-tailored, Hospital-based Food Pantry
      (Pantry).

      For this RCT, we will enroll patients across three Bronx hospitals- Jacobi Medical Center,
      St. Barnabas Hospital, and Montefiore Medical Center. For the new study arms, we will enroll
      patients across Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, Jacobi Medical Center, St. Barnabas
      Medical Center, and Montefiore Health System. Before conducting the RCT across Lincoln
      Medical and Mental Health Center and the three new sites in the Bronx, we will refine written
      educational materials to be used in the intervention through focus groups.

    <description>The primary analytic approach for these secondary outcome variables will be a series of Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMMS) modeling the change scores from baseline to each of the follow-up assessments, separately for each of the questionnaire outcome variables [51]. Analyses based on change scores have the advantage of creating easily interpretable results and clearly indicating the direction of individual change (e.g., increased protein intake).</description>

    <description>In the Food Voucher arm, each participant will receive a debit card specifically created for this program. Each month for the duration of study participation (6 months), the debit card will be credited with $128 and given to the patient in person or via mail. Patients will be instructed to use these cards only for food purchases. They will be counseled on using their vouchers only for healthful foods, in a way that stretches their food dollars. Purchases will be tracked by having patients bring their receipts in for review each month when they come in to pick-up their next monthly vouche, or by providing electronic copies of receipts. Patients will be provided with a receipt holder to assist in storing receipts for review.</description>

    <description>In the Home Grocery Delivery arm, each participant will receive home grocery delivery from PeaPod grocery delivery service or from FreshDirect (depending on the participantâ€Ÿs zip code), worth $128 per month, for the duration of study participation (6 months). Patients in the Delivery arm will review a list of food categories and a subset of items in each category with a COA.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm will have access to the pantry for the duration of their study participation (6 months). Those accessing the medically-tailored food pantry will pick-up a pantry bag weekly at the hospital, either during one of their medical appointments or at another preferred time. Each patient's food prefereces will be assessed once during baseline and they will be given food bags, tailored when possible and when available to these preferences and to their medical needs and cultural preferences.</description>
