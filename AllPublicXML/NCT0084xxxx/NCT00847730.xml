      The study is aimed at evaluating the clinician's perceived ease of using the V.A.C. GranuForm
      bride dressing and the patients perceived level of comfort during the dressing wear.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the ease of use of the V.A.C® GranuFoam™ Bridge
      dressing on Diabetic Foot Ulcers under ActiV.A.C® negative pressure wound therapy for a
      period of 48-72 hrs (+6hrs). Ease of use will be determined based on the feedback on the
      following characteristics 1) Ease of dressing application 2) Ease of dressing removal and 3)
      Ease of dressing conformability. Additionally patient feedback on comfort during wear will
      also be collected. Patients currently prescribed to V.A.C.® Therapy will be enrolled in the
      trial.

    <description>Each subject was assessed on the three scales (each scale was 1-Poor, 2 - Fair, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent) and given a score on each individual characteristic (Ease of Dressing Application, Ease of Conformability, and Ease of Dressing Removal). The scores were then summed for each subject with possible range being 3-12. If the subject had a total score greater than or equal to 6, and a minimum score of greater than or equal to 2 on each individual characteristic then the subject was included in the percentage of subjects with satisfactory performance. Note that for each scale higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>
