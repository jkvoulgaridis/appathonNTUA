  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previously demonstrated that epidural ropivacaine reduces uterine artery
      vascular resistance in a dose dependent manner in pre-eclampsia. The investigators also noted
      a marked right-left difference in vascular resistance between paired uterine arteries, which
      was almost completely abolished following epidural ropivacaine. However, this novel
      observation was not a stated outcome variable before the study began. This study assesses
      right-left difference in vascular resistance between paired uterine arteries as a primary
      end-point, assesses the dose-response effect of epidural lidocaine and compares the effect
      observed in pre-eclampsia with that in two control populations (term normal pregnancy and
      non-pregnant controls).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-eclampsia patients and normal pregnancy controls scheduled to receive epidural
             catheterization for induction of labor or Cesarean delivery. Non-pregnant controls
             receiving epidural catheterization for elective surgery. Pre-eclampsia group:

               1. gestational age between 35 to 40 completed weeks

               3. resting systolic pressure &gt; 140mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90mmHg measured twice
                  at least 6 hours apart

               4. proteinuria (at least 0•1 g/l in two random samples at least 6 hours apart or at
                  least 0•3g in a 24 hour collection).

          -  Normal pregnancy control group:

               1. gestational age between 35 to 40 completed weeks

               2. absence of other inclusion factors for the pre-eclampsia group. Non-pregnant
                  control group: Non-pregnant women of reproductive age.
