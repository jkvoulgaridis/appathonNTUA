      In the study proposed, up to 1,500 men age 60 and over with strong smoking histories will
      test their urine for the presence of blood daily for two 10-day testing periods with the Ames
      Hemastix. Individuals with even a solitary positive test will undergo a thorough urologic
      evaluation to determine the cause of hematuria and follow-up will continue for 2 years after
      completion of the study.

      Reduction of cancer mortality is a stated goal of the National Cancer Institute. Cancer of
      the bladder is the 4th most commonly diagnosed cancer and 7th leading cause of cancer death
      in the American men, and represents an important target for mortality-reducing efforts.
      Furthermore, these tumors, even in early (i.e. curable) stages, usually cause several easily
      detectable abnormalities, including hematuria, and the presence of abnormal tumor products
      that are shed into urine or lie within exfoliated malignant cells.

      The overall goal of the proposed study is to gain information concerning the performance
      characteristics of three bladder cancer markers when combined with hematuria testing in
      detecting bladder cancer.

      A mail back questionnaire, completed at the beginning of the study, will provide information
      about the participants and the results of testings will be reported after each testing
      period. Individuals with even a solitary positive test will undergo a thorough urologic
      evaluation to determine the cause of hematuria and follow-up will continue or 2 years after
      completion of the study. At the time of the evaluation, three bladder cancer marker tests,
      NMP22 Bladder Chek, ImmunoCyt and UroVysion FISH will be performed, but regardless of the
      results, a hematuria evaluation will be completed. Data will be updated continually.

      The 10 day testing with Hemastix will be repeated 9 months after the first one is completed
      regardless of the outcome of the first testing.

        MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical
        Center and Laval University that contain within them county hospitals, Veterans
        Administrations Hospitals, fee-for-service clinics, and tertiary care facilities will
        enroll subjects. Each site will devise their own means of soliciting participants in the

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men age 60 and over, - who are current cigarette smokers OR - who have a history of at
             least 20 pack years smoking OR - who have over a 30 pack/year history who have stopped
             smoking within 10 years of the registration date OR - who have a 40 pack year history
             of smoking regardless of the quit date, will be eligible for participation.

          -  Patients with prostate or renal cancer must have been treated more than 5 years
             previously and be considered disease-free at the time of entry. In the case of
             prostate cancer, patients may have only received prostatectomy as their treatment and
             must have undetectable PSA's at study entry.

          -  In the case of calculus disease, patients must be believed to be stone free at time of
             study entry and could not have had a stone attack within the previous 2 years.

          -  Patients receiving anticoagulation therapy, such as Warfarin, Plavix, Lovenox,
             aspirin, etc. will be able to take part in the study and, will be thoroughly worked-up
             if the only explainable cause of hematuria is receiving anticoagulation medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of urothelial cancer

          -  any malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers treated within the past 5 years

          -  benign tumors of the urinary tract that are still existent

          -  known urinary calculi

          -  medical or oncological conditions known to produce hematuria (e.g. glomerulonephritis,
             treatments with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and pelvic radiation therapy)

          -  visual, psychological, neurological, musculoskeletal, etc. impairments that would make
             home testing impractical
