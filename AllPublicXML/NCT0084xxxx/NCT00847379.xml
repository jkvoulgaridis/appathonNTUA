  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It
      is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for
      maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility
      that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A
      specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of
      DMD/BMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally
      delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the
      nonsense mutation. This study is a Phase 2b extension trial that will evaluate the long-term
      safety of ataluren (PTC124) in boys with nonsense mutation DMD/BMD, as determined by adverse
      events and laboratory abnormalities. The study will also assess changes in walking, muscle
      function, and other important clinical and laboratory measures.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Severity of an AE was classified as: mild (does not interfere with usual function), moderate (interferes to some extent with usual function) and severe (interferes significantly with usual function). Drug-related AEs: AEs with a possible or probable relationship to study drug. Serious AEs: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention. TEAE: AE that occurred or worsened in the period extending from first dose of study drug in this study to 6 weeks after last dose of study drug in this study. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) at Week 60</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 48 of Study 007), Week 60</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWD test was performed in a 30 meters long flat corridor, where the participant was instructed to walk as far as possible, back and forth around two cones, with the permission to slow down, rest, or stop if needed. Ambulation was assessed via the 6MWD test following standardized procedures by measuring the 6MWD in meters. Participants were not permitted to use assistive devices (walker, long leg braces, or short leg braces) during the 6MWD test.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Activity Period/Day/Visit at Week 60, as Assessed by Step Activity Monitoring (SAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 48 of Study 007), Week 60</time_frame>
    <description>The SAM is a pedometer (worn on the ankle) that continuously records the number of steps per time interval. Participants were instructed to continue to wear the SAM for at least 9 consecutive days. SAM was used to record the number of strides/minute following each visit. A stride is the leg motion that begins when the foot with SAM leaves the floor and ends when the same foot touches the floor again (that is, a stride generally equals 2 steps). Mean activity period/day/visit was computed for each participant. For each day, an active period was defined as the first time after 3:00 AM that greater than (&gt;) 2 strides/minute were recorded to the last time prior to midnight that &gt;2 strides/minute were recorded. Days were deleted on which such an active period was less than (&lt;) 50 percent (%) of the mean active period across all days for that participant's visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 48 of Study 007), Week 60</time_frame>
    <description>The heart rate was measured with a Polar RS400 heart rate monitor, which consists of a transmitter strap worn around the chest and a wristwatch receiver. The monitor produces a digital text file with 1 value per minute that represents the mean heart rate for that minute. Mean heart rates values were collected prior to, during, and after the 6MWT. The participant rested for 5 minutes in a sitting position prior to the 6MWT, and the mean heart rate for the last minute of this rest period was collected and documented as the resting heart rate. During the 6MWT, the mean heart rate was collected and documented as the active heart rate. After completing the 6MWT and resting for 3 minutes, the mean heart rate for 1 minute was collected and documented as the recovery heart rate.</description>

    <description>Basic attention and working memory was measured using the digit span task. A series of digits (0-9) were presented to the child in an auditory format only. The task had 2 parts; in the forward condition, the child was requested to repeat back the digits in the order they were presented and in the backward condition, he was requested to reverse the order of presentation. A raw score of the total number of correct responses was converted to an age-scaled-score (z-score) by subtracting the corresponding mean and dividing by the corresponding standard deviation of a reference population for that age.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant- Reported Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) as Measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Physical, Emotional, Social, and School Functioning Domain Scores at Week 60</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 48 of Study 007), Week 60</time_frame>
    <description>HRQL was measured via the PedsQL. The generic core module (including physical, emotional, social and school functioning scales) comprises 23 questions and the fatigue-specific module (including general fatigue, sleep/rest fatigue, and cognitive fatigue scales) comprises an additional 18 questions. The PedsQL was completed by both the participant and/or a parent/caregiver. Examples of items in each of the generic core module scales include: &quot;It is hard for me to run&quot;; &quot;I feel sad or blue&quot;; &quot;I cannot do things that other kids my age can do;&quot; and &quot;It is hard to pay attention in class.&quot; Each of the generic core module items was scored on a 5-point Likert response scale from 0 (never a problem) to 4 (almost always a problem). Scores were transformed on a scale from 0 to 100 (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 60.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Severity of an AE was classified as: mild (does not interfere with usual function), moderate (interferes to some extent with usual function) and severe (interferes significantly with usual function). Drug-related AEs: AEs with a possible or probable relationship to study drug. Serious AEs: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention. TEAE: AE that occurred or worsened in the period extending from first dose of study drug in this study to 6 weeks after last dose of study drug in this study. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

        <description>The 6MWD test was performed in a 30 meters long flat corridor, where the participant was instructed to walk as far as possible, back and forth around two cones, with the permission to slow down, rest, or stop if needed. Ambulation was assessed via the 6MWD test following standardized procedures by measuring the 6MWD in meters. Participants were not permitted to use assistive devices (walker, long leg braces, or short leg braces) during the 6MWD test.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Activity Period/Day/Visit at Week 60, as Assessed by Step Activity Monitoring (SAM)</title>
        <description>The SAM is a pedometer (worn on the ankle) that continuously records the number of steps per time interval. Participants were instructed to continue to wear the SAM for at least 9 consecutive days. SAM was used to record the number of strides/minute following each visit. A stride is the leg motion that begins when the foot with SAM leaves the floor and ends when the same foot touches the floor again (that is, a stride generally equals 2 steps). Mean activity period/day/visit was computed for each participant. For each day, an active period was defined as the first time after 3:00 AM that greater than (&gt;) 2 strides/minute were recorded to the last time prior to midnight that &gt;2 strides/minute were recorded. Days were deleted on which such an active period was less than (&lt;) 50 percent (%) of the mean active period across all days for that participant's visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Total Step Count/Day/Visit During the Active Periods at Week 60, as Assessed by SAM</title>
          <description>The SAM is a pedometer (worn on the ankle) that continuously records the number of steps per time interval. Participants were instructed to continue to wear the SAM for at least 9 consecutive days. SAM was used to record the number of strides/minute following each visit. A stride is the leg motion that begins when the foot with SAM leaves the floor and ends when the same foot touches the floor again (that is, a stride generally equals 2 steps). Mean total step count/day/visit during the active periods was computed for each participant. For each day, an active period was defined as the first time after 3:00 AM that &gt;2 strides/minute were recorded to the last time prior to midnight that &gt;2 strides/minute were recorded. Days were deleted on which such an active period was &lt;50% of the mean active period across all days for that participant's visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Maximum Continuous 10-minute, 20-minute, 30-minute, and 60-minute Total Step Count at Week 60, as Assessed by SAM</title>
          <description>SAM is a pedometer (worn on the ankle) that continuously records the number of steps per time interval. Participants were instructed to continue to wear the SAM for at least 9 consecutive days. SAM was used to record the number of strides/minute following each visit. A stride is the leg motion that begins when the foot with SAM leaves the floor and ends when the same foot touches the floor again (that is, a stride generally equals 2 steps). The maximum continuous 10-minute, 20-minute, 30-minute, and 60-minute total step counts were computed for each participant. For each day, an active period was defined as the first time after 3:00 AM that &gt;2 strides/minute were recorded to the last time prior to midnight that &gt;2 strides/minute were recorded. Days were deleted on which such an active period was &lt;50% of the mean active period across all days for that participant's visit.</description>

          <description>SAM is a pedometer (worn on the ankle) that continuously records the number of steps per time interval. Participants were instructed to continue to wear SAM for at least 9 consecutive days. SAM was used to record number of strides/minute following each visit. A stride is leg motion that begins when the foot with SAM leaves the floor and ends when the same foot touches the floor again. Percentage of time during active periods spent at no activity (0 steps/min), low activity (≤15 steps/min), medium activity (16-30 steps/min), and high activity (&gt;30 steps/min) were computed for each participant. For each day, an active period was defined as first time after 3:00 AM that &gt;2 strides/minute were recorded to the last time prior to midnight that &gt;2 strides/minute were recorded. Days were deleted on which such an active period was &lt;50% of the mean active period across all days for that participant's visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Heart Rate Before, During, and After Each 6MWD Test at Week 60, as Assessed by Heart Rate Monitoring With the Polar® RS400</title>
        <description>The heart rate was measured with a Polar RS400 heart rate monitor, which consists of a transmitter strap worn around the chest and a wristwatch receiver. The monitor produces a digital text file with 1 value per minute that represents the mean heart rate for that minute. Mean heart rates values were collected prior to, during, and after the 6MWT. The participant rested for 5 minutes in a sitting position prior to the 6MWT, and the mean heart rate for the last minute of this rest period was collected and documented as the resting heart rate. During the 6MWT, the mean heart rate was collected and documented as the active heart rate. After completing the 6MWT and resting for 3 minutes, the mean heart rate for 1 minute was collected and documented as the recovery heart rate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Digits Recalled Forwards and Backwards on Digit Span Task at Week 60</title>
        <description>Basic attention and working memory was measured using the digit span task. A series of digits (0-9) were presented to the child in an auditory format only. The task had 2 parts; in the forward condition, the child was requested to repeat back the digits in the order they were presented and in the backward condition, he was requested to reverse the order of presentation. A raw score of the total number of correct responses was converted to an age-scaled-score (z-score) by subtracting the corresponding mean and dividing by the corresponding standard deviation of a reference population for that age.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Participant- Reported Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) as Measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Physical, Emotional, Social, and School Functioning Domain Scores at Week 60</title>
        <description>HRQL was measured via the PedsQL. The generic core module (including physical, emotional, social and school functioning scales) comprises 23 questions and the fatigue-specific module (including general fatigue, sleep/rest fatigue, and cognitive fatigue scales) comprises an additional 18 questions. The PedsQL was completed by both the participant and/or a parent/caregiver. Examples of items in each of the generic core module scales include: &quot;It is hard for me to run&quot;; &quot;I feel sad or blue&quot;; &quot;I cannot do things that other kids my age can do;&quot; and &quot;It is hard to pay attention in class.&quot; Each of the generic core module items was scored on a 5-point Likert response scale from 0 (never a problem) to 4 (almost always a problem). Scores were transformed on a scale from 0 to 100 (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 60.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Participant- Reported Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) as Measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Physical, Emotional, Social, and School Functioning Domain Scores at Week 60</title>
          <description>HRQL was measured via the PedsQL. The generic core module (including physical, emotional, social and school functioning scales) comprises 23 questions and the fatigue-specific module (including general fatigue, sleep/rest fatigue, and cognitive fatigue scales) comprises an additional 18 questions. The PedsQL was completed by both the participant and/or a parent/caregiver. Examples of items in each of the generic core module scales include: &quot;It is hard for me to run&quot;; &quot;I feel sad or blue&quot;; &quot;I cannot do things that other kids my age can do;&quot; and &quot;It is hard to pay attention in class.&quot; Each of the generic core module items was scored on a 5-point Likert response scale from 0 (never a problem) to 4 (almost always a problem). Scores were transformed on a scale from 0 to 100 (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 60.</description>
          <population>Evaluable population included all participants who completed Study 007 and received ≥1 dose of ataluren in Study 007e, who had sufficient baseline and on-treatment data in Study 007e to assess the measure of interest. ‘Number analyzed’=participants evaluable for specified categories.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Parent/Caregiver- Reported HRQL as Measured by the PedsQL Physical, Emotional, Social, and School Functioning Domain Scores at Week 60</title>
          <description>HRQL was measured via the PedsQL. The generic core module (including physical, emotional, social and school functioning scales) comprises 23 questions and the fatigue-specific module (including general fatigue, sleep/rest fatigue, and cognitive fatigue scales) comprises an additional 18 questions. The PedsQL was completed by both the participant and/or a parent/caregiver. Examples of items in each of the generic core module scales include: &quot;It is hard for me to run&quot;; &quot;I feel sad or blue&quot;; &quot;I cannot do things that other kids my age can do;&quot; and &quot;It is hard to pay attention in class.&quot; Each of the generic core module items was scored on a 5-point likert response scale from 0 (never a problem) to 4 (almost always a problem). Scores were transformed on a scale from 0 to 100 (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 48.</description>
          <population>Evaluable population included all participants who completed Study 007 and received ≥1 dose of ataluren in Study 007e, who had sufficient baseline and on-treatment data in Study 007e to assess the measure of interest. ‘Number analyzed’=participants evaluable for specified categories.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Participant-Reported HRQL as Measured by the Total Fatigue Scale Score at Week 60</title>
        <description>HRQL was measured via the PedsQL. The fatigue-specific module (including general fatigue, sleep/rest fatigue, and cognitive fatigue scales) comprises an additional 18 questions. PedsQL was completed by both the participant and/or a parent/caregiver. Fatigue-specific module obtains information relating to items such as: &quot;I feel too tired to do things that I like to do&quot;; &quot;I spend a lot of time in bed&quot;; and &quot;I have trouble remembering more than one thing at a time;&quot; Each of the fatigue-specific module items was scored on a 5-point Likert response scale from 0 (never a problem) to 4 (almost always a problem). Scores were transformed on a scale from 0 to 100 (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), with higher scores indicating less fatigue. Total score was the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 60.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Participant-Reported HRQL as Measured by the Total Fatigue Scale Score at Week 60</title>
          <description>HRQL was measured via the PedsQL. The fatigue-specific module (including general fatigue, sleep/rest fatigue, and cognitive fatigue scales) comprises an additional 18 questions. PedsQL was completed by both the participant and/or a parent/caregiver. Fatigue-specific module obtains information relating to items such as: &quot;I feel too tired to do things that I like to do&quot;; &quot;I spend a lot of time in bed&quot;; and &quot;I have trouble remembering more than one thing at a time;&quot; Each of the fatigue-specific module items was scored on a 5-point Likert response scale from 0 (never a problem) to 4 (almost always a problem). Scores were transformed on a scale from 0 to 100 (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), with higher scores indicating less fatigue. Total score was the sum of all items over the number of items answered on all scales. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 60.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Participant and Parent/Caregiver Reported Activities of Daily Living of Participants Who Were Unable to Complete the 6MWT (Nonambulatory Participants), as Measured by the Egen Klassifikation (EK) Scale at Week 60</title>
        <description>Activities of daily living were measured using the EK scale in all participants who were unable to complete the 6MWT at Screening/Baseline on Day 1. The EK scale is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 30 points where 0 represents the highest level of independent function and 30 the lowest. The scale consists of 10 categories (each scored 0 to 3), involving different functional domains including 1) ability to use wheelchair, 2) ability to transfer from wheelchair, 3) ability to stand, 4) ability to balance in the wheelchair, 5) ability to move the arms, 6) ability to use the hands and arms when eating, 7) ability to turn in bed, 8) ability to cough, 9) ability to speak, and 10) physical well-being. The administration of the EK scale consisted of an interview of the participant to capture how he performed the tasks of daily life (as described by Categories 1 to 9) and how he perceived his well-being (as described by Category 10).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Participant and Parent/Caregiver Reported Activities of Daily Living of Participants Who Were Unable to Complete the 6MWT (Nonambulatory Participants), as Measured by the Egen Klassifikation (EK) Scale at Week 60</title>
          <description>Activities of daily living were measured using the EK scale in all participants who were unable to complete the 6MWT at Screening/Baseline on Day 1. The EK scale is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 30 points where 0 represents the highest level of independent function and 30 the lowest. The scale consists of 10 categories (each scored 0 to 3), involving different functional domains including 1) ability to use wheelchair, 2) ability to transfer from wheelchair, 3) ability to stand, 4) ability to balance in the wheelchair, 5) ability to move the arms, 6) ability to use the hands and arms when eating, 7) ability to turn in bed, 8) ability to cough, 9) ability to speak, and 10) physical well-being. The administration of the EK scale consisted of an interview of the participant to capture how he performed the tasks of daily life (as described by Categories 1 to 9) and how he perceived his well-being (as described by Category 10).</description>
