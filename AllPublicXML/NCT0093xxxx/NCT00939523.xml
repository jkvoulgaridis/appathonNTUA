    <textblock>
      This study focuses on new therapies for a challenging disease in pituitary medicine, that of
      aggressive pituitary tumors which have limited therapeutic options beyond standard surgical,
      radiotherapy, and select medical therapies, each incurring significant morbidity and
      mortality, and each not optimally effective. To improve this gap in knowledge, we seek to
      translate findings from the laboratory into clinical practice and hone in on therapies
      directed at pituitary molecular targets, namely ErbB receptors. We have shown that human
      prolactinomas express nuclear EGFR and membranous ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4, and expression
      correlates with tumor invasion. Pituitary tumor cell lines transfected with EGFR and ErbB2
      translated to downstream effects on prolactin (PRL) gene expression and secretion,as well as
      cell proliferation. Animal models implanted with these cell lines developed larger tumors and
      PRL elevations. Treatment with ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) led to regression of
      tumors xenografted into these animals and attenuated PRL secretion. Primary culture of human
      prolactinomas confirmed expression of ErbB receptors and inhibitory effects of TKIs on PRL
      secretion and cell proliferation. Based on these exciting preliminary data, the objective of
      this new proposal is to conduct a Phase IIa clinical trial as a trenchant test of our
      translational hypothesis that tyrosine kinase inhibition constitutes highly effective
      targeted biologic therapy for these hitherto refractory pituitary adenomas. Specifically, our
      aims are to test the: 1) efficacy of TKI therapy with a clinical trial; 2) threshold level of
      tumor receptor expression to achieve TKI clinical response. Nineteen subjects will be treated
      with lapatinib for 6 months in combination with their current dopamine agonist therapy, with
      monthly measurements of PRL levels and MRI imaging every 3 months to evaluate the primary
      endpoints of achieving 40% reduction in tumor size and 50% reduction in PRL and secondary
      endpoints of radiologic stabilization and/or reduction and PRL normalization. Mean ErbB
      receptor protein expression will be compared between responders to lapatinib and
      non-responders by immunohistochemistry in pituitary tumor samples of these subjects collected
      from prior surgeries.

      PURPOSE

      The drug Lapatinib has been shown to inhibit both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
      erbB2 tyrosine kinases resulting in an effective slowing of disease progression in breast
      cancer. It has also been demonstrated that erbB is overexpressed in human pituitary adenomas.
      The investigators are therefore assessing tumor size stabilization and pituitary tumor
      secretory profiles during the course of a six month therapy of lapatinib. The purpose of this
      trial will be to estimate the activity of lapatinib in slowing the growth rate of pituitary
      tumors. Lapatinib is an FDA approved drug used to treat breast cancer. However, in this
      study, the drug will be used to treat pituitary cancer.

      STUDY POPULATION

      This study will recruit patients from the Pituitary Center at CSMC who are over the age of 18
      that have a recurrent nonfunctioning adenoma after at least one surgical resection as well as
      patients with prolactinomas who are resistant to dopamine agonist therapy and patients with
      recurrent Cushing's disease.

      PARTICIPANT'S JOURNEY THROUGH THE RESEARCH

      The principal investigator (PI) or co-investigator will determine patients' potential
      eligibility for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The PI or the co-investigator will then approach subjects with recurrent nonfunctioning
      adenomas or prolactinomas resistant to dopamine agonist therapy or recurrent Cushing's
      disease during a visit in the clinic office and ask if these subjects would be interested in
      participating in this study. If the subjects express interest, they will be given the consent
      form to review. They will be encouraged to review it with family, friends, and/or other
      physicians. The PI, co-investigators, or research nurse will be available for any questions
      the subjects might have. If the subjects are still interested, they will be asked to sign and
      return the consent form to the office and a study visit will be scheduled.

      The PI, co-investigator, or member of study staff may also attempt to contact current
      patients by phone to assess interest in participating in the study. The purpose and overall
      structure of the study will be discussed with the possible participant. They will be reminded
      that the study is strictly voluntary and that their involvement or disinterest in the study
      will not affect their ongoing care. If the patient is interested they will be mailed a
      consent to review and will be asked to call the center to schedule an appointment to further
      discuss the study if they decide they are interested.

      Each participant will undergo 8 visits of the course of the study. Each participant will have
      a baseline visit where a medical history will be taken, a physical, visual field test,
      electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), and blood draw will be performed. At this
      point lapatinib therapy will begin and the patients will be asked to take the drug daily for
      the next six months. Patients will take Lapatinib 1250 mg daily (orally), which is the
      standardized dose used to treat breast cancer patients. Visit 2 will be 1 month after the
      participant has started lapatinib. At visit 2 all participants will receive a physical exam,
      a history will be taken, an ECG will be performed, and a blood draw will occur. Visit 3 will
      be 2 months after starting lapatinib. A physical exam and history will be performed along
      with an ECG and echocardiogram and blood draw. Visit 4 will be 3 months after starting
      lapatinib. A physical, history, blood draw, ECG, visual field test, and a magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of the pituitary will be performed. Visit 5 will occur 4 months after starting
      lapatinib. A physical exam and history along with a blood draw and ECG and echocardiogram
      will occur. Visit 6 will be 5 months after starting lapatinib. A physical exam, history, ECG,
      and a blood draw will occur. Visit 7 will occur 6 months after the start of lapatinib. A
      physical exam, history, blood draw, visual field test, ECG, echocardiogram and MRI of the
      pituitary will occur. At this point lapatinib will be discontinued. Visit 8 will occur 1
      month after visit 7 and a physical exam, history, blood draw, and ECG and and echocardiogram
      will occur.
