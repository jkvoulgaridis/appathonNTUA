  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of varenicline treatment on cue induced
      craving to smoking using brain imaging. The investigators hypothesize that participants will
      report reduced urges to smoke and will have less activation in parts of the brain associated
      with craving.

      Treatment with varenicline reduces overall subjective cigarette craving and smoking reward in
      nicotine-dependent smokers. This preliminary study will explore the impact of varenicline
      treatment on smoking cue-induced craving and associated regional brain activation using BOLD
      fMRI. Twenty healthy smokers (10 males, 10 females) will undergo two BOLD fMRI scans with the
      presentation of smoking-related and neutral cues at baseline and after five weeks of
      treatment with open-label varenicline. The investigators hypothesize that participants will
      report reduced urges to smoke on the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges-Brief and have less
      activation of the brain areas associated with craving during the fMRI after 5 weeks of
      varenicline and smoking cessation counseling compared to the baseline scan.

          <title>Change in Post-Resist Craving</title>
          <description>Change in Post-resist task craving between Scan 1, pre-medication, and Scan 2, post- medication, as measured on a 0-10 Likert scale. The Within Sessions Rating scale (Range 0-10) measures craving with 0 indicating Not at All and 10 indicating Extremely. Change scores were calculate by subtracting the craving score immediately following the pre-medication scan from the craving score immediately following the post-medication scan.</description>
