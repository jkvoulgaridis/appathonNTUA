  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety profile, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and disease response of Ixazomib administered orally in participants with relapsed and/or
      refractory multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to treat people who
      have multiple myeloma. This study will look at the safety and efficacy of ixazomib and will
      enroll approximately 60 participants.

      Participants will receive ixazomib by oral capsule twice weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a
      21-day cycle. The study will consist of a dose escalation phase to determine the MTD,
      followed by an expansion phase in which participants will be treated at the MTD.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 8 years.

    <time_frame>From first dose of the study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug or start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy (Up to 81.1 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal investigational drug. The untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death;is life-threatening;requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of present hospitalization;results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;or is a medically important event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of other outcomes listed in definition above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs after administration of first dose of study drug and through 30 days after last dose of study drug or until start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

      <pre_assignment_details>60 participants with a diagnosis of relapsed and/or refractory (RR) multiple myeloma were enrolled in 1 of 7 ixazomib dose escalation groups (26 participants) and/or 1 of 4 ixazomib dose expansion groups (40 participants). 6 Participants in 2.0 mg/m^2 dose escalation cohort were also included in the expansion group: 5 in RR, 1 in VR arms.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal investigational drug. The untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death;is life-threatening;requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of present hospitalization;results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;or is a medically important event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of other outcomes listed in definition above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs after administration of first dose of study drug and through 30 days after last dose of study drug or until start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy.</description>

          <title>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</title>
          <description>ORR is defined as percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or minimal response (MR) as assessed by the investigator using International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response criteria. CR=Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and &lt;5% plasma cells in bone marrow. PR=≥50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to &lt;200 mg /24 h. MR=25-49% reduction in the serum monoclonal paraprotein maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks; 50-89% reduction in 24-h urinary light chain excretion, which still exceeds 200 mg/24 h, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks; for participants with non-secretory myeloma only, 25-49% reduction in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate and on trephine biopsy, if biopsy is performed, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks; 25-49% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas; no increase in the size or number of lytic bone lesions.</description>
          <population>Response-evaluable population included participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had measurable disease at baseline, and at least 1 post baseline disease assessment.</population>
