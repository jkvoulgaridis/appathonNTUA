    <textblock>
      This was an open label, randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of randomized 2:1
      Ruxolitinib tablets versus best-available therapy, as selected by the investigator. The
      purpose was to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Ruxolitinib
      (INC424/INCB018424) given twice daily to the best-available therapy, in subjects with primary
      myelofibrosis (PMF), post polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF) or post essential
      thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (PET-MF).

      This study included a randomized treatment phase, followed by an extension phase. The
      treatment phase lasted from Study Day 1 (day of randomization) to the occurrence of a
      protocol-specified progressive disease event or study conclusion, whichever came first. The
      extension phase (including crossover of control group patients) lasted from the progressive
      disease event until the earliest of the following events: a) the patient was no longer
      receiving clinical benefit, b) the patient chose to withdraw from the study, or c) the study
      ended. All patients received ruxolitinib in the extension phase of the study. Maximum
      individual patient duration was 5 years.

    <description>The change in spleen volume from baseline to week 48 was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or by computer tomography (CT) for participants unable to undergo MRI) and was calculated only for participants who had an evaluable spleen volume at baseline. The percentage of participants achieving a greater than or equal to 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline to week 48 was then calculated by treatment group.</description>

    <description>DoMSR is defined as the interval between the first spleen volume measurement that is &gt;=35% reduction from baseline and the first scan that is no longer = 35% reduction AND that is a &gt;25% increase over nadir. It was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate for each treatment arm. The analysis was performed only for subjects who achieved greater than 35% reduction in spleen volume.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomization until death from any cause</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the interval between randomization and the date of the bone marrow blast count of 20% or greater OR the date of the first peripheral blast count of 20% or greater that was subsequently confirmed to have been sustained for at least 8 weeks OR the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Bone Marrow Histomorphology at Week 48 (Primary Analysis)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This was noted as fibrosis density and was tabulated by fibrosis grade at baseline and at week 48 (post-baseline). Descriptive statistics (participant percentages) were used.
Fibrosis grades: 0 Scattered linear reticulin with no intersections corresponding to normal bone marrow ; 1 Loose network of reticulin with many intersections, especially in perivascular areas; 2 Diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections, occasionally with only focal bundles of collagen and/or focal osteosclerosis; 3 Diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections with coarse bundles of collagen, often associated with significant osteosclerosis</description>

    <description>Shift table from baseline to last available postbaseline fibrosis grade by treatment
The grade gives an indication of the activity or amount of inflammation and the stage represents the amount of fibrosis or scarring. The grade is assigned a number based on the degree of inflammation, which is usually scored from 0-4 with 0 being no activity and 3 or 4 considered severe activity</description>

    <description>Commercially available therapy, oral or parenteral, per manufacturer's instructions and Investigator discretion. BAT included the option of no treatment.
Patients randomized to BAT were eligible to cross over to receive open−label ruxolitinib after a qualifying progression event, if they met the safety criteria. After the primary analysis in January 2011, patients randomized to receive BAT were allowed to cross over to receive ruxolitinib and move to the extension phase of the study without a qualifying progression event.</description>

        <description>This was noted as fibrosis density and was tabulated by fibrosis grade at baseline and at week 48 (post-baseline). Descriptive statistics (participant percentages) were used.
Fibrosis grades: 0 Scattered linear reticulin with no intersections corresponding to normal bone marrow ; 1 Loose network of reticulin with many intersections, especially in perivascular areas; 2 Diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections, occasionally with only focal bundles of collagen and/or focal osteosclerosis; 3 Diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections with coarse bundles of collagen, often associated with significant osteosclerosis</description>
