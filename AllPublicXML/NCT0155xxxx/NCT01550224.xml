  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to first determine if temozolomide plus vorinostat in combination
      can control relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determine if this
      combination can be safely taken. The study will look at the side effects of the Temozolomide
      plus Vorinostat in combination and whether the treatment schedule is tolerated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the clinical efficacy as determined by the
      rate of morphological complete remission, of 2 different treatment regimens of temozolomide
      and vorinostat administered to 2 distinct groups of participants patients with AML and poor
      prognostic features. Participants will be allocated to treatment on the basis of
      O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status.

          <description>The rate of morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that achieve MLFS. The outcome is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that demonstrated MLFS. This assessment is independent of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or platelets (PLT) recovery status. MLFS is defined below.

          <title>Disease-free Survival (DFS) at 2 Years</title>
          <description>Disease-Free Survival (DFS) is defined as survival after complete response (CR) without disease progression. DFS is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that experienced CR and were alive without progression (ie, without disease) 2 years after induction chemotherapy. CR is defined as all of the following.
CR = &lt; 5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules; &gt; 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods; no persistence of extramedullary disease absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL platelets (PLT) ≥ 100,000/µL</description>

        <title>Relapse-Free Survival (RFS) at 2 Years</title>
        <description>Relapse-free survival (RFS) is defined as survival after complete response (CR) or (PR) without further disease progression. RFS is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that experienced CR or PR, and were alive without progression 2 years after induction chemotherapy. CR and PR are defined as the following.
CR = &lt; 5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules; &gt; 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods; no persistence of extramedullary disease absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL platelets (PLT) ≥ 100,000/µL
