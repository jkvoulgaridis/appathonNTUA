      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effect on the body of Tabalumab
      (LY2127399) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in Japanese participants with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

    <textblock>
      The study has 3 cohorts. Cohort 2 and cohort 2-SC will be conducted in parallel with some
      data presented combined.

      Cohort 1 - Participants will receive 100 mg Tabalumab (LY2127399) intravenously (IV), 1.3
      milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) bortezomib IV, and 20 mg dexamethasone orally.

      Cohort 2 - Participants will receive 300 mg Tabalumab (LY2127399) IV, 1.3 mg/m^2 bortezomib
      IV, and 20 mg dexamethasone orally.

      Cohort 2-SC - Participants will receive 300 mg Tabalumab (LY2127399) IV, 1.3 mg/m^2
      bortezomib subcutaneously (SC), and 20 mg dexamethasone orally.

      Cohort 2-SC was added per protocol amendment in February 2013.

        <title>Duration of Response (DoR)</title>
        <description>DoR is defined as the time from the date when the measurement criteria are met for CR, CRu, or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the date of first observation of measured progressive disease. For responding participants who die without progressive disease (including death from study disease),DoR will be censored at the date of death. For responding participants not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who do not have progressive disease, DoR will be censored at the last objective progression-free assessment date prior to the data cut-off date.</description>
