  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether patients with cervical cancer treated with
      IMRT have less side effects with equal cancer control compared to standard radiation
      techniques. With standard radiation techniques, normal pelvic organs near the tumor receive
      radiation dose, which leads to side effects. IMRT is a new radiation technique that can
      reduce radiation dose to these organs and may reduce side effects.

      Compared to conventional RT techniques, the hypothesis is that IMRT will reduce acute
      hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity for cervical cancer patients treated with
      concurrent cisplatin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple randomized controlled trials have established concurrent cisplatin-based
      chemoradiotherapy as the standard of care for locally advanced cervical cancer [3-8]. The
      addition of concurrent cisplatin to radiotherapy (RT) increases pelvic control, disease-free
      survival (DFS) and overall survival; however, 5-year DFS and overall survival are still only
      approximately 60% and 5-year pelvic failure is approximately 30%. Moreover, acute
      gastrointestinal (GI) and hematologic toxicity are increased. Approximately 30% of patients
      will experience acute grade ≥ 3 toxicity, predominantly GI and hematologic. Methods to reduce
      toxicity during chemoradiotherapy, particularly gastrointestinal and hematologic, could
      mitigate this toxicity and take advantage of the therapeutic benefits of intensive concurrent
      chemotherapy.

      Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a modern RT technique that differs from
      conventional techniques in many ways. First, patients undergo computed tomography (CT)
      simulation so that customized target volumes can be defined 3-dimensionally. IMRT treatment
      planning involves multiple beam angles and uses computerized inverse treatment planning
      optimization algorithms to identify dose distributions and intensity patterns that conform
      dose to the target, reducing radiation dose to surrounding tissues. IMRT delivery is
      typically accomplished with the use of multileaf collimators, which involve small motorized
      leaflets (collimators) that move in and out of the beam path, modulating the dose intensity.
