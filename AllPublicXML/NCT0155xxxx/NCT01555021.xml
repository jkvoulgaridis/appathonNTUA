    <textblock>
      More than one out of three individuals treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not
      experience a full reduction of symptoms even when treated with adequate antidepressant
      medication. These individuals may have treatment-resistant depression. This is a condition
      that contributes to the tremendous costs of MDD, in terms of health care costs, functional
      impairment (limitation of an individual's functional ability), and diminished quality of
      life.

      There is a clear need for personalized medicine, for people at high risk for
      treatment-resistant depression. If these individuals could be identified early in the course
      of their depression, they could be recommended for more intensive or specialized
      interventions. Doing so could improve their likelihood of having a full reduction in their
      symptoms.

      Today, there are many treatment options for MDD. Individuals can spend months or years in and
      out of treatment before receiving one that works for their treatment-resistant depression.

      The investigators want to study treatment resistant depression by examining specific genes
      (genotyping) that might influence how your body responds to certain antidepressant
      medications. This process of examining specific genes is not experimental. To look at your
      specific genes, the investigators will collect a blood sample. Genes contain the material
      passed from parent to child that determines the make-up of the body and mind. For example,
      some genes control the color of your hair or eyes. Genes are contained in your DNA
      (deoxyribonucleic acid). There are many differences in DNA, from one person to another. These
      differences may affect a person's chances of having a particular disease.

      This will be a 6-month, randomized, controlled study of assay-guided treatment (AGT) versus
      treatment as usual (TAU) in adult inpatients with major depressive disorder. Two hundred
      subjects will be randomized to receive AGT or TAU. After subjects are screened, determined to
      be eligible, and complete baseline assessments, blood samples for genotyping will be obtained
      from all subjects as well as saliva samples for future GWAS analysis from all subjects. Only
      those subjects that are randomized to the AGT arm will have their blood samples immediately
      analyzed. Subjects in the TAU arm will have their blood samples stored for future analysis..

      Once the blood samples are obtained, the attending psychiatrists will be asked to indicate
      their top three choices of antidepressants and at what doses they will initiate treatment. In
      order to prevent delays in providing treatments, the first choice antidepressants will be
      started prior to receiving assay results.

      Upon receiving the assay reports (AGT arm), the attending psychiatrists will be asked whether
      the reports influenced their choice of antidepressant treatments and doses of
      antidepressants, as well as their confidence in their choices. The attending psychiatrists
      will then document any switches in antidepressant treatments or changes in doses of current
      antidepressant medications on a structured form. The assay reports will be available between
      3 to 5 days after the blood samples are taken. The attending psychiatrists who are randomized
      to be provided the results of CYP genotyping will also be provided a phone number for
      consultation with Genomind Labs regarding the interpretation of the results.

      Trough antidepressant blood samples for the AGT arm (10-12 hours after last dose) for
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) will be obtained within 24 hours of discharge. Blood
      samples will also be obtained from the TAU arm, but they will be stored for future analysis
      of CYP genotyping and biomarker analysis of treatment resistant MDD. Clinical follow-up will
      proceed as felt to be clinically indicated. For subjects who have been discharged before the
      assay results are received, the attending psychiatrists will complete the from indicating
      changes in treatments as if patients were still in hospital. Results and recommendations will
      be forwarded to the identified outpatient psychiatrists. (note: blood levels of
      antidepressants were not analyzed)

      The AGT arm is not standard care for patients with depression. The addition of assay-results
      and questionnaires makes the AGT arm different than standard care. Only the questionnaires
      make the TAU arm different than standard care.

      Note:

      Within 24 hours after you are admitted to the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit, the &quot;baseline&quot;
      assessment will occur. If you stay in the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit for more than one week,
      the &quot;weekly&quot; assessment will occur every 7 days. Typically, patients spend an average of 8-10
      days in the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit. The day before or the day of your discharge from the
      Inpatient Psychiatric Unit, your &quot;discharge&quot; assessment will occur. One, 3, and 6 months
      after you are discharged, you will be asked to complete follow-up assessments.

    <description>To determine the efficacy of assay-guided treatment (AGT) versus treatment-as-usual (TAU), in terms of depression severity as measured by change in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR 16), adjusted for baseline severity, upon discharge, and at 1, 3, and 6 months post discharge from inpatient treatment. The QUIDS-SR 16 is a self rating 16 item multiple-choice questionnaire that measure severity of depression over the past week. The range on the QIDS-SR IS 0-27, with 0-5 indicating no depression; 6-10, mild depression; 11-15; moderate depression; 16-20 severe depression; and greater than or equal to 21, very severe depression.</description>

    <description>This group will provide blood samples to be analyzed at a later date for genotyping to determine the activity of CYP-450 enzymes that are important in metabolizing antidepressant medications.Treatment will be initiated based on the attending clinicians decision making absent genotyping results.
All subjects in the group will receive the following assessment instruments for diagnosis: SCID-I/P and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)
All subjects in the group will have the severity of their depression measured by the HAM D-17 (physician rating scale), the QIDS-SR-16 (patient rating). Clinical status will be measured by the CGI-S scale (1-7 with 7 being high functioning). Side effects ratings will be measured by the UKU. ATRQ will be used to assess the degree of treatment resistance by measuring the number of prior antidepressant trials.
Patients in the TAU group will provide saliva samples for future GWAS analysis.</description>

    <description>Patients will provide blood samples at the beginning of the study. If the patient is in the AGT group (as opposed to the TAU group), their blood samples will be sent for genotyping immediately. AGT psychiatrists will be given the results of genotyping within 3-5 days in order to decide which antidepressants to use long-term and at what doses. Patients in the Treatment as Usual group will have their blood samples stored for future analysis. Both groups will provide saliva samples for GWAS analysis at a alter date; however, since the study was terminated early, GWAS testing for both groups and genotyping for the TAU group were not performed.
Patients will receive questionnaires to measure their mood, side effects, and symptoms.
Patients will be asked to participate in 3 follow-up phone calls (1 month, 3 months, and 6 months) to measure their mood.</description>

        The study was conducted on the 24-bed inpatient psychiatric unit at Massachusetts General
        Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained using the MGH-IRB approved consent form. A

        <title>Change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self Rating (SR) 16 Item</title>
        <description>To determine the efficacy of assay-guided treatment (AGT) versus treatment-as-usual (TAU), in terms of depression severity as measured by change in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR 16), adjusted for baseline severity, upon discharge, and at 1, 3, and 6 months post discharge from inpatient treatment. The QUIDS-SR 16 is a self rating 16 item multiple-choice questionnaire that measure severity of depression over the past week. The range on the QIDS-SR IS 0-27, with 0-5 indicating no depression; 6-10, mild depression; 11-15; moderate depression; 16-20 severe depression; and greater than or equal to 21, very severe depression.</description>
