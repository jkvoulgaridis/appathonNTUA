  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two management
      strategies for patients with a recent onset of low back pain (LBP). One is based on usual
      care and the other is based on early access to physical therapy following a pragmatic
      treatment-based classification approach. The secondary purposes are to compare the subsequent
      healthcare utilization associated with two management strategies as well as to evaluate the
      importance of psychosocial factors on outcomes within both groups of treatment. The overall
      hypothesis guiding the study is that the additional initial treatment expense incurred by
      early implementation will result in superior short-term clinical effectiveness, and will be
      more cost-effective in the long-term due to reduced healthcare utilization. We will also
      explore the importance of psychosocial factors on outcomes within both treatment groups,
      which may provide insights for further improving treatment strategies.

      The specific aims of this study are the following:

        1. Compare the effectiveness of two primary care management strategies for patients with a
           recent onset of combat-related LBP. We hypothesize early physical therapy access for
           these Soldiers will result in greater improvements in function and quality of life over
           1 year as compared to a stepped care strategy.

        2. Compare the subsequent healthcare utilization associated with two management strategies
           for patients with a recent onset combat-related LBP. We hypothesize early physical
           therapy access will result in decreased healthcare utilization over 1 year as compared
           to a stepped care strategy.

        3. Evaluate the importance of psychosocial factors on outcomes within both groups of
           treatment.

    <measure>Modified Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (OSW) is a 10-item condition-specific measure of functional status (pain and disability) for patients with low back pain (LBP). Each question has 6 possible answers (0 = worse, 5 = best). The raw score is doubled to provide a percent score from 0 to 100%; with 0 equaling no disability and 100% equalling the worst possible outcome. It measures pain-related disability. We used the modified version that replaces the sex life item with an employment/ homemaking item due to poor compliance with the former. The OSW is widely used in research on non-operative management of patients with LBP, with high levels of test-retest reliability among stable patients (ICC = 0.90), good construct validity, and responsiveness to change for patients with acute LBP. It has a minimum clinically important difference of 6 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 0-10 numeric pain rating scale ('0' indicating no pain, and '10' worst imaginable pain) will be used to assess LBP intensity. Numeric pain scales are known to have excellent test-retest reliability. Previous research has found the NPRS to be responsive to change, with a minimum clinically important difference of two points among patients with acute LBP receiving physical therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Change (GRC) of +3 or More (Minimum Clinically Important Change)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The GRC is a 15-point scale that asks the patient to rate the degree of change in his or her condition from the beginning of treatment to the present. The mid-point of the scale is no change (0). Ratings from -1 to -7 represent varying degrees of a worsening of the patient's condition, while rating from +1 to +7 represent varying degrees of improvement. A score of 3 or higher is considered clinically meaningful change.</description>

        <title>Modified Oswestry Disability Index</title>
        <description>The Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (OSW) is a 10-item condition-specific measure of functional status (pain and disability) for patients with low back pain (LBP). Each question has 6 possible answers (0 = worse, 5 = best). The raw score is doubled to provide a percent score from 0 to 100%; with 0 equaling no disability and 100% equalling the worst possible outcome. It measures pain-related disability. We used the modified version that replaces the sex life item with an employment/ homemaking item due to poor compliance with the former. The OSW is widely used in research on non-operative management of patients with LBP, with high levels of test-retest reliability among stable patients (ICC = 0.90), good construct validity, and responsiveness to change for patients with acute LBP. It has a minimum clinically important difference of 6 points.</description>

            <description>The usual care (UC) group will be managed with stepped care approach, receiving a screening exam, advice, education, activity limitation profile and medications if needed, but no early physical therapy.
Usual Care (UC): Initial management for all patients will include an activity-limiting profile for up to 30 days and a 10-day supply of medications if needed (NSAIDs and muscle relaxers). All patients will then receive advice and education about the favorable natural history of LBP and the advantages of remaining as active as possible.

The physical therapy treatment will be based on the Treatment Based Classification system (an approach that places patients into either an extension-oriented, core strength/stabilization, or a spinal manipulation treatment group based on signs and symptoms).</description>

        <title>Global Rating of Change (GRC) of +3 or More (Minimum Clinically Important Change)</title>
        <description>The GRC is a 15-point scale that asks the patient to rate the degree of change in his or her condition from the beginning of treatment to the present. The mid-point of the scale is no change (0). Ratings from -1 to -7 represent varying degrees of a worsening of the patient's condition, while rating from +1 to +7 represent varying degrees of improvement. A score of 3 or higher is considered clinically meaningful change.</description>
