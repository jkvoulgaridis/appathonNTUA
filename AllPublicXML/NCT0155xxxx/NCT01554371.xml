  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of eribulin (Halaven™) and cyclophosphamide
      (Cytoxan®) given together at different doses. This study will look at what effects, good
      and/or bad, that these drugs have on solid tumors. Eribulin is a drug that has been approved
      by the FDA for breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Cyclophosphamide has
      been approved for different types of cancers (including breast cancer). However, the
      combination of eribulin and cyclophosphamide is considered experimental; that means this
      combination has not been approved by the FDA.

      The funding for this study is provided by Eisai Inc., the maker of eribulin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/II trial designed to determine the MTD and DLTs of the combination of
      eribulin and cyclophosphamide in solid tumors and make preliminary estimates regarding
      efficacy of this treatment in patients with advanced breast cancer.

      The study includes a standard dose-confirmation schema (phase Ib portion) enrolling 3 to 6
      patients/subjects, with any solid tumors, per cohort (3+3 design) with a total of 18
      patients. The dose-expansion (phase II portion) will enroll 40 patients with advanced breast
      cancer to detect an effect size of 15% with a power of 80% with endpoints of safety,
      efficacy, and clinical benefit rate. A maximum of 58 patients will be enrolled on the phase
      Ib and II portions of this trial combined and will be treated until disease progression or
      toxicity mandate treatment change.

      Eribulin is a non-taxane microtubule inhibitor that is FDA approved as monotherapy for the
      treatment of taxane and anthracycline resistant metastatic breast cancer. The combination of
      docetaxel and cyclophosphamide is a well-accepted adjuvant chemotherapy regimen that has
      become an increasingly common therapeutic choice for intermediate risk early stage breast
      cancer. Eribulin has a favorable toxicity profile compared to docetaxel with the most common
      adverse reactions (incidence ≤25%) including neutropenia, anemia, asthenia/fatigue, alopecia,
      peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and constipation. Eribulin appears to have activity in taxane
      resistant disease, making it an attractive partner with cyclophosphamide.

      Neuropathy can be a devastating complication from adjuvant chemotherapy and in the metastatic
      setting, may limit effective therapy and reduce quality of life. Understanding the host
      factors that predict risk for neuropathy is critical, as these patients may in particular
      benefit from the lower risk of neuropathy associated with eribulin therapy. In conjunction
      with this trial, we have included correlative studies to study the proposed pharmacogenomic
      factors associated with risk of neuropathy. In this way we will potentially be able to
      identify patients who could preferentially be treated with less neurotoxic microtubule
      inhibitors.

    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate of the combination of eribulin and cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced breast cancer (Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be re-evaluated for response at 6 weeks (after 2 cycles), then every 9 weeks until end of study therapy for complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD). Response will be evaluated in this study using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (uni-dimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 1.1 criteria.
Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)</description>

    <measure>Evaluate European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) (EORTC QLQ-C30) Scores (Phase 1b and Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / quality of life (QoL) scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. This questionnaire will be administered at baseline (within 7 days of cycle 1 day 1), and thereafter at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months. Questionnaires should continue to be completed at the scheduled time-points (including beyond study termination), until the patient has progressive disease or starts a different course of anti-tumor treatment, whichever comes first.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy /Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-Ntx) (Phase 1b and Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT/GOG-Ntx contains 11 items scored from 0-4, and scores are summed for a range of 11-44. Higher total scores correlate with more severe neuropathy. . Questions on the Ntx subscale pertain to the feeling of weakness all over, numbness or tingling in the hands or feet, and difficulty buttoning their buttons evaluating symptoms and concerns associated specifically with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. Assessments will take place by a health care provider at baseline (within 7 days of cycle 1 day 1), and at the start of each cycle until the patient has progressive disease, starts a different course of anti-tumor treatment, or until 12 months from time of enrollment on study, whichever comes first. It will be performed before drug administration and before any tumor assessments are communicated to the patient.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate Modified Total Neuropathy Score (mTNS) (Phase 1b and Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The mTNS is a 10 item tool that combines patient report of subjective sensory and motor symptoms, deep tendon reflexes, manual muscle testing of distal muscles, pin sensibility, and quantitative vibration thresholds using a Biothesiometer®. Each neuropathy item is scored by a physician or nurse on a 0-4 scale. The scores are summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 40. Higher total scores correlate with more severe neuropathy. Assessments will take place by a health care provider at baseline (within 7 days of cycle 1 day 1), and at the start of each cycle until the patient has progressive disease, starts a different course of anti-tumor treatment, or until 12 months from time of enrollment on study, whichever comes first. It will be performed before drug administration and before any tumor assessments are communicated to the patient.</description>
