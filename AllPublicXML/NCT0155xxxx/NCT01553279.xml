  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of
      concomitant administration of V419 (PR51) with 2 types of meningococcal serogroup C conjugate
      (MCC) vaccines to healthy infants at 3 and 4 months of age in terms of antibody
      seroprotection rate (SPR) to MCC. Participants also received a Haemophilus influenza type B
      (Hib)-MCC vaccination at 12 months of age. It was hypothesized that the SPR to MCC at 1 month
      post-dose 2 of either tetanus toxoid conjugated Meningo C (MCC-TT) or CRM197 conjugated
      Meningo C (MCC-CRM) vaccines would be acceptable when administered concomitantly with V419.

    <description>The percentage of participants meeting Ab response rates for V14 antigens was determined after V114 Dose 3. Antibody response rate criteria for Haemophilus influenza Type B (PRP); hepatitis B (HBsAg); diphtheria; tetanus; and polio types 1, 2, and 3 are shown in the rows below. The percentage of seroresponders to pertussis seroresponders (pertussis toxoid [PT]; filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA); fimbrae types 2 and 3 [FIM]; and pertactin [PRN]) was determined as 1) if pre-vaccination Ab concentration &lt;lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) but post-vaccination Ab concentration ≥LLoQ; or 2) if pre-vaccination Ab concentration was ≥LLoQ but post-vaccination Ab concentration was ≥pre-immunization levels. Antibody titres were measured by RIA for PRP, enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECi) for HBsAg, micrometabolic inhibition test (MIT) for diphtheria and poliovirus, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for tetanus, PT, FHA, FIM, and PRN.</description>

Antibody response rate criteria for Haemophilus influenza Type B (PRP); hepatitis B (HBsAg); diphtheria; tetanus; and polio types 1, 2, and 3 are shown in the rows below. The percentage of seroresponders to pertussis seroresponders (pertussis toxoid [PT]; filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA); fimbrae types 2 and 3 [FIM]; and pertactin [PRN]) was determined as 1) if pre-vaccination Ab concentration &lt;lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) but post-vaccination Ab concentration ≥LLoQ; or 2) if pre-vaccination Ab concentration was ≥LLoQ but post-vaccination Ab concentration was ≥pre-immunization levels. Antibody titres were measured by RIA for PRP, enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECi) for HBsAg, micrometabolic inhibition test (MIT) for diphtheria and poliovirus, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for tetanus, PT, FHA, FIM, and PRN.</description>
