      A Multicenter, Open-label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Efficacy of
      Certolizumab Pegol in Children and Adolescents With Moderately to Severely Active
      Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA).

      The overall study consists of a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks and an Open-Label Treatment
      Period which will continue until the approval of the marketing application for the
      Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) indication in the study
      participant's country or region or until further notice from UCB (approximately 4-6 years
      duration; depending on region). A Final Visit will be conducted 12 weeks after last dose of
      study medication. Overall, study visits will occur monthly during the first 6 months and
      every 2 months afterwards. All patients will receive active treatment with Certolizumab
      Pegol. The dose will depend on actual weight. Home dosing will be allowed between study
      visits.

      If less than 50 % of the study population achieves an adequate response to the treatment
      (American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 30 % (PedACR30) response) at Week 16, the study
      will be entirely discontinued.

    <description>CZP will be administered subcutaneously as a fixed dose based on weight every 2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) throughout the study.
CZP will be provided by UCB as a CZP 200 mg/ml solution for single subcutaneous (sc) injection, in a single use prefilled syringe (PFS). Each PFS contains an extractable volume of 0.25 mL, 0.5 mL or 1 mL of CZP solution.
Eligible subjects will begin with 3 loading doses of CZP followed by a treatment dose for the duration of the study based on the weight range.
Reduced CZP regimen (after implementation of protocol amendments 4 and 5):
10 to &lt; 20 kg: Loading dose = 50 mg Q2W (1 x 0.25 mL sc); treatment dose = 50 mg Q4W (1 x 0.25 mL sc);

             diagnosis of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) (according to the International
             League of Associations for Rheumatology Classification of Juvenile Idiopathic
             Arthritis, 2001) and initiation of JIA treatment for at least 6 months prior to
             Baseline (Visit 2). Eligible JIA categories include: polyarthritis rheumatoid

             with active arthritis at Screening and at Baseline

          -  Study participants must have had an inadequate response to, or intolerance to, at

             withdrawn for documented reasons of intolerability or inadequate response

          -  If the study participant is using oral corticosteroid therapy, the dose must have been
             stable for at least 7 days prior to the Baseline arthritis assessment at a maximum
             dose of 10 mg or 0.2 mg/kg prednisone (or equivalent) per day, whichever is the
             smaller dose

          -  Study participant had previous treatment with a biological therapy for juvenile

             with CZP (whether in a study or not)

          -  Study participant has a history of systemic JIA, with or without systemic features

          -  Study participant has a secondary, noninflammatory type of rheumatic disease or of
             joint pains (eg, fibromyalgia) that in the Investigator's opinion is symptomatic
             enough to interfere with evaluation of the effect of study medication

          -  Study participant has other inflammatory arthritis (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus,
             inflammatory bowel disease-related)

          -  Study participant has active uveitis or a history of active uveitis within the
             preceding 6 months

          -  Study participant has current, chronic or recurrent clinically significant infections

          -  Study participant has a current sign or symptom which may indicate infection (eg,
             fever, cough), a history of chronic or recurrent infections within the same organ
             system (more than 3 episodes requiring antibiotics/antivirals during the 12 months
             prior to Screening [Visit 1]), had a recent (within the 6 months prior to Screening
             [Visit 1]) serious or life-threatening infection (including herpes zoster), or is at a
             high risk of infection in the Investigator's opinion (eg, study participants with leg
             ulcers, indwelling urinary catheter, and persistent or recurrent chest infections or
             permanently bed-ridden or wheelchair bound)

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a pre-specified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
