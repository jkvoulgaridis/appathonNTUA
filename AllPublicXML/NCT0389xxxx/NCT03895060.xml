  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many different techniques exist for effective vertical bone augmentation, such as the use of
      particulate bone grafts and bone graft substitutes, barrier membranes for guided bone
      regeneration (GBR), autogenous and allogenic block grafts, and the application of distraction
      osteogenesis. Harvesting of autogenous block grafts is associated with greater morbidity
      compared with the less invasive procedure of using autogenous particles harvested through
      bone scrapers. On the other hand, particulate grafts always require a space-maintaining
      barrier, or their physical properties would not allow three-dimensional bone regeneration as
      those of block grafts do.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An autogenous ring block is harvested from the chin area by trephine bur and the autogenous
      bone chips will be collected with a bone scraper, then a specially manufactured machine
      titanium tenting screw is used to fasten the ring block to the alveolar ridge. Two or three
      ring blocks is screwed according to the defect. Then resorbable collagen membrane is fixed to
      the alveolar ridge instead of the titanium-reinforced e-PTFE and equally autogenous and
      xenograft bone particles is packed around the screw to fill the defect area completely.
      Extreme care is taken to avoid autogenous particles drifting distally toward the area of the
      block. The barrier membrane was then closed over the block and particulate graft and fixed by
      bone tacks. Then periosteal releasing incision is done to allow tension free adaption of the
      mucoperisteal flap.

    <description>A crestal incision is made using No. 15 blade extending over the anterior maxilla, an anterior vertical releasing incision is made and a full mucoperiosteum flaps elevated to provide access to the alveolar ridge and the lateral aspect of the maxilla
Autogenous onlay ring blocks is taken by a trephine bur from the chin area and then fixed by screws to the deficient maxillary alveolar height.
Equally autogenous and xenograft bone particles is packed around the screw to fill the defect area completely.
The collagen membrane is fixed to the alveolar ridge by bone tacks and the mixture of autogenous and xenograft bone is then packed.
The flap will then be closed using interrupted 4/0 resorbable sutures.</description>
