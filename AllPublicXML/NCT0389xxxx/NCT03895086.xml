  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a common, expensive and controversial condition, one of whose origins would
      be central nervous system sensitization to pain.

      Usual treatment consists of multimodal care including physical activity. This dosage should
      be adapted to the patient's health needs. Currently recommended physical exercise is aerobic
      work associated with muscle reinforcement, without evidence of superiority of the efficacy of
      one over the other. Recommended dosage for aerobic exercises is 20 minutes (or twice 10
      minutes), two to three times a week (70 - 80% of Theoretical Maximum Heart Rate).

      At the Vendee Departmental Hospital Center (CHD), adapted physical activity is proposed to
      fibromyalgia patientsby the associative group &quot;Siel Bleu&quot;. This physical activity, performed
      with patients suffering from different pathologies, is non specific for fibromyalgia context.

      In parallel, a preliminary study showed the interest of a lifestyle coaching for fibromyalgia
      patients, performed by physiotherapists, nurses and coaches specifically trainede.

      Another possibility seems to be personalized coaching with a physical activity adapted to the
      physical and organizational constraints of the patient, and specific to pathology. This
      solution would make it possible to adapt to the patient's choice of physical activities, to
      ensure a better adaptation to their physical and organizational constraints as well as a
      better individualized follow-up.
