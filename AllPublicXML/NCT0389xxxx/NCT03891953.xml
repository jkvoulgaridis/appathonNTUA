  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/Ib, open label study. The escalation portion will characterize the safety
      and tolerability of DKY709 and DKY709 in combination with PDR001 in subjects with NSCLC or
      melanoma who have received prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, or subjects with NPC. After the
      determination of the MTD/RD for a particular treatment arm, dose expansion will further
      assess safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and anti-tumor activity of each regimen at the MTD/RD.
