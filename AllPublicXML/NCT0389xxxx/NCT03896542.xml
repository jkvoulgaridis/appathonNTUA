  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aims: To establish whether the effectiveness of conventional treatment is increased when it
      is complemented with video-based therapy, whether specific rehabilitation or commercial after
      subacute stroke.

      Design: Randomized clinical trial with pre / post-test and follow-up evaluation, assessor
      blinded study.

      Methodology: Three different groups: conventional treatment, conventional treatment and
      commercial videogame, or conventional treatment and specific rehabilitation videogame. The
      three groups completed 12 sessions.
