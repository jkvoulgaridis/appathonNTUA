    <textblock>
      This pilot study has two aims. The first aim is to establish the feasibility of occupational
      performance coaching for caregivers of youth with spinal cord injury, and the second aim is
      to establish methodological procedures for a future multi-center study on the effectiveness
      of coaching as an intervention for caregivers of youth with spinal cord injury.

      This study addresses the unmet needs of female primary caregivers of youth with spinal cord
      injury. A randomized crossover delayed treatment design will be used. Consented caregivers
      will be assigned to one of two groups: coaching via face-to-face and delayed coaching via
      phone. Each caregiver will participate in up to 10 coaching sessions. Each coaching session
      will last up to 90 minutes. Coaching sessions will be audiorecorded for assessment of
      treatment fidelity.
