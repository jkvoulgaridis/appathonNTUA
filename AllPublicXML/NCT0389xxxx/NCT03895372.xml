  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study is being conducted to provide additional PF-06826647 safety and
      tolerability data, and to further explore the clinical efficacy of PF-06826647 in the
      treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Additionally, the study is intended to
      enable selection of oral dose and dosing regimen for the future clinical development of
      PF-06826647.

    <measure>Change from Baseline of Participants With a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 90 (PASI 90) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 90 response was defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI 75) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of body surface area (BSA)&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Psoriasis Score of 'Clear' or 'Almost Clear'</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).</description>

The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 50 response was defined as at least a 50 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>
