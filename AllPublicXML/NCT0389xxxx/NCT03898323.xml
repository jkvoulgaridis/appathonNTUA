  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed project is to improve the treatment of individuals with
      Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). We will conduct a pilot feasibility trial of Approach Bias
      Modification (AABM) training of heavy-drinking non-treatment seeking individuals with AUD. We
      will measure feasibility with respect to recruitment, retention and tolerability of AABM
      training and the Alcohol Drinking Paradigm (ADP). We will also assess changes in alcohol
      craving and alcohol consumption during ADP sessions conducted before and after 2 weeks of
      AABM training.

    <textblock>
      Twelve heavy-drinking non-treatment seeking male community volunteers with a diagnosis of AUD
      will receive 2 weeks of AABM training preceded and followed by a 1-day ADP session.

      AABM training is a computer training program that participants interact with by pushing and
      pulling a joystick. Participants are asked to respond to the format of a presented picture,
      irrespective of the pictures' content. Training effect is achieved by presenting alcohol
      pictures in push format only and non-alcoholic drinks in pull format only. Training is
      conducted in 3 sessions per week for 2 weeks, for a total of 6 sessions.

      The ADP session is a one day human laboratory session taking place at the SFVA Medical
      Center. This human laboratory session involves the self-administration of alcoholic beverages
      by research participants under highly structured, observed conditions in order to evaluate
      the effects of the study intervention (AABM training) on alcohol craving and alcohol
      consumption.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men, ages 21-50;

          2. Able to read English and to complete study evaluations;

          3. Risky (also known as high-risk, or hazardous, or heavy) alcohol use, defined as 25-70
             standard drinks per week on average over the past 30 days; Heavy (also known as risky,
             high-risk, or hazardous) alcohol use, defined as 15-70 standard drinks per week on
             average over the past 30 days.

          4. No more than 3 days/week of alcohol abstinence in the past 30 days, to maximize
             likelihood that participants will choose to drink during the laboratory sessions.

          5. At least 1 heavy drinking day (&gt; 5 drinks/day) per week on average during the 30 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals who are seeking AUD treatment or have been in treatment within the past 6
             months;

          2. Current DSM-V non-alcohol use disorder other than tobacco and marijuana;

             antidepressants during the 30 days prior to entry, as well as anticonvulsants, beta
             blockers, central nervous system stimulants or depressants, or other drugs that cause
             excessive sedation;

             consumption of alcohol or would make study participation hazardous;

          7. History of serious alcohol withdrawal (e.g. seizures, DTs, hospitalization) or a
             Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Scale (CIWA-AD) score &gt; 8;

          8. Participants who report disliking beer will be excluded because beer will be provided
