  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal Incontinence (FI) affects 40 million Americans, predominantly women and elderly. It is
      a major health care burden, significantly impairs quality of life and psychosocial function.
      FI is characterized by multifactorial dysfunction including lumbosacral neuropathy, anorectal
      sensori-motor dysfunction, and abnormal pelvic floor-brain innervation. A critical barrier to
      progress in the treatment of FI is the lack of RCTs, absence of mechanistically based
      non-invasive therapies that modify disease, and a lack of understanding on how treatments
      affect pathophysiology of FI. Consequently, most current remedies remain ineffective. Our
      long-term goal is to address the problem of lack of effective treatments for FI by
      investigating treatments that modulate neuronal perturbations and thereby improve sensory and
      motor control, and to understand the neurobiologic basis of these treatments. Our central
      hypothesis is that a novel, non-invasive treatment consisting of Translumbosacral
      Neuromodulation Therapy (TNT), using repetitive magnetic stimulation, will significantly
      improve FI in the short-term and long-term, by enhancing neural excitability and inducing
      neuroplasticity. Our approach is based on compelling pilot study which showed that TNT at 1
      Hz frequency, significantly improved FI, by enhancing bidirectional gut- brain signaling,
      anal sphincter strength and rectal sensation compared to 5 or 15 Hz. Our objectives are to 1)
      investigate the efficacy, safety and optimal dose of a new treatment, TNT, in a sham
      controlled, randomized dose-dependent study in 132 FI patients; 2) determine the mechanistic
      basis for TNT by assessing the efferent and afferent pelvic floor-brain signaling, and
      sensori-motor function; 3) identify the durability of treatment response and effects of TNT,
      and whether reinforcement TNT provides augmented improvement, by performing a long-term, sham
      controlled randomized trial. Our expected outcomes include the demonstration of TNT as a
      durable, efficacious, safe, mechanistically based, non-invasive, and low risk treatment for
      FI. The impact of our project includes a novel, disease modifying, non-invasive treatment, a
      scientific basis for this treatment, and improved understanding of the pathophysiology of FI
      and how TNT modifies bidirectional gut and brain axes and anorectal function. Ultimately, the
      knowledge generated by this project will provide new avenues for the development of
      innovative, evidence-based therapies for FI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence (FI), defined as the involuntary passage of either formed or liquid stool,
      affects 8-15% of ambulatory Americans, mostly women and elderly and 45% of nursing home
      residents. It occurs at least weekly in 3% of adults, and in 37% of patients attending
      primary care clinics. FI has a major impact on quality of life, causes significant distress
      including anxiety and depression, and carries a considerable health care burden. FI is
      characterized by multifactorial dysfunctions that include lumbosacral neuropathy, anorectal
      sensori-motor dysfunction, and decreased rectosigmoid reservoir capacity and maladaptive
      pelvic floor-brain innervation. Consequently, treatments that help a single dysfunction, for
      example, anal dextranomer injection or anal sphincteroplasty could improve FI by reinforcing
      the anal barrier, but unlikely to improve the multidimensional problem of FI. Also, anal
      sphincteroplasty felt to be effective initially, was disappointing long-term with only 30%
      remaining continent at 10 years. An-other surgical procedure, sacral nerve stimulation (SNS)
      has been shown to be useful in 54% of FI patients, but has significant complications (33%)
      and a failure rate of 15%, its mechanism of action is unknown, and lacks rigorous
      sham-controlled trial. Furthermore, a comparative assessment of the effectiveness of current
      treatments has not been performed, and none of the current therapies have been shown to
      improve the multifactorial pathophysiological dysfunction(s) in FI.

      A critical barrier to progress in the treatment of FI is the lack of RCTs, and absence of
      mechanistically based non-invasive therapies that modify the pathophysiology of FI.
      Consequently, most current remedies have remained ineffective. These findings were
      highlighted by experts at a recent NIDDK workshop focused on research in FI. Our long-term
      goal is to address the problem of lack of effective treatments for FI by investigating
      therapies that modulate peripheral and central neuronal perturbations, and to understand the
      neurobiologic basis of these treatments. Translumbosacral Neuromodulation Therapy (TNT) is a
      novel, non-invasive technique that involves the focal delivery of magnetic energy through an
      insulated coil to the lumbo-sacral nerves that regulate anorectal function. The pulses
      generated are of the same strength as clin-ical MRI machines. It builds on the concept of
      neuromodulation therapies such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) that
      uses a computerized electromechanical medical device to deliver brief pulses of magnetic
      energy and has been shown to be effective in major depression , refractory auditory
      hallucinations (AH), and visceral pain, and our studies in post-stroke dysphagia. Our central
      hypothesis is that TNT will significantly improve FI, both in the short-term and long-term,
      by enhancing neural excitability and inducing neuroplasticity, and thereby will provide a
      multidimensional thera-peutic benefit- improve neuropathy, enhance anal strength, improve
      rectal perception and capacity.

    <description>A probe with 2 pairs of bipolar steel ring electrodes, will be placed in the rectum. At each site a mapping procedure is performed with single stimulus coil to assess the motor threshold intensity, defined as the minimum level of magnetic stimulation intensity required to achieve an anal and rectal MEP response of 10 microvolts and an anterior tibialis MEP of 20 microvolts with 50% of trials.The intensity for TNT at each site is capped at a maximum of 150% above this threshold to comply with safety guidelines. Thus, intensity of magnetic stimulations will be individualized. Bilateral lumbar stimulations (rTLMS) are administered at L2/L3 disc space, and sacral stimulations (rTSMS) at S2/S3 level. Next a 70 mm double air film self-cooling coil is positioned randomly over one of the 4 sites, held in place by a coil fixator and 300 or 450 stimulations are delivered. After a 5 min rest the cycle is repeated (Total =600-900/site).The coil is moved to the opposite side and it is repeated.</description>
