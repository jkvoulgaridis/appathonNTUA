             metastases must be stable for a minimum of 6 weeks.

          -  Patients must have discontinued anti-seizure medications and steroids, except for

             star-fruit, and Seville oranges; Moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of major
             drug transporters; Substrates of CYP3A4/5 with a narrow therapeutic index

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active
             infection; transfusion dependent thrombocytopenia or anemia; psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization
             abnormality, including any of the following: symptomatic congestive heart failure;
             Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≤ 50%; unstable angina pectoris or cardiac
             arrhythmia; baseline QTcF (Fridericia) ≥ 450 milliseconds; Long QT syndrome or family
             history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome

          -  Any major surgery within 21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with SP-2577. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.
