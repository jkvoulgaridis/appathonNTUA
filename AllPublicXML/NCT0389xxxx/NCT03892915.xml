      This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the effects of
      task-shifted, evidence-based depression care vs. usual care on adherence to each step of the
      PMTCT care cascade at 8 ANC clinics in Uganda. At 4 experimental sites, task-shifted,
      depression care will include (1) depression screening and psychoeducation, (2) depression
      diagnosis, and (3) provision of evidence-based problem solving therapy (PST), or
      antidepressant therapy (ADT) for those with severe and refractory depression (or who decline
      PST), to be implemented by trained peer mothers and midwife nurses, respectively. The 4
      control sites will use usual care services for managing depression, which consist of
      referrals to a mental health specialist and access to the Family Support Group program
      (comprehensive, monthly multi-session psychosocial program to enhance pregnancy management
      and PMTCT adherence). At each site, 50 HIV-positive newly pregnant women (total n=400) who
      screen positive for potential depression will be enrolled and followed until 18-months
      post-delivery to assess how depression and depression alleviation relate to primary
      (adherence to each component of the PMTCT care continuum, maternal virologic suppression) and
      secondary (infant HIV status; post-natal maternal and child health outcomes) outcomes, as
      well as processes of depression care (treatment uptake and depression alleviation among
      clinically depressed patients). A cost-effectiveness analysis will be used to compare the two
      study arms.

    <description>We will use a stepped care approach to depression treatment. Participants with clinical depression (defined as PHQ-9&gt;9) will be offered either Problem Solving Therapy (PST) or Antidepressant Therapy (ADT), but those with moderate to moderately severe depression will be recommended PST, while those with severe depression will be recommended ADT. Participants with subthreshold depressive symptoms (PHQ-9: 5-9) will receive depression psychoeducation and continued depressive monitoring.</description>
