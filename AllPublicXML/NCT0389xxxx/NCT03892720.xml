  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy with HyperArc
      software technology works in treating patients with head and neck cancer that has come back.
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver
      radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses
      over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate local control and toxicity of patients who receive escalated dose stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) reirradiation with HyperArc for recurrent head and neck cancer
      (rHNC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical benefit of HyperArc through the analysis of overall survival
      (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and locoregional progression-free survival (LPFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate dosimetric data including dose to target and organs at risk (OAR).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo treatment planning with both standard radiation treatment software and
      HyperArc software technology. The most optimal plan will be delivered to a total dose of 55
      Gy in 5 fractions, given 2-3 times weekly.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 1 year.
