      Primary Objective: To assess whether usual care plus auricular acupressure with beads reduces
      subject-reported maximum pain during first trimester vacuum aspiration compared to usual care
      plus placebo.

      Secondary Objective: To assess whether usual care plus auricular acupuncture with Pyonex™
      needles reduces subject-reported maximum pain during first trimester vacuum aspiration as
      compared to usual care plus placebo. This assessment will replicate the previous trial and
      strengthen the evidence that auricular acupuncture is beneficial for aspiration abortion pain

      Exploratory Objective: To assess whether usual care plus either auricular acupressure with
      beads or auricular acupuncture with Pyonex™ needles reduces subject-reported anxiety scores
      during first trimester vacuum aspiration as compared to women receiving usual care plus
      placebo.

    <textblock>
      Most first trimester aspiration abortions are performed in the outpatient setting with a
      paracervical block and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as the only analgesics.
      Yet first trimester aspiration pain control is often inadequate with 26-32% of women
      reporting that they experienced severe pain. Moderate sedation and general anesthesia are not
      readily available, and investigations on opioids and anxiolytics have consistently found them
      ineffective for first trimester aspiration abortion pain. In 2018, The National Academies of
      Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) recommended research to improve pain relief.
      Limited data indicate that acupuncture is valuable in dysmenorrhea and for labor pain,
      conditions in which pain may be similar to that experienced during aspiration abortion.

      This randomized trial will recruit women seeking first trimester aspiration abortion. This
      study will evaluate two types of auriculotherapy applied to selected acupoints on the
      external ear. The study treatments are acupressure using gold beads and acupuncture using
      Pyonex needles; both are applied to the ear using adhesive disks. A control group will
      receive the adhesive disks alone. All participants will receive usual care for their
      aspiration abortion procedure, including a paracervical block and ibuprofen for pain
      management. The investigators will query the participants regarding pain and anxiety
      immediately after their procedure, in person, on the day of their procedure.

    <intervention_model_description>This 3-arm randomized trial will assign participants 1:1:1 to receive either of two active treatments (acupressure or acupuncture) or placebo (inert adhesive disks applied to ears).</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Supportive Care</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>A designated investigator (auriculotherapy provider) will apply the intervention prior to the aspiration abortion; thus the care provider (abortion provider) will not be aware of the treatment arm.
Participant will wear a surgical hat that covers their ears and the adhesive disks appear similar for the treatments and the placebo arm; thus the participants will be unaware of their treatment assignment.
The research assistant collecting the outcomes data will not know which treatment arm the participant belongs to.
Finally, treatment assignment will be coded in the study database until analysis is complete, so that the investigator will be unaware of the treatment assignment until analysis is complete and then un-blinding will occur.</masking_description>
