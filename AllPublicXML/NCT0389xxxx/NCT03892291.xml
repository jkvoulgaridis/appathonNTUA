  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate objective dual-task turning measures for use as
      rehabilitative outcomes and as tools for return-to-duty assessments in individuals with mild
      traumatic brain injury (mTBI).This project consists of three goals examining the I)
      Diagnostic Accuracy, II) Predictive Capacity, and III) Responsiveness to Intervention of dual
      task turning measures in individuals with mTBI.

      The investigators hypothesize that objective measures of dual-task turning will have high
      diagnostic accuracy, predictive capacity, and responsiveness to intervention in people with
      mTBI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to expand the investigators' prior preliminary work on
      wearable sensors to evaluate objective dual-task turning measures for use as rehabilitative
      outcomes and as tools for objective return-to-duty assessments following mild traumatic brain
      injury (mTBI). The investigators will assess the diagnostic accuracy, predictive capacity,
      and responsiveness to intervention of measures obtained from clinically feasible, dual-task
      turning tasks in an effort to evaluate the utility of turning measures for clinical
      return-to-duty decisions.

      This study is divided into two phases. For phase one, participants will be recruited from the
      general populations surrounding four sites (Oregon Health &amp; Science University, the
      University of Utah, Courage Kenny Research Center, and Fort Sam Houston), including active
      duty service members at Fort Sam Houston. For phase two, participants will be recruited from
      active duty service members referred to military medical treatment facilities (Warrior
      Recovery Center, Madigan Army Medical Center) for vestibular rehabilitation following mTBI.

      Phase One: Fifty civilian individuals with mTBI, 50 healthy control individuals, and 40
      healthy control active duty service members will be recruited for phase one. Participants
      will complete a battery of clinical, neuropsychological, and balance tests, including three
      clinically feasible turning tasks while wearing inertial sensors. The investigators will
      evaluate the capability of objective, dual-task turning measures to discriminate between
      healthy controls and people with chronic mTBI, determine clinically relevant measures of
      dual-task turning based on clinometric properties (e.g., minimum detectable change), and
      determine whether active-duty SMs perform dual-task turning tasks differently than civilians,
      assess the capacity of dual-task turning measures to predict performance in a
      civilian-relevant task, and assess the capacity of dual-task turning measures to predict
      performance in a military-relevant task.

      Phase Two: Forty active-duty service members with mTBI referred to vestibular rehabilitation
      at the Warrior Recovery Center or Madigan Army Medical Center will be recruited for phase
      two. Participants will complete a selected turning task from phase one at the beginning and
      end of the treatment. The investigators will determine the clinically important difference of
      turning outcomes and compare the effect of rehabilitation to the minimum detectable change
      for each outcome.

    <description>Participants will asked to follow a series of written directions that involves walking in uncontrolled pedestrian environments. Subjects will be given a walking route through written instructions and landmark-based directions to follow. The walking route will require participants to ambulate around public areas and will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. Participants will be required to navigate through crowded hallways, ascend and descend stairs, and scan for pedestrians and/or other obstacles. The total time to complete the task will be recorded</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a simulated patrol task within a small room partitioned into two areas. Each area will contain several targets illuminated with LED lights and containing infrared (IR) sensing diodes. Participants will be instructed to enter the room, and tag all red LEDs by pointing a laser at the IR receiver located next to the LED. Participants will use a trigger-activated laser (i.e., laser gun) to tag targets. Upon being tagged with the laser, the white LEDs surrounding the target will activate to indicate the target has been cleared. The total time to complete the task will be recorded. Following the task, participants will also be asked to recount the number targets in each room.</description>

        Across all sites, Phase One will include 50 civilians with persistent symptoms from mTBI,
        50 civilian healthy controls, and 40 active duty SM healthy controls in total. Three
        non-military sites will test civilians. A fourth military site (FSH) will enroll and test
        40 healthy active duty SMs across a range of military experience and ability levels.

        Subjects for Phase Two will include 40 active duty SMs with persistent symptoms from mTBI
        who are referred for physical therapy due to their symptoms. Participants will be recruited
        from two military medical centers specializing in the rehabilitation of active duty
        personnel after mTBI, WRC at Fort Carson and MAMC at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Each site
        will recruit 20 participants for Aim III.
