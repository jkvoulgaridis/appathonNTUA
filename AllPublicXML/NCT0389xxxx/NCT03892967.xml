      The Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) pragmatic clinical trial will
      test the population-level implementation of validated approaches to detect and effectively
      manage sleep disturbance, pain, anxiety, depression, energy deficit/fatigue, and functional
      decline among patients with all types and stages of cancer using a cluster-randomized,
      stepped wedge design.

      The Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) Pragmatic Clinical Trial tests
      whether systematically assessing patient reported outcomes for sleep disturbance, pain,
      anxiety, depression, and fatigue among patients with solid and liquid malignancies and using
      these data to increase the frequency of guideline-concordant care by: 1) reporting these data
      to their clinical teams, 2) providing patients with needs-matched symptom self-management
      education, and 3) suggesting evidence-based symptom management strategies to their care teams
      improves patients' quality of life, symptoms, and adherence to cancer treatment, while
      reducing their unplanned use of healthcare resources. This population-based trial uses a
      cluster-randomized, stepped wedge design to evaluate the full population of patients managed
      within Mayo Clinic Midwest medical oncology practices irrespective of cancer type or stage.

    <description>A guideline-informed intervention that combines low touch automated provision of symptom self-management education, coupled with EHR clinical decision support, for moderate symptoms with conventional, high-touch, collaborative care provided by a nurse-physician team for more intense symptoms. Additionally, the E2C2 intervention will increase the frequency of symptom and function screening. Prior to E2C2 intervention initiation, patients will only be assessed in association with a physician or allied health provider encounter. They will not be assessed when seen for nurse-only visits, or for systemic treatments. Following E2C2 intervention activation, they will be assessed every other week which will require remote, portal-based assessment for patients who lack clinic appointments.</description>
