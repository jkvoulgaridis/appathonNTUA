  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the synergistic effects of durvalumab and
      tremelimumab plus chemotherapy in advanced-stage ovarian cancer.

      Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic cancer. The current standard therapy is surgical
      cytoreduction followed by taxane-platinum combination chemotherapy. However, most patients
      with advanced-stage ovarian cancer will experience a relapse of disease. Therefore, there is
      an urgent need to improve outcomes of patients with this aggressive cancer.

      Research hypothesis: Adding durvalumab and tremelimumab to current neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      (front-line therapy) in advanced-stage ovarian cancer can increase response rate and improve
      patient's outcome such as progression-free survival and overall survival with minimal effects
      on safety.

             ±tremelimumab in combination with an agent with pro-arrhythmic potential or where
             effect of the combination on QT is not known if this criterion should be retained.
