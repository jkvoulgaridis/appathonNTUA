  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The
      increased prevalence of obesity worldwide is a major concern among the scientific and medical
      communities. Insulin resistance is a common factor associated with obesity, metabolic
      syndrome, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Individuals affected by these conditions often
      experience endothelial dysfunction as well. Insulin resistance provides a key link between
      metabolic syndrome risk factors and vascular disease. Development of strategies aimed at
      preventing vascular dysfunction and future disease caused by metabolic disturbances is
      needed. Although the relationship between obesity and various diseases is well known, the
      acute effects of insulin on vascular function in obese individuals have yet to be fully
      determined. Additionally, the effects of acute exercise on insulin-stimulated endothelial
      function are unknown. Exercise may be an effective and potent treatment that protects against
      endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and future cardiometabolic disease commonly
      present with obesity. However, less attention has been placed on vascular insulin
      sensitivity. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a single bout of
      exercise increases insulin-stimulated blood flow at the macro- and micro-vasculature level in
      obese individuals with metabolic syndrome to similar levels as healthy obese control. Our
      laboratory has available non-invasive methods to quantify vascular function and the
      gold-standard technique for assessing insulin sensitivity (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic
      clamp). The investigators will assess vascular function (flow-mediated dilation,
      post-ischemic flow velocity and contrast-enhanced ultrasound) as well as arterial stiffness
      (augmentation index and pulse wave velocity) before and at the end of the clamp protocol
      performed the morning following a bout of exercise and a control (no-exercise) condition in
      1) metabolic syndrome and 2) obese adults. If our hypothesis is sustained, it will suggest
      that a key role of the vasculature exists in regulating insulin following exercise and will
      provide insight into the link between the vasculature, obesity, metabolic syndrome and
      cardiovascular disease and may confer decreased risk for cardiometabolic disease.

    <description>An exercise condition, which will be walking at a moderate intensity (~70% VO2peak). Time will vary based upon individual fitness levels to burn ~400kcals (estimated 0.5 - 1hr). Oxygen consumption will be measured during exercise via a metabolic cart to confirm energy expenditure. Participants will then rest following the exercise procedure for 20 minutes. Between 20 and 45 minutes following exercise, oxygen consumption will be measured to understand and capture excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). Following this, participants will be provided with a standardize dinner and snack to consume in the AMP lab.</description>
