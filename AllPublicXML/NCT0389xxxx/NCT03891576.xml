    <intervention_model_description>This is a study built up by a randomized and a no-randomized part.
Randomized part:
Patients who either have a baseline body weight ≥58 and &lt;77kg, or have a baseline body weight ≥77kg and baseline platelet count &lt;150,000/µL (named as restricted population) will be randomly assigned to receive RADAR dosing or the SmPC dosing.
Randomization ratio will be 1:1 and will be based on a minimization procedure accounting for the following factors: i. platinum sensitivity; ii. use of bevacizumab in conjunction with the penultimate platinum based therapy; iii. best response (complete or partial) during the last platinum regimen.
No-randomized part:
Patients with weight &lt;58 or ≥77kg and baseline platelet count ≥150,000/µL will be enrolled into the study but not randomized.</intervention_model_description>
