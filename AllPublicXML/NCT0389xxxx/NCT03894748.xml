      This study design is multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, active
      controlled, phase 3 clinical trial(Including randomized, double-blind, parallel group, active
      controlled, preliminary study). Subjects who voluntarily signed the informed consent and are
      judged to be eligible for this study will be intramuscularly injected with the study drug or
      the comparator at a total of 20U(4U/0.1ml each)in five sites of the glabella line.
      Thereafter, follow-up visits will be made 4 weeks, 10weeks, 16weeks and efficacy and safety
      assessments will be conducted for total 16 weeks.
