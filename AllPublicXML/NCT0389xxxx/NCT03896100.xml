    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, prospective, bilateral, non-randomized study that will be split into
      four elements. Element 1 will be an in vitro non-clinical study and described in the
      laboratory protocol. Elements 2, 3 and 4 will each be a single non-dispensing visit.

               2. They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing and able to
                  sign a Statement of Informed Consent.

               3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

               4. They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of this
                  study.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from
             participating in the study:

               1. They have had cataract surgery.

               2. They have had corneal refractive surgery.

               3. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear
                  or have keratoconus.

               4. They are pregnant or breast-feeding.

               5. They have any infectious disease (e.g. hepatitis) or any immunosuppressive
                  disease (e.g. HIV) or a history or anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions.

               6. They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial
                  research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.

               7. They are currently regularly (once per day or more) using oral or inhaled
                  steroids or anti-inflammatory medications.

               8. They are using any topical medications such as eye drops or ointments.

               9. They are a current (i.e. within the last three months) contact lens wearer
                  (wearing a lens in one or both eyes).

              10. History of allergic reaction to sodium fluorescein or topical anesthetic.

              11. They have Grade 3 or greater of any of the following ocular surface signs:
                  corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining (white light
                  evaluation), tarsal conjunctival changes or any other abnormality which would
                  normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

              12. Any active ocular infection or inflammation.
