  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some cases, strabismus, or squint, is treated with injections of Botulinum toxin (BTX) to
      temporarily relax the eye muscle responsible for causing the eye to be pulled to one side.
      Due to the deep location of the muscles, electromyogram (EMG) needle guidance is used to help
      ensure the toxin is delivered accurately. EMG needle guidance involves listening to the EMG
      signal from the tip of the delivery needle - when the needle is in the right place a sound
      akin to &quot;rain on a tin roof&quot; is heard and the BTX can be injected.

      From previous research, clearly clinicians want to improve the technology of this procedure
      and increase the treatment efficacy and repeatability. After all, the current procedure is
      imprecise and subjective for what is a small target, with the eye muscles being around 2.5 mm
      to 4.7 mm in diameter. There may also be an increase in the likelihood of side effects such
      as droopy eyelids when the toxin spreads beyond the target muscle.

      There is a strong need for new knowledge to improve EMG needle guidance in this context. It
      is hypothesised that the EMG signal could be cleaned and mined for information in real time
      during the procedure, thus providing the clinician with better information to guide the
      positioning of the needle before injecting. This pilot study will deliver the knowledge
      essential to indicate the feasibility of doing this. If feasible, this study will inform a
      full study with the aim of benefitting patients by allowing new technology to be developed to
      improve the treatment of strabismus with BTX.

    <description>Clinician's score of the step change from baseline EMG to 'active' EMG level heard immediately prior to delivery of Botulinum toxin (BTX). A higher score represents a clearer step change, and is quantified as 1 to 5, where: 1 indicates no significant step change heard and 5 indicates a very clear step change heard.</description>

    <description>Clinician's score of their confidence in accurate needle placement with respect to the target muscle. Given as a percentage, a higher score indicates more confidence in accurate needle placement.</description>
