  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a telephone delivered
      behavioral change intervention for older Veterans with chronic low back pain (cLBP) and
      comorbid depression, and to ultimately assess its effect on cLBP-related pain, depressive
      symptoms, and disability.

      Investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess feasibility for
      older Veterans with cLBP and depression assigned to receive the behavioral interventions
      (n=25) versus waitlist control (n=25). For participants assigned to the intervention arm,
      trained health coaches will deliver the intervention via telephone. All participants,
      regardless of what group they have been assigned to will undergo several outcome assessments
      (pre-screening, baseline, mid-point, final assessments) conducted by a blinded research
      assistant. Subjects randomized to the waitlist control group will be offered the same
      intervention once the active intervention group has completed the active sessions and
      assessments.

      In this pilot RCT, investigators will assess the feasibility for older Veterans with cLBP and
      depression assigned to receive the behavioral intervention (n=25) versus the waitlist control
      (n=25). Follow-up will also include assessments at 6 months and 12 months post-intervention.

      Overview of Proposed intervention: The behavioral intervention is designed for older Veterans
      with cLBP and depression and will include 8 individual telephone sessions delivered by health
      coaches over a period of 10-20 weeks (up to 5 months total, accounting for additional time
      between sessions if needed). Exceptions may be made for highly motivated subjects who had
      unfortunate life circumstances arise.

      For the physical activity component of the intervention, investigators will provide an Omron
      pedometer to subjects, as previously used in VA research studies. The Omron pedometer will be
      set up by the research team (stride length, setting date/time) and will be mailed to the
      subject's home in between session 1 and 2. The health coach will remind the subject that this
      pedometer will arrive via United States Postal Service mail to their home and to call the
      research coordinator when it arrives. The research team will provide technical assistance and
      instructions to the subject regarding use of the Omron pedometer (to be worn on the waist
      band, daily, all day aside from showers/baths). The research team will also verbally show the
      subject how to press the mode and memory buttons to obtain weekly step counts for
      documentation/tracking physical activity. The subjects will be prompted by the health coach
      or research staff to report out weekly step counts during subsequent coaching sessions.

      In addition to the assessments outlined later in this protocol, specifically at 12 months,
      investigators will conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews with ~10-15 participants (8
      from both arms of the pilot trial, the health coaches, 2 primary care providers, and 1 mental
      health provider) using purposive sampling. The health coach/research coordinator will
      identify Veterans who are at higher risk for drop-out, were less engaged, or were
      particularly successful at achieving behavioral change. The purpose of this final interview
      is to learn about the barriers and facilitators to successful intervention delivery and
      participant retention from the Veteran, health coach, and provider perspective.

             you been hospitalized for an illness in the past 3 months that would make
             participating in a physical activity program challenging or unsafe? (Examples include:
             fall, gout attacks, stroke, heart attack, heart failure, or surgery for blocked
             arteries)
