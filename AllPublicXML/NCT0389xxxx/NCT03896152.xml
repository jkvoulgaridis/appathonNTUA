  <brief_summary>

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LNP023 in patients with PNH,
      showing signs of active hemolysis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LNP023 is a novel oral small molecular weight compound, that inhibits alternative complement
      pathway (AP). Blockade of the AP with oral LNP023 has the potential to prevent both intra -
      and extravascular hemolysis.

      This three-period study includes: a screening phase of up to 8 weeks, a baseline visit, Day 1
      (first day that the investigational drug is given), a 4-week treatment period of LNP023 at
      the first dose in the assigned sequence (Period 1), an 8-week treatment period at the second
      dose in the assigned sequence (Period 2), an approximately 2 year extension Period 3,
      followed by a taper down period of 2 weeks and end of study visit and a safety follow up call
      performed 30 days post end of treatment.

             over a maximum of 8 weeks prior to Day 1 (Screening, baseline or medical history data
             acceptable).

          5. Hemoglobin level &lt; 10.5 g/dL at Baseline.

         13. Systemic corticosteroids unless on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before
             randomization.

         14. Severe concurrent co-morbidities not amenable to active treatment; e.g., patients with
             severe kidney disease (CKD stage 4, dialysis), advanced cardiac disease (NYHA class
             IV), severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO class IV), or unstable thrombotic
             event, as judged by the investigator, both at screening and baseline (unless baseline
             was skipped).

         15. Any medical condition deemed likely to interfere with the patient's participation in
             the study, or likely to cause serious adverse events during the study.

         16. History of hypersensitivity to the study treatment or its excipients or to drugs of
             similar chemical classes.

         17. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to conceive during the
             course of the study.

         18. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 1 week after stopping of investigational drug -
