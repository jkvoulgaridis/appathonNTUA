  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of computer assisted cognitive rehabilitation and
      conventional cognitive rehabilitation methods on patients' attention, quality of life and
      functional independence. Recruiting from 15 patients from each group, patients will be
      followed up for a month and the outcome measures will be repeated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroop test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Stroop test is a quick measurement for ability of color perception and focusing attention Participants are asked to read 112 words with color within 2 min. Then, they are required to tell the color of these 112 words as color-word association. Finally, time of accomplishing task and number of correct read, corrections and errors are examined.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail making</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Trail making test is used to evaluate the attention and velocity. Participants are asked to sequentially connect 25 circles with number which was written in only one style (Line A), or to sequentially connect 25 circles with number which was written in two styles (Line B). The time used to complete the line A or B and the number of errors and fouls are recorded and analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>It is a test frequently used to assess depressive symptoms in chronic diseases. It is comprised of 21 items, 8 of which investigate the somatic symptoms of depression (such as loss of appetite and difficulty sleeping) and 13 of which address the cognitive-affective symptoms of depression (e.g., despair, social withdrawal). The BDI is scored as follows: 0-9: no symptoms; 10-16: mild depression; 17-29: moderate depression; and 30-63: severe depression</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36). This is one of the most widely used scales evaluating quality of life. The SF-36 explores eight dimensions of the quality of life &quot;physical function&quot;, &quot;physical role&quot;, &quot;bodily pain&quot;, &quot;general health&quot;, &quot;vitality&quot;, &quot;social function&quot;, &quot;emotional role&quot; and &quot;mental health&quot;. All scales were linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scoring, with 100 indicating most favorable health state and 0 indicating the least favorable health state</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The FIM is a generic and global activity scale that measures an individual's independence in conducting his or her daily fundamental physical and cognitive activities. The FIM measures 81 items in two areas:
1) physical/motor function (13 items) and 2) cognitive/ psychosocial function (5 items). The items are divided into six subgroups according to activities, four physical and two cognitive. Each item is scored on a scale of one to seven, with &quot;level 1&quot; indicating that the patient needs complete help and &quot;level 7&quot; indicating complete independence. The total FIM score varies between 18 and 126.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive their therapies 1 day a day, 2-3 days a week. The computer-aided cognitive rehabilitation group will perform simulation-based exercises, including exercises related to attention, in a special computer program (Cogniplus TR version) during therapy hours, and patients will progress to the difficulty level automatically. Their performance during this process (response time etc.) will be recorded.</description>
