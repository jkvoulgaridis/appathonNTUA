  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the main treatment method for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is chemotherapy. However,
      the effectiveness of drugs is moderate and there are several side effects. In this clinical
      trial, the investigators would like to activate the brain by the transcranial ultrasound
      stimulation (TUS). This is a feasibility study to evaluate the safety and initial
      effectiveness of TUS for the treatment of patients with mild AD.

      The purpose of this study is to verify the feasibility of low intensity transcranial
      ultrasound stimulation (TUS) for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a secondary
      aim, the investigators will explore whether the TUS is associated with improvement in
      cognitive functioning six and forty-six weeks following the intervention.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups which with or without
      the TUS administration.

      The investigators will study up to 20 subjects with mild AD. Initially, subjects will undergo
      a screening assessment with a study physician to determine medical and psychiatric history,
      establish AD diagnosis, and undergo a bold draw. Subjects that meet criteria and agree to
      participate in the study will undergo a follow-up visit. In the baseline measurement visit,
      participants will first undergo neuropsychological testing. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups. Participants will then be administrated TUS treatment for six
      weeks. Subsequently, participants will undergo a series of neuropsychological test. A final
      follow-up assessment will be administered at forty-six weeks.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 7, 12, 24, and 52 week</time_frame>
    <description>ADAS was designed to measure the severity of the most important symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its subscale ADAS-cog is the most popular cognitive testing instrument used in clinical trials of nootropics. It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention and other cognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. The test administrator adds up points for the errors in each task of the ADAS-Cog for a total score. Total scores range from 0-70. The greater the dysfunction, the greater the score.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 12 and 52 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating or CDR is a numeric scale used to quantify the severity of symptoms of dementia (i.e. its 'stage'). Using a structured-interview protocol, qualified health professional assesses a patient's cognitive and functional performance in six areas: memory, orientation, judgment &amp; problem solving, community affairs, home &amp; hobbies, and personal care. Scores in each of these are combined to obtain a composite score ranging from 0 through 3, with 0 meaning of no symptoms, 0.5 very mild dementia, 1 mild dementia, 2 moderate dementia and 3 severe dementia.</description>

    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 12 and 52 week</time_frame>
    <description>NPI-Q is a carer-based tool that assesses the possible presence of 12 symptoms in dementia cases, including delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviors, night-time behavioral disturbances and appetite/eating disturbances. The severity scale has scores ranging from 1 to 3 points (1=mild; 2=moderate; and 3=severe) and the scale for assessing caregiver distress has scores ranging from 0 to 5 points (0=no distress; 1=minimal distress; 2=mild distress; 3=moderate distress; 4=severe distress; and 5=extreme distress). The total scores of severity and caregiver stress are summed of each 12 items separately, with with higher scores indicating a greater number of neuropsychiatric symptoms or distress.</description>
