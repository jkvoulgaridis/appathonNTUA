    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the efficacy of VenaSeal™ Closure System (VCS) for the treatment of
      lower extremity superficial truncal veins in a real-world clinical setting, in a multi-racial
      Asian population in Singapore.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the ASVS study is to investigate the performance of cyanoacrylate glue closure
      (CAC) in a real-world post market evaluation setting in which multiple incompetent
      superficial saphenous truncal veins - namely (great saphenous vein (GSV), short saphenous
      vein (SSV), anterior accessory saphenous vein (AASV) - will be treated at the same setting,
      and compression stockings will not be used postoperatively. Unlike previous studies, the
      inclusion criteria for this study will be liberalized, and veins up to 12mm in diameter will
      be treated. As such, ASVS will be the first published prospective trial conducted in Asia on
      a predominantly Asian cohort of patients to report on the performance of CAC for incompetent
      GSV and non-GSV trunks. This study specifically focuses on the initial technical outcomes,
      safety, anatomical occlusion and patient experience with CAC applied with broader inclusion
      of patients than previous trials.

    <description>EQ5D is used to assess quality of life based on Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety, rated at 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to perform activity.

    <description>CIVIQ is a questionnaire based on three dimensions - pain, physical and psychological, based on a scale from 1 to 5 (no trouble, slight, moderate, considerable, severe). Based on inputs, Global Index Score (GIS) will be tabulated, ranging for 0 to 100 - the higher the value, the poorer the quality of life.</description>
