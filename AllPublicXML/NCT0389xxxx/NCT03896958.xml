  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PIONEER Initiative stands for Precision Insights On N-of-1 Ex vivo Effectiveness
      Research. The PIONEER Initiative is designed to provide access to functional precision
      medicine to any cancer patient with any tumor at any medical facility. Tumor tissue is saved
      at time of biopsy or surgery in multiple formats, including fresh and cryopreserved as a
      living biospecimen. SpeciCare assists with access to clinical records in order to provide
      information back to the patient and the patient's clinical care team. The biospecimen tumor
      tissue is stored in a bio-storage facility and can be shipped anywhere the patient and the
      clinical team require for further testing. Additionally, the cryopreservation of the
      biospecimen allows for decisions about testing to be made at a later date. It also
      facilitates participation in clinical trials. The ability to return research information from
      this repository back to the patient is the primary end point of the study. The secondary end
      point is the subjective assessment by the patient and his or her physician as to the
      potential benefit that this additional information provides over standard of care. Overall
      the goal of PIONEER is to enable best in class functional precision testing of a patient's
      tumor tissue to help guide optimal therapy (to date this type of analysis includes organoid
      drug screening approaches in addition to traditional genomic profiling).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PIONEER Initiative is a lead clinical trial designed to provide the foundation for
      subsequent adaptive trials. The mission with this and subsequent trial activity will be to
      demonstrate the utility of carrying out functional precision medicine in that cohort of
      patients who receive local cancer care at institutions that do not have significant research
      capabilities or are not NCI-designated cancer centers. As discussed above, the vast majority
      of cancer patients (~85%) are in this category. It is imperative to open up the possibility
      of best-in-class functional precision medicine testing to these patients. Core aspects of the
      PIONEER Initiative include recruiting a cadre of up to 200 patients, showing that proof of
      concept in a more limited set of patients can ultimately scale to arbitrarily large numbers
      of patients. It is anticipated that PIONEER will continue as the foundation for subsequent
      clinical trials into the indefinite future. This evolving trial structure fills an important
      unmet need within the broader cancer community since the primary mission is the return of
      actionable information in order to positively impact care.

      The underlying basic assumption of the PIONEER Initiative is that the ability to receive the
      best in cancer care should not be restricted as to location, age, or medical condition. The
      PIONEER Initiative design facilitates inclusion of subjects across all these divides, thus
      providing beneficence to all participants. A key aspect of the PIONEER Initiative is to
      provide patient benefit through a data and tissue biorepository to be utilized by researchers
      to discover new cancer diagnostics, treatment therapies and preventive strategies.
      Additionally, the data and samples will be used to improve existing treatments and to
      understand, at the molecular level, changes occurring during transition from illness to
      remission and/or relapse. SpeciCare, through the PIONEER Initiative, will store de-identified
      self-reported data, medical records, and biological samples from individuals who consent to
      participate in PIONEER. PIONEER will obtain further study and testing as appropriate and
      return results, through CLIA certified labs, through research vetted by CLIA testing, and, as
      enabled by current regulatory standards, through delivery of research results back to the
      patient and patient's clinical care team.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

        1. To provide patient access to additional information about his or her tumor, including
           functional precision cancer testing outside the patient's body, in order to provide
           potential access to clinical trials, decreased toxicities, better outcomes, improved
           overall care compared with the current standard, and potentially improved survival.

        2. To establish a data and tissue biorepository comprised of high quality biological
           specimens and associated clinical data that will support drug discovery, diagnostic
           assay development, oncology biomarker discovery, molecular biology, immuno-oncology
           therapies, translational medicine and other future discoveries as novel methods become
           available.

        3. To facilitate and accelerate oncology research by providing a pipeline of high quality
           specimens and associated clinical data for researchers to access.
