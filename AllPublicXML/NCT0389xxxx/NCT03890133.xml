  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic debilitating musculoskeletal pain syndrome. &quot;Central
      sensitization&quot; is an important mechanism of the disease. Recent studies have shown that
      &quot;microbiome-gut-brain axis&quot; imbalance may be one of the important mechanisms of &quot;central
      sensitization&quot;. The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of
      Ba-Duan-Jin therapy in the treatment of fibromyalgia by improving intestinal microecology.
      The mechanism was evaluated by comparing the results of brain functional MRI (fMRI) and
      microbacterial analysis of the patients' stool pre and post treatment .

    <description>The participants will be guided by a research staff to do the Ba-Duan-Jin therapy for 50 minutes twice weekly for 12 weeks, in the outpatient section of the hospital; Pregabalin placebo treatment will be administered at bedtime once a day, starting at 150 mg for the first week, and increase to the dose of 300 mg from the second week. After one week, if 300 mg dose is tolerable, then maintain it for 10 additional weeks, if not, then go back to the 150 mg dose for 10 additional weeks.</description>

    <description>Ba-Duan-Jin is a common form of &quot;self-healthcare&quot; Qigong exercise that has been practiced by Chinese people for at least eight hundred years.It consists of eight sets of simple movements. By combining meditation with slow, graceful movements,deep breathing, and relaxation, Ba-Duan-Jin practitioners believe it has the ability to move vital energy (Qi) throughout the body. Ba-Duan-Jin is also considered to be a multicomponent intervention that integrates physical, psychosocial, emotional, spiritual, and behavioral elements. While the biological mechanisms remain unclear.</description>
