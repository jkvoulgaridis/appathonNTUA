      Abstract

      Backgrounds and objectives:

      Dental treatments, especially in children who can not be cooperated, may require deep
      sedation due to intense anxiety and fear. During sedation oxygen is usually given to the
      patients by nasal cannula. Investigators want to use nasal mask for non-invasive mechanical
      ventilation for oxygenation of the patient during sedation for dental treatment and described
      it with nasal cannula.

      Methods:

      Seventy three children classified as ASA 1 or 2, aged between 3 to 17 will be included for
      this study. During deep sedation procedure group M will be applied nasal mask in order to
      noninvazive mechanical ventilation, group C will be applied nasal cannula connected to the
      oxygen flowmeter.

      Majority of dental treatments can be performed under local anesthesia. However, this is not
      always possible for pediatric non-cooperative patients with severe anxiety. In these cases,
      unpleasant dental experiences may lead to dental phobia when they become adults. For such
      patients requiring short-term dental procedures, sedation can best choice.

      In sedative procedures of patients it is necessary to delivery oxygen to the patient's
      respiratory system. This can achieved by means of nasal cannulas or interface masks like
      nasal mask which are connected to the oxygen flowmeter of the anesthesia machine.
      Investigators hypotezed that oxygen delivery via non-invazive machanic ventilation with nasal
      mask which is connected to the anesthesia-breathing circuit unit could be better than nasal
      cannula connected to the oxygen flowmeter of the anesthesia machine during deep sedation for
      dental treatment.
