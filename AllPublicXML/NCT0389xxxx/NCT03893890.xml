  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, rollover, long-term study to evaluate the safety and duration of efficacy
      of EN3835 in the treatment of women with EFP. Subjects who participated in and completed
      studies EN3835-201 and EN3835-202 and had composite improvement of at least 2 levels on both
      the CR-PCSS and PR-PCSS in study EN3835-201 will be eligible for this study.

               2. Have participated in and completed both studies EN3835-201 and EN3835-202 and had
                  composite improvement of at least 2 levels on both the CR-PCSS and PR-PCSS in
                  study EN3835-201.

               3. Be willing and able to comply with all protocol required visits and assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be ineligible for participation in this study if the subject:

               1. Has had retreatment with EN3835 in the area initially treated during the
                  EN3835-201 study since the completion of study EN3835-202.

               2. Has had liposuction on the body region treated during the EN3835-201 study since
                  the completion of that study.

               3. Has had any of the following in the area initially treated during the EN3835-201
                  study since the completion of that study.

                    1. Injections (eg, mesotherapy); radiofrequency device treatments; laser
