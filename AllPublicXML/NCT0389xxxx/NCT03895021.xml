  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no evidence-based fall prevention programs for Hispanic/Latinos even though their
      age-adjusted death rate from unintentional falls is climbing in the US. &quot;Pisando Fuerte&quot;, a
      linguistically and culturally appropriate version of an evidence-based fall prevention
      program for Spanish speakers (&quot;Stepping On&quot; [SO]) is evaluated. &quot;Pisando Fuerte&quot; consists of
      2-hour group sessions over the course of 8 weeks delivered in Spanish by trained
      Hispanic/Latino personnel in two communities in Wisconsin. Implementation and intervention
      fidelity were evaluated by an independent assessor on three sessions using a-priori criteria
      based on key elements of SO. Uptake, proximal and distal outcomes were assessed through
      interviews 6 months after the program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stepping On is an evidence-based falls prevention program for community-dwelling persons 65+.
      It uses principles of self-efficacy in 2-hour sessions held once a week for 7 weeks + one
      home visit to review principles learned in class and one booster class after 3 months.

      The program, developed and researched in Australia, was found to reduce falls by 30%. It was
      brought to the U.S. in 2006 by the Kenosha County Aging Division in collaboration with Dr.
      Jane Mahoney, U.W. Madison and other Wisconsin partners using foundation and state funding.
      Funding from the CDC provided the opportunity to adapt the program for widespread
      dissemination in the United States. In addition preliminary work was done on translating and
      culturally adapting Stepping On for the Latino community. The adapted program, known as
      Pisando, was offered as a pilot class at the United Community Center in Milwaukee in 2012.
      Further revisions were made to the program based on the experience at the pilot classes and
      advice from the advisory board, but questions remained about some key areas of workshop
      format.

    <description>To help test implementation; direct empirical evidence. Shortened Fall Behavioral Scale (FaB) scale, a 24-item validated tool that assesses the presence of protective behaviors for falls in older adults using a scale between 0 (not at all) and 4 (very much). High scores indicate the safest behaviors and low scores indicate risky behaviors. Total averaged scores range from 1-4.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity of Enactment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To help test implementation; proxy empirical evidence. This is an assessment of fidelity of participants' whom engaged in intermediary falls prevention behaviors after Pisando Fuerte ended (two time-points: at 1-week post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention), expressed as a percentage. Falls prevention behavior measures include: exercise adherence, elimination of at-home falls hazards, and adjustments to walking form and standing posture.</description>

    <measure>Fidelity of delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To help test implementation; direct empirical evidence. This is an assessment of fidelity of trained Pisando Fuerte leaders' delivery of the program's key elements (as determined in the original Stepping On program), expressed as a percentage for each component/element. Elements measured for fidelity of delivery include: Adult Learning, Program Aspects, Exercise Element, Upgrading Exercise, Background &amp; Training of Group Leader, Group Leader's Role, Elements of Peer Co-leader Role, and Cultural Adaption (specific to Pisando Fuerte, not included in Stepping On). The benchmark to be considered sufficient fidelity of delivery is 80%.</description>
