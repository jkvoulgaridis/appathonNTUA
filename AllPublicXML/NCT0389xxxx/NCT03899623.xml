    <textblock>
      This study is to build an multi-modal artificial intelligence ophthalmological imaging
      diagnostic system covering multi-level medical institutions. We are going to evaluate this
      system in an evidence-based medicine view, taking diabetic retinopathy as an example. And
      clinical diagnostic criteria will be made based on this multi-modal artificial intelligence
      imaging diagnostic system. The study is designed as a cross-sectional study involving 1,000
      normal individuals, 1,000 diabetes patients without ocular complications, and 1,000 with
      diabetic ocular complications. Statistical analysis of the diagnostic sensitivity and
      specificity of the artificial intelligence system will be made, and ROC curve wil be draw.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and ROC curve of the artificial intelligence（AI） system compared with reference standard (ophthalmologist).</measure>
    <time_frame>It will take 15~20min for each subject to take the exams.</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity: the percentage of diabetic retinopathy（DR） patients who are correctly identified as having the condition by AI. Sensitivity=True positive/(True positive+False negative). Specificity: the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the condition by AI. Specificity=True negative /(True negative +False positive). The ROC curve was plotted with true positive rate (sensitivity) as the ordinate and false positive rate (1-specificity) as the abscissa.</description>

          3. Diagnosis of gestational diabetes patients;

          4. Without systemic disease that may affect the retina except for diabetes;

          5. Meet the standards of 1 to 4 items.

        Group C(patients with diabetic ocular complications): meet with any of 1 to 3, and all 4 to
        6 items

          1. Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for more than 5 years;

          6. A group to meet the criteria for 1 to 4 items.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Refractive pathway is turbid, so that fundus image can not be clearly photographed;
