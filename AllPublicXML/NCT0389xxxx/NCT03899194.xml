  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive disorder is known as being accompanied with the activation of immune system which
      could lead to a series of changes including the neuron apoptosis, synapses transmission
      inhibition and emotional symptoms. The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) can reverse the
      immune/inflammatory process and restore the neuroplasticity and neurotransmitters
      transmission. Based on our finding that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) showed
      a significantly lower gene expression of PRKCB1, while the PKC activation mediated by PRKCB1,
      we hypothesize that PRKCB1 contribute to the development of MDD and treatment response by its
      specific expression in brain, regulating ERBB, Chemokine signaling pathways and PKC
      activation during the neuroinflammatory process. In the present study, we aim to evaluate and
      verify the regulation effect of PRKCB1 on the neuroimmune and inflammatory mechanism in
      depressive disorder by a serious of studies focus on PRKCB1 gene expression modulating
      process and different downstream biomarkers which associated with PRKCB1 effect, combined
      with the specified treatment (plus omega-3 poly unsaturated fat acids). This study may
      provide scientific evidences for using neuroinflammatory biomarkers to diagnose MDD, as well
      as personalized treatment.

      (1）To find out the differences of expression of mRNA, lncRNA, miRNA and proteins of PRKCB1
      between patients with depressive disorder and healthy subjects.

      (2) Patients with depressive disorders will be randomized into two groups that they will be
      treated with escitalopram or escitalopram plus Omega-3 PUFAs. To observe the effects of
      Omega-3 PUFAs on PRKCB1 and related neuroimmune/neuroinflammatory pathway which may improve
      understanding the relationship between neuroinflammatory regulation and depressive disorder
      treatment.
