  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, deep neuromuscular blockade during general anesthesia has been studied by many
      authors regarding various effects upon patients' outcomes and surgical conditions. We believe
      deep neuromuscular blockade can be especially beneficial in laparoscopic surgery, because it
      can expand surgical space and prevent patients' minute movements that can disturb precise
      operations. In clinical situations, anesthetists tend to compensate the insufficiency of
      neuromuscular blockade by increasing the dose of other anesthetic agents, which can prolong
      patients' recovery time and impair the surgical condition. In this study, we plan to divide
      the patients into 2 groups according to the depth of neuromuscular blockade, and compare the
      dose of anesthetic agent used to maintain surgical condition.

    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery are going to be recruited and
      divided into 2 groups: Group D will receive deep neuromuscular blockade, and Group M will
      receive moderate neuromuscular blockade using continuous infusion of rocuronium.
      Acceleromyography(TOF-watch SX) will be used to monitor the depth of blockade. In both
      groups, the anesthesia will be maintained with TIVA(total intra-venous anesthesia) including
      continuous target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. During the surgery, the
      number of patient movement and restoration of self respiration will be recorded. At the end
      of anesthesia, the dose of propofol and remifentanil used will be assessed and compared
      between the groups. Also, the satisfaction score of surgeons regarding the surgical
      condition, the anesthesia time, the operation time will be documented. After the patients are
      discharged, their charts are going to be reviewed and whether any pulmonary or surgical
      complications occurred will be documented.
