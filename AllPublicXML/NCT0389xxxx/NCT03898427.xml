  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wrist-worn accelerometers and associated data analysis platforms will provide quantitative
      and qualitative knowledge regarding the action of scratching and sleep quantity in a
      symptomatic Atopic Dermatitis (AD) population. The overall research aim is to evaluate the
      sensitivity of digital devices to capture drug-induced (standard of care treatments; SOC)
      quantitative changes in nighttime scratch and sleep quantity in AD subjects. In the current
      study, the investigators aim to evaluate the ability of wrist-worn accelerometers to detect
      significant and clinically meaningful changes in scratch behavior and sleep quantity in
      patients with symptomatic AD aged 2 to 75 years, receiving topical SOC treatment for AD. To
      evaluate this experimental paradigm, using wearable accelerometers, traditional
      patient-reported outcome measures/observer-reported outcome (ObsRO) (PRO/ObsRO), thermal
      videography and physician assessments of AD will be assessed in a well-controlled
      observational methodology study that has both an in-patient and out-patient portions within
      the study.

      This open label study is to evaluate the ability of a wrist-worn accelerometry device to
      detect scratch and sleep quantity changes in patients with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) receiving
      Standard of Care (SOC) treatment. Subjects, age 2 to 75 years, with symptomatic AD will be
      recruited.

      The study will be comprised of an initial screening/baseline clinic visit when subject will
      be diagnosed with symptomatic AD, screened and enrolled in the study after signing an
      informed consent (or parents/guardians and assent when appropriate). The subject will start
      or modify a SOC treatment course at the physician's discretion, and thereafter will be
      followed up for a total of 2 weeks for the purposes of the study. During those 2 weeks, the
      subject will wear two wrist worn accelerometry devices. The subject will also have to
      complete daily PRO/ObsRO related to itch, sleeping habits, quality of life, and device
      comfort questionnaires (parent/guardian will complete as appropriate) and may also
      participate in an optional daily photography taken of a single lesion (optional and for adult
      subjects only 18-75 years of age). The subject will also be asked to come and stay overnight
      at the sleep clinic for an overnight between Days 1-3, for thermal video recording overnight.
      An optional additional night (immediately following the first clinic overnight; between days
      2-4) with video and polysomnography (PSG) may occur (subjects must be 18-75 years of age to
      participate in this aspect of the study). The subjects will be asked to return to the clinic
      on days 8 and 15 for clinician-based assessments. At the completion of the study, Day 15 (+3
      day) the subjects will return the devices, and will complete PRO/ObsRO questionnaires.

    <time_frame>From enrollment through the end of visit 5 (15 days +/- 3 days).</time_frame>
    <description>One GENEActiv watch will be used on each hand at a sampling rate of 100 Hz to measure movement in the x, y, and z direction. The movement will be analyzed using the algorithm described by Cole et al. to differentiate between periods of wakefulness and sleep following SOC treatments.</description>

    <description>Polysomnography (PSG) will be used to report the number of sleep occurrences and appropriate sleep staging following SOC treatments based on the scoring guide provided by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). The following sleep stages will be scored: Stage W (wakefulness), Stage N1 (NREM 1), Stage N2 (NREM 2), Stage N3 (NREM 3), Stage N (NREM), and Stage R (REM).</description>
