  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid technological advances in the last 20 years have led to the exponential adoption of
      simulation-based learning in nursing education.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Simulation-based learning is designed to engage, challenge and enrich the learner's knowledge
      base and skill set. It presents the opportunity to experience a variety of clinical
      scenarios, both common and uncommon, in a safe environment allowing repeated skills training
      and facilitating the transfer of classroom-knowledge to real situations.Research demonstrates
      that simulation can improve student engagement and learning and is being increasingly used as
      an educational strategy for nursing students. This prospective randomized controlled study
      that was undertaken with the following goals:

        1. to investigate the effectiveness of simulation-based training in a large sample of
           perioperative nurses, measured as nurses' learning progress in the simulation
           environment;

        2. to determine whether the learning acquired through this training is transferable to
           recognizing real surgical instruments; and

        3. to evaluate whether simulation-based learning is retained at least one week.

    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Time saved is defined as the duration in seconds from the time the participant correctly submits an instrument prior to the maximum allotted time. Change is measured over repeated sessions on Day 1 and Day 7.</description>

    <measure>Change in number of errors for simulation task</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 7</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total score for simulation task</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Total score is a gamification-based algorithm dependent upon the number of correct responses in the first attempt and time saved. Change is measured over repeated sessions on Day 1 and Day 7.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in total score for knowledge transfer task</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Score is defined as the number of correctly identified instruments from the instrument tray during the instrument recognition task. The difference in score is measured between arms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in time for knowledge transfer task</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Time is the number of seconds (to a maximum of 45) taken to complete the real instrument task. The difference in score is measured between arms.</description>
