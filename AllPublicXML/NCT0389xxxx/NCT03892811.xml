  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of nipple flow rate on swallowing
      function in infants less than 3 months corrected age (up to 11 weeks and 6 days) who have
      been referred for videofluoroscopic swallow study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Feeding difficulties are common in infants born premature and with medical complexity,
      particularly those with congenital heart disease. One of the most common strategies for
      managing feeding difficulties is changing the milk flow rate of the bottle nipple. Milk flow
      is the rate at which milk transfers from the bottle to the infant's mouth. During swallowing,
      the vocal folds must close to prevent aspiration of fluid into the airway. When milk flow is
      fast, the infant must swallow frequently to clear the bolus of fluid and prevent aspiration;
      this is done at the expense of respiration. When the milk flow rate is slowed, the infant can
      swallow less frequently, allowing better integration of respiration, and has more time to
      coordinate an effective swallow. While there is some very limited evidence that slower milk
      flow rate improves feeding in infants born premature and with congenital heart disease, the
      underlying mechanisms for improvement of feeding remain unknown. This project will be the
      first to evaluate the effect of milk flow rate on swallowing function under fluoroscopy to
      better understanding how swallowing changes under different conditions of flow in young
      infants. This research will provide the evidence needed to support the use of this simple
      intervention (i.e., changing the flow rate) in infants at risk for feeding difficulty and
      swallowing dysfunction.
