      To compare skin closure via subcuticular suture versus tissue adhesive (Dermabond) in
      urogynecological robotic surgeries. The primary outcome is incision cosmesis at the 12 week
      follow up visit. Secondary outcome is the operative time between the two methods of closure.

      The purpose of this study is compare skin closure via suture versus tissue adhesive
      (Dermabond) in urogynecological robotic surgeries. The primary outcome is incision cosmesis.
      Therefore, if the tissue adhesive is cosmetically comparable to that of sutures, that will be
      reason to use tissue adhesives over traditional sutures. In these surgeries, there are five
      to six port sites (compared to fewer for usual laparoscopic procedures) and the procedures
      are lengthy procedures (average duration about 300 minutes as per recent AUGS/ACOG committee
      opinion), so if the investigators can show significant time reduction for closure, that
      should reduce operative time and costs. To the investigators' knowledge, this will be the
      first study of its kind to make this comparison for urogynecologic robotic procedures.

    <description>Our primary outcome measure is to compare incision cosmesis between the two closure methods at the 12 week postoperative visit. The Stony Brook Scar Evaluation scale is used. A point is awarded in each of the following categories: width, height, color, hatch/suture marks, overall appearance. Poorer cosmesis is indicated by a lower score. Highest score possible is 5 points.</description>

    <description>For the tissue adhesive, we will use Dermabond, which was FDA approved for skin closure in 1998. We will record the length of time of each closure method for comparison, and have patients follow-up at two, six and 12 weeks. At the 12 week visit we will score the appearance of the incision.</description>

    <description>For the suture arm we will only close the subcuticular layer. We will record the length of time of each closure method for comparison, and have patients follow-up at two, six and 12 weeks. At the 12 week visit we will score the appearance of the incision.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women, ages 18 years and older, undergoing any urogynecologic robotic procedure at St.
             John Hospital and Medical Center from March 19, 2018 - November 30, 2018.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We will exclude women with active skin infections as they may contribute to poor wound
             healing and infections. We will also exclude procedures that are converted to
             laparotomy.
