  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of spinal neoplasms as radical resections
      are often limited anatomically. Frequently, a surgical stabilization with implants is
      required. However, metallic implants not only make the CT-based planning of a subsequent
      radiation therapy more difficult, but might also have an uncontrolled dose modulating effect
      in adjuvant radiotherapy. At the spine, radiation is limited by the effective dose posed to
      the relatively radiosensitive spinal cord. While metallic implants might result in an
      inhomogeneous and uncontrollable dose distribution due to the interface effect, the use of
      new radiolucent implants consisting of carbon/polyether ether ketone (PEEK) might allow a
      more homogeneous and predictable dose distribution. This study aims to evaluate the potential
      benefits of the use of carbon/PEEK pedicle screws during adjuvant radiation therapy and
      follow-up imaging of spinal tumors.

      60 patients will randomized 1:1 into either treatment arm (Pedicle System Carbon/PEEK vs.
      Pedicle System Titanium). The feasibility of planning the radiation therapy will be
      evaluated. The postoperatively administered total radiation dose is documented. The
      radiological visualization of the area of interest will be evaluated The surgical outcome is
      evaluated by fusion rate, implant integrity and anchorage. Patients will be followed up for
      12 months according to local standards.
