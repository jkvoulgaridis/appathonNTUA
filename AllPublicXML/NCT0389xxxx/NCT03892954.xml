  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroRNAs were shown to play an important role in regulating pain-processing in a wide range
      of experimental models and clinical pain disorders. Thus, the aim of the present study is to
      evaluate a set of Micro-RNAs as diagnostic biomarkers of pain intensity in adolescents with
      chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and to correlate with inflammatory markers and pain related
      comorbidities.

      The present study was performed to evaluate a set of Micro-RNAs as diagnostic biomarkers of
      pain intensity in adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and to correlate with
      inflammatory markers and pain related comorbidities. Thus, a total of 150 adolescents aged
      (12-18 years) were invited to participate in this study. They are classified into two groups;
      adolescents with CFS (n=100) and healthy control (n=50). RT-PCR and immunoassay analysis were
      used to estimate miRNAs (miR-558, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-124, and miR-143) and
      immune-inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2) respectively.

    <description>A pre-validated modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was performed to measure pain scores among both subjects with CFS and healthy controls.The BPI includes four ratings of pain intensity (items 3-7), and seven other ratings on the impact of pain. Intensity is recorded on numerical scales from zero (no pain) to ten (pain as bad as you can imagine). Also, intensity is rated at the time of completing the questionnaires (pain now) as well as its worst, least, and average over the past day or week. The BPI also records the location of the pain on a diagram of a human figure. Patients are also asked to select words that best describe their pain and to indicate the extent and duration of pain relief obtained from analgesics.</description>

        A total of 150 adolescents aged (12-18 years) were invited to participate in this study.
        Based on CFS diagnosis, participants were classified with CFS (n=100) and healthy controls
        (n=50). adolescents who had constant or persisting fatigue lasting 3 months with the severe
        functional disability to such extent that prevents normal school attendance and also had no
        drug prescriptions (including hormone contraceptives), any medical or psychiatric disorder
        that might explain the fatigue were included in this study.
