  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 3-arm randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare the effectiveness of a new
      enhanced Child Friendly Space service package with the basic Child Friendly Space service
      implementation, and to a waitlist control condition, within the West Nile refugee response in
      Uganda.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Child Friendly Space (CFS) is an acute phase humanitarian intervention designed to provide
      children with a safe, supportive, and stable environment early after the onset of crisis that
      will promote their social and emotional well-being, as well strengthen the existing systems
      of protection required to support children in reaching developmental milestones. Typically,
      CFSs house a range of structured and unstructured activities led by trained animators in a
      community-designated safe area.

      The basic service package offers a mixture of recreational and non-formal education
      activities over a twelve-week period. Each session lasts around 1.5 - 3 hours. Structured
      activities offered include basic literacy and numeracy lessons, life skills exercises, health
      and hygiene sessions, and traditional song and dance. Many activities are centered around
      various forms of play that enable expression and age-appropriate skill development.
      Unstructured free play and playground time is allocated throughout the daily session.

      The enhanced service package provides 40 sequential sessions selected by CFS program staff in
      advance and implemented over a twelve-week period. Activities are meant to build upon and
      reinforce one another and are organized into seven psychosocial themes: 1) Building
      community: &quot;Our space together&quot;, 2) Emotional learning: &quot;My feelings&quot;, 3) Wellbeing and
      coping: &quot;Feeling good&quot;, 4) Social support: &quot;My friends and family&quot;, 5) Relating to others:
      &quot;Being a good friend&quot;, 6) Protection and boundaries: &quot;My safety&quot;, and 7) Building on
      strengths: &quot;All my supports&quot;. Each session takes approximately 1.5 - 2 hours to facilitate
      and will conclude with 1-1.5 hours unstructured free play time.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-28)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 hour from the start of a session</time_frame>
    <description>A 28-item caregiver (for children aged 6-8 years) or child-reported (for children aged 9-14 years) measure that explores the resources that may bolster the resilience of children. Each item of the child self-report has response options rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 5 (A Lot). Higher scores are indicative of increased presence of resilience processes. Each item of the caregiver-reported measure has three response options - 1 (No), 2(Sometimes), and 3 (Yes). Higher scores are indicative of increased presence of resilience processes of the child (better outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) Part 1</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 hour from the start of a session</time_frame>
    <description>A two-part 27-item measure of psychological distress that maps to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Part one features 20 PTSD symptom items rated on a 5-point scale of frequency and severity from 0 (not at all) to 4 (6 or more times a week). Scores on part one range from 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater psychological distress (more symptoms) and lower scores indicating a better outcome. This will be administered to children aged 9 to 14 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) Part 2</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 hour from the start of a session</time_frame>
    <description>A two-part 27-item measure of psychological distress that maps to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Part two features 7 dichotomous functionality items from 0 (no) to 1 (yes). Scores on part two range from 0 to 7, with higher scores indicating greater daily functional impairment. This will be administered to children aged 9 to 14 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Hope Scale (CHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 hour from the start of a session</time_frame>
    <description>A 6-item measure of children's perception of agency and pathways thinking towards goals. The CHS measures goal-oriented thinking using six youth-appropriate items. Each item has response options rated on a six-point Likert-type scale ranging from one (None of the Time) to six (All of the Time). Higher scores are indicative of more positive goal-oriented thinking (greater hopefulness). This will be administered to children aged 9 to 14 years. Caregivers of children aged 6 to 8 years will be asked to answer on behalf of their child.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Revised Impact of Events Scale (CRIES-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 hour from the start of a session</time_frame>
    <description>A 8-item screening measure of intrusive and avoidant cognitions related to PTSD and is frequently used in evaluating stress reactions after traumatic experiences. Response options are rated on a 4-point scale from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Often). Scores range from 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating PTSD symptoms consistent with intrusion and avoidance of the child and lower scores indicating lesser PTSD symptoms (better outcome). This will be administered to caregivers of children aged 6 to 8 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (S-MFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 hour from the start of a session</time_frame>
    <description>A 13-item screening measure for depression. Each item is rated on a 3-point Likert scale with response options of 0 (Not True), 1(Sometimes True), and 2 (True). Scores range from 0 to 26, with lower scores indicating the child is likely not suffering from depression (better outcome). This will be administered to caregivers of children aged 6 to 8 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emergency Developmental Assets Profile (EMDAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 hour from the start of a session</time_frame>
    <description>A 13-item measure of developmental assets essential for children to thrive into adulthood. Each item is answered on a four-point scale from 0 (Not at All/Rarely) to 3 (Extremely/Almost Always). Scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating the child has more developmental assets (better outcome). This will be administered to children aged 9 to 14 years.</description>
