      20 minute Whole Blood Clotting Test(20'WBCT) recommended by World Health Organisation
      guidelines is probably the most routinely employed bed side screening tool in the country.

      The Modified Lee and White (MLW) method gives a value which when performed serially gives a
      trend in clotting time which the investigators hypothesise to be a better tool in serially
      assessing the victim compared to the 20'WBCT.

      The investigators propose that delayed reading of both MLW and 20'WBCT to check for clot
      stability at 30 minutes also provides added information in management of snake bite victims.

      Envenomation by snakes is common in India. Hematotoxic bites cause the highest morbidity and
      mortality in Kerala, a state in the south of India.

      20 minute Whole Blood Clotting Test(20'WBCT) recommended by World Health Organisation
      guidelines is probably the most routinely employed bed side screening tool in the country. It
      is the tool of choice due to its cost effectiveness in low and middle income countries
      (LMIC).

      The reliability of 20'WBCT is questionable with respect to not just its rapidity but also its
      reliability. There is no standardisation for the test and procedure.

      Modified Lee White (MLW) Method for coagulation is a cheap bed side test used as part of the
      standard treatment protocol of snake bite victims. The MLW method gives a value which when
      performed serially gives a trend in clotting time which the investigators hypothesise to be a
      better tool in serially assessing the victim compared to the World Health Organisation
      recommended 20'WBCT.

      The investigators also propose that delayed reading of both MLW and 20'WBCT to check for clot
      stability also provides added information in management of snake bite victims.

      The bed side coagulation test done, forms the trigger to commence antivenom in snake bite
      victims with hematotoxicity in resource limited settings.

      Lee White (MLW) Method for coagulation is a test that has been employed for decades to assess
      coagulation in Jubilee Mission Hospital, Medical College and Research Institute in Thrissur
      for snake bite victims. It is a cheap bed side test used as part of the standard treatment
      protocol of snake bite victims. The MLW method gives a value which when performed serially
      gives a trend in clotting time which the investigators hypothesise to be a better tool in
      serially assessing the victim compared to the World Health Organisation recommended 20'WBCT.

      The investigators also propose that delayed reading of both MLW and 20'WBCT to check for clot
      stability or 'clot lysis' also provides added information in management of snake bite
      victims.

    <description>1ml of blood drawn from snake bite victims in clean glass test tubes of 1 cm diameter Kept undisturbed for a period of 20 minutes (measured by a stop watch). At the end of 20 minutes the tube is tilted to see if the blood has clotted or not.
If a well formed clot is not formed, the test is recorded as 'abnormal'.
If the clot seems well formed, it is further observed for a period of 30 minutes to look for dissolution of the formed clot and would be termed &quot;clot lysis&quot;. Clot lysis indicates an unstable clot.</description>

    <description>The blood collected in three additional test tubes would be utilised for MLW.
The three test tubes would be kept on a rack at ambient temperature.
The blood sample would be drawn in a 5cc syringe and 1 ml would be added in the three test tubes consecutively.
The test tube would be left undisturbed for 5 minutes, after that the first tube would be tilted approximately to check for clot formation every 30 seconds while the other tubes are left undisturbed.
After the blood in the first tube has clotted, the time would be noted and the second tube would be tilted every 30 seconds and examined.
Following its clotting, the third tube would be examined. The time at which the third tube is recorded as the CT value.
Once clotted, then the sample in the all three test tube would be assessed at 20 minute and 30 min to look for breakup or lysis of the clot.</description>
