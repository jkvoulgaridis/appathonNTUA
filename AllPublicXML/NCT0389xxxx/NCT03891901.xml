  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and effects of
      imatinib on myelopoiesis in adults when given with and without isoniazid and rifabutin. The
      results of this trial will determine the imatinib dose to be studied in a subsequent Phase
      IIB treatment trial of imatinib as an adjunctive therapy with an antimicrobial regimen
      (rifabutin, PZA, INH and ethambutol) for drug-sensitive TB.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and effects of imatinib on
      myelopoiesis in adults when given with and without isoniazid and rifabutin.

      Participants will be enrolled into one of two cohorts. In Cohort 1, participants will be
      enrolled in a dose-escalating fashion to receive one of four doses of imatinib alone for 14
      days, followed by imatinib in combination with rifabutin and isoniazid for another 14 days.

      In Cohort 2, participants will receive rifabutin and isoniazid for 14 days, followed by 14
      days of rifabutin and isoniazid in combination with one of the two selected doses of
      imatinib. The exact doses of imatinib administered in Cohort 2 will be determined after
      analyzing data from Cohort 1.

      Total study duration for participants will be 50 days, during which time participants will
      attend several study visits. Study visits may include a physical exam, electrocardiogram,
      blood and urine collection, and pharmacokinetic assessments.
