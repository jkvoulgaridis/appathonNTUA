    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug Crofelemer in the
      treatment of non-HIV patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea; to determine the prevalence
      of identifiable causes of chronic diarrhea in a non-HIV patients; to assess the diagnostic
      yield, in terms of identification of treatable etiologies, of commercially available
      diagnostic evaluations in adult, non-HIV patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea, that is,
      evaluate which tests, among the standard diagnostic tests commonly conducted as part of the
      evaluation of chronic idiopathic diarrhea, are most likely to identify a treatable cause of
      the diarrhea; and to analyze the relationship between chronic idiopathic diarrhea and
      health-related quality of life and assess the impact of crofelemer treatment on
      health-related quality of life.

    <description>The Bristol stool form scale is a validated 1-7 scale that correlates to stool form. Type 1 is pebble like stool, type 2 lumpy and hard, type 3 like a sausage with cracks on the surface type 4 like a sausage but smooth and soft, type 5 soft blobs with clear cut edges, type 6 fluffy pieces with ragged edges, mushy stool, type 7watery, no solid pieces Types 5-7 are consistent with diarrhea and for this study a movement to lower types is considered an improvement</description>

    <description>The Medical Outcomes Trust short form questionnaire with 36 questions, most often referred to as SF-36, is a measure of general health status relevant across age, disease and treatment groups, widely used and tested in a range of conditions and settings. The items in SF-36 are divided into eight different domains with overall physical and mental health component summary scores. Domains are physical functioning, role limitations physical, bodily pain, social functioning, general mental health, role limitations emotional, vitality and general health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic diarrhea (defined as 3 non-bloody loose stools per day or more
             than 20 non-bloody loose stools per week for more ≥ 4 weeks) and Bristol Stool Form
             Scale for stool consistency of 6/7 with &gt;50% stool without an obvious cause after
             evaluation for organic etiologies.

          -  Patients from any ethnicity

             of crofelemer has not been established in these age groups).

          -  Pregnant females (crofelemer is a Category C drug due to lack of well-controlled
             studies to study its effects in this population).

          -  Lactating females (it is unknown if crofelemer is excreted in the human milk and thus
             may have unknown adverse effects on the nursing infants).

          -  HIV positive individuals.

          -  Persons within ability to provide consent and understand the study

          -  Persons with history of alcohol abuse or binge drinking.

          -  Persons with history of surgical bowel resection or bariatric surgery in the past 12
             months.

          -  Persons who have undergone cholecystectomy (open or laparoscopic) in the past 3
             months.

          -  Persons receiving antibiotics currently or have received antimicrobials in the past 4
             weeks.

          -  Persons with end-organ failures including end-stage renal disease, end-stage liver
             disease, or severe heart failure.

          -  Persons with metastatic hematologic and oncologic malignancies.

          -  Persons receiving chemo-radiation or immune-modulators for oncologic or rheumatologic
             conditions.

          -  Persons with any other known organic gastrointestinal or non-gastrointestinal disease
             process in which diarrhea is a recognized clinical feature.

          -  Gluten free diet for previous 3 months and refusal to ingest gluten.
