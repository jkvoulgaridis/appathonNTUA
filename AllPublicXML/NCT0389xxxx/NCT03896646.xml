  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to improve hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor responses in patients
      undergoing Y90 radioembolization by using personalized dosimetry as part of treatment
      planning. Using standard calculations for Y90 doses may not be specific enough for individual
      patients given that there can be differences in how tumor cells and liver cells respond to
      radiation. Personalized dose plans may help improve treatment and outcomes in liver cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To achieve tumor objective response rates of 75% using voxel based dosimetry when the mean
      dose (Dmean) to tumor is targeted to be greater than 200 Gray (Gy).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate changes in liver function and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) incidence to the mean absorbed dose to normal liver.

      II. Prospectively validate the accuracy of our published tumor dose response prediction based
      on the yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (yttrium-90 [Y90]) tumor dose volume histograms
      (DVHs).

      III. Correlate predicted tumor doses macroaggregated albumin (MAA) scan with actual doses
      delivered (Y90 scan).

      IV. Develop a tumor dose response model prediction based on the MAA dose maps. V. Develop a
      model correlating normal liver radiation dose to liver function using single-photon emission
      computed tomography/computed tomography hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (SPECT/CT HIDA)
      imaging.

      VI. Develop a model correlating the relative tumor to normal liver enhancement on CT imaging
      and Cone beam CT imaging to the uptake on SPECT CT Tc99m MAA imaging (gold standard).

      VII. Compare tumor and normal liver doses estimations from SPECT CT Bremsstrahlung imaging to
      positron emission tomography (PET) CT imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization with yttrium Y 90 glass
      microspheres using personalized dose measurements. Patients also undergo SPECT/CT HIDA scan
      before radioembolization and 2-4 months after radioembolization.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.

    <description>Will analyze the correlation in changes in liver function to the mean absorbed dose to normal liver. The hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan will be used to estimate the body-surface area corrected mebrofenin clearance rate in %-activity/sec/m^2 using published methodology. The change in liver function after radioembolization will be calculated and correlated to the radiation dose distribution to the normal liver.
