  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In search of the best possible outcome for the severe hearing impaired who have regained the
      ability to hear by means of a cochlear implant (CI), electrical stimulation and the
      information it carries should match as closely as possible to what the human brain naturally
      has evolved to cope with and learned to process instead of relying on plasticity to adapt to
      an induced mismatch. At the moment, however, CI's are fitted with a 'one size fits all'
      principle. This is known to cause a mismatch between the frequencies presented by the CI
      electrode array and the frequencies represented at the corresponding natural acoustic
      location in an individual cochlea. In this study it is hypothesized that an individual imaged
      based fitting that pursues natural hearing alignment and is implemented from the start of the
      rehabilitation process, will improve the individual outcomes of electric hearing. The natural
      fitting strategy is thought to give rise to a steeper learning curve, result in a better
      performance in challenging listening situations, improve sound quality, complement better
      with residual acoustic hearing in the contralateral ear and win the preference of
      CI-recipients.

    <measure>Listening effort</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first 12 months of CI rehabilitation</time_frame>
    <description>In a listening effort test subjects are asked to rate the effort it takes to listen to speech fragments in noise.The listening effort test is based on subjective ratings for the ease or difficulty involved in listening to speech in the presence of varying amounts of noise. Speech and noise are presented from the same loudspeaker in front of the subject. Three relevant signal-to noise ratios will be tested repeatedly (5 times) and the mean effort level will be calculated. Rating is performed using a vertical scale with 13 discrete points (seven named categories interspersed with an empty category) ranging from no effort (Score 0) to extreme effort (Score 12).</description>

    <measure>Spectral resolution (SMRT test)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first 12 months of CI rehabilitation</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to spectrally resolve frequency information is known to be related to speech understanding performance (in noise). Frequency selectivity will be monitored to test the ability of the patient to filter out one stimulus from the others on the basis of frequency. This will be done with the Spectral-temporally Modulated Ripple Test (SMRT).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Loudness scaling (ACALOS test)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first 12 months of CI rehabilitation</time_frame>
    <description>To estimate the course of loudness percept between minimal audible level and maximum comfortable level, a procedure is used that automatically adjusts the presentation levels to the subject's individual auditory dynamic range without employing any pre-measurement. The procedure uses repeated measurements and presents levels in randomized order. It has been named &quot;ACALOS&quot; (Adaptive Categorical LOudness Scaling). Results will provide information about the difference in loudness percept between CI and HA and will give input for optimizing the fitting of these hearing devices across the dynamic range.</description>

    <time_frame>During the first 12 months of CI rehabilitation</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Speech-Spatial-Qualities (SSQ) questionnaire. A short form of the SSQ (SSQ-12) will be used. The SSQ is designed for use typically as a complement to behavioural or experimental measures of hearing ability and consists of questions on the following domains: speech hearing, spatial hearing, qualities of hearing, and listening effort. Participants will be asked to answer 12 questions on a 10-point Visual Analogue Scale with different units.</description>
