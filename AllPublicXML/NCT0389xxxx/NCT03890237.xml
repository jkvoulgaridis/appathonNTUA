    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of Act With Her Ethiopia (AWH-E), a gender transformative
      multi-level program that aims to improve the lives of young adolescent boys and girls.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unequal gender norms and power dynamics are often driven and reinforced by adolescent girls'
      male peers, families, communities, and the broader institutional structures that surround
      them. Without change in gender attitudes and norms at each of these levels, improved outcomes
      for key transitions are much less likely to be sustained. Efforts to nurture change must also
      acknowledge that adolescents' opportunities and capabilities are shaped by complex,
      intersectional forces including ethnicity, caste, religion, and disability, among others.
      This multi-arm randomized control trial aims to improve the evidence base on effective
      approaches to improve multi-sectoral outcomes for girls across the following domains from the
      Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence (GAGE) framework: education and learning; health,
      nutrition and sexual and reproductive health; bodily integrity; psychosocial well-being;
      voice and agency; and economic empowerment.

      Specifically, the trial has four goals:

        1. To evaluate the impact of Act With Her in Ethiopia (AWH-E) - a gender-transformative
           multi-level program - on young adolescent girls' and boys' capabilities (11-13) in the
           short- and long-run across the six GAGE capability domains using a multi-arm cluster
           randomized control trial across two regions (Amhara and Oromia).

        2. To compare the impact of AWH-E to a more basic gender-synchronized program (AWH-E
           without community engagement and systems strengthening), a standalone girls' group
           program (Her Spaces), and the gender-transformative program with economic support (AWH-E
           + Asset Transfers) on young adolescent capability achievements and transitions in the
           short- and longer- terms across two regions (Amhara and Oromia).

        3. To evaluate the impact of AWH-E on young adolescent capability achievements and
           transitions in the short- and long- term in pastoralist contexts (Afar).

        4. To use mixed-methods research to understand the mechanisms driving the impact, and in
           particular what works, for whom, and why.

    <intervention_model_description>The impact evaluation study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial among 175 communities with five study arms: control (no intervention), AWH-E, Her Spaces, AWH- E + asset transfer, and AWH-E without community engagement and systems strengthening.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>None (Open Label)</masking>
    <masking_description>Study participants will not be masked to their assignment, but will not know the full set of treatment and comparison groups, or what those other groups receive. Given cluster level randomization, contamination will be minimized. Enumerators who collect the survey data that forms the basis of the evaluation will not be explicitly told the treatment status of a given Kebele, however, given the community level nature of the intervention it may be possible for them to ascertain whether it is a treatment or control Kebele. Statistical analyses will be done by the investigators who will not be masked to the treatment status of the participants</masking_description>

    <description>Act With Her was designed to facilitate adolescent transitions to adulthood via improvements across the six GAGE domains (education, bodily integrity, health, psychosocial well-being, voice and agency, and economic empowerment). Project activities fall into three main categories: curriculum-based programming with adolescent girls and boys, community transformation, and systems strengthening. Act With Her will work with 10-13 year old girls and boys for 10 months and implement community-level and high-level system strengthening work up to 24 months (in rural and pastoralist areas).</description>

    <description>This arm will implement the Act With Her program described above, using program curricula with 10-13-year-old girls and boys over 10 months and conducting community-level systems strengthening up to 24 months. Additionally, the girls participating in this arm will receive one of three asset transfer options. The packages will be of equal value (115 USD) - one will include school supplies, one will include hygiene supplies, and will be a combination of both. Each adolescent girl will choose which package she would like to receive and will receive components of the package at 3 timepoints over the course of the first 10 months of the project.</description>

The adolescent groups will follow the same model (near-peer, same-sex mentors, 40 weekly meetings for girls, 18 meetings for boys, 4 of which are joint sessions for boys and girls, 6 sessions for parents), but will not include community-level systems strengthening activities</description>
