  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients are put under invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) during respiratory
      failure because they can no longer breathe in a way that delivers enough oxygen to their
      body. MV involves placing a tube into the wind pipe that is attached to a machine (known as a
      ventilator) which helps the patient breathe. However, MV is associated with complications
      such as shrinkage and damage of the diaphragm muscle fibres. It has been shown that the
      diaphragm (the main breathing muscle which provides approximately 70% of the work in healthy
      persons) can be affected after only 3-4 days of MV. Disconnection from the ventilator (a
      process known as extubation) is conducted with the calculated risk that the patient may
      become exhausted due to the additional workload of breathing off the ventilator resulting in
      needing to be reconnected to the ventilator (a process known as reintubation). Reintubation
      requires additional deep sedation of the patient and leads to longer time connected to the
      ventilator, increased risk of new lung infections, prolonged stay in the intensive care unit
      (ICU) and further immobilisation. Thus, the intensive care physician must constantly evaluate
      the need for MV to maintain adequate breathing versus withdrawal as quickly as possible to
      reduce the risk associated with long-term use of MV. However, to date, there is no technique
      for continuous assessment of diaphragm function that can be easily used at the patient's
      bedside. RESPINOR DXT, which offers continuous ultrasound monitoring of the right diaphragm
      velocity without the need of the continued presence of an operator, could offer an
      interesting solution.

      Aim: The primary objective of this study is to compare diaphragm excursion values obtained
      around a 30-minute SBT using RESPINOR DXT in patients who are successfully and unsuccessfully
      extubated. Data analysis will be performed using post-processing. The timepoints to be
      analysed will be:

        -  Pre-SBT: 10, 30 and 60 minutes before the start of the SBT

        -  During the 30-minute SBT: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20 and 30 minutes

        -  Post-SBT: 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 hours after the end of the
           30-minute SBT.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesise that there will be significantly different median
      diaphragm excursion between successful and failed extubation groups in at least one of the
      timepoints of interest. The information from this pilot study will be used to design a
      fully-powered observational study.
