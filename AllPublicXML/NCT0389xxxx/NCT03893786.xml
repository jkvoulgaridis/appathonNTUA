  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that robot-assisted therapy may be considered an effective and reliable
      method for the delivery of highly repetitive training useful to boost neuroplasticity. Thus,
      an early, intensive, repetitive and task oriented training could be an ideal strategy to
      facilitate relearning of motor function and to improve motor function. The ARMEO-S® is a
      specific upper limb electromedical device mainly used to reduce spasticity and improve muscle
      force. To date robotic upper limb training has been applied only in patiebts with brain
      injury and spinal cord lesions.

      Aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of ARMEO-S in improving upper limb agility in a
      sample of PD patients, as compared to traditional physiotherapy.

    <description>Fifteen patients with Parkinson's Disease will perform ten 45-minutes training sessions of the upper limb using the Armeo®Spring applied bilaterally, an electromedical device aimed at improving force and coordination in neurologically affected patients.
The device was built to sustain the forearm during the upper limb training and it is equipped with a VR screen with which the patient may interact during the playful and motivating rehab.</description>
