  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aimed to reveal the neural mechanism of social placebo belief formation and
      belief representation, and also investigated how the brain pattern predict the social
      behavior performance under placebo manipulation.

      Participants were randomly assigned to spray+ group (sprayed with saline but told as
      &quot;oxytocin&quot;) and control group (sprayed with saline but told as &quot;saline&quot;). After 10 min,
      participants were invited to the resting-state, text viewing task in fMRI scanner.

      In resting state session, participants with their eyes open and were instructed to attend to
      a black fixation cross centrally presented on a grey projection screen for 8 min (240TR).

      The Text viewing task employed a mixed block and even-related fMRI design. Participants were
      asked to judge whether they could understand the stimuli or not by a button press
      (1=understand; 2=not understand). Three kinds of stimuli were presented in separate block
      including &quot;oxytocin-function&quot;, &quot;oxytocin-knowledge&quot;, &quot;robot&quot; related stimuli, each category
      contained 20 sentences. In each block, the sentence (within one category) was presented
      pseudo-randomized from 5s to 9s (with mean duration of 7s), then followed by a jittered time
      interval (interval time = sentence duration - response time; if participants made response
      within 5s, the sentence would not disappear until its duration reached 5s). There were two
      sessions with six blocks per session, and there were 5 sentences (trials) per block. The
      order of blocks and sentences were designed to present in pseudo-random order and were
      applied to all participants.

    <description>For functional connectivity estimation, we adopted DLPFC, mPFC and reward related brain regions as the seeds to do whole-brain connectivity analysis. And the conducted two-sample T test to examine whether there would be some differences between spray+ and control groups.</description>

    <description>In spray+ condition, participants learned oxytocin materials on a self-paced basis and then intranasally administered with saline (but it was told as &quot;oxytocin&quot;). Participants were instructed to refrain from smoking or drinking (except water) for 2 h before the experiment. The spray was administered to each participant three times, and each administration consisted of one inhalation into each nostril. Participants took a rest (they were told it was a time period waiting for treatment to produce effects) for 10min and then performed the experimental tasks.</description>
