  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Running is effective in increasing levels of physical activity and promotes a number of
      beneficial health effects. However, running can lead to running- related injuries (RRI). In
      theory, such injuries can be avoided with the implementation of prevention programs. But in
      practice, there is a paucity of prevention programs that are effective in reducing the risk
      of RRIs. In a previous study, the investigators developed an RRI prevention program using the
      Intervention Mapping framework. The RRI prevention program was named RunIn3. The present
      study will evaluate the effectiveness of the RunIn3 RRI prevention program.

      Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of an RRI prevention program (i.e., RunIn3).

      There will be recruited 530 runners of the state of São Paulo aged 18 years or older. After
      inclusion, participants will be randomly assigned and allocated in two groups: (1)
      intervention group, which will be the target of the implementation of the RunIn3 prevention
      program; and (2) control group, which will receive a minimal intervention (i.e., feedback
      based on surveillance).

    <measure>Behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The preventive behaviours towards running-related injuries (RRI) adopted or modified will be collected using an online questionnaire that will be composed of questions with 7-point Likert scales (-3 to +3).</description>

    <measure>Costs</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The cost data will be collected through a questionnaire composed of open-ended and multiple choice questions regarding direct costs (medical and non-medical costs) and indirect costs (work absenteeism) regarding participants' health related to running practice.</description>

    <description>The intervention will be delivered online. Every two weeks we will send a link to participants that will direct them to an online questionnaire. The online questionnaire will collect information on complaints and symptoms related to running, and the volume, intensity and frequency of running practice within the 2-week period. If the participant reports any symptom and if she/he accepts a suggestion regarding running training, an algorithm embedded in the online system will automatically suggest a training volume for the next two weeks based on the distance and/or duration reported by the participant.
Through a website we will make available informative texts, videos and infographics in order to increase the participant's knowledge regarding topics such as: musculoskeletal symptoms; foot strike patterns; training workload; running shoes; warming-up/cooling-down, stretching; and concomitant strength training.</description>
