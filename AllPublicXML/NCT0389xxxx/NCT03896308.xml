  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is distinguished from healthy aging by cognitive difficulties
      that are greater than expected for one's age and education. Amnestic mild cognitive
      impairment (aMCI) is a major sub-type of MCI with noticeable impairments in memory.
      Approximately 12% of aMCI will progress to AD per year. There are two test to evaluate the
      effects on memory, but both without Chinese version. This study is to know the test-retest
      reliability of the Chinese version of the Verbal learning test and Selective reminding test
      among people with mild cognitive impairment.

        Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is distinguished from healthy aging by cognitive
        difficulties that are greater than expected for one's age and education. Amnestic mild
        cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a major sub-type of MCI with noticeable impairments in
        memory. Approximately 12% of aMCI will progress to AD per year. Guidelines for MCI
        recommended: controlling vascular risk factors and focusing on behavioral interventions.
