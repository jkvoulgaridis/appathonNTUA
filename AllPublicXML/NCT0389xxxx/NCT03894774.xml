      Evaluation of longitudinal treatment effects applying an intensive psychotherapeutic
      intervention for inpatients (age of participants: 6-13 years) with a multi-method-approach to
      address the complex nature of severe childhood trauma. (Chronic Post-Traumatic Stress
      Disorder)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe adversity and trauma in early childhood have been associated with a highly increased
      risk for a variety of psychiatric disorders, lasting into adulthood. This increased risk is
      accompanied by a set of biological changes ranging from changes in cortical thickness to
      endocrinological changes. At a behavioral level, children with complex PTSD (developmental
      trauma disorder) show severe and long-lasting negative effects. Such children exhibit a wide
      range of symptoms: affect dysregulation, attention difficulties, impairment in interpersonal
      relationships, aggressive and dissociative behaviour, disturbances of cognition.
      Corresponding alterations in neural networking and brain development are well studied.
      Although evidence-based treatment approaches for children with non-complex PTSD exist,
      complex-traumatized children have no well-evaluated treatments. Furthermore, early
      intervention can prevent the chronification and exacerbation of symptoms and promote social
      adaptation and participation.The following topics will be addressed: (1) brain development
      (Multimodal MRI (mMRI) including anatomical (T1-MPRAGE, T2-FLAIR, DTI-Diffusion Tensor
      Imaging) and functional MRI measurements (resting-state functional MRI, task fMRI (presenting
      affective pictures according to the International Affective Picture System, IAPS), EEG); (2)
      alterations in neuroendocrinological systems involved in stress regulation (Cortisol,
      Oxytocin, Vasopressin); (3) behavioral symptoms; (4) cognitive functioning; (5) attachment
      representations of children and their primary caregivers;

    <intervention_model_description>The study was conducted in the following randomized waiting control design:
After being included in the study at time T0 the children stay in Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) for at least three months and are then randomly assigned to the Intensive Inpatient Psychotherapy Treatment Group (IG) or the Waiting Control Group (WCG) after this TAU time period (This period is considered necessary and sufficient in order to reliably estimate possible trends of changes in the brain). The children in the WCG stay in TAU and are assigned to the IG as soon as a treatment place is available. The waiting period will be included in the analysis as a confounder. The third group is a Healthy Control Group (HCG) of matched pairs (matched for gender, age and handedness).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Structural MRI (T1w, T2w, DTI)</measure>
    <time_frame>longitudinal (4 measurements, t0: at least 3 month before treatment, t1: at admission to treatment, t2: at discharge (average of 8 month), t3: 6 month post treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>All structural images will be acquired in a 3 Tesla MR system using a 20- channel head-coil (Siemens, Erlangen). Data post-processing will be performed with lab-internal scripts developed for a multi-core cluster. For structural analyses of T1w, T2w and DTI data, freesurfer,FSL and workbench will be used. T1w and T2w data will be volumetrically analyzed and the results will be reported in mm3. DTI data will be processed using tbss-FSL and probtrackX-FSL. DTI will be quantified in regard of the number of white matter fiber bundles within regions-of-interest (ROIs) and from-ROI-to-ROI. The Dosenbach atlas (Dosenbach et al. 2010) and the multimodal Brainetome atlas (Fan et al. 2016) will be used for all structural analyses. It is an explorative study that follows a whole-brain approach. Changes in emotion-processing and trauma-associated brain regions such as the hippocampus,the amygdala,the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula are assumed</description>

    <description>EPI-sequence: fMRI will be carried out at 3 Tesla (Siemens) scanner using a 20- channel head-coil. For functional imaging, an EPI sequence with the following parameters will be used: repetition time (TR),2000 ms; echo time (TE),30 ms; flip angle (FA), 80°; spatial resolution, 3 × 3 × 3 mm3; imaging matrix, 64 × 64; field-of-view (FoV), 192 × 192 mm2; number of slices: 36; number of volumes: 200. Data post-processing will be performed with lab-internal scripts developed for a multicore cluster. For rsfcMRI analyses of freesurfer,FSL,AFNI and workbench will be used. rsfcMRI will be quantified as number of significant activated voxels (spatial extent) and connectivity strength (z-scores).Networks of interest (ICA-based): Salience network, Default Mode Network. Regions of interest (seed-based): hippocampus, the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula.In addition, a RS-EEG with 19 scalp electrodes is used to complement rsfcMRI,which is cortically evaluated using Brainstorm.</description>

    <time_frame>longitudinal (4 measurements, t0: at least 3 month before treatment, t1: at admission to treatment, t2: at discharge (average of 8 month), t3: 6 month post treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>For the task-based fMRI the same EPI sequence will be used as for the resting state (see outcome 2). The number of volumes: 180. Three different sets of each 45 (15 neutral, 15 negative, 15 positive rated pictures) pictures were created and randomly displayed during the scanning procedure and also afterward to control for personal affective valence and arousal with Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM).
Data post-processing will be performed with FSL-FEAT using a block-design. Regions of interest follow the previous structural and rsfcMRI analyses ROIs: hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and the insula.</description>
