  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      TV-46000. The primary safety and tolerability endpoint is the frequency of all adverse
      events, including serious adverse events. For new patients, the total duration of patient
      participation in the study is planned to be up to 80 weeks (including a screening period of
      up to 4 weeks, a 12-week oral conversion/stabilization stage [Stage 1], a 56-week
      double-blind maintenance stage [Stage 2], and a follow-up period [8 weeks]). For roll-over
      patients, the total duration of patient participation in the study is planned to be up to 64
      weeks (including up to 56 weeks in the maintenance stage [Stage 2] and a follow-up period [8
      weeks]). Patients who started Stage 2 who relapse or meet 1 or more of the withdrawal
      criteria should be invited to perform the Early Termination visit as soon as possible within
      4 weeks of the last injection. Patients who withdraw from the study before completing the
      56-week maintenance stage will have follow-up procedures and assessments performed at their
      follow-up visits. During the follow-up period, patients will be treated according to the
      investigator's judgment.

      All subjects will be treated with active drug.

        Patients Rolling Over from the Pivotal Efficacy Study TV46000-CNS-30072:

          -  The patient must have participated in the pivotal efficacy study (Study
             TV46000-CNS-30072) without experiencing relapse events and without important protocol
             deviations.

          -  If the patient was taking antidepressants or mood stabilizers in Study
             TV46000-CNS-30072, no dose changes or initiation of treatment with these medications
             will be permitted.

          -  The patient, in the investigator's judgment, requires chronic treatment with an
             antipsychotic medication.

          -  The patient is able to understand the nature of the study and follow protocol
             requirements, including the prescribed dosage regimens (oral and sc administration)
             and non-use of prohibited concomitant medications; can read and understand the written
             word in order to complete patient-reported outcomes measures; and can be reliably
             rated on assessment scales.

          -  The patient has had a stable place of residence for the previous 3 months before the
             baseline visit in this study, and changes in residence are not anticipated over the
             course of study participation.

          -  The patient has no significant life events (such as pending loss of housing, family
             status change, long travel abroad, surgery, etc) that could affect study outcomes
             expected throughout the period of study participation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and sexually active female adolescents must agree not
             to try to become pregnant, and, unless they have exclusively same-sex partners, must
             agree to use a highly effective method of contraception and agree to continue use of
             this method beginning 1 month before the first administration of study drug and for
             the duration of the study and for 120 days after the last injection of study drug.

          -  The patient, if adult or adolescent male, is surgically sterile, or, if capable of

             approved method of birth control and agrees to the continued use of this method for
             the duration of the study (and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug). Male
             patients with sex partners who are women of childbearing potential must use condoms
