      This is a prospective, single arm, early feasibility study designed to evaluate the safety
      and device performance of The RenalGuard System in the management of patients admitted with
      signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure who require diuresis for the treatment of
      volume overload.

      This is a prospective, single arm, early feasibility study designed to evaluate the safety
      and device performance of The RenalGuard System in the management of patients admitted with
      signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure who require diuresis for the treatment of
      volume overload. Subjects will be referred by their physician if he/she feels that the
      subject could benefit from observed diuresis in a hospital setting.

      The device being utilized is called The RenalGuard® System (The System). By default, The
      System infuses a volume of hydration fluid equal to the volume of urine output. This is known
      as matched hydration. In addition, the clinician has the ability to adjust the matched
      setting such that RenalGuard can infuse hydration fluid to achieve a positive fluid balance
      (e.g. +100 ml/hr.) or a negative fluid balance (e.g. -100 ml/hr.). The purpose of this
      balanced fluid replacement is to prevent hypovolemia that may lead to hypotension and vital
      organ dysfunction, or fluid overload that may lead to shortness of breath in subjects in whom
      high urine output is desired.

      All patients will be treated with The RenalGuard System for a minimum of 24-hours, and
      possibly longer, at the investigators discretion. They will be followed for 30 days post
      discharge. The protocol will enroll up to 40 subjects to develop the clinical algorithm
      required to optimally and safely perform removal of volume. The study will be conducted in up
      to 5 sites in Europe.

             consent

          2. Subject is diagnosed and hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure. ADHF is
             defined as including all of the following measured at any time between presentation
             and the end of screening:

               -  persistent dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion at screening and at the time
                  of enrollment, despite standard background therapy for acute heart failure
                  including intravenous furosemide,

               -  Rales by chest auscultation

               -  Edema ≥ +1 on a 0-3+ scale, indicating indentation of skin with mild digital
                  pressure that requires 10 or more seconds to resolve in any dependent area
                  including extremities or sacral region.

               -  pulmonary congestion on chest radiograph

               -  systolic BP ≥100 mmHg at the start and at the end of screening

          3. Subject with pre-existing chronic renal failure (impaired renal function) defined as
             an eGFR between presentation and enrollment of ≥ 25 and &lt;90 mL/min/1.73m2, calculated
             using the MDRD equation.

          4. Subject has agreed to all follow-up testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known inability to have a Foley catheter placed.

          2. Total urine output &lt; 200 ml or average urine rate &lt; 50 ml/hour in the Diuretic
             Challenge.

          3. Patient is managed on, or there is a plan to manage on, renal replacement therapy
             (RRT) such as ultrafiltration, hemofiltration or dialysis.

          4. Dyspnea due to non-cardiac causes, such as acute or chronic respiratory disorders or
             infections (i.e., severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis,
             pneumonia), which may interfere with the ability to interpret the primary cause of
             dyspnea.

          5. Patients with blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg at the time of enrollment or persistent heart
             rate &gt; 130 bpm.

             antimicrobial treatment.

          7. Clinical evidence of acute coronary syndrome currently or within 30 days prior to
             enrollment. (Note: the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome is a clinical diagnosis
             and that the sole presence of elevated troponin concentrations is not sufficient for a
             diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, given that troponin concentrations may be
             significantly increased in the setting of AHF).

          8. AHF due to significant arrhythmias, which include any of the following: sustained
             ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation/flutter with sustained ventricular
             response of &gt;130 beats per minute; or bradycardia with sustained ventricular rate &lt;45
             beats per minute without the use of a pacemaker

          9. Patients with hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dl, or a history of blood transfusion within the 14 days
             prior to screening, or active life-threatening GI bleeding.

         10. Known hepatic impairment (as evidenced by total bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dL, or increased
             ammonia levels, if performed) or history of cirrhosis with evidence of portal
             hypertension such as varices.

         11. Significant, uncorrected, left ventricular outflow obstruction, such as obstructive
             hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or severe aortic stenosis (i.e., aortic valve area &lt;1.0
             cm2 or mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg on prior or current echocardiogram) or severe mitral
             stenosis.

         12. Severe aortic insufficiency or severe mitral regurgitation for which surgical or
             percutaneous intervention is indicated.

         13. Documented, prior to or at the time of enrollment, restrictive amyloid myocardiopathy,
             OR acute myocarditis or hypertrophic obstructive, restrictive, or constrictive
             cardiomyopathy (does NOT include restrictive mitral filling patterns seen on Doppler
             echocardiographic assessments of diastolic function).

         14. Current (within 2 hours prior to enrollment) or planned (through the completion of
             study drug infusion) treatment with any IV vasoactive therapies, including
             vasodilators (including nesiritide), positive inotropic agents and vasopressors, or
             mechanical suport (endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation; intra-aortic
             balloon pump or any ventricular assist device; hemofiltration, ultrafiltration or
             dialysis), with the exception of IV furosemide (or equivalent diuretic), or IV
             nitrates at a dose of ≤ 0.1 mg/kg/hour if the patient has a systolic BP &gt;150 mmHg at
             the start of screening.

         15. Any major solid organ transplant recipient or planned/ anticipated organ transplant
             within 1 year.

         16. Major surgery, including implantable devices (e.g. ICD, CRT), or major neurologic
             event including cerebrovascular events, within 30 days prior to screening.

         17. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past year with a current life
             expectancy less than 1 year due to the malignancy.

         18. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.

         19. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception

         20. Use of any investigational drugs within 30 days prior to screening.

         21. Inability to follow instructions or comply with follow-up procedures.

         22. Any other medical condition(s) that may put the patient at risk or influence study
             results in the investigator's opinion, or that the investigator deems unsuitable for
             the study, including drug or alcohol abuse or psychiatric, behavioral or cognitive
             disorders, sufficient to interfere with the patient's ability to understand and comply
             with the protocol instructions or follow-up procedures.
