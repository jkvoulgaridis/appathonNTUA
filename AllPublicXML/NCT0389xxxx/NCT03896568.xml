      This phase I trial studies best dose and side effects of oncolytic adenovirus DNX-2401 in
      treating patients with high-grade glioma that has come back (recurrent). Oncolytic adenovirus
      DNX-2401 is made from the common cold virus that has been changed in the laboratory to make
      it less likely to cause an infection (such as a cold). The virus is also changed to target
      brain cancer cells and attack them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of allogeneic bone marrow-derived human
      mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) loaded with the oncolytic adenovirus DNX-2401
      (BM-hMSCs-DNX2401) administered by intra-arterial injection (i.e., transfemoral
      super-selective endovascular intracranial injection) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      (GBM), gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.

      II. To determine the local and systemic toxicity of allogeneic BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 administered
      by intra-arterial injection (i.e., transfemoral super-selective endovascular intracranial
      injection) in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic
      astrocytoma.

      III. To determine at the molecular and cellular level the capacity of allogeneic
      BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 administered intra-arterially to home to and deliver DNX-2401 to recurrent
      GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma by analyzing post-treatment
      surgical brain tumor specimens for the expression and distribution of adenoviral proteins.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess shedding of adenovirus into the blood, sputum, and nasopharynx after
      intra-arterial administration of BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma
      or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.

      II. To assess the development of anti-adenovirus antibodies after intra-arterial
      administration of BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type
      IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.

      III. To evaluate immune-mediated cytokine responses after intra-arterial administration of
      BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic
      astrocytoma.

      IV. To assess anti-tumoral activity and to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS) after intra-arterial administration of BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients
      with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      PART I: Patients receive oncolytic adenovirus Ad5-DNX-2401 intra-arterially (IA) over 20-30
      minutes on day 0.

      PART II: Patients receive oncolytic adenovirus Ad5-DNX-2401 as in part I. After 2 weeks,
      patients undergo surgery, then receive oncolytic adenovirus Ad5-DNX-2401 IA over 20-30
      minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients in part I are followed up on days 1, 4, 7, and
      14 of month 1, months 1.5, 3, and 4.5, every 2 months up to month 26, month 30, then every 6
      months thereafter. Patients in part II will be followed up on the day after surgery, weeks 1,
      2 and 4, months 2, 2.5, 4, 5.5 and 7, every 2 months until month 19, every 4 months until
      month 32, then every 6 months thereafter.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to provide informed consent, undergo and comply with
             all study assessments and adhere to the protocol schedule

          -  Patients with recurrent malignant GBM or gliosarcoma will be eligible. Patients with
             recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma with wild-type IDH-1 gene will also be eligible if
             there is a significant enhancing mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because
             their prognosis/behavior is similar to GBM. A pathology report constitutes adequate
             documentation of histology for study inclusion. Subjects with an initial diagnosis of
             a lower grade glioma are eligible if a subsequent biopsy is determined to be GBM and
             there is a significant enhancing mass on MRI

          -  Patients must show unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by MRI
             scan after failing prior surgical resection, biopsy, chemotherapy or radiation. A
             baseline MRI must be performed within 24 days prior to registration. Biopsy is
             encouraged at the time of recurrence if it is unclear that there is recurrent tumor.
             However, biopsy is not required if the practicing physician thinks that there is
             adequate radiographic and clinical evidence for recurrence

          -  Patients must be able to undergo endovascular treatment based on Doppler studies
             showing internal carotid artery (ICA) that is less than 50% occluded

          -  For patients undergoing resection for biological endpoints, tumors must be surgically
             resectable at the time of baseline evaluation and craniotomy for tumor resection would
             be part of their standard medical care

          -  Tumors must be &gt; 1.0 cm in diameter with upper limit of 5 cm maximal diameter

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance score &gt;= 70

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 16 weeks

          -  Absolute granulocyte count &gt;= 1,500 prior to starting therapy

          -  Platelet count of &gt;= 75,000 prior to starting therapy

          -  Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamic oxaloacetic
             transaminase (SGOT) &lt; 2 times institutional normal ranges prior to starting therapy

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 2 times institutional normal ranges prior to starting therapy

          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 times institutional normal prior to starting therapy

          -  Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and thrombin time within
             institutional normal limits after correction of nutritional deficiencies that may
             contribute to prolonged PT/PTT

          -  Subjects who have received the following chemotherapies must have completed them
             within the following time periods prior to baseline/day 0 of hMSC-DNX2401 delivery
             with recovery from any drug-related toxic effects to grade 1, or less, severity: 4
             weeks from cytotoxic agents (3 weeks from procarbazine or temozolomide, 2 weeks from
             vincristine), 6 weeks from nitrosoureas (lomustine [CCNU], carmustine [BCNU]), 4 weeks
             from any investigational agent, 1 week from non-cytotoxic agents

          -  Patients must be 8 weeks from radiotherapy to minimize the potential for MRI changes
             related to radiation necrosis that might be misdiagnosed as progression of disease, or
             4 weeks if a new lesion, relative to the pre-radiation MRI, develops that is outside
             the primary radiation field (beyond 80% isodose line). However, if a biopsy is
             undertaken prior to these times and this biopsy documents histological evidence for
             recurrent disease, then patients will be eligible regardless of the time after
             radiation

          -  Patients must be willing to forego other cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic drug or radiation
             therapy against the tumor while enrolled in the study

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test documented
             within 7 days prior to study initiation

          -  Subjects and their partners must be willing to use effective birth control during the
             study and for up to 6 months following administration of hMSC-DNX2401. Birth control
             that is acceptable to use in this study:

               -  Using twice the normal protection of birth control (i.e., double-barrier) by
                  using a condom AND spermicidal jelly or foam, or a diaphragm AND spermicidal
                  jelly or foam. A spermicidal jelly or foam must be used in addition to a barrier
                  method (e.g., condom or diaphragm)

               -  Birth control pills (&quot;The Pill&quot;)

               -  NuvaRing

               -  Surgical sterilization (i.e., tubal ligation or hysterectomy for women or
                  vasectomy for men)

        Exclusion Criteria:
