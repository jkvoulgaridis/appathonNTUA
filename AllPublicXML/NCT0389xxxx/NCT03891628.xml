  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of the modified Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up
      Intervention, adapted for use with peripartum mothers receiving medication-assisted treatment
      for opioid use disorder. The investigators expect that mothers who receive the modified
      Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up Intervention will show more nurturing and sensitive
      parenting and more adaptive physiological regulation than parents who receive a control
      intervention. The investigators expect that infants whose mothers receive the modified
      Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up will show better outcomes in attachment, behavior, and
      physiological regulation compared to infants of parents who receive the control intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripartum mothers will be randomly assigned to receive the modified ABC intervention or the
      control intervention (modified DEF). Hypotheses relate to parent and child outcomes
      associated with the intervention.

      Hypothesis 1: Compared to mothers who receive the control intervention, mothers who receive
      the ABC intervention will show more nurturing and sensitive parenting, enhanced neural
      activity during parenting-relevant tasks, and more normative patterns of DNA methylation,
      autonomic nervous system activity, and cortisol production.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to infants of mothers who receive the control intervention, infants of
      mothers who receive the ABC intervention will show more organized and secure attachment
      patterns, better behavioral regulation during stressors, more advanced social-emotional
      development, and more normative patterns of DNA methylation, autonomic nervous system
      activity, and cortisol production.

      Hypothesis 3: Enhanced maternal sensitivity will mediate effects of the ABC intervention on
      improved infant outcomes.

    <description>Maternal sensitivity will be coded observationally from maternal interactions with an infant simulator pre-programmed to coo and then cry. Mothers will be coded for sensitivity, nurturance, intrusiveness, detachment, and positive regard, on 5 point scales from 1-Not at all characteristic to 5-Highly characteristic. Higher scores on sensitivity, nurturance, and positive regard represent more positive parenting, whereas higher scores on nurturance and detachment represent less positive parenting.</description>
