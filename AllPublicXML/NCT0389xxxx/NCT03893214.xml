  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, in the treatment of phobias, exposure therapy in virtual reality is becoming
      more and more popular as an alternative for in-vivo exposure. Effectiveness of virtual
      reality exposure therapy (VRET) is comparable to in-vivo exposure therapy, though several
      characteristics of the VRET have an impact on the outcome of the therapy (e.g., immersion
      into the virtual environment (VE), familiarity with the VE). Additionally, the use of VRET
      varies from multiple exposure sessions to single-session VRET. Single-session therapy has an
      economic advantage and in in-vivo, post therapy outcomes show good results. In virtual
      reality, the assessment of outcome post therapy and in follow-up of single-session therapies
      is still needed for an evaluation of this approach. As an outcome measure, behavioral
      assessments are especially relevant for effectiveness studies as in fear of heights it is
      closer to the individual's life to know how high they voluntarily go up a building than to
      have hypothetical self-report questionnaire results.

      Much research has been conducted on physiological correlates of the subjective experience of
      fear in exposure therapy as they are assumed to be a prerequisite for effective exposure
      treatment. Skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate can be used for objective manipulation
      checks of exposure therapy. SCL is found to increase during fearful situations independent of
      setting while heart rate only increases during in-vivo exposure. Contrary to heart rate,
      heart rate variability (HRV) is not thoroughly studied in VRET yet. HRV is associated with
      the adaptability of an organism to new environments and cognitive functioning. High Frequency
      HRV is found to be reduced in individuals with mental disorders, and positive and negative
      mood inductions lead to differential HRV responses overall.

      Respiration is a well-studied correlate of emotional experience and especially of the
      experience of fear and anxiety. In a series of experiments, it was found that sighing is
      tightly associated with relief in or after fearful or stressful situations and might become
      maladaptive when used disproportionally often. This study shows that respiration parameters
      have an impact on the handling of fearful situations in a reciprocal way. On the one hand,
      fear leads to an increased respiration rate and sigh rate while on the other hand, an altered
      sigh rate or respiration rate might have an impact on the experience of fear and be used as a
      defensive reaction to a fearful situation. As such, specific respiration patterns might act
      as emotion-driven behaviors (EDB). EDBs are responses to emotions that result in a short-term
      reduction of a negative state while in long-term support the maintenance of the phobia.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a single-session VRET for acrophobia
      with a multimethod outcome design. Familiarity of the setting will be high with the use of a
      well-known tower in this area. Immersion into the VE will be assessed with a presence
      questionnaire. For a manipulation check, physiological data will be assessed, i.e., SCL,
      heart rate and HRV. Primary outcome measure will be a behavioral approach test (BAT) as
      behavioral assessment. Additionally, after four weeks, a follow-up assessment will
      investigate the stability of the effectiveness of the VRET in comparison to a waitlist
      control group. A second aim of this study is to investigate the impact of respiration as an
      EDB on the effectiveness of an exposure therapy. Therefore, the association between
      respiration and outcome of the VRET will be analyzed.

      Hypothesis 1: Participants in the VRET condition show less height avoidance in the BAT after
      the intervention than participants in the control condition.

      Hypothesis 2: Participants in the VRET condition show less height avoidance in the BAT in a
      four-week follow-up assessment than participants in the control condition.

      Hypothesis 3: Participants in the VRET condition score significantly lower on the Acrophobia
      Questionnaire at follow-up than participants in the control condition.

      Hypothesis 4: During the VRET, breath holding is used as EDB. Participants that hold their
      breath, profit less from the VRET than participants that do not hold their breath.

      Hypothesis 5: During the VRET, sighing is used as EDB. Participants that sigh, profit less
      from the VRET than participants that do not sigh.
