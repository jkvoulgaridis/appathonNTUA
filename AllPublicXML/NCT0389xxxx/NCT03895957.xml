      In this study, investigators will test the software developed by Tomorrow Sp. z o. o., named
      VR Mind and VR Mind+. The software utilizes the concept of virtual reality exposure therapy
      to treat social anxiety disorder. The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy
      of VR Mind and VR Mind + interventions.

      The research consists of fourteen sessions. The first and the last session will be dedicated
      to participant assessment. Subsequent sessions 2-13 will be performed according to the
      therapy protocol for each arm. Control group of participants (active comparative arm) will
      receive standard treatment for social anxiety disorder - cognitive behavioral therapy based
      on the protocol developed by the Principal Investigator [protocol adapted from the approach
      of Clark and Wells (Mayo-Wilson, Dias, Mavranezouli, 2014)]. Experimental group 1 will
      receive cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure in virtual environment. Experimental group
      1 and control group were designed to be as similar as possible, with the exception of the
      modality for the delivery of exposure. All treatment session will be led by licensed
      therapist.

      Participants of the experimental group 2 will independently conducts the self-therapy
      process. The intervention will consist of 12 therapeutic sessions. At each of the 12
      sessions, the participant will selects a specific scenario of social situations that arouse
      fear (e.g. public speaking, job interview or other situations from everyday life).

      Because of the risk of simulator sickness (e.g., headaches, nausea), exposure trials will
      last no longer than 20 minutes for each session.

    <measure>Efficacy: Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale - Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS; Liebowitz, 1987)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline: Pre-treatment at session 1, to session 9 (5 weeks) and to post-treatment at session 14 (7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is composed of 24 items, depicting various social situations. For each item, participants assess their fear (from 1 - &quot;No fear&quot; to 4 - &quot;Severe&quot;) and avoidance (from 1 - &quot;Never&quot; to 4 - &quot;Usually&quot;). LSAS has 3 scores, summing the results for particular items - fear (0-72), avoidance (0-72) and total score (0-144).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety: Occurrence and severity of Simulator Sickness - Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ; Kennedy, Lane, Berbaum, Lilienthal, 1993)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from session to session with virtual reality exposure: at session 1, session 7 (4 weeks), session 8 (4 weeks), session 10 (5 weeks), session 11 (6 weeks) and session 12 (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Simulator sickness is expected adverse effect of the VR.Total SSQ score equal to or higher than 10 will be used as a preliminary cut-off for simulator sickness (Balk et al., 2013). Individual scores will be corrected for baseline (pre-VR) symptom severity. Only items with a pre-VR - post-VR increase will contribute to a final SSQ score. All post-intervention SSQ scores &gt;10 will be analyzed further for its association with study drop-outs and other intervention required. The adverse effect will be classified as:
mild (no intervention required),
moderate (any intervention needed, e.g. session termination),
severe (hospitalization required),
life-threatening / death.
Some of the symptoms of anxiety may produce similar side effects as a simulator sickness. The results obtained in this case will be false positive. Therefore assessment of side effects for each case will be verified if the increase in SSQ score was triggered by rapid relapse of phobia symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment at session 1</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression (CGI; Guy, 1976) - is a single item, 7 point scale used by clinicians to assess the severity of illness, where 1 is labeled as &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and 7 is labeled as &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Global Impressions of Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment, approximately 7 weeks after initial session</time_frame>
    <description>Global measure of change in severity of symptoms, ranging from 1 labeled as &quot; Very much improved&quot; to 7 labeled as &quot;Very much worse&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment at session 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Impression - is a single item, 4 point scale used by patients to assess their impression of severity of their illness and quality of their functioning in everyday life, where 1 is labeled as &quot;Normal&quot; and 4 is labeled as &quot;Severe&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impressions of Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment, approximately 7 weeks after initial session</time_frame>
    <description>Global measure of change in severity of symptoms, where 1 is labeled as &quot;No change&quot; and 7 is labeled as &quot; Very much improved &quot;.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment at session 1 to post-treatment at session 14 (7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory for measuring the severity of depression. Each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used differ from the original:
0-13: minimal depression 14-19: mild depression 20-28: moderate depression 29-63: severe depression</description>

    <measure>Subjective Units of Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from session to session with virtual reality exposure during the course of six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Units of Distress (SUD) SUD is a subjective measure of perceived fear in certain situation. The scale range is from 0 (&quot;Totally relaxed) to 100 (&quot;Highest distress/fear/anxiety/discomfort that you have ever felt&quot;).</description>
