  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain information pertaining to the occurrence of antibodies
      to investigational SPK-3006 and GAA, GAA activity and GAA antigen levels in the usual care
      setting of Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) participants on an enzyme replacement regimen.
      Additionally, a careful evaluation of laboratory and functional testing in patients with LOPD
      may provide information to better understand the disease features and better drive the design
      of a future interventional investigational gene therapy trial. An understanding of the
      underlying status of liver and muscle health in individuals with LOPD may also inform best
      surveillance during the conduct of gene therapy trials.

    <description>This is a multi-center, low-interventional study with a retrospective component in participants with LOPD. During a single study visit, assessments including but not limited to, liver health, neutralizing antibodies to SPK-3006 capsid and GAA, anti-GAA binding antibodies, GAA activity and GAA antigen levels will be performed. Additional information will be collected to provide retrospective evaluations relating to muscle and liver inflammation and/or injury. Historic data relating to Pompe disease will be collected from medical records. The retrospective and laboratory data collected may assist in providing baseline information for a future investigational gene therapy study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent and authorization to use protected health information
             in accordance with national and local privacy regulations

          -  Male or females ≥18 years of age

          -  Currently on ERT using regular recombinant human GAA infusions for at least 18 months
             prior to screening

          -  Documented history of clinically moderate late-onset Pompe disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of HIV infection

          -  Requires any invasive ventilation (other than BiPAP at night) or noninvasive
             ventilation while awake and upright

          -  Previously received SPK-3006

          -  Previously dosed with any investigational or approved gene therapy product at any time
             or treated with an investigational drug within the last 12 weeks (vaccination studies
             are accepted)

          -  Any concurrent clinically significant condition that would not allow the potential
             participant to complete the Day 1 examinations, or other condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor, makes the subject unsuitable for
             participation in the study

          -  Unable or unwilling to comply with the schedule of visits and/or study assessments
             described in the clinical protocol.
