  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal mortality is still high in Ethiopia. Antenatal care (ANC), use of skilled delivery
      attendants and postnatal care (PNC) services are key maternal health care services that can
      significantly reduce maternal mortality. However, interventions applied to the continued
      utilization of these key maternal heath services in a continuum of care approach (i.e. early
      initiation of ANC and continued utilization up to four plus vists, health facility delivery
      attended by skilled health care providers and attending three PNC visits) were not well
      applied and studied.

      Hence, the purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of checklist based box system
      interventions on improving utilization of maternal health service (Antenatal care, skilled
      birth attendance and postnatal care) utilization.

      Cluster Randomized controlled trial study design will be employed. The sample size for this
      study was calculated based on the recommendations for sample size calculations for cluster
      randomized controlled trials with fixed number of clusters, by using STATA. The following
      assumptions were considered: to detect an increase of postnatal care three utilization from
      16% to 28% from previous study, number of clusters available-30, with 95% confidence interval
      and 80% power, intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.04849 from similar studies, 15
      clusters per arm. The sample size was calculated to determine number of observations required
      per cluster, for two-sample comparison of proportions (using normal approximation), Assuming
      individual randomization, sample size per arm is 194. Then allowing for cluster
      randomization, average cluster size required is 40, and the final sample size is 1200
      pregnant mothers (600 in intervention, and 600 in control). Data analysis will take place in
      two levels (cluster and individual). Risk ration will be computed at cluster level, and the
      results of this cluster summary will be compared using t-test. Primary and secondary outcomes
      will be compared between intervention and control groups with random effects logistic
      regression models, taking account of clustering.

    <description>The intervention has both behavioural change and service utilization drop out tracing mechanism. Special type of boxes designed to schedule health educations and continued service utilization monitoring boxes will be placed at health posts and health centers respectively. Community level survey will be conducted to identify suspected pregnant mothers using stanback et al, 1999 checklist, and mothers are linked to health centers. Then, they will be followed for their subsequent attendance of consecutive maternal health services (ANC 2nd-third PNC). Mothers who fail to utilize the service will be traced; will get person-centered health education to continue the service.</description>
