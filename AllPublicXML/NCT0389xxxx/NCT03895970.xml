      The investigators design a phase IIB clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of
      lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab as a second-line treatment in patients with advanced
      hepatobiliary malignant tumors and to analyze potential biomarkers of therapeutic response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study of targeted
      therapy combined immunotherapy in patients with hepatobiliary malignant tumors.

      It is estimated that 50 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in PUMCH and
      treated with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. The investigators will follow up and collect
      subjects' data each month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including overall
      survival and time to progression. Multi-omics data analysis will be used to find potential
      biomarkers of treatment response.

             during the treatment period and at least 6 months after the last dose of treatment to
             prevent the fetus from being affected by the study.

          -  The reliability of sexual desire should be evaluated relative to the duration of the
             clinical trial and lifestyle of patient. Periodic abstinence (eg. calendar days,
             ovulation, symptomatic body temperature or post-ovulation methods) and in vitro
             ejaculation are unacceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Patients are unsuitable for participation in this research after comprehensive
             assessment by the researchers.
