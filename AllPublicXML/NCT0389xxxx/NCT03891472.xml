      Primary goal:

      Improvement of the therapeutic index by reducing the toxicity of treatment and increasing
      local control of the cancer process while evaluating the possibility of conversion to the
      surgical status.

      Secondary targets:

        -  Survival rate (OS) assessment in patients treated with mFOLFIRINOX + SBRT

        -  Assessment of quality of life using questionnaires: EQ-5D, EORTC (QLQ-C30) and
           pancreatic cancer-specific QLQ PAS module 26

        -  Early toxicity &lt;3 months after completion of SBRT treatment.

        -  Percentage of local control (1-year)

      STUDY PLAN Patients will receive initial mFOLFIRINOX (6 cycles) chemotherapy, followed by
      evaluation of the response to the treatment (imaging and laboratory testing) followed by
      SBRT, followed by mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.

      In case of exclusion of disease progression after 10 weeks +/- 2 weeks after completion of
      SBRT, patients will be qualified to surgical treatment to attempt a radical surgical
      treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients diagnosed with other types of pancreatic cancer than adenocarcinomas (eg
             neuroendocrine cancer).
