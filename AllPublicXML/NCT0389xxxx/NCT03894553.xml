  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed pilot study will investigate the safety and initial effectiveness of focused
      ultrasound lesioning of the contralateral mesencephalon for severe, opioid-resistant pain
      associated with head and neck cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed as a prospective, open-label clinical trial of stereotactic FUS
      mesencephalotomy in 6 subjects with treatment-refractory pain from head and neck cancer.
      Primary safety assessments will be made throughout the study period of 6 months following the
      procedure. Primary efficacy outcome is determined by comparing the difference in baseline
      NPRS to 3 months post treatment. All subjects receiving treatment will be followed for the
      six month study period.

          2. Subjects with head and neck cancer, including one of the following:

               -  Cancer that arises in the head and neck region: nasal cavity, sinuses, lips,
                  mouth, salivary glands, throat, or larynx (typically squamous cell carcinoma)

               -  Cancer occurring in the nasopharynx, skin, thyroid gland, and eye

               -  Lymphoma

               -  Sarcoma

          3. Craniofacial or cervical pain related to the cancer that meets all of the following
             criteria:

               -  Severe defined by: Worst NPRS score of ≥ 5 out of 10 at current visit and the
                  subject reports having a similar level of pain for at least the past two months.

               -  Pain is medication-refractory to all three tiers of the WHO cancer pain ladder.
                  Thus, adequate trials of at least 3 prescription medications that will include a
                  'weak' and a 'strong' opioid. An adequate medication trial is defined as a
                  therapeutic dose of each medication without sufficient effect.

               -  Duration of greater than 6 months

          4. Mesencephalon contralateral to the pain can be targeted by the ExAblate Neuro device.
             The region of the mesencephalon must be apparent on MRI. Additional MRI sequences
             including inversion-recovery and DTI may be utilized to refine the target.

          5. Subjects who are able and willing to give consent and able to attend all study visits

          6. Subjects who are able to communicate sensations during the focused ultrasound
             treatment

          7. Stable prescribed doses of all symptomatic pain medications for 30 days prior to
             screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          3. Post-herpetic neuralgia

          4. Headache syndromes like migraine, cluster headache

          5. Temporomandibular joint syndrome

          6. Atypical facial pain or pain related to a somatoform disorder

             care clinicians:

               1. Significant clinician concern about reliability of subject-reported information,
                  such as subject in active process of seeking disability for neuropathic pain

               2. Subjects exhibiting any behavior(s) consistent with ethanol or substance abuse as
                  defined by the criteria outlined in the DSM-V as manifested by one (or more) of
                  the following occurring within a 12 month period: Recurrent substance use
                  resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home
                  (such as repeated absences or poor work performance related to substance use;
                  substance-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school; or neglect of
                  children or household). Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is
                  physically hazardous (such as driving an automobile or operating a machine when
                  impaired by substance use)

               3. Recurrent substance-related legal problems (such as arrests for substance related
                  disorderly conduct)

               4. Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or
                  interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance (for
                  example, arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication and physical
                  fights).

          8. Subjects with active psychiatric illness will be excluded. For the purpose of this
