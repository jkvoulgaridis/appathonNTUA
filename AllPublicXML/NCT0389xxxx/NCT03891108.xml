  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Main Objective of this study is to compare the single intravenous (IV) infusion
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMS-986231 and its metabolites (BMT-284730, BMT-279554, and
      CAR-000463) following of up to 2 test formulations of BMS-986231 relative to the reference
      formulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized 1:1:1:1 and dosed with either of the 4 treatments: A, B, C,
      or D; followed by review of safety and tolerability data during and after the infusion. The
      study will proceed with treatments A, and C unless one or more of these treatments shows poor
      tolerability; in which case the study may proceed with treatment B or D in the follow-up
      cohorts. Additional participants will be randomized equally to each of the treatments the
      study will proceed with.
