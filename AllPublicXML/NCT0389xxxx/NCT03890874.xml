  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Didactic lectures are the currently used mode of imparting training to medical students. Use
      of other modes of teaching like simulation is still in its infancy. Simulation, as a teaching
      tool may aid in longer retention of the learning contents and also provides a safe
      environment for the students to practice their skills after knowledge acquisition. The aim of
      the study is to analyze the efficacy of different teaching modalities in imparting a
      particular skill, namely adult cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) which is a life saving
      skill in first year medical students. The study population includes all the first year MBBS
      students and the duration of the study is 1 month. A clarity as to which mode of teaching
      will be ideal for memory retention is the expected outcome of this study.

      Introduction

      Our current medical curriculum devotes a large percentage of its time to knowledge
      acquisition by means of didactic lectures. Psychomotor skill acquisition takes a back seat.
      Certain lifesaving skills like basic life support skill training have not even made an
      appearance in the current curriculum. Equal time distribution to cognitive and psychomotor
      skills should be allotted for a subject as practical as MBBS .Simulation can prove to be a
      valuable tool in imparting skill training. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of
      different teaching modalities in imparting lifesaving skills in first year MBBS students.

      Methods

      This Cross sectional study is conducted among 33 first year students who consented to
      participate. Institutional ethics clearance was also obtained. The students were divided into
      three groups, each undergoing didactic lecture, animation based videos and simulation
      studies. Pretest, posttest and skills test was administered to them. One way anova, Paired t
      test were some of the statistical test employed using SPSS version 21.
