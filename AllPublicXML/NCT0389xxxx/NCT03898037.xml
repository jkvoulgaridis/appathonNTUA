  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of pilot trial is to compare the efficacy of lifestyle intervention, metformin
      intervention, lifestyle combined with metformin intervention in improving assisted
      reproductive technology in non-polycystic ovary syndrome(pcos) patients with
      overweight/obesity and insulin resistance compared with conventional clinical education.
      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to four groups: lifestyle
      intervention group, metformin intervention group, lifestyle combined with metformin
      intervention group, and routine clinical education group. Subjects of above three
      intervention group will start ovulation stimulation treatment after reach the aim or duration
      of intervention and routine clinical education group has no intervention. All subjects are
      treated with the same procedures, including a long ovarian stimulation regimen, oocyte
      retrieval, and fertilization, followed by a planned transfer of two day-3 embryos. The
      primary outcome is ongoing pregnancy rate.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects will receive weight loss intervention under the guidance of a dietitian after assigned to lifestyle intervention group, including: restricted energy balanced diet, aerobic exercise, etc. Subjects will come to the hospital to measure their height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, body fat rate, BMI and test oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)/insulin resistance test(IRT)/HOMA, blood routine, liver and kidney function on the day of grouping and in the 4th week, the 8th week, the 12th week after grouping.
The aim is to lose 5-10% of the initial body weight. If the target was reached within 3 months, subjects will receive ovarian stimulation treatment in advance, otherwise treatment starts after 3 months. All subjects are treated with the same procedures，including a long ovarian stimulation regimen, oocyte retrieval, and fertilization, followed by a planned transfer of two day-3 embryos. The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes after transfer were followed up.</description>

Subjects will come to the hospital to measure their height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, body fat rate, BMI and test OGTT/IRT/HOMA, blood routine, liver and kidney function on the day of grouping and the 4th week, the 8th week, the 12th week after grouping.
The aim is to adjust insulin level to normal within 3 months. If the target was reached within 3 months, subjects will start to receive ovarian stimulation treatment in advance, Otherwise treatment starts after 3 months. All subjects are treated with the same procedures, including a long ovarian stimulation regimen, oocyte retrieval, and fertilization, followed by a planned transfer of two day-3 embryos etc. The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes after transfer were followed up.</description>
