  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic nasal obstruction due to adenoid hypertrophy is among the most common health problems
      affecting children, and adenoidectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed
      in this age group Because of difficulties associated with the use of the objective methods
      (such as nasopharyngeal endoscopy) in young children, the development of a reliable scale
      based on the child's symptoms to properly evaluate the need for surgical intervention would
      be of great value for clinicians. When adenoidectomy is being considered, the diagnosis and
      documentation of adenoidal hypertrophy become an important issue. Numerous modalities have
      been used for this task, including trans oral digital palpation and trans oral mirror
      examination; however, these methods are quite impractical with uncooperative younger children

      Assessment of the nasopharynx and adenoids by fibreoptic examination bears the advantage of
      direct visualization of the postnasal space. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated
      that adenoid size, as determined by rhinoscopy, was well correlated with clinical symptoms
      such as nasal obstruction and snoring.

      The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of lateral neck radiography and video
      rhinoscopy in assessing adenoid size .

      Assessment of the reproducability of these modalities to associated symptoms and, thus, the
      severity of the disease.
