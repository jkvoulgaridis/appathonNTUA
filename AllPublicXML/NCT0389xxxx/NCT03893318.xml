    <textblock>
      This study addresses the focus areas of Post-Operative Pain Management. We propose a
      randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of a systemic
      infusion of intravenous lidocaine as a non-opioid method of post-operative pain management
      following postoperative spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The outcomes
      assessed will be (1) the effect of intravenous lidocaine on post-operative opioid
      consumption, both in-hospital and at three-month follow-up, (2) the effect of intravenous
      lidocaine on the immunophenotype expressed following surgery, and (3) the effect of
      intravenous lidocaine on recovery from surgery as assessed by the Patient Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System-Computer Adaptive Tests for Pain Interference (PI) and
      Mobility (M) (PROMIS-CAT). Thus, we propose a study of a non-opioid method of pain control to
      minimize opioid consumption in-hospital and at three-months postoperatively, with primary
      outcomes measures that include morphine-equivalent opioid consumption and PROMIS-Mobility to
      assess recovery. In addition, we will test the ability of systemic lidocaine to attenuate the
      systemic inflammatory response to major spine surgery. The immunologic response to surgery
      has been associated with rehabilitation and recovery following total hip arthroplasty and
      this study will provide data to support further work.

      a Phase IV, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial with two study groups:
      postoperative standard of care with opioid patient controlled analgesia (PCA) and IV
      lidocaine infusion versus postoperative standard of care plus normal saline placebo. Block
      randomization into one of the two groups will be based on a random table generated using an
      R-program. Group 1 (Study) will receive intravenous lidocaine during and after posterior
      spinal fusion for AIS. Group 2 (Control) will receive saline placebo during and after
      surgery.

    <intervention_name>IV lidocaine</intervention_name>
    <description>an amide-type, short-acting local anesthetic and delivered as an aqueous solution for intravenous administration. It has a half-life of 1.5-2 hours. A traditional method of administration is via epidural delivery. Epidural lidocaine is effective and this effect is due, in part, to systemic absorption. Systemic (intravenous) administration of lidocaine is a Food and Drug Administration approved method of delivery. Low plasma levels are needed for effective use, 0.5µg/mL to 5.0µg/mL. Given this low concentration required and the short half-life, continuous infusion of lidocaine is thought to be generally safe with low risk of complication.</description>
