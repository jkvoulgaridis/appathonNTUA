      phase II controlled randomized study comparing atezolizumab as single agent to the
      combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with chemonaive metastatic NSCLC with
      PD-L1 expression. All NSCLC patients with tumor tissue available for biomarker assessment and
      candidate for first-line therapy are considered eligible for the study. After evaluation of
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria and after informed consent signature all eligible
      patients will be randomized to atezolizumab (Arm A) or to the combination of atezolizumab and
      bevacizumab (Arm B). Disease assessment will be performed every 6 weeks.

      This is a phase II controlled randomized study comparing atezolizumab as single agent to the
      combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with chemonaive metastatic NSCLC with
      PD-L1 expression.

      A total of maximum of 206 patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be treated
      with atezolizumab (1200 mg) every 3 weeks (6-week cycles) or the combination of atezolizumab
      (1200 mg) every 3 weeks (6-week cycles) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal. Disease evaluation, along with
      various assessments, will be made every 3 weeks and every 6 weeks and follow-up every 3
      months. Toxicities will be evaluated throughout the study period. A follow-up of 12 months is
      planned for each patient from the end of treatment .The study will be performed in
      approximately 20 centers across Italy.
