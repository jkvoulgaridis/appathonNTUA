  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that uses a standard of care technique, Stereotactic Body Radiation
      Therapy (SBRT), in combination with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (DCE-CT) to
      determine if perfusion changes from SBRT of liver cancer may be used for outcome assessment
      and prediction of prognosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo standard of care SBRT while also receiving DCE-CT, also known as
      perfusion CT, pre-treatment, 6 hours post-treatment and 6 weeks post-treatment.
