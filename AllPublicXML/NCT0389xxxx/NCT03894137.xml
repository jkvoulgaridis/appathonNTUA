  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Grains of paradise (Aframomumu melegueta) (GP), also known as Guinea pepper or Alligator
      pepper, belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which is native to West Africa. GP seeds are
      used as a spice and also have wide-ranging ethnobotanical uses. GP seeds are very rich in
      non-volatile pungent compounds such as 6-paradol, 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol and related
      compounds. This feature may equip them with the power to activate the Sympathetic Nervous
      System and thereby increase EE, which has been demonstrated in rodents. Research suggest that
      ingestion of GP extract can result in sustained elevation of EE and a consequent reduction in
      body fat. Thus, there is some evidence that GP may have a potential thermogenic effect that
      could be useful as part of a weight loss treatment. However, there is no information on
      whether GP has the potential of improving and prolonging the thermogenic effects of
      bioactives known to elevate fatty acid mobilization and subsequent fat oxidation. This
      proposal will fill a void in the literature by testing for the first time in healthy, normal
      weight, human volunteers whether the ingestion of GP in combination with a commercially
      available complex containing caffeine, green tea, and forskolin has an enhanced acute effect
      on REE, the largest and most stable component of EE, as well as the ratio of fat:carbohydrate
      oxidation. This project will provide pilot data to support larger studies such as prospective
      studies and studies to compare the thermogenic effect with currently available compounds.
