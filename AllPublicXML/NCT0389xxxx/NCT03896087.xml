    <textblock>
      FIND is preparing a study to evaluate the performance, as measured by sensitivity and
      specificity, of three centralized assays for the detection of HCV RNA using capillary blood
      collected on dried blood spots (DBS) and plasma separation card (PSC).

             results

             Inclusion criteria:

               -  Aged 18 years or older

               -  Provided written informed consent

               -  Documented positive result of HCV serology test

          2. Individuals at risk of having HCV infection based on past and/or current exposure to
             risk factors

             Inclusion criteria:

               -  Aged 18 years or older

               -  Able to understand the scope of the trial

               -  Past and/or current exposure to one of the high risk factors as defined by WHO
                  and CDC guidelines (Appendix I)

          3. Individuals diagnosed with chronic HCV infection who initiated or completed the
             anti-HCV treatment with direct acting antivirals (DAA) presenting at the clinical site
             for treatment monitoring or test of cure (i.e. sustained virological response)

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Aged 18 years or older

          -  Able to understand the scope of the trial

          -  Provided written informed consent

          -  Initiated on DAA treatment (regardless of type of DAA regimen) within 12 months prior
             to the enrolment to the trial

        Exclusion criteria (for all trial populations):

          -  Previously enrolled in the trial

          -  Unwilling to provide required volume of fingerstick blood
