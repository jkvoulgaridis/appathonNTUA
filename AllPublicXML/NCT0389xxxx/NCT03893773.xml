  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft ischemia after liver transplantation is associated with a high incidence of morbidity
      and mortality . The overall incidence of vascular complications in adults varies widely among
      transplant centers worldwide, but remains around 7% in various series of deceased donor liver
      transplantation (DDLT), and around 13% involving living donor liver transplantation (LDLT)
      Vascular complications include; hepatic artery thrombosis and stenosis, portal vein
      thrombosis and stenosis, caval and hepatic veins obstruction, arterial pseudo aneurysm.
      Biliary complications include; biliary leakage, stricture and obstruction .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is the most severe and frequent complication represents more
      than 50% of all arterial complications. Early HAT occurring within 1 month post-operation in
      2.9%, and late HAT in 2.2%. The overall mortality rate for patients with early HAT is about
      33% (13).

      Hepatic arterial stenosis can occur immediately postoperative or later with an incidence of
      1% to 2% and has been suggested to progress to HAT. This is due to surgical technique or
      fibrotic healing (14).

      Hepatic artery aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm is rare and has an incidence of 0.27-3%. They occur
      in the second or third post-transplant week after infection caused by biliary sepsis,
      intestinal perforation, anastomotic leak, or intrahepatic stenting, or technical failure .

      Portal vein thrombosis (partial or complete) or stenosis has an incidence of 2-3%, it can
      occur early postoperative within 1 month or more late. Early portal vein thrombosis can lead
      to liver insufficiency and failure. Late presentation, depending on the collateral
      circulation, can lead to portal hypertension with varices and ascites .

      Currently, transplant outflow obstruction by kinking, stenosis or thrombosis of the inferior
      vena cava (IVC) or hepatic vein, especially in LDLT, are relatively uncommon complications
      following liver transplantation with an reported incidence of less than 3%. The main risk
      factor is a technical error in the creation of the anastomosis Despite all the advances in
      transplant patient care and surgical techniques, biliary complications remain high incidence
      in living donor or split liver transplant. There are early and late complications, and there
      are anastomotic, and nonanastomotic biliary complications, such as stones, sludge and casts .
