  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall goal is to optimize preferred, ventilating windows/apertures/vents in low-income
      neighborhoods of Dhaka, Bangladesh. We will:

      I. Collect baseline data on housing types and finalize windows/vents protoypes.

      II. Measure the impact of improved ventilation on air exchange rates in houses in low-income
      neighborhoods of Dhaka and characterize the current and potential market for windows/vents in
      households in low-income neighborhoods of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

      III. Understand recipients' (tenants and landords) perceived benefits of installed
      window/vent designs and difficulties faced with adoption of each design

    <description>Repeated household measurements of effective point ventilation to approximate air exchange rates in both treatment and control households will be obtained.

    <measure>Number of households that adopt the intervention (Part 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Takeup of the intervention will be defined by whether a household had a ventilation design installed, either by winning the BDM auction paying the full price or by accepting a free installation after previously losing the BDM auction.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Revealed willingness-to-pay for ventilation (Part 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>We will obtain stated willingness-to-pay for the ventilation designs through the BDM auction mechanism, which will be used to trace out a demand curve for ventilation, plotting the number of households that are willing to pay for a window agaist their stated price.</description>
