  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of melatonin on clinical outcome,
      quality of life, and cardiovascular function of the patients with heart failure, as well as
      its effect on their skeletal muscle mass and function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with heart failure (HF) suffer from various comorbidities and complications which
      their management is as important as treatment of HF per se. An important complication of the
      HF is progressive decrease in muscle mass and function known as muscle wasting or sarcopenia.
      Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of muscle wasting is emphasized to improve prognosis and
      quality of life of the patients with HF. Melatonin is a natural hormone which is secreted
      from pineal gland and is involved in circadian rhythm control. Recent data delineates more
      important roles for melatonin in cellular metabolism and apoptosis, as well as acting as an
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent in the body. Experimental studies show that melatonin
      can have a beneficial role in muscle wasting in several chronic conditions such as heart
      failure. Furthermore melatonin has been shown to have valuable effects on cardiovascular
      health, blood pressure, and endothelial function and it might benefit patients with heart
      failure. In this study the effect of melatonin on clinical outcome and quality of life of the
      patients with HF and their echocardiographic parameters, muscle mass, muscle function,
      inflammatory biomarkers, serum metabolic parameters, and serum oxidative stress markers will
      be studied.
