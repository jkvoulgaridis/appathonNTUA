      Study to assess the pharmacokinetics of plasma doravirine once daily over 72 hours following
      drug intake cessation at steady-state in healthy volunteers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to HIV-infected patients has
      been associated with a dramatic reduction in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. The key to
      successful HIV drug treatment is adhering to the prescribed combination every day. The
      approval of single tablet combinations (STRs) provides HIV care providers with a &quot;one tablet
      once a day&quot; therapy, making adherence much easier for patients. However, in HIV therapy,
      successful adherence also means attention to intervals between doses or dietary restrictions.
      Ideally, to guarantee long-term virological response, HIV-infected patients should take their
      cART every day at the same time. However, cART is for life and doses can be forgotten or
      delayed. For this study 14 healthy volunteers will receive Pifeltro® (doravirine 100mg
      tablets) daily for 7 days to reach steady state. Following the last dose samples will be
      taken for pharmacokinetic testing over 72 hours.

      The incidence of adverse events between enrolment to the study (day 1) and last visit (day
      20-23) will be recorded.

      Blood, urine and faecal samples from study subjects will be taken for use in planned
      exploratory research and for use in future research:

      Analyses looking at genes which affect drug disposition (pharmacogenomics); the impact of
      doravirine intake on platelet function and markers of platelet and endothelial cell
      activation; metabolic changes associated with doravirine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, prior to
             participation in any screening procedures and must be willing to comply with all study
             requirements

          2. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females.

          3. Between 18 to 65 years, inclusive

          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18 to 35 kg/m2, inclusive

          5. ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). A single repeat is
             allowed for eligibility determination.

          6. Women of childbearing potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to
