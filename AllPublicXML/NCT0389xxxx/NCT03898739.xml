  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of different angles of decompression on
      the Flexor Carpi Radialis (FCR) H-Reflex in patients with cervical radiculopathy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical traction has long been defined as a distracting force that separate the cervical
      segments and relieve nerve roots compression. Yet, there is lack of knowledge that reports
      the effects of different traction decompression angles and determines the proper angle of
      pull among different angles of decompression system

    <description>Intermittent traction will be applied, maximum force will be 16 kg, minimum force will be 12 kg, traction cycle of each minute consists of 20 seconds static traction at the maximum force then released down to the minimum force for 20 seconds then repeated for 20 seconds static traction. Traction session time will be 15 minutes, and the traction force will be increased progressively with speed (50%) of increment of force</description>
