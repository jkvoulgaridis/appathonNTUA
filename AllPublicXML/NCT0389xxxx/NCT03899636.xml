  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in a randomized, controlled, 2-arm,
      unblinded multicenter trial (RCT). There will be 2 study arms: the control arm receiving
      chemotherapy with the modified FOLFIRINOX regimen alone; and the irreversible electroporation
      (IRE) arm, receiving chemotherapy with the modified FOLFIRINOX regimen followed by IRE with
      the NanoKnife System using either an open or a percutaneous approach. All subjects will be
      treated with the modified FOLFIRINOX regimen for at least 3 months; randomization to either
      control or IRE arm will take place at the time of completion of the 3 month modified
      FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy regimen. Randomization will be conducted centrally. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio and must be found to have no evidence of disease progression after
      completion of the 3 month modified FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy regimen in order to participate in
      the RCT. All radiologic assessments will be performed as consistent with the imaging
      protocol. All post induction and post IRE treatments are left to the discretion of the
      treating physician. The minimum period of follow-up will be for 24 months or until death.
