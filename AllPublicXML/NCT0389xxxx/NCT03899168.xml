  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines whether people primarily want to confirm their prior attitudes in
      health-related information search, in an online environment using social tags for navigation.
      Participants were looking for information on the treatment of depression with antidepressants
      and psychotherapy. They were randomly assigned to two groups with either high or low
      credibility of the community who provides social tags, and two groups where participants'
      confidence in prior attitudes was heightened or lowered, and to two groups where either
      antidepressant tags were more popular or psychotherapy was more popular. The investigators
      measured attitude change toward the treatments and also navigation behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In health-related, Web-based information searches, people should select information in line
      with expert (vs nonexpert) information, independent of their prior attitudes and consequent
      confirmation bias.

      This study aimed to investigate confirmation bias in mental health-related information
      searches, particularly (1) if high confidence worsens confirmation bias, (2) if social tags
      eliminate the influence of prior attitudes, and (3) if people successfully distinguish high
      and low source credibility.

      In total, 520 participants of a representative sample of the German Web-based population were
      recruited via a panel company. Among them, 48.1% (250/520) participants completed the fully
      automated study. Participants provided prior attitudes about antidepressants and
      psychotherapy. The investigators manipulated (1) confidence in prior attitudes when
      participants searched for blog posts about the treatment of depression, (2) tag popularity
      —either psychotherapy or antidepressant tags were more popular, and (3) source credibility
      with banners indicating high or low expertise of the tagging community. The investigators
      measured tag and blog post selection, and treatment efficacy ratings after navigation.

    <measure>Attitudinal Preference Score of Psychotherapy over Antidepressants</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 hour. Prior to and after information search phase in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators constructed a questionnaire to measure the attitudinal preference of psychotherapy over antidepressant treatments of depressive disorders. On a 7-point likert scale, participants rate the degree of efficacy of antidepressant and psychotherapy treatments, on 8 items (e.g. item 1: &quot;Antidepressants/Psychotherapy are/is effective in treating depression.&quot;). An index score for the degree of preference of psychotherapy is calculated by subtracting the average antidepressants score from the average psychotherapy treatment rating score for each participant. To analyse if attitudinal preferences predict the number of clicks on social tags and blog posts, the treatment preference score is entered in a logistic regression as predictor. Ratings are inquired at the beginning of the 1 hour study (prior attitudes), and at the end of the study (attitude change).</description>

    <description>Both, psychotherapy and antidepressant tags can be clicked on, and are counted respectively. An index score will be calculated for each participant subtracting the sum of clicks on antidepressants from the sum of clicks on psychotherapy, to analyse if clicks are associated with the treatment preference measured by prior treatment attitudes.</description>
