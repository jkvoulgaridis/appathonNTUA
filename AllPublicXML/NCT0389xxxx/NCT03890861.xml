  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RAATE proposal is designed to determine the effects of physical activity on risk factors
      for Alzheimer's Disease in older African American adults. The study will compare a physical
      activity program to an active control group. There are three main objectives of the protocol:
      1) to determine if a physical activity intervention tailored to older African American adults
      is effective in modifying cognitive function associated with Alzheimer's Disease, 2) to
      determine if a physical activity intervention tailored to older African American adults is
      effective in modifying brain function and structure associated with Alzheimer's Disease, and
      3) to determine if a physical activity promotion intervention tailored to African American
      adults is effective at enhancing physiological parameters. The primary endpoints for the
      study are episodic memory and executive functioning. The secondary outcomes include
      anthropometry, blood pressure, brain activation, cerebral blood flow, volume of whole brain
      and white matter hyperintensities, cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively measured physical
      activity, circulating hormones, and telomere length.

    <description>The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is a common neuropsychological tool used to evaluate episodic memory. The RAVLT involves providing participants with 15 unrelated words and asking them to recall the word list. There are 5 trials designed to determine short-term memory and then a 30 minute delay to assess long-term memory. The total words correct in both the short- and long-term trials are used as outcome measures.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks, 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NIH Toolbox Executive Function subdomain consists of the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test and the Dimensional Change Card Sort Test. The Flanker test is a measure of one's ability to inhibit attention to irrelevant conditions. Participants must identify the direction of a central visual stimuli amongst flanking stimuli either congruent or incongruent with the central stimuli. There are 40 trials and scores range from 0 - 10. The Card Sort is a measure of the ability to shift attention based on rules. Participants must match a target visual stimuli to either a color or word stimuli and this matching shifts during the assessment.</description>

    <ipd_description>For all study data, Pennington Biomedical has a well-structured internal process for data sharing and transfer. The Office of Legal and Regulatory Compliance is responsible for all data agreements which includes data subject to the protection under HIPAA. As part of the Louisiana State University System, Pennington Biomedical ensures that data agreements are in place in the following circumstances: business associate agreements when the transfer of data contains all identifiers, data use agreements when the transfer of data contains those identifiers that constitute a limited data set and a data transfer agreement in instances where data is de-identified, but still may be subject of protection in order to protect intellectual property rights. Transmission of data to ensure proper safeguards are in place on the data in motion and data at reset are carried out with assistance of the Research Computing Group or the Office of Computing Services.</ipd_description>
