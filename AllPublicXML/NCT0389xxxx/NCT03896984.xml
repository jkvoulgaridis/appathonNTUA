  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researcher want to learn more about the overall survival in patients suffering
      from prostate gland cancer which spread outside the prostate to other parts of the body who
      received either a novel anti-hormone therapy (NAH) or Radium-223 (Xofigo) after a prior NAH
      therapy (first line treatment). Additionally the researchers are also interested in the
      occurrence of bone fractures and other skeletal events. Basis for this study will be the US
      based Flatiron database which provides access to clinical data for cancer patients.
