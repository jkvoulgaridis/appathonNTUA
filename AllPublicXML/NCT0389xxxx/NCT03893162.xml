  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has suggested that probiotics can improve depressive symptoms in patients
      with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), particularly when used in addition to antidepressants.
      The aim of this exploratory pilot study is to improve the investigator's understanding of the
      mechanisms underlying these effects. This study will assess the effects of an 8-week
      double-blind placebo-controlled probiotic intervention on the gut microbiome, inflammatory
      marker levels, brain activity and neurotransmitter levels in patients with MDD and their
      relationship to changes in mood. This study will also recruit a group of
      demographically-matched healthy controls for gut microbiome comparison with the MDD group
      (non-interventional).
