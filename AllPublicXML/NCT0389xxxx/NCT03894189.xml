  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doxapram is licensed for drug-induced post-anesthesia respiratory depression , arousal effect
      and return airway protective reflexes caused by barbiturates, volatile anesthetics, nitrous
      oxide or benzodiazepines over dosage.

      Value of theophylline to stimulate the respiratory neuronal network has been examined by
      previous studies and increases the activity of respiratory muscles, including the intercostal
      , transversus abdominis muscles and the diaphragm, it also has bronchodilator and
      anti-inflammatory effects.

      This randomized comparative study will be conducted in the post-surgical cardio-thoracic
      intensive care unit in Beni -Suef University Hospital after approval of the department of
      anesthesiology, surgical ICU and pain management , and cardio thoracic department and the
      local ethics and research committee, and obtaining written informed consents from the
      patients to compare the effect of doxapram versus theophylline on diaphragmatic function
      using ultrasonography parameter: thickening fraction of the diaphragmatic muscle during
      respiration which defined as [(thickness at end-inspiration - thickness at
      end-expiration)/thickness at end-expiration] during spontaneous breathing trial as a primary
      outcome and its effect on weaning time and weaning success rate as secondary outcomes.
