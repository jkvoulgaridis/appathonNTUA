  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans have the greatest burden of endothelial dysfunction and hypertension.
      Recently, gut microbial dysbiosis (a term that describes a poorly diverse gut microbial
      profile and lower short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production) has been linked to hypertension
      and may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in African Americans. African
      Americans have been reported to have lower gut SCFA and SCFA can reduce blood pressure.
      Exercise reduces blood pressure and improves gut dysbiosis (increases SCFA) and likely
      couples' improvements in gut microbial health and vascular function to reduce blood pressure.
      Thus, the goals of this research are to fill a critical void concerning the interaction of
      gut dysbiosis, hypertension, and utilizing exercise to identify gut microbial adaptations
      that accompany a reduction in blood pressure. The short-term implications of this work will
      advance the clinical communities understanding of the relationship between dysbiosis and the
      pathogenesis of hypertension in African Americans, while long term implications will promote
      identifying adaptable gut microbes associated with vascular health to aid in amending
      treatment strategies for hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans (AA) have the greatest burden of hypertension and elucidating the
      pathogenesis of this racial disparity is important for amending treatment strategies. Gut
      microbial dysbiosis has been linked to hypertension and has been characterized as low
      microbial composition of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing microbes. Reduced gut SCFA
      production has been observed in AA with disease, such as glucose intolerance and vitamin
      deficiency, and may be related to the pathogenesis of hypertension in this group. Preliminary
      data show that aerobic exercise improves the gut microbial profile and increases SCFA
      production in animal models and humans. Additional preliminary data show that the SCFA
      butyrate attenuates dysfunction in AA endothelial cells suggesting a role for SCFA in
      endothelial/vascular function. The proposed studies have been constructed to fill a critical
      void in our understanding of the pathogenesis of hypertension in AA involving the gut
      microbiome. The investigators hypothesize that lower SCFA production is associated with blood
      pressure in AA and exercise will be effective in reducing blood pressure by coupling
      improvements in gut microbial health (↑SCFA production) and vascular health. The proposed
      research will: 1) quantify the relationship between gut dysbiosis (reduced gut and
      circulating SCFA) and blood pressure in AA with hypertension and 2) quantify the impact of
      aerobic exercise training on gut microbial community structure, identify adaptable SCFA
      microbes related to blood pressure, blood concentrations of SCFA, and blood pressure in AA.
      The research will provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of hypertension, particularly
      in the health disparate AA population, and will facilitate the development of future
      mechanistic studies to advance the clinical communities understanding of the &quot;gut-vascular
      axis&quot; concerning endothelial function and vascular disease in AA.
