      Prospective, multi-center study will evaluate a pulsing technique with the ECHELON FLEX GST
      system for hemostasis at the staple line in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy procedures.

      Data collected for the study consists of videography imaging and audio. Video recordings (no
      subject identifiers) will involve the use of two cameras providing:

        1. Synchronized Internal and external views of devices used, including the hands of the
           surgeon firing the endocutter; and

        2. Audio of the procedure to record the motor noise of the device while firing (audio will
           help identify the surgeon's pulsing technique during the procedure).

      Surgeon satisfaction with transection technique will also be collected. Videography will be
      evaluated for staple line hemostasis and need for surgical intervention at the staple line
      (defined in Criteria for Evaluation).
