  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It can inhibit the
      angiogenesis related kinase, such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR),
      Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor(FGFR), Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor(PDGFR), and
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase c-Kit kinase. Anlotinib is an efficient second line
      therapeutic agent in treatment for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma which has been approved in
      clinical trials (ALTER-0203). Therefore, this study evaluates the safety and efficacy of
      anlotinib as maintenance treatment of disease control in advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

      This regional multi-center study is planned to be carried out in Guangdong and Sichuan
      provinces. 48 cases are preliminarily expected to be included. The study will start in
      January 2019 and end in December 2019. It is expected that the trial will end in December
      2020. This study evaluating the safety and efficacy of anlotinib as a maintenance treatment
      in advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

      All those participants need to sign informed consent forms for data collection and be used
      for research purpose before inclusion. Participants remained PR/SD after ≥4 cycles of
      anthracyclines could be enrolled.

      48 subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcoma will receive anlotinib at a dose of 12 mg once
      daily (day1-14 PO) in 21-day cycles until disease progression (defined by RECIST version 1.1)
      or unacceptable toxicity.
