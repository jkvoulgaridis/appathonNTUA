  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first prospective study in Hong Kong that recruit patients with poor neurological
      status after intracranial aneurysm rupture in all seven public neurosurgical services in Hong
      Kong. This study assesses whether ultra-early aneurysm treatment improves outcomes in
      patients with poor neurological status after intracranial aneurysm rupture in Hong Kong.
      These data are essential to understand the impact of the disease and for future service
      development in Hong Kong.

      Objectives:

        1. To evaluate outcomes in patients admitted with poor neurological status after
           intracranial aneurysm rupture in Hong Kong;

        2. To evaluate whether ultra-early aneurysm treatment improves outcomes in patients
           admitted with poor neurological status after intracranial aneurysm rupture.

      Hypothesis to be tested: Ultra-early aneurysm treatment increases chance of favorable
      outcomes in in patients admitted with poor neurological status after intracranial aneurysm
      rupture.

      Design and subjects: Prospective observational study to recruit consecutive poor grade
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients in the seven public neurosurgical services in
      Hong Kong.

      Study instruments: Modified Rankin Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Stroke-Specific
      Quality of Life, Short Form-36, Return to Work, and hospital resource utilization.

      Groups: Ultra-early (within initial 24 hours) and non-ultra early aneurysm treatment.

      Main outcome measures: Favorable outcome at six months. Data analysis and expected results:
      Comparisons are carried out with adjustments for age, sex, admission Glasgow Coma Scale,
      hypertension, and modality of aneurysm treatment with appropriate regression analyses.
