  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter phase II randomized trial. The purpose is to investigate both the
      efficacy and safety of radiotherapy combined with anti-PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy
      (gemcitabine+cisplatin) in unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients.

    <textblock>
      The trial will recruit 184 patients, and they will be randomized (1:1) into two groups
      (radiotherapy+anti-PD-1 group, gemcitabine+cisplatin group). Patients in
      radiotherapy+anti-PD-1 group will receive conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy or
      stereotactic body radiation therapy first for a total dose more than 40Gy. Camrelizumab 200mg
      intravenously every 3 weeks will be initiated within 7 days after radiotherapy. Patients in
      chemotherapy group will receive cisplatin 25mg/m2 intravenously (day 1 and day 8) and then
      gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 intravenously (day 1 and day 8) every 3 weeks (1 cycle), for 8 cycles.

    <description>The total radiation dose is over 40Gy without damaging organic fucntion. Conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy are both allowed. Camrelizumab 200mg intravenously every 3 weeks will be initiated within 7 days after radiotherapy. Patients will receive camrelizumab until clinical or radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, termination of the study or withdrawal. If disease progression is confirmed by radiologic examinations, another 200mg camrelizumab should be applied to the patient, then another radiologic examination will be performed 4 weeks later to confirm or exclude progression. If progression is confirmed, the camrelizumab should be stopped.</description>
