  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal duration of anticoagulation therapy (3
      months versus 12 months) with direct oral anticoagulant (edoxaban) for isolated distal deep
      vein thrombosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis
      (DVT), is a major health problem in the world. There have been many clinical studies
      evaluating PE and/or proximal DVT, although data on isolated distal DVT (IDDVT) has been
      quite limited. However, IDDVT was reported to account for about half of all the diagnoses of
      DVT detected on ultrasound in daily clinical practice, and optimal management strategies for
      these patients are becoming clinically more relevant. The current American College of Chest
      Physicians (ACCP) guidelines suggest the same approach for IDDVT patients with cancer as
      proximal DVT patients with cancer. However, whether anticoagulation therapy should be
      continued indefinitely remains uncertain and the duration of treatment in these patients
      might vary widely in daily clinical practice. Recently, some observational studies reported
      that IDDVT patients with cancer have a high risk of VTE recurrence, suggesting the benefit of
      prolonged anticoagulation therapy. In this open-label, superiority trial, we will randomly
      assign IDDVT patients with active cancer to receive either edoxaban for 3 months (short DOAC
      group) or edoxaban for 12 months (long DOAC group).

    <description>Symptomatic VTE recurrence event is defined as PE and/or DVT with symptoms accompanied by confirmation of new thrombus or exacerbation of the thrombus by objective imaging examinations or autopsy. VTE related death event is defined as death due to a documented PE (either an objective test prior to death of the subject or PE detected during autopsy) or unexplained death (i.e. death without a clear alternate cause and not a primary consequence of subject's underlying cancer.)</description>

    <description>Major bleeding is defined as International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding, which consisted of a reduction in the hemoglobin level by at least 2 g/dL, transfusion of at least 2 units of blood or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A bleeding event will be classified as a clinically relevant non-major bleeding event if it is overt (i.e. is symptomatic or visualized by examination) not meeting the criteria for major bleeding, requires medical attention or is associated with discomfort for the subject such as pain, or impairment of activities of daily life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Clinically relevant bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically relevant bleeding is defined as major or CRNM bleeding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bleeding related death event</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding related death event is defined as a bleeding event directly led to death. Examples of fatal bleeding events are an intracranial hemorrhage that led to herniation of the brain and death within 24 hours, and a massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage that results in shock, hemodynamic collapse, and death.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Unsuspected recurrent VTE is defined as thrombi that are detected during imaging testing performed for other reasons (e.g., computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging) and not for suspicion of DVT or PE.</description>
