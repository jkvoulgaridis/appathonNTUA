  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study targets individuals in Chicago who have received naloxone administered by first
      responders within the past week to reverse an overdose, but who have not entered into MAT.
      Study participants will be recruited through partnerships with the Chicago Fire Department
      (CFD) and/or Police Department (CPD); first responders will be trained to seek consent from
      individuals who are alert and oriented after receiving naloxone for future contacts by
      research staff as part of the naloxone standard protocol. Those who consent will be contacted
      and screened for study eligibility ideally within one week of naloxone administration;
      eligible participants will be randomly assigned either to the control group, i.e., referral
      to MAT as usual, or to Recovery Initiation and Management after Overdose (RIMO), an assertive
      linkage and recovery support intervention. This intervention builds on an evidence-based
      intervention for treatment linkage, monitoring, and recovery support evaluated in 3 prior
      clinical trials by the study team.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research staff will work with the Chicago Fire Department's Emergency Medical Services
      division and the Chicago Police Department to identify people who have just had an opioid
      overdose reversed with naloxone, recruit them into the trial, randomize them to a passive
      referral (via a brochure) vs. the RIMO experimental group. Using the study recruitment and
      RIMO procedures refined in Phase 1, a total of 350 individuals will be recruited and randomly
      assigned to the &quot;referral to MAT&quot; control or to &quot;RIMO&quot;. All participants will receive
      standardized assessments at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months post-randomization. The study's
      aims and their associated hypotheses are:

      Aim 1: Evaluate RIMO's direct effect on linkage to MAT, length of time on MAT, dropout, and
      total days of MAT.

      H1: Relative to the control group, RIMO will have a direct effect on: a) initiating MAT
      sooner, b) staying on medication longer, c) reducing dropout, and d) receiving more total
      days of MAT.

      Aim 2: Evaluate RIMO's direct and indirect (via MAT) effects on time to relapse, opioid use,
      and opioid-related overdose.

      H2: RIMO will have direct and indirect (via days of MAT treatment) effects on: a) time to
      relapse, b) days of opioid use, and c) number of overdoses.

      Aim 3: RIMO's direct and indirect (via MAT and opioid use) effects on opioid-related
      fatalities, opioid use disorder (OUD) symptoms, physical health, mental health and the cost
      of health care utilization.

      H3: RIMO will have direct and indirect (via days of MAT treatment and days of opioid use)
      effects on: a) opioid-related fatalities, b) opioid use disorders symptoms, c) physical
      health, d) mental health, and e) cost of health care utilization.
