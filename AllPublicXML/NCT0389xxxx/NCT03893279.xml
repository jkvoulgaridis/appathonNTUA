  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic use may be associated with effects on the perception of smell and taste. These
      effects are poorly known. The mechanisms can be very diverse, and the effect can be very
      variable depending on the type of antibiotic used, the dose, and the duration.

      The aim of this study is to analyze the perception of the taste and olfactory capacities of
      patients, during an antibiotic treatment.
