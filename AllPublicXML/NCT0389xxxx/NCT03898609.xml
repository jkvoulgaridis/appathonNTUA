      Introduction. The multifactorial chylomicronemia ((MCM), also known as type V
      hyperlipoproteinaemia or mixed hyperlipidaemia) is an oligogenic or polygenic disorder that
      is associated with a reduction in lipoprotein lipase activity which leads to chylomicronemia.
      In this disease, very high concentrations of serum triglycerides (≥10 mmol/l (≥880 mg/dL))
      can be observed in the fasting state due to the accumulation of both VLDL-C and chylomicron.
      In patients with MCM, chylomicronemia typically occur in adulthood and is exacerbated by the
      presence of secondary factors such as a diet rich in dietary fats and simple sugars, obesity,
      alcohol intake and uncontrolled diabetes. It has been estimated that chylomicronemia can be
      found in 1:600 adults. However, it is likely that the prevalence of MCM may increase in the
      future due to the increasing prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.
      This condition increases the risk of acute pancreatitis, which can be recurrent and
      potentially fatal. Indeed, the risk of acute pancreatitis is 10-20% for TG levels &gt; 22.58
      mmol/L (&gt;2000 mg/dL). Furthermore, because MCM patients often present with other lipid
      disturbances as well as a worse metabolic profile, these patients are at increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Fortunately, MCM patients generally respond well to
      modifications in lifestyle, to treatment of secondary factors and to triglycerides lowering
      therapies such as fibrates. However, it is still unknown which kind of diet has the greatest
      effect on triglycerides level and on the metabolic profile in MCM patients.

      The nutritional recommendations can be very different according to the nature of the
      patient's population to be treated. In order to reduce and manage triglycerides level in the
      general population, the American Heart Association guidelines recommend reduction of simple
      carbohydrates intake.

      On the other hand, the nutritional intervention strategy is quite different for subjects
      affected by familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), for which the treatment focuses on
      restriction of dietary fat. FCS is a very rare autosomal recessive disease that leads to a
      drastic reduction of chylomicrons clearance leading to chylomicronaemia. Therefore, a very
      strict lipid-controlled diet low in long-chain fatty acid (10-30g/day or 10%-15% of total
      energy intake) is required in order to lower chylomicron formation.

      MCM is a complex condition in which both an increased VLDL formation by the liver and a
      decreased chylomicrons and VLDL clearance are present. Furthermore, triglycerides values are
      fluctuating from day to day but generally remain very high. Therefore, the best dietary
      approach for these patients remains to be elucidated.

      Primary Objective. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of low-fat
      vs low-carbohydrate diets on fasting serum triglyceride concentrations.

      Secondary Objectives.

        1. To compare the effects of low-fat vs low-carbohydrate diets on other fasting
           cardiometabolic parameters: measured LDL-C, total cholesterol, HDL-C, glucose, insulin,
           HOMA-IR, apoB, non-HDL-C, hs-CRP, PCSK9 and free fatty acids (FFA).

        2. To compare the effects of low-fat vs low-carbohydrate diets on SBP, DBP and waist
           circumference.

        3. To compare the effects of low-fat vs low-carbohydrate diets on lipoprotein subfractions
           (fasting).

        4. To compare the effects of low-fat vs low-carbohydrate meals on postprandial
           triglycerides, insulin, glucose, FFA and PCSK9 after a standardized test meal.

        5. To assess the patients' appreciation, compliance and tolerability for each experimental
           diet (feedback questionnaire).
