  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial develops and studies how well a patient decision aid works in supporting
      decision-making about when to start or stop new drugs, join clinical trials, or continue
      active cancer monitoring for patients with medullary thyroid cancer and their caregivers.
      Developing a patient decision aid may help patients with medullary thyroid cancer make
      well-informed decisions about their cancer care and be able to discuss their preferences with
      their doctors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess patient, caregiver, and provider decision-making needs. II. To design and
      develop an initial patient decision aid prototype. III. To pilot test its acceptability.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants use decision aid and complete questionnaire.

    <description>The research team will tabulate and summarize responses to the needs assessment questionnaire to identify priority design needs, and review open text areas for notable suggestions assessed quantitatively in terms of greater than 80% of participants providing greater than 80% favorable responses (e.g. Agree or Strongly Agree) to the Acceptability measure (comparable to similar studies in the literature)</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>During storyboarding, the research team will iteratively review the interviewers' notes regarding participant feedback, identify predominant recommendations for improvement, and make decisions to refine the decision aid design assessed quantitatively in terms of greater than 80% of participants providing greater than 80% favorable responses (e.g. Agree or Strongly Agree) to the Acceptability measure (comparable to similar studies in the literature</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision aid acceptability: acceptability questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year post decision aid</time_frame>
    <description>The research team will review the Think Aloud interview notes for potential opportunities for improvement. Responses to the post‐decision aid acceptability questionnaire will be tabulated and summarized into tables for publication and presentation using Excel. The Stakeholder Advisory Panel will review responses to the post‐decision aid acceptability questionnaire, to confirm that viewing the decision aid provides a balanced presentation of the options and is not likely to bias patients'/survivors' initial preferences assessed quantitatively in terms of greater than 80% of participants providing greater than 80% favorable responses (e.g. Agree or Strongly Agree) to the Acceptability measure (comparable to similar studies in the literature).</description>
