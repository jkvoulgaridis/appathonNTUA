  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of ever-increasing automation in surface vehicles, automation impact on
      drivers will be investigated through three complementary research axes undertaken under
      simulated driving:

      Axe 1 (Cognitive ergonomics), how automation is impacting driving behaviors and visual
      explorations? Axe 2 (Experimental psychology), how automation is impacting drivers' mental
      representations of their own driving abilities? Axe 3 (Neuroimaging), how automation is
      modifying the car driving neural network? And what are drivers' mental representations neural
      bases? The project tackle both applied and basic research issues using an original
      experimental neuro ergonomics approach. AUTODRIVE will bring original data on human-machine
      cooperation, mental representations, cognitive control and brain processes depending on the
      characteristics of the automation used over a significant period of time (six weeks) on a
      large sample (N=120) of experienced and inexperienced drivers.

    <measure>BOLD effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Repetition Time (TR) :every 3 seconds, during the 3 fMRI sessions of respectively 1 hour, 0,75 hour and 0,75 hour. fMRI session 2 occurs 3 weeks after fMRI session 1 and 3 weeks before fMRI session 3.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases. The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast in response to an experimental condition (Ogawa, Lee, Kay, &amp; Tank, 1990), allowing researchers to track changes in oxygen consumption on the brain, and therefore brain activity. BOLD effect is computed by assessing the different relaxation times (T1 and T2) in the brain, as T1 and T2 are different in function of regional cerebral blood flows.
The outcome will be a change between mean BOLD effect oven session 1 versus session 2 versus session 3.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral changes</measure>
    <time_frame>Two experimental sessions of an hour, one before and one after the six weeks of automated driving. Plus six driving sessions of 0,5 hour, one driving session the first day of each experimental week.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to drive through a variety of driving situations in a driving simulator simulated environment equipped with an eye-tracker. The measure collected will be drivers' behaviors on the steering wheel and pedals as well as their visual behaviors.
The outcome will be a change in the number of actions on the steering wheel (a), pedals (b) and gaze dispersion (c) on the visual scene across the time points.</description>

    <arm_group_label>UnAssisted (UA)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This term refers to driving a vehicle manually without any vehicle automation technology. It will serve as a baseline concerning behaviors, representations and neural results associated with unassisted automobile driving.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This term refers to driving with warning technology which upon activation sounds an a warning when the vehicle is too close to the edge of the road (off-road warning , Navarro, Mars, &amp; Hoc, 2007; Suzuki &amp; Jansson, 2003) or too close to the vehicle in front of it (anti-collision warning; Lee, McGehee, Brown, &amp; Reyes, 2002).</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Shared Control (SC)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This term refers to shared tactical control between the driver and the automated assistive technology, both working simultaneously on the physical trajectory of the vehicle, laterally (Griffiths &amp; Gillespie, 2005; Mulder, Abbink, &amp; Boer, 2012) as well as longitudinal (Adell, Várhelyi, &amp; Hjälmdahl, 2008).</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Partly Autonomous (PA)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This term refers to a situation where the lateral and longitudinal control of the driving are delegated to the automated assistive technology. It consists of a level of automatisation that today is possible to put into application and which often is referred to by the name &quot;Highly Automated Driving&quot; (Navarro, 2018). In this case, the driver is no longer the one who physically ensures the lateral and longitudinal control of the vehicle, but instead supervises the actions of the automated assistive technology.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
