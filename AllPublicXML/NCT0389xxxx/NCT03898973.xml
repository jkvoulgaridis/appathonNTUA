      This is one project of a larger ongoing study related to the immune system's response to the
      flu virus. This study is designed to determine how immune memory develops at the actual site
      of exposure, and how immunization may alter this process.

      This is a Phase IV study of licensed influenza vaccines with up to 50 volunteers, 20-75 years
      of age.

      Each volunteer will participate for approximately 1 week including enrollment, vaccination,
      and completion of sample collection.

      The study has a total of 3 visits.

      Study Procedures:

      Screening Visit: Procedures during this visit are: Informed consent process, assess
      eligibility collect relevant clinical data and obtain 10 mL of blood to ensure the FNA will
      be safe (acceptable CBC and PT/PTT).

      Visit 1: Vaccination Visit:

      Eligible subjects will return and have a 20 mL blood sample. Participants will receive the
      inactivated flu vaccine into the right anterior quadriceps. Volunteers will be monitored for
      at least 15 minutes after study vaccination.

      Visit 2: FNA Procedure: Seven days after vaccination the participant will return for another
      collection of 20 ml of blood and a fine needle aspiration of a right inguinal lymph node
      under ultrasound guidance by a trained pathologist.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 20-75-year-old male and female patients

          2. Body mass index (BMI) 20-35 kg/m2

          3. Acceptable laboratory values: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 750 cells/mm3;
             Hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL; Platelet count &gt;75,000/mm3; Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)
             &gt;1.2x ULN; Prothrombin time (PT) &gt;1.2x ULN

          4. Willing and able to complete the informed consent process

          5. Availability for follow-up for the planned duration of the study

          6. Acceptable medical history by review of inclusion/exclusion criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior off-study vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine within three months of
             study vaccination

          2. Life-threatening reactions to previous influenza vaccinations

          3. Allergy to egg or egg products or to vaccine components

          4. Active systemic or serious concurrent illness, including febrile illness on the day of
             vaccination

          5. History of immunodeficiency (including HIV infection)

          6. Known or suspected impairment of immunologic function; may include significant liver
             disease, diabetes mellitus treated with insulin or moderate to severe renal disease

          7. Chronic Hepatitis B or C.

          8. Recent or current use of immunosuppressive medication, including systemic
             glucocorticoids (corticosteroid nasal sprays and topical steroids are permissible).
             Use of oral steroids (&lt;20mg prednisone-equivalent/day) may be acceptable after review
             by the investigator.
