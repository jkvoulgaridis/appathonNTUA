    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the CORONA-IS study is to characterize stroke-associated acute myocardial
      injury (elevated hs-cardiac troponin) using different diagnostic examinations in order get a
      better understanding of it's underlying pathomechanisms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial injury (i.e. elevated cardiac troponin levels) is a frequent cardiac complication
      during the first few days after an ischemic stroke and is associated with a poor functional
      outcome. Myocardial injury represents one essential part of a broad spectrum of cardiac
      complications ranging to severe arrhythmia or heart failure. There is evidence that, in the
      majority of patients, the underlying mechanism of stroke-associated myocardial injury is not
      coronary-mediated myocardial ischemia but rather stroke-induced functional and structural
      interference in the central autonomic network. The investigators hypothesize that this causes
      a dysregulation of normal neuronal cardiac control leading to myocardial edema and stunning
      ('Stroke-Heart-Syndrome') CORONA-IS is a prospective, observational, single-centered cohort
      study that will recruit 300 patients with acute ischemic stroke. According to serial high
      sensitivity cTn levels during the first 24h after admission, patients will be assigned to
      three groups (no myocardial injury, chronic myocardial injury, acute myocardial injury).
      Study procedures include cardiovascular MRI and transthoracic echocardiography to visualize
      (transient) cardiac dysfunction and provide detailed tissue characterization, 20-minute
      Holter-monitoring with an analysis of specific autonomic markers, and a systematic
      bio-banking to study further mechanisms such as altered microRNA signatures. A follow-up for
      cardiovascular events will be conducted one year after enrolment to study long-term effects
      of stoke-associated myocardial injury.

      The aim of the CORONA-IS study is to develop a better understanding of the characteristics
      and the pathophysiology of stroke-induced acute myocardial injury ('Stroke-Heart-Syndrome')
      in order to identify patients at risk and improve diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
