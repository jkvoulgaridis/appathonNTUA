  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a condition of the hip where there is a mis-fit between
      the femoral head (ball) and hip acetabulum (socket). The abnormalities on the hip bones
      collide or &quot;impinge&quot; during movements such as hip flexion and rotation. Typically, patients
      with this condition are young adults who present with hip pain, loss of hip function, and in
      many cases, osteoarthritis later in life. The rate of diagnoses of FAI has dramatically risen
      across all age groups, but it has been especially notable within adolescent populations.
      There has been a corresponding increase in the number of surgeries performed on younger and
      younger hips to treat pain and loss of function due to this condition. Preliminary
      small-scale research has hypothesized that increased activity, such as sport specialization
      (i.e. playing only one sport for most of the year) at an early age when the hip is still
      developing, may be the cause. In the past 20 years, sport injuries among children have
      dramatically increased, where close to 45 million young athletes participate in organized
      sports annually in Canada and the US alone. There is a current trend among coaches and
      parents to have children focus on one sport with the thought that this dedication will allow
      them to reach an elite level. We are proposing the first international, longitudinal cohort
      study to determine the effect of sport specialization on the development of FAI during the
      critical phase of hip development (i.e. between the ages of 12-14 years). Volunteer
      participants will be recruited across Canada and internationally and will be evaluated
      clinically and radiographically (i.e. using MRI) over 2 years. This study will not only
      prospectively evaluate the role of sport activity the development of FAI, but also inform
      preventative training protocols to potentially reduce its incidence among adolescents, and
      later as adults, as well as identify parameters to detect hips that are at risk for
      developing FAI.

      This is a multi-centre, international longitudinal cohort study evaluating 200 participants
      between the ages of 12-14 that include sport specialists at the moderate to vigorous physical
      activity (MVPA) level and non-sport specialists at any activity level. Participant groups
      will be defined according to the AOSSM and AMSSM early sport specialization criteria (2016).
      We will monitor physical activity levels of all participants using an activity log and a
      wrist-mounted activity tracker, with synced data collected every 3 months during the study
      period. In addition, participants will be evaluated clinically and radiographically at time
      of enrollment and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The primary study outcome is the incidence of FAI
      between groups at 2 years, determined via MRI. Secondary outcomes include hip function and
      health-related quality of life between subjects diagnosed with FAI versus no FAI at 2 years,
      as determined by the HOS and PedsQL questionnaires.

    <description>The primary outcome is the incidence of radiographic FAI between groups at 2 years, as determined by the dedicated MRI of the hip. We will identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, where asymptomatic FAI can become symptomatic in young adulthood, and/or could be associated with idiopathic osteoarthritis later in life.</description>
