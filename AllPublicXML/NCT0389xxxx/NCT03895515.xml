  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fiasp® is a meal-time insulin that has been available in Sweden since June 2017. This study
      will investigate the effectiveness of Fiasp® in treating Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The study
      will be based on blood sugar measurements that the participants have uploaded to the Diasend®
      database and on existing data in their electronic medical records. The study does not require
      any additional visits to the study doctor.
