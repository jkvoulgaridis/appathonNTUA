    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for
      EGFR-Mutated Advanced Lung Cancer.

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are Niraparib and Osimertinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved niraparib for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      The FDA has approved osimertinib as a treatment option for this disease.

      Niraparib is a type of drug called a &quot;PARP inhibitor&quot;, which blocks DNA (the genetic material
      of cells) damage from being repaired or may prevent damage from occurring in the first place.
      In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells through deadly DNA damage.
      PARP inhibition may be a treatment option for participants with this type of cancer due to
      altered repair and protection of tumor DNA.

      Osimertinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this type of
      cancer there is a mutation in the EGFR which is allowing the cancer to grow when it is not
      supposed to. Osimertinib blocks mutated EGFR, which may cause tumor regression (when the
      tumor starts to shrink) and prevent the spread of the cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether the combination of
      niraparib and osimertinib is safe and well tolerated and what the best dose of niraparib is
      in participants with EGFR-Mutated Advanced Lung Cancer. The investigators also hope that the
      combination of niraparib and osimertinib will stop the cancer from growing and spreading.

             may enroll with permission of the PI.

          -  The effects of Niraparib on the developing human fetus are unknown but based on its

             woman. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry through 180 days after the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for

                  must be willing to use 2 adequate barrier methods throughout the study, starting
                  with the screening visit through 180 days after the last dose of study treatment.
                  See Section 4.4 for a list of acceptable birth control methods. Information must
                  be captured appropriately within the site's source documents. Note: Abstinence is

             characteristics of the individual therapy, after discussion with the Study PI. For
             investigational therapy, the time frame will not be shortened to less than at least 5
             half-lives of the investigational agent.

             the last treatment prior to planned study treatment. However, small volume palliative
             radiation therapy with no or little bone marrow exposure is allowed at the
             investigator's discretion.

          -  Participants may receive a stable dose of bisphosphonates for bone metastases, before

          -  Participants with symptomatic uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases.
             Participants with brain metastases that have been treated with prior radiation therapy
             and are stable on a subsequent scan are allowed. Participants with untreated possible
             brain metastases that are ≤ 1 cm and asymptomatic are allowed.

          -  Participants who received a transfusion (platelets, red blood cells) or hematopoetic
             growth factors within 4 weeks of study treatment.

             degree heart block.

          -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events
             such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of
             long QT syndrome, or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first degree
             relatives, or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval.

          -  Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung

          -  Participants with known hypersensitivity to the components or excipients of niraparib
             or osimertinib.

          -  Participants may not have received prior treatment with anti-PD1, -PDL1, or -CTLA4
             inhibitors.

          -  Participants with a second, clinically active, malignancy. Participants must not have

          -  Participants must not have current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory
             abnormality (including active or uncontrolled myelosuppression [ie, anemia,
             leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia]) that might confound the results of the
             study or interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study
             treatment or that makes it not in the best interest of the patient to participate in
             the opinion of the investigator or sponsor.

          -  Known disorder affecting gastrointestinal absorption.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children,
             within the projected duration of the study treatment, or for 180 days after the last
             dose of study treatment.

          -  Known HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with Niraparib. In addition, these participants may be at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated, However, HIV testing is not required.
