  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refractive surgeries can be divided into two distinct categories: 1) corneal surgeries
      (superficial and deep procedures) carried on the surface of the eye and 2) lens surgeries
      (phakic IOL, refractive lens exchange) - an intraocular intervention, performed in the
      anterior or posterior chamber or on the lens. In the proposed protocol focus is on the
      corneal refractive surgeries impact on monochromatic higher-order aberrations on the one hand
      and chromatic aberrations on the other. During the surgery in order to get the patient
      emmetropic, refractive surgery corrects optical defects by decreasing aberrations of lower
      orders ) simultaneously increases high-order aberrations (that is perceived by the patient as
      halo, glare or starburst). Informations about prevalence and causes of higher order
      aberrations after refractive surgery are numerous but there is no information about chromatic
      aberrations.
