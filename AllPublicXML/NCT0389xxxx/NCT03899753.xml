    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare two types of wound closure after total shoulder arthroplasty to
      determine which closure is faster, and subsequently if there are different outcomes between
      the two types of closures.

      The objective of this study is to compare two types of wound closure after total shoulder
      arthroplasty procedures. A single fellowship trained shoulder surgeon will perform all
      procedures. It is hypothesized that participants who undergo an 2-Octyl Cyanoacrylate (OCA)
      mesh closure will have a faster closure time, lower cost, non-inferior complication rate, and
      non-inferior satisfaction scores with respect postoperative follow up and scar appearance.

      Participants in the OCA mesh cohort will be compared to participants who have a closure with
      a running monocryl suture and dermabond. This investigation seeks to determine if OCA closure
      mesh closure is non-inferior to monocryl suture and dermabond in terms of operative time,
      cost, complications, and aesthetic appearance.

      If the hypothesis is confirmed, this study will suggest that a OCA mesh closure may be used
      for total shoulder arthroplasty surgeries as an alternative to current conventional closures
      and may provide a cost benefit.

    <description>A stopwatch will be used to measure the time it takes for the incision to be closed. When the surgical implants are in place and irrigation is complete, the surgeon will announce that he will start the closure and a nurse will start the stopwatch to measure how long it takes for the surgeon to close the incision.</description>

    <time_frame>At each follow up visit up to 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The surgeon and participant will fill out the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). This is a survey used to assess the participant and the surgeons opinion of the appearance of the wound. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) is a questionnaire that was developed to assess scar quality. It consists of two separate six-item scales (Observer Scale and Patient Scale), both of which are scored on a 10-point rating scale. Each questionnaire consists of 7 questions, each graded 1 through 10. The minimum score is 7 (most like normal skin) and the maximum score is 70 (very different from normal skin). The observer is the surgeon. The observer and patient scores can then be added together to determine the collective score.</description>

    <measure>Dehiscence</measure>
    <time_frame>At each follow up visit up to 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The wound will be assessed for dehiscence (incision opening) which will be recorded as a &quot;yes or no&quot;. A dehiscence is defined as exposure of the underlying subcutaneous fat secondary to failure of the epidermal healing and may be accompanied by persistent wound drainage. It will be assessed by the length of the opening in centimeters and then normalized against the length of the entire incision. Furthermore, the number of wounds that open will be reported</description>
