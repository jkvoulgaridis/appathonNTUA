  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether breaking up prolonged sitting with short
      regular bouts of walking can reduce blood sugar and cholesterol levels after eating, which
      are risk markers for Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. This study will compare these
      responses in normal weight versus overweight/obese South Asian adults.

      Participants will attend a preliminary testing session where height, weight, body fat and
      waist circumference will be measured. They will be familiarised with a motorised treadmill
      that will be used during the experimental visit below and will take part in an exercise test
      to determine a light-intensity walking speed for the experimental visit.

      Participants will then attend two experimental visits in a random order:

        1. Prolonged sitting: Participants will remain seated for 5 hours and instructed to reduce
           excessive movement.

        2. Breaking up sitting with walking breaks: Participants will rise from the seated position
           every 30 minutes throughout the experimental period to walk on a motorised treadmill at
           a light intensity for 3 minutes. After performing walking activity, they will return to
           the seated position. In addition, blood sample will be taken at the resting position
           just before each physical activity bout. The activity breaks will be undertaken on 9
           occasions, providing a total of 27 min of light intensity activity.

      During each visit, blood pressure will be taken 11 times and blood samples will be taken 10
      times. Participants will be given a breakfast and lunch meal to consume.

    <description>Participants will rise from the seated position every 30 min throughout the experimental period to walk on a motorised treadmill at a light intensity walking (as determined during the preliminary test) for 3 min. Participants will start walk on a treadmill at 30 min (so physical activity would be at 30-33 min), 60 min (physical activity will be at 60-63 min), 90 min (physical activity will be at 90-93 min), 120 min (physical activity will be 120-123 min), 150 min (physical activity will be at 150-153 min ), and 180 min (physical activity will be at 180-183 min) in the breakfast postprandial period and 30 min (physical activity will be 30-33 min), 60 min (physical activity will be at 60-63 min), and 90 min (physical activity will be at 90-93 min) in the lunch postprandial period. After performing walking activity, they will return to the seated position.</description>
