  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is an important disease around the world and the number of diabetic people
      increase every day. The type 1 diabetes often occurred in the youth and people have to learn
      to work with it and its complication. Conversely, diabetic people sometimes have trouble to
      manage their diabetes with working obligation. Actually, French therapeutic education don't
      teach how to reconcile diabetes and work. The study hypothesis is that type 1 diabetic people
      can be helped by therapeutic education in order to reconcile the management of their diabetes
      and their work. This study is a qualitative study. Interviews will help to find the needs of
      the type 1 diabetic patients to reconcile diabetes and work.
