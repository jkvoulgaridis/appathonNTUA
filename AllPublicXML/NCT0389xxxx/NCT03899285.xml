  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder is a common mental disorder and the leading cause of disability
      worldwide. According to the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatment, early
      improvement following an antidepressant treatment is correlated with response and remission.
      Escalation of an antidepressant dose after 2 weeks, as opposed to 4 to 8 weeks, is proposed
      to favor early improvement. However, this has never been tested systematically in a
      controlled study involving major depressive disorder patients that are non-responders to
      their antidepressant treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators sought to assess whether it is feasible to perform a prospective randomized
      controlled double-blind feasibility study with a 2 week run-in period and 3 parallel groups
      randomized controlled study using citalopram. Citalopram has physicochemical properties
      compatible with over-encapsulation and a has a simple titration that allows the study of
      early dose increase.. It is among the most prescribed antidepressant in the province of
      Quebec and at the Hospital Maisonneuve-Rosemont - University family medicine group (U-FMG).

      Since establishment of a randomized controlled trial is complex and expensive, a feasibility
      design is appropriate to identify all the obstacles and to minimize sources of possible bias
      (recruitment, follow up, resources).

    <intervention_model_description>Preparation phase (Phase 1) : Every enrolled patients start with citalopram 10 mg daily for 3 days and 20 mg daily for 11 days.
Escalation phase (Phase 2) :This phase is split in two arms which are the responders and the non-responders. Responders will pursue their citalopram 20 mg for 14 days. Non-responders will be assigned randomly 1:1 in 2 groups. Patients in group A will be randomized to receive a pill of citalopram 20 mg and a capsule of citalopram 20 mg for 14 days. The total dose of citalopram will be 40 mg once daily. Patients in group B receive a pill of citalopram 20 mg and a capsule of placebo (a capsule without medication) for 14 days. The total dose of citalopram will be 20 mg once daily.
Follow-up phase (Phase 3) : Every responders will pursue their treatment of citalopram 20 mg daily for 28 days. It's possible that in this group, the treatment approach may vary depending the physician. Every non-responders (group A and B) will receive 40 mg of citalopram for 28 days.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary outcomes determined by the proportion of non-responders (&lt; 30 % improvement on the MADRS) after 2 weeks of treatment and the proportion of non-responders randomized patients who completed the study.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of treatment was assessed by the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).Threshold for non-responders : &lt; 30 % improvement on the MADRS between T2 and T0. This scale was completed by a trained assessor and measures the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. The scale is in french and has 10 items, with an overall score ranging from 0 to 60 points. Higher score indicates more severe depression.
Criteria for success of the randomization and completion of the study :
Sample size target : 24 non-responders randomized patients
Proportion of non-responders after 2 weeks of treatment (T2) : ≥ 0.45 (number of non-responders after 2 weeks of treatment divided by the number of enrolled patients).
Proportion of non-responders randomized patients who completed the full course of treatment (8 weeks) : ≥ 0.65 (number of non-responders randomized patients who completed the study divided by the total number of enrolled patients).</description>

This scale was completed by a trained assessor and measures the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. The scale is in french and has 10 items, with an overall score ranging from 0 to 60 points. Higher score indicates more severe depression.</description>
