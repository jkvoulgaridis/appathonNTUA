  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that any of 3 modalities of home non- invasive ventilation
      (NIV) compared to 'no NIV' (=hospital NIV) will reduce re-admission to hospital or death in
      COPD patients who remain persistently hypercapnic following an exacerbation requiring NIV.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By 2020, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is expected to be the 3rd leading cause
      of death in the world, especially in countries of middle to high income, like EU. Despite the
      improvements in survival by using acute non- invasive ventilation (NIV) to treat patients
      with exacerbations of COPD complicated by acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF), these
      patients are at high risk of re-admission and further life-threatening events. Furthermore,
      in a recent study of 110 patients who had AHRF (RESCUE study, Struik, Thorax 2014), at one
      year after discharge 65% had another life-threatening event, and 49% had died. New recent
      data suggests that NIV at home can reduce re-admissions (HMV-LTOT, Murphy, JAMA 2017), but in
      a small proportion of patients, and with a high level of expertise. There is an urgent need
      to develop strategies to reduce the number and severity of exacerbations of COPD. With
      healthcare objectives and budget constraints, telemonitoring of COPD patients is an important
      challenge in most European countries. RESCUE2-Monitor is the next step. This European trial
      (currently, France, Spain and Portugal) will test the hypothesis that home NIV, with a highly
      adapted ventilatory strategy (hereafter referred to as 'TARGETED VENTILATION'), compared to
      no home NIV (only hospital NIV), to non-targeted home NIV or to rescue home NIV will reduce
      re-admission to hospital or death in COPD patients, is possible using e-medicine, and will
      reduce costs of health.

    <intervention_model_description>Rescue2-monitor is an open-label, prospective randomized, controlled, superiority clinical trial, performed in patients with hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease post-acute hypercapnic exacerbation. Four arms (distributed between groups at a ratio of 1:1:1:1) will be compared: no home NIV 'hospital NIV' (control group) versus any of 3 modalities of home NIV (experimental groups). The 3 experimental treatments are Nocturnal home NIV 'non-targeted home NIV', Nocturnal home NIV with high monitoring 'targeted home NIV', and 'rescue home NIV'.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Evolution of scores obtained at the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire The SRI consists of seven subscales covering 49 items: Respiratory Complaints (SRI-RC), Physical Functioning (SRI-PF), Attendant Symptoms and Sleep (SRI-AS), Social Relationships (SRI-SR), Anxiety (SRI-AX), Psychological Well-Being (SRI-WB), and Social Functioning (SRI-SF). These seven subscales can be summarised to one Summary Scale (SRI-SS). All items relate to the patients' circumstances of the last week. Rating for each item is provided by a five-point Likert-scale, a scaling method which measures either positive or negative responses to a given statement with five possible grading steps ranging from &quot;strongly agree&quot; to &quot;strongly disagree&quot;. Higher scores are attributed to better Health Related Quality of life.</description>

    <description>Evolution of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score. Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>

The questionnaire asks the subject to rate his or her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 to 3 for eight different situations that most people engage in during their daily lives, though not necessarily every day. The scores for the eight questions are added together to obtain a single number. A number in the 0-9 range is considered to be normal while a number in the 10-24 range indicates that expert medical advice should be sought</description>
