      This study will implement a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT, N=60) to assess the
      feasibility and acceptability a refined emotion regulation intervention designed to improve
      engagement in HIV-care among substance using HIV+ MSM sub-optimally engaged in HIV care.

    <textblock>
      Eligible study participants will be screened and enrolled at Fenway Health (Boston, MA).
      Participants will be randomized to an enhanced treatment as usual (E-TAU) arm or the
      intervention arm. All participants (in both the E-TAU and intervention groups) will receive a
      one-session behavioral engagement in care intervention, substance use treatment referral
      information, and the opportunity to discuss and problem solve barriers to substance use
      treatment with an interventionist, informed by motivational interviewing principles. After
      randomization, participants in the intervention group will attend 5 therapy sessions focused
      on behavioral strategies for improving HIV self-care, meta-cognitive awareness of emotions
      and thoughts, and cognitive restructuring. All participants will receive texts queries about
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and substance use, and participants in the
      intervention group will also receive text queries about mood. All participants will be
      compensated for every research visit and completed text message blocks.
