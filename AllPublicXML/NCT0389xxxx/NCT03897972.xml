    <textblock>
      The proof-of-principle EatWellEUR pilot study will investigate whether online personalised
      dietary advice encourages greater dietary behaviour change after 12 weeks compared with
      general population-based diet advice. Dietary change will be quantified from an 11-item diet
      quality score (DQS) suitable for Northern European populations that is calculated from the
      results of the eNutri food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and week 12.

      The proof-of-principle EatWellEUR pilot study will investigate whether online personalised
      dietary advice encourages greater dietary behaviour change after 12 weeks compared with
      general population-based diet advice. Both groups will receive two prompts to remind them of
      their diet advice at weeks 4 and 8. Dietary change will be quantified from an 11-item diet
      quality score (DQS) suitable for Northern European populations that is calculated from the
      results of the eNutri food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and week 12. 98
      participants will be recruited per study arm and will be randomly allocated to an
      intervention arm using a minimisation technique integrated with the eNutri app.

    <description>Dietary intake at baseline and week 12 will be assessed via the eNutri food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) from which an 11-item eNutri DQS will be calculated. The eNutri DQS was developed for Northern Europe and quantifies diet quality (i.e. the healthiness of a diet). It is composed of 11 food and nutrient components (contributing 10 points each) that are summed to give an overall score (between 0-110 points), where higher scores reflect the healthiest diets based on adherence to dietary recommendations.</description>
