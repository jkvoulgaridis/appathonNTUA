  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suvorexant (trade name Belsomra) is an orexin receptor antagonist that has TGA approval for
      the treatment of insomnia, characterised by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep
      maintenance. It may also have a role in addictions as the orexins play a critical role in
      drug addiction and reward-related behaviours. Orexins appear to be involved in both alcohol
      withdrawal and in alcohol seeking triggered by external cues (eg contexts or stressors)
      through both OX1 and OX2 receptor signalling. Chief investigator, Professor Lawrence was the
      first to demonstrate a role for endogenous orexin signaling in alcohol-seeking. Alcohol is
      known to effect the sleep of healthy and alcohol dependent individuals with effects on
      daytime sleepiness, physiological functions during sleep, and the development of sleep
      disorders. There are various estimates of the co-occurrence of insomnia and alcohol use
      disorder ranging from 36-72%. In alcohol dependent individuals sleep is disturbed both while
      drinking and for months of abstinence and abstinent sleep disturbance is predictive of
      relapse.

      This proposal aims to evaluate the use of suvorexant as a safe and effective pharmacotherapy
      to treat sleep disorders in alcohol dependent patients undergoing acute alcohol withdrawal
      and thereafter for six months. The study will also examine the effectiveness of suvorexant in
      reducing craving for alcohol and promoting duration of abstinence. This will be the first
      double blind controlled trial of suvorexant in the management of the alcohol withdrawal
      syndrome and maintenance of abstinence post withdrawal.

      Study Procedures Baseline On Day 1, prior to commencement of treatment baseline data will be
      collected on demographics, ISI questionnaire plus 2 short questions 1) how many hours sleep
      has the participant had for the past week; 2) how would the participant rate their sleep
      quality in the past week. The investigators will also determine previous drug use history,
      physical examination, urine drug screen and measures of alcohol dependence severity,
      psychological and social functioning (ATOPv7).

      Treatment Period Treatment will begin immediately after collection of Baseline data.
      Suvorexant will not be given if breath alcohol concentration is above zero. Both groups will
      be treated using the St Vincent's Hospital standard protocol for management of alcohol
      withdrawal, in which benzodiazepines are provided as required according to the symptoms
      listed in the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scale (CIWA-Ar). That is,
      if the CIWA-Ar score is &gt; 10 then benzodiazepines (BZD) are administered. Note, BZD will not
      be given for management of insomnia. Physicians involved in patient care, nurses and
      participants will be blinded to treatment assignment. Participants will be monitored for
      signs of adverse events (i.e. distress, significant alcohol withdrawal, and adverse response
      to suvorexant) approximately 4 hourly for the first 24 - 48 hrs of residential stay and then
      according to clinical assessment. All clinical observations will be made by a suitably
      qualified and experienced medical professional. Where any adverse events are observed,
      monitoring will be increased to meet clinical needs and treatment discontinued if required.
      Alcohol withdrawal severity will be assessed using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal
      Assessment - Alcohol revised (CIWA-Ar).

      Note, during in-patient assessment there will be no consumption of alcohol (7-10 days). Upon
      release to outpatients the investigators will advise participants not to consume alcohol and
      will provide follow-up support to help maintain abstinence. If patients resume heavy drinking
      and are deemed to have relapsed i.e. daily alcohol consumption greater than 5 standard drinks
      each day, the investigators will tell them to cease the medication and they will be withdrawn
      from the study. Data collected to this point will be included in the study.

      Follow-up Treatment Subsequent follow-up would occur weekly for 4 weeks post inpatient
      treatment and then every 4 weeks to week 25. Patients will continue the same dose of
      Suvorexant/placebo for the duration of the follow-up period. At the end of the 25 week trial
      patients will continue to receive treatment as usual. If they wish to continue to receive
      suvorexant they can get a prescription from their GP (suvorexant has been added to the
      pharmaceutical benefits scheme).
