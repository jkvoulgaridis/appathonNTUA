    <textblock>
      Postpartum family planning is defined as prevention of unintended pregnancy and closely
      spaced pregnancies during the first 12 months after the child birth postpartum contraceptive
      utilization is important because some women resume ovulation after 28 days postpartum
      inter-pregnancy intervals shorter than 18 to 24 months have been associated with an increased
      risk of fetal and maternal deaths ,35% of children younger than five deaths could be avoided
      if births spaced 36 months
