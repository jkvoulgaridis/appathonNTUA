      Objective: To examine the effect of vitamin D supplements on the pregnancy and clinical
      pregnancy rate in embryo transfer cycles.

      Design: Experimental study with a pre- and post-test. Setting: In Vitro Fertilization Center
      Patients: Its sample consisted of 118 women, 58 in the experimental group and 60 in the
      control group.

      Intervention(s): At the beginning of the infertility treatment, the experimental group took
      vitamin D supplements, and the control group did not. Vitamin D supplementation for infertile
      women includes regulation of a diet rich in vitamin D, educational and motivational
      interviews about insolation, and taking vitamin D orally.

      Main Outcome Measure(s): 25(OH)D and beta HCG levels

    <description>The physicians gave the women in the experimental group vitamin D oral drops in an ampoule of 300,000 IU and a vial of 50,000 IU to take during the IVF treatment. Written and verbal information about how to take vitamin D was provided to the participants by the nurses. The women took 300,000 IU vitamin D orally for the first week. In the second week of the treatment, 50,000 IU vitamin D (15 drops/day) was used as maintenance dose until the pregnancy test day.</description>
