      The aim of this study was to investigate the emergence quality of patients extubated on prone
      or supine position after lumbar spinal surgery.

      60 patients with ASA I-II who underwent lumbar spinal surgery between 18-65 years of age were
      included in the study. Patients with difficult intubation, BMI&gt; 35kg / m2, asthma and
      reactive airway problems, cardiovascular disease and obstructive sleep apnea will not be
      included in the study. Initial data will be recorded after standard monitorization. Induction
      is made by 2 mg / kg propofol, 1 mg / kg fentanyl and 0.5 mg / kg rocuronium will be added
      for muscle relaxation. Patients with adequate muscle relaxation will be intubated with
      appropriate endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation will be initiated. Patients who are
      then given prone positions on the operating table will be supported with side gels. The head
      will be placed in the face gel in a neutral position. For intraoperative analgesia,
      remifentanil infusion at 0.2mcg / kg / min will be applied.

      After laminectomy is completed and control of bleeding, 1 mg / kg Tramalol and 2 mg / kg
      Metaclopromide will be applied to all patients. At the end of the skin stitching, the
      inhalation agent will be closed and the fresh gas will be turned 6 lt 100% O2. Patients who
      want to be extubated in the prone position are left in this position while the other patients
      will be placed on the stretcher in a supine position for a short time. Patients will be
      decurarized be neostigmin with atropine. Extubation will be performed in both positions when
      spontanous ventilation begins at a tidal volume of 6ml / kg and a frequency of 12-20 / min.
      All the measures will be taken to ensure airway safety while the patient is extubated pron.
      The stretcher will be brought to the side of the operating table, investigator will be ready
      for reintubation and all the necessary persons will be with the patient. Aspiration frequency
      will be recorded for each patient. During recovery after extubation, the severity of cough
      will be evaluated as mild (only once), less (more than one but not continuous) and severe
      (continuously for 5 seconds). Aldrate scores of patient will be recorded and first 9-10 time
      is estimated from extubation time. Vomiting, nausea, respiratory insufficiency, inability to
      control the airway and obvious desaturation if seen are also recorded.
