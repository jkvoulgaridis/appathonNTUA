  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to increase safe medication storage practices in homes with young
      children in order to prevent unintentional childhood poisonings.

      As a step toward meeting this goal, this study aims to determine if an intervention to
      promote safe storage to patients who have young children in their home, including provision
      of a lock box or lock bag along with brief counseling versus brief counseling alone, results
      in 1) increased locked storage (and overall safe medication storage practices) of high-risk
      prescription medications in the home; 2) increased safe medication storage practices of other
      medications in the home; and 3) improved safe medication storage related knowledge and
      attitudes.
