      Group/cohort:

      Uterine artery ligation (UAL) Investigators would like to invite the patients to the hospital
      at least 6 months after surgery who underwent only uterine artery ligation performed due to
      uterine atony during C-section.

      Participants would be evaluated for their ovarian reserve via hormones and antral follicle
      count (AFC)

      Control Group:

      Investigators would like to invite the patients to the hospital at least 6 months after
      C-section who delivered baby without any complication.

      Participants would be also evaluated for their ovarian reserve via hormones and antral
      follicle count (AFC)
