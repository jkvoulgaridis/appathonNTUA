  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The activity of thyroid orbitopathy can be evaluated with CAS (Clinical Activity
      Score) based on 7 inflammatory signs. Selenium acts as an oxide-reducing agent in
      thioredoxin-reductase, and as an anti-inflammatory agent by reducing the hydroxy peroxide
      intermediates on the cyclo-oxygenase pathways. Increased oxidative stress has been observed
      in Graves' disease and therefore, by incorporating an antioxidant such as selenium in
      patients with mild thyroid ophthalmopathy, inflammatory activity could be reduced or
      inactivated.

      General Objective: To determine the clinical differences between patients with mild thyroid
      orbitopathy who were administered oral supplementation with selenium and patients who were
      administered oral placebo.

      This is a simple controlled clinical trial. In which 66 eyes of 33 patients were studied.
      Fifteen patients were assigned to the placebo group and 18 to the Selenium group. We
      randomized into two groups the patients with mild clinical activity according to CAS score.
      Group A took placebo pills twice a day which consisted in 100µg of starch, and Group B took a
      pill of Selenium 100 µg twice a day. All the subjects tool the pills during six months.
      Patients of both groups where examined and evaluated with CAS score before and after the
      first, third and sixth month of treatment.

    <description>Clinical Activity Score (CAS) scale consists of 7 measurements used to evaluate clinical activity of thyroid orbitopathy:
Spontaneus orbital pain
Gaze evoked orbital pain
Conjunctival redness that is considered to be due to active GO
Eyelid erythema
Chemosis
Eyelid swelling that is considered to be due to active GO
