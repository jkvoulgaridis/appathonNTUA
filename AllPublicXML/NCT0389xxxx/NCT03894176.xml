    <textblock>
      335 of patients with STEMI treated by primary PCI were assayed for PTX3 measurement by ELISA
      method using human PTX3 kit. Blood was drawn at the emergency department before primary PCI.
      The angiographic and clinical outcomes were evaluated and analyzed according to the PTX3
      concentration. The angiographic outcome were thrombus grade on initial angiogram and final
      TIMI flow. The clinical outcome were ECG resolution after primary PCI and all-cause death at
      30 days. The plasma PTX3 concentration was then compared based on the outcomes.
