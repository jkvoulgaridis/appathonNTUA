  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of chronic subjective tinnitus is rising with age and associated with maladaptive
      oscillatory changes in auditory as well as non-auditory regions of the brain such as the
      insula and the anterior cingulate cortex which are known to be key points within the salience
      and distress networks of the brain.Thus, we are conducting a clinical trial by implementing
      those auditory as well as non-auditory regions into a tomographical neurofeedback Training
      (ToNF) -protocol.

      Prior to 12 electroencephalography (EEG) -based ToNF-trainings with 36 older participants
      using standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography Software (sLORETA,
      Pascual-Marqui 2002), participants' brains will be measured using structural magnet resonance
      imaging (sMRI) in order to identify potential structural markers for training success (e.g.
      cortical thickness).

      Training success will be measured by oscillatory change via EEG before and after the training
      period as well as by means of follow-up measures. Furthermore, a comprehensive battery of
      behavioral and psychometric standardized self-report questionnaires will be applied.

      Based on this multifocal (Insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex &amp; auditory cortex) ToNF we
      expect oscillatory changes resulting in decreased tinnitus symptoms such as perceived
      loudness and distress.

    <description>Within each training session, participants will receive 7 minutes training for each of the three brain areas Insula (I), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) &amp; the auditory cortex (AC) resulting in 21Minutes of training for each session. The arm Title describes the order in which participants within this Arm will receive the three trainings. (E.g. dACC,I,AC: each participant in this group receives the training of the dACC first and the AC last.) This sequence order is kept stable during all training sessions.
