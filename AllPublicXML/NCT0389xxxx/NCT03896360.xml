  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators have previously shown that eating carbohydrates after protein or vegetables
      resulted in reduced glucose and insulin excursions over 180 min in patients with T2DM and in
      individuals with prediabetes as well. This is an open label, randomized controlled pilot
      study to assess the efficacy of carbohydrate-last food order behavior in reducing the risk of
      progression to type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive diet and lifestyle modifications have been shown to reduce the risk of progression
      to T2DM in several randomized controlled trials. Key components of standard nutritional
      counseling include reducing calorie intake and glycemic load. Sequential nutrient ingestion
      is a novel strategy found to attenuate the glycemic effect of a meal. Investigators have
      previously shown that ingestion of carbohydrates after protein or vegetables results in
      reduced glucose and insulin excursions over 180 min in patients with T2DM. In addition,
      investigators also found that levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin were more suppressed at
      the end of 3 hours after a meal. Furthermore, investigators found that the glycemic effects
      of food order apply to individuals with prediabetes as well. This study follows previous
      research on nutrient order and seeks to determine the metabolic effects of this behavioral
      intervention in the real world. The study will include two randomized groups who are
      overweight or obese and are diagnosed with prediabetes. The control group will receive
      standard nutritional counseling at the start of the study and no instructions to change food
      order behavior. The intervention group will receive regularly scheduled food order counseling
      over a period of 16 weeks in addition to standard nutritional counseling at baseline.
      Anthropometric and metabolic parameters, including insulin sensitivity, will be assessed at
      baseline and at 16 weeks. The primary aim of this study is to determine the proportion of
      subjects who achieve reversal of prediabetes at study completion and/ or who achieve a 0.2%
      reduction in hemoglobin A1c. If shown to be effective, this data will inform the design of
      larger study focused on diabetes prevention.
