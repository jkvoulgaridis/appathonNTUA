  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the results of the research team's cross-sectional study conducted in 2014
      describing insufficient gynecological care, the research team implemented an on-site
      gynecological consultation in the adult Cystic Fibrosis (CF) centre in 2015. The study aimed
      to compare the results of two surveys conducted successively in 2014 and in 2017 on a cohort
      of women with CF attending the Lyon CF adult referral centre. All the women attending the
      adult CF center in 2017 were asked to complete the same self-report written questionnaire
      that was completed in 2014 about their contraceptive choices, gynecological follow-up and
      cervical screening. Questions concerning gynecological comorbidities were added to the 2017
      questionnaire.

      This current study aimed to evaluate the impact of the implementation of an on-site
      gynecological consultation on gynecological health of women with CF, as measured through 3
      indicators: the proportion of women with regular gynecological follow-up, cervical screening
      coverage, and contraceptive coverage. The identification of specific gynecological
      comorbidities was the other objective of this study.

    <description>Patient questionnaire filled-out in presence of clinical nurse. Gynecological options and contraceptive choices were recorded. Close-ended questions used (&quot;yes/no&quot;): contraception use; contraceptive pill use; contraceptive implant; intrauterine device; tubal sterilization; mechanical contraception; other type of contraception use; previous term delivery; gynecological follow-up; previous Pap smear. If &quot;Yes&quot; was noted, more details were requested (contraception name, delivery date, gynecological follow-up frequency, last Pap smear date).
Other gynecological history and management data not included in the 2014 questionnaire: age at first menstruation, menstrual cycle regularity without hormonal contraception, age at menopause, previous human papilloma virus vaccination, recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, urinary incontinence, fertility/infertility data, and infertility treatment with assisted reproductive technologies. Results were compared with those obtained in 2014 (121 women).</description>
