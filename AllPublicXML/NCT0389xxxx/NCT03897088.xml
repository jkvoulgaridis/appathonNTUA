          9. Subjects must have results of a physical examination within normal limits or
             clinically acceptable limits to the Investigator prior to Day 1. The Investigator is
             encouraged to consult with the Medical Monitor (or appropriate designee) if there are
             questions regarding the significance of any out-of-range values.

         10. Subjects must be capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 2,

          2. Subjects who have predominantly non-plaque forms of psoriasis specifically
             erythrodermic psoriasis, predominantly pustular psoriasis, medication-induced or
             medication-exacerbated psoriasis, or new-onset guttate psoriasis.

             be capped at 40% and the analysis will be stratified based on prior use of these
             biologics.

             Sponsor/designee staff directly involved with this study.

         11. Subjects who have any concomitant medical condition which in the opinion of the
             Investigator could affect the study outcome or present an unacceptable risk.

         12. Subjects who were hospitalized due to an acute cardiovascular event (such as
             myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, cardiovascular illness [eg, angina
             pectoris], or cardiovascular surgery [such as coronary artery bypass grafting]) within
             6 months before Screening.

         13. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not be a reliable participant

             positive response in the behavioral section of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating
             Scale

         16. Subjects with any other clinically significant laboratory abnormality, which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, will prevent the subject from completing the study or
             will interfere with the interpretation of the study results.
