        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each Subject must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Males and females ≥40 to &lt;80 years of age.

          2. Subject is able to read, understand, and sign a written Informed Consent in order to
             participate in the study.

          3. Subject has a diagnosis of CB and COPD and has been symptomatic for a minimum of two
             years. (Chronic Bronchitis is defined clinically as chronic productive cough for 3
             months in each of 2 successive years in a patient in whom other causes of productive
             cough have been excluded).

          4. Subject is classified as having moderate or severe (GOLD stage 2-3) airflow
             obstruction defined by a post-bronchodilator of =&gt;30% FEV1 to &lt;80% predicted with a
             baseline FEV1/FVC of &lt;0.70.

          5. Subject has a COPD assessment tool (CAT) score of ≥10.

          6. Subject is being treated according to current medically accepted treatment guidelines
             without successful resolution of chronic bronchitis and agrees to continue maintenance
             pulmonary/COPD medications (as defined per GOLD Standard for medications) for the
             duration of the study (subject must be on a regime of pulmonary medications for a
             minimum of 2 weeks prior to enrolment into the study).

          7. Smoking history of at least 10 pack years.

          8. Non-smoking for a minimum of 2 months prior to consent and agrees to continue not
             smoking for the duration of the study.

          9. Subject is able to adhere to and undergo 4 bronchoscopic procedures (5 for control
             subjects accepting cross over option), in the opinion of the investigator or per
             hospital guidelines.

         10. For women of childbearing potential: non-pregnant, non-lactating, and agree to
             practice an adequate birth control method (abstinence, combination barrier and
             spermicide, or hormonal) for the duration of the study.

             thermoplasty, rheoplasty or cryotherapy.

         11. Subject has had a prior lung device procedure, including emphysema stent(s) implanted,
             lung coils, valves, lung denervation or other devices for emphysema.

         12. Subject is unable to temporarily discontinue use of anticoagulant therapy: warfarin,
             Coumadin, LMWH, heparin, clopidrogel (or equal).

         13. Subject has a serious medical condition, such as: uncontrolled coagulopathy or
             bleeding disorder, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina, myocardial
             infarction in the past year, renal failure, liver disease, cerebrovascular accident
             within the past 6 months, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, autoimmune
             disease or uncontrolled gastric reflux.

         14. Subject has or is receiving chemotherapy or active radiation therapy within the past 6
             months or is expected to receive chemotherapy during participation in this study.
