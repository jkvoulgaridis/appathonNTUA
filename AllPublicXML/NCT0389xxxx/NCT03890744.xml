    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase IIa study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
      ModraDoc006 in combination with ritonavir (denoted ModraDoc006/r) in patients with recurrent
      or metastatic HER-2 negative breast cancer, that are suitable for treatment with a taxane as
      1st-3rd line of therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa, multicentre, two-stage, single-arm, clinical study with the primary
      objective is to determine the efficacy of ModraDoc006 in combination with ritonavir (denoted
      ModraDoc006/r) in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER-2 negative breast cancer, as
      measured by RECIST v1.1 criteria of objective response rate (ORR). To this aim, a Simon
      two-stage minimax design will be used, in which 14 evaluable patients will be treated in the
      first stage (Stage A). If 0 or ≥ 2 objective responses at week 8 (with confirmation at week
      12) are observed in Stage A, no further patients will be enrolled. If 1 objective response is
      observed, an additional 10 patients with recurrent or metastatic HER-2 negative breast cancer
      will be included in the second stage (Stage B).

      All patients will be treated with ModraDoc006/r, given as oral tablets twice daily once
      weekly (BIDW).

      Patients will be radiologically assessed at week 8 and 12 by CT scan (or MRI if CT is
      contraindicated), and may continue to receive study medication with ongoing radiological
      scans every 6 weeks until disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1), unacceptable
      toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason.

      Furthermore, the safety and tolerability of ModraDoc006/r in the target population will be
      assessed. Additionally, as metastatic breast cancer may occur at older age, often coinciding
      with other non-malignant diseases and co-medications, this protocol investigates whether
      ModraDoc006/r can be applied safely in these (frail) patients.

             anticonvulsant therapy for at least 6 weeks are allowed to enrol. Radiotherapy for
             brain metastasis must have been completed at least 6 weeks prior to start of study
             treatment. Brain metastasis must be stable with verification by imaging (e.g. brain
             MRI or CT completed at screening, demonstrating no current evidence of progressive
             brain metastases). Patients are not permitted to receive anti-epileptic drugs or

             presence of a permanent peritoneal drain in the past 4 weeks prior to first dose of
             ModraDoc006/r. Enrolment in patients with peritonitis carcinomatosa and malignant
             ascites is allowed if there is no clinical and/or radiological known or suspected
             motility disorder within the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of ModraDoc006/r

         17. Concomitant use of MDR, MRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and CYP3A modulating drugs such as Ca+-
             entry blockers (verapamil, dihydropyridines), cyclosporine, quinidine, and grapefruit
             juice, concomitant use of HIV medications, other protease inhibitors, (non) nucleoside
             analogues, or St. John's wort (see section 5.8). These need to have been stopped at
             least 5 times the terminal half-life (according to Summary of Product Characteristics
             (SPC)) or 7 days, whichever is longest, in order to prevent interaction with the drug.
             Tamoxifen and megestrol need to be stopped only 1 week prior to start of the first
             dose of ModraDoc006/r
