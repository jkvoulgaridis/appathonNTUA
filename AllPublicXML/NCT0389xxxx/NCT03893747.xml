      This study evaluates three batches consistency, immunity duration and safety of inactivated
      Enterovirus 71(EV-A71) vaccine(vero cell) post-marketing among children aged 6-35months in
      China.3000 subjects will be recruited in this study, of who 1500 subjects will be randomly
      assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive one of the three batches of EV-A71 vaccines
      manufactured by 40L capacity reactor, other 1500 subjects will be randomly assigned in a
      ratio of 1:1:1 to receive one of the three batches of EV-A71 vaccines manufactured by 150L
      capacity reactor. Vaccine wil be administrated according to a two doses of schedule given at
      day 0 and 28. Sample will be collected at day 0, day 56 and at month 13 after vaccinaiton.
