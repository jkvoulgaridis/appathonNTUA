      The goal of this research investigation is to conduct a prospective observation of the
      comparative efficacy of midazolam versus olanzapine for the treatment of acute
      undifferentiated agitation in the emergency department.

      In the summer of 2017, the ED implemented a treatment protocol as a quality improvement
      initiative. The investigators performed observational research on this protocol and
      identified that haloperidol and ziprasidone were inferior to midazolam and olanzapine for
      treating agitation in our Department.

      The comparison between olanzapine and midazolam, however, was inconclusive. It is possible
      that this is due to inadequate power, so the question of whether olanzapine or midazolam is
      superior is still unknown.

      Because the department continues to strive to achieve the best care for this patient
      population, in the Summer of 2018 the ED is going to initiate a second ED treatment protocol
      of olanzapine and midazolam, based on the results of our 2017 protocol.

      All patients requiring chemical sedation for will receive olanzapine as the initial treatment
      for agitation for 6 weeks, followed by midazolam as the initial treatment for agitation for 6
      weeks. These patients will be observed by research staff.

      This is a clinical care quality improvement protocol. The clinical protocol is not research.
      The research component is the observation of this clinical care protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Emergency Department patients

          -  Patients 18 years and older

          -  Patients with acute undifferentiated agitation requiring chemical sedation at the
             discretion of the attending emergency physician will be observed.

        Patients meeting these criteria who receive medications in the ED will be observed by
        research staff, evaluating efficacy and safety of the administered medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - There are no exclusion criteria per se as this is only observational research. The
        decision to administer the medication is at the discretion of the physician. Research
        protocols are only such that we are observing the efficacy and safety, which coincides the
        quality improvement purposes of this clinical protocol. Patients will be provided an
        Information Sheet and can opt to have their data removed.

        Patients who are prisoners, children, will NOT have their data collected
