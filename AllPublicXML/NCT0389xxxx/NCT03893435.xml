  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sacubitril/Valsartan (SAC/VAL) is a new treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) recently
      indicated as class I, level of evidence B in the recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
      guidelines 2016 of CHF. PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated a significant improvement of morbidity
      and mortality with SAC/VAL in comparison to enalapril. So far, no data available about the
      effect of usage of SAC/VAL post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) except in animal
      experimental models.

      The purpose of the research is evaluation of the effects of SAC/VAL in post-AMI in comparison
      to the traditional Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEs inhibitors) or Angiotensin
      II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) in a real-life clinical trial in treatment of post-AMI patients
      with reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function.

      Background and study rationale:

      Sacubitril/Valsartan (SAC/VAL) is now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and also, recently indicated as
      class I indication, level of evidence B in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
      guidelines 2016 on congestive heart failure (CHF).(1) PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated that
      morbidity and mortality can be improved with SAC/VAL In comparison to enalapril, it reduced
      the occurrence of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for CHF by 20% with a 16% reduction
      in all-cause mortality.(2) So far, no available data about the effect of usage of SAC/VAL in
      post-AMI except in animal experimental models that proved efficacy of SAC/VAL in preventing
      AMI-induced LV dysfunction compared with SAC/VAL, also significantly attenuated LV scar size
      following AMI compared with placebo .(3)

      Aim of the work:

        -  This study aims to investigate the effects of SAC/VAL in post-AMI through using it
           instead of conventional Angiotensin Converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs inhibitors) or
           Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) in treatment of post-AMI patients with reduced
           left ventricular (LV) systolic function.

        -  Design: Randomized open label interventional clinical trial.
