  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving cessation outcomes for African American smokers through the use of novel,
      empirically-based strategies is a national health priority. In the vast majority of smoking
      cessation studies and in clinical practice, when smokers are provided a medication to help
      them quit, they are expected to continue that medication regardless of how well it is
      working. This study will assess whether African Americans smokers respond better if they
      continue with a single treatment or if their treatment is changed when that treatment is not
      working.

      The objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of optimized (OPT) versus enhanced
      usual care (UC) treatment for smoking cessation. African American smokers randomized to OPT
      (n=196) will receive high intensity smoking cessation counseling, nicotine patch (NP), and up
      to two pharmacotherapy optimizations [varenicline (VAR), bupropion (BUP) plus NP, ] based on
      verified smoking status at Weeks 2 and 6. African American smokers randomized to enhanced UC
      (n=196) will receive the same high intensity counseling and NP with no optimizations in
      pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy and counseling in both groups will last for 18 weeks with
      long-term follow-up through Week 26. The primary outcome is biochemically-verified smoking
      status at Week 12.
