  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry follows patients undergoing two methods of aortic heart valve replacement in
      adults aged 18-60, the Ross procedure or conventional aortic valve replacement using a
      biologic or mechanical heart valve. The Ross procedure replaces a patient's diseased aortic
      valve with his/her own pulmonary valve and uses a donor valve in the pulmonary position which
      receives less stress than the aortic valve. Mechanical valves tend to form blood clots so
      they need long-term blood thinners that increase risk of bleeding and lower quality of life.
      Animal tissue valves reduce clotting and bleeding risks but wear out sooner and shorten
      patient life-span. The REVIVAL Registry will run in parallel with the REVIVAL randomized
      trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart valves help control blood flow through the heart and, if diseased, may need to be
      replaced. After having a heart valve replaced, patients have a higher risk of death than
      people who have not had a valve replaced. In young adult patients, replacing the aortic heart
      valve with a mechanical valve halves their life-span compared to other people their age.
      Mechanical valves tend to form blood clots so they need long-term blood thinners that
      increase risk of bleeding and lower quality of life. Animal tissue valves reduce clotting and
      bleeding risks but wear out sooner and shorten patient life-span. An operation, called the
      Ross procedure, replaces a patient's diseased aortic valve with his/her own pulmonary valve
      and uses a donor valve in the pulmonary position which receives less stress than the aortic
      valve. The Ross procedure aims to improve valve durability with less clotting, avoiding use
      of blood thinners. Patients and physicians need a large, high-quality study comparing the
      Ross procedure and standard valve replacement to know if either approach is better. In
      parallel to the REVIVAL Registry, a REVIVAL Randomized Trial will also take place.

      Patients included in randomized trials often systematically differ from those who are not. By
      creating a registry of patients who are eligible for but not recruited into the REVIVAL
      trial, the investigators will better understand: 1) the reasons for not including these
      patients; 2) how those patients differ in terms of baseline characteristics from the trial
      cohort; 3) whether the outcomes of registry participants differ from those in the trial,
      assessed by treatment group. The registry will aid in understanding the generalizability of
      the results that the trial produces.

    <description>Evaluate the frequency of REVIVAL trial outcomes among registry participants.
The primary outcome is the rate of survival free of life-threatening valve-related complications (major bleeding, stroke or systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, and operated-on valve reintervention) over duration of follow-up. Assessment of this composite over time is particularly important, as the Ross procedure may show initial benefit secondary to thromboembolic and bleeding reduction, however should the technique show high late rates of reoperation as suggested in some observational literature, the effect magnitude may change significantly over time.</description>

Stroke is acute focal brain dysfunction due to a vascular cause lasting ≥ 24 hrs in the absence of brain imaging or requires evidence of acute stroke on brain imaging. Stroke is divided into 3 types: ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and undetermined stroke. If death occurs within 24 hours, the neurological deficit must persist up to the time of death.
Systemic arterial embolism is an abrupt vascular insufficiency associated with evidence of arterial occlusion in the absence of other likely mechanisms. Clinical signs/symptoms must be consistent with embolic arterial occlusion, there must be clear evidence of abrupt occlusion of a systemic artery, with at least one type of supporting evidence (surgical report indicating evidence of arterial embolism, pathological specimens related to embolism removal, imaging evidence consistent with arterial embolism, or autopsy report).</description>

Valve thrombosis is defined as any thrombus not caused by infection attached to or near an operated valve that occludes part of the blood flow path, interferes with valve function, or is large enough to warrant treatment. Valve thrombus found at autopsy in a patient whose cause of death was not valve related or found at operation for and unrelated indication is to be counted as valve thrombosis.</description>

    <description>Evaluate the frequency of REVIVAL trial outcomes among REVIVAL registry participants.
The 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) is a health related quality of life questionnaire that measure eight health domains and each survey provides psychometrically-based physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. The domains are physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. The questionnaire is calibrated such that scored values of 50 represent the norm and higher scored values according to the scoring key represent a more favourable health state. A baseline score will be obtained prior to the patient's surgery and the SF-36 will be administered annually thereafter over the duration of patient follow-up.</description>
