    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalation study designed to define the maximum tolerable dose(MDT),
      the safety profile, pharmacokinetic parameters, immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity of
      F0002-ADC in Chinese patients with relapsed/refractory CD30-positive hematologic
      malignancies.
