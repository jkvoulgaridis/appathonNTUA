  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective cohort study that will recruit a diverse sample of 84
      participants with newly diagnosed with unresectable, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      at the UT Health Cancer Center in San Antonio. This study uses geriatric assessment tools
      with participants 65 years and older and collects adverse events and exploratory markers of
      aging for all participants.

  <detailed_description>

      The results from this study will allow us to identify unique disease characteristics of older
      participants and to study treatment patterns that may be barriers to treatment and risk
      factors for increased morbidity. Characteristics of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment will
      be obtained prior to standard interventional treatment for participants that are 65 years or
      older. Observations will be made of treatment toxicities and cellular senescence with
      treatment outcomes. Findings from this study will result in the development of R01
      intervention studies that develop and validate a treatment algorithm based on these
      associations to provide older adults with a personalized treatment plan.
