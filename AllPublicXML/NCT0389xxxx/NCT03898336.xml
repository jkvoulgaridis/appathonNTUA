  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impulsivity is a cross-disorder symptom domain which affects a significant proportion of
      adolescents.

      Predominately as part of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but also as symptom
      domain without a diagnosis of ADHD, impulsivity causes serious burden. Furthermore, treatment
      options and their effects are limited.

      Previous studies with different study designs assessing micronutrients for the treatment of
      impulsivity / ADHD in children and adults have reported positive benefits as well as a very
      good tolerability. However, more research is required; in particular controlled studies with
      adolescents, cross-disorder approaches and studies investigating long-term effects are
      missing.

      The focus of this study is to investigate the effect of micronutrients on impulsivity and
      compulsivity in children and adolescents between 10 and 18 years of age with a high level of
      impulsivity with or without a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

      The investigators intend to include 180 children and adolescents (n=110 in Germany) with a
      high level of impulsivity.

      The study is divided in two phases. An initial 10-week double blind, placebo-controlled
      treatment phase with broad-spectrum micronutrients is followed by a 10-week open-label
      treatment phase. The study assessments will be performed during five study visits and a
      follow-up visit.

    <description>The primary objective is to investigate the double-blind placebo controlled (10 weeks) effects of broad-spectrum micronutrients in highly impulsive children and adolescents (10-18 years; N=180 in total) with a high level of impulsivity with or without diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The primary outcome measure is the response rate at the end of the placebo-controlled phase. Response is defined as a Clinical Global Impression - Improvement score (CGI-I, Guy 1976; NIMH 1985) with a focus on impulsivity of 1 or 2 [=very much improved or much improved] plus a reduction in the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI, parent-rated, Stringaris et al. 2012) total score of at least 30% compared to baseline.</description>
