    <textblock>
      This trial studies photoacoustic imaging of the breast in patients with breast cancer and
      healthy subjects. Dense breasts typically reduce the sensitivity of a mammography and also is
      associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Photoacoustic tomography combines light and
      sound to provide more information about breast tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify photoacoustic features of breast malignancy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo photoacoustic imaging of the breast over 30 minutes. At subject's
      discretion, imaging may repeat for a total of 10 studies, each in a separate day.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with clinically suspicious or confirmed breast cancer masses (that have not been
             surgically removed) and will/have already undergo/undergone breast magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women (there are no known risks to these procedures, but any unforeseen risks
             are as yet undetermined, so pregnant women will be excluded by means of a verbal
             confirmation at time of screening).

          -  Women who have had breast implants in the previous 6 months.

          -  Women who have had lumpectomy or are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Adults unable to consent.

          -  Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers).

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Prisoners.

          -  There is no direct benefit of the study to any subject either non-English or English
             speaker. To facilitate the consent process, we will exclude non-English speaking
             subjects.
