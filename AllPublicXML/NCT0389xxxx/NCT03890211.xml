  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia contributes to a significant portion of neonatal deaths. Kangaroo Mother Care
      (KMC) is a safe and effective method of warming; however, it is not always feasible, for
      example in settings such as resuscitation or clinical instability. Electric warmers are the
      standard of care in developed countries, but are extremely costly, complicated with risk of
      causing both hypo and hyperthermia with misuse, and often not reliable in settings without
      stable electricity. After two encouraging pilot studies totaling 204 uses in 2 district
      hospitals and 4 health centers in rural Rwanda, the investigators aim to further study the
      warmer in a stepped wedge prospective controlled trial in hospital setting to assess safety
      and efficacy of the Infant Warmer based on clinical observation and feasibility based on
      observer audits.

      Hypothermia contributes to a significant portion of neonatal deaths. Kangaroo Mother Care
      (KMC) is a safe and effective method of warming; however, it is not always feasible, for
      example in settings such as resuscitation or clinical instability. Electric warmers are the
      standard of care in developed countries, but are extremely costly, complicated with risk of
      causing both hypo and hyperthermia with misuse, and often not reliable in settings without
      stable electricity. The Infant Warmer the investigators propose to study has previously been
      tested in 2 pilot studies totaling 204 uses, occurring in 2 district hospitals and 4 health
      centers in rural Rwanda.

      The combined results of these pilot studies were extremely encouraging. This study will be a
      stepped wedge prospective controlled trial in hospital setting to assess safety and efficacy
      of the Infant Warmer based on clinical observation, and feasibility based on observer audits.
      A total of 10 district hospitals will participate in the study. All 10 hospitals will start
      with a 2 week period of observation in which &quot;pre&quot; data will be collected. Hospitals will
      then receive the warmer and be transitioned to the &quot;post&quot; period at a rate of one every two
      weeks. The primary study aim is to assess the safety, efficacy and feasibility of the Infant
      Warmer as an addition to KMC, and to achieve and maintain euthermia when KMC is inadequate or
      unavailable. The study will be conducted across a wide range of district hospitals with
      control data coming from pre-intervention period and treatment data coming from post
      intervention period, with the intervention being the introduction of the Infant Warmer.

    <measure>Ability to regulate infant body temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The infant warmer will be evaluated on its ability to achieve and maintain a normal body temperature for patients who are hypothermic and those patients at risk of hypothermia because of a &lt; 2.5 kg birth weight or &lt; 35 week gestational age. Infants temperature will be measured, using a thermometer to ensure the body temperature will increase but not exceed 37.5°C.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events as assessed by staff observation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess the safety of the infant warmer by observing any adverse reactions such as skin irritations or higher than usual patient temperature (&gt;37.5°C). The safety of the warmer will be measured by study staff observation, measuring the temperature of the warmer with a thermistor instrument, measuring the infant's temperature with a thermometer, as well an investigator-developed Observer Audit Form. The Observer Audit Form is a battery of nine questions which includes eight yes/no questions and one free response. The questions evaluate such topics as whether the warmer was cleaned, the infant was positioned correctly, if adverse events were present, etc.</description>

    <measure>Studying the practicality of applying the device in a clinical setting</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use observation to evaluate the usability of the warmer by assessing the way that the infant is placed on the warmer and any adverse effects of infant warmer use. This will be measured by study staff observation as well an investigator-developed Observer Audit Form. The Observer Audit Form is a battery of nine questions which includes eight yes/no questions and one free response. The questions evaluate such topics as whether the warmer was cleaned, the infant was positioned correctly, if adverse events were present, etc.</description>

    <measure>Functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The functionality will be assessed by the way that the warmer is prepared and cleaned, as well as any wear and tear on the warmer based on repeated use. Functionality will be measured by study staff observation as well an investigator-developed Observer Audit Form. The Observer Audit Form is a battery of eight questions which includes seven yes/no questions and one free response. The questions evaluate such topics as whether the warmer was cleaned, the infant was positioned correctly, if adverse events were present, etc.</description>

    <description>In line with current recommended practice, the mother will be encouraged to provide KMC whenever possible. For hypothermic infants, if the temperature is not rising by ½°C per hour with KMC alone, the Infant Warmer will be offered as an addition. In these cases, the heat will be provided by placing the Infant Warmer over the infant's back while the mother provides KMC. If the mother is not available for KMC at any time, the infant will be warmed exclusively with the Infant Warmer by being placed directly on the warmer as it lies flat. Use of hat and socks will be encouraged by additional clothes will only be added in addition to the warmer per caregiver request, as it reduces heat transfer.</description>
