  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, open label, two stage study will be conducted in several medical centers
      around Taiwan. Stage one determine safety and tolerability in patients with HCC, and stage
      two assess anti-tumor activities of GT90001 in combination with nivolumab in patients with
      metastatic HCC. Subjects who fulfill all the entry criteria and have written informed consent
      will be enrolled to the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on published and first-hand experience with the safety and tolerability of both GT90001
      and nivolumab, the proposed dose is GT90001 7 mg/kg in combination with nivolumb 3 mg/kg.
      Nivolumab will first be administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes, then 30 minutes
      later, give GT90001 intravenous infusion for 1 hour. All participants will receive GT90001 +
      Nivolumab until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or loss of clinical benefit as
      determined by the investigator.The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety
      and tolerability of GT90001 in combination with nivolumab in subjects with advanced and or
      metastatic HCC who were progressed on or were intolerant of first-line and/or second-line
      systemic therapy. The secondary objectives will be to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy and
      the PK profile of this combination therapy.
