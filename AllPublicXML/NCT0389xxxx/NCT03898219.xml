  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, few cases of relapse in adulthood are described in the literature except in
      patients with sickle cell disease and the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological
      features and the management of osteomyelitis relapsing in adulthood are not described. The
      aim of this retrospective multicentric cohort study : in France is to describe the
      epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features and the management of adult
      patients who experienced a relapse between 2003-2015 of an acute hematogenous osteomyelitis
      acquired in the childhood (description of characterization of the period between the first
      episode of osteomyelitis and the second episode, description of signs of relapse and
      description of treatments used in the relapse). The data are analysed with non-comparative
      descriptive statistics.
