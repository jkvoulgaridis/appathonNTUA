    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea(OSA) is characterized by multiple episodes of upper airway collapse
      during sleep and considered as a major health issue worldwide due to comorbidity with
      obesity, hypertension, diabetes and more advanced cardiovascular diseases. The noisy sounds
      of snoring caused by OSA bother bed partner sleepless and lead to long-term health problems.
      Mobile snore applications are convenient and accessible for patients to monitor the progress
      of OSA by themselves, but there are no reliable PSG-validated applications.
