  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nitric oxide supplementation product, Neo40 Daily®, provides a dietary source of No2-.
      The product also allows for robust No2-reduction to NO from the extremely potent
      nitrite-reducing capacity of the polyphenols found in Hawthorne berry.(Bartsch et al., 1993)
      Neo40 Daily® is a unique product since it provides the dietary source of No2-, as well as the
      rate limiting No2- reduction activity.

      Neo40 Daily® facilitates both endothelial dependent and independent NO production. The acute
      effects of Neo40 Daily® have been demonstrated in hypertensive patients.(Zand et al., 2011)
      Within 30 minutes following a single dose of the Neo40 Daily®, a significant reduction in
      systolic/diastolic BP and vascular compliance was observed, as well as, 4 hours following
      treatment, a significant improvement in endothelial function was seen. Furthermore, it has
      been used in longer term clinical trials to show elevated plasma levels of No3• and No2·,
      indicating an increase in systemically available NO, and lower levels of triglycerides in an
      older population with cardiovascular risk factors.(Zand et al., 2011) This pilot study also
      demonstrated a trend towards reduced BP and improved quality of life among its
      prehypertensive participates (Biswas et al., 2015). This current clinical trial aims to
      expand on this pilot study and examine the effect of NO supplementation on a pre- and mildly
      hypertensive populations with endothelial dysfunction as measured by EndoPAr® and asymmetric
      dimethyl L-arginine (ADMA). In a double blinded placebo controlled parallel arm study, we
      will further investigate the effect of Neo40 Daily® on 40 pre- and mildly hypertensive
      subjects with regards to changes in blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction and other markers
      of NO availability and CVD risk.
