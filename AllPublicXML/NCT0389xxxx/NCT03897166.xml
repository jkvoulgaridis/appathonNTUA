  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In oncology, personalized medicine is progressing by providing increasingly tumor- and
      patient-specific care. Thus, medical imaging allows precise morphological and functional
      characterization of the tumor by volume measurements, used in particular in radiotherapy to
      define the macroscopic tumor volume (GTV), and radiomic measurements that correspond to a
      recent concept of extraction of textural parameters and/or tumor shape (tumor heterogeneity,
      tumor invasiveness...). Precise characterization of the patient is also possible by
      anthropometric measurements (measurements of total muscle mass, visceral adipose tissue
      mass...) which can be important predictive and prognostic factors and which are generally
      estimated more accurately in imaging than by using mathematical formulas.

      However, these measurements are partly dependent on the imaging acquisition mode (PET, CT or
      MRI). The volume measurements, and therefore the GTV, are thus different depending on the
      imaging used. Studying these differences is important because no single imaging technique
      encompasses all potential GTV regions but, on the other hand, a combination of anatomical and
      functional information could improve tumor delineation. Beyond this volume analysis, the
      extraction of radiomic characteristics seems very promising in radiotherapy with however many
      limitations to be overcome, linked in particular to the data acquisition mode. Concerning
      anthropometric measurements, CT and MRI have become essential techniques for precise
      anatomical quantification, particularly of lean mass, visceral adipose tissue or muscle mass,
      but automatic measurement techniques for these parameters have yet to be defined,
      particularly during CT or MRI acquisitions associated with PET for attenuation correction.

      To identify useful volume, radiomic and anthropometric characteristics, medical imaging thus
      requires prospective cohorts of patients with comparable cancer histologies and standardized
      images acquired by different modalities (e. g. PET, CT or MRI) during the pre-treatment
      assessment before similar treatments.

      The purpose of this study is to create a prospective cohort to study volume, radiomic and
      anthropometric characteristics by taking advantage of the recent installation of MRI in the
      medical imaging department of the Henri Becquerel Cancer Center (HBCC), Rouen, France,
      allowing PET/MRI to be performed and by taking advantage of the collaboration between the
      radiotherapy and medical imaging departments of the HBCC.

      The purpose of this study is to create a prospective cohort to study volume, radiomic and
      anthropometric characteristics. For that 60 patients will be included before treatment by
      radiotherapy.

      Patients will benefit from a detailed pre-therapeutic imaging assessment with trimodal
      acquisitions (CT/MRI/PET with 18F-FDG) before radiotherapy and in radiotherapeutic position
      according to the &quot;CRAI&quot; (for &quot;Centre Régional de thérapie Assistée par l'Imagerie&quot;)
      acquisition protocol, innovative in trimodality.

      This initial imaging assessment will be supplemented by a whole-body biphoton absorptiometry
      which will be used as a reference examination for certain anthropometric parameters. This
      examination will be carried out at the Rouen University Hospital in the Rheumatology
      Department
