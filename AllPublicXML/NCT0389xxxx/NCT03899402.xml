  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether the addition of dapagliflozin to semaglutide and insulin (triple therapy)
      improves glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes compared with semaglutide and
      insulin (dual therapy) and insulin only (standard) treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 52 week study for type 1 diabetics looking into the effect of semaglutide and
