  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-resistant partial epilepsies are disabling diseases for which surgical treatment may be
      indicated. The determination of the area to be operated (or 'epileptogenic zone') is based on
      a bundle of clinical arguments and neuroimaging, having a direct impact on surgical success.

      Epileptic patients have electrical abnormalities that can be detected with surface
      electrophysiological examinations such as surface EEG or MagnetoEncephalography (MEG). The
      intracerebral source of these abnormalities can be localized in the brain using source
      modeling techniques from MEG signals or EEG signals if a sufficient number of electrodes is
      used (&gt; 100, so-called high EEG technique Resolution = EEG HR). EEG HR and MEG are two
      infrequent state-of-the-art techniques.

      The independent contribution of EEG HR and MEG for the localization of the epileptogenic zone
      has been shown in several studies. However, several modeling studies have shown that MEG and
      EEG HR have a different detection capacity and spatial resolution depending on the cortical
      generators studied. Modeling studies suggest that MEG has better localization accuracy than
      EEG for most cortical sources.

      No direct comparison of the locating value of MEG and EEG HR for the localization of the
      epileptogenic zone has been performed to date in a large-scale clinical study.

      In this prospective study, 100 patients with partial epilepsy who are candidates for epilepsy
      surgery, and for some of them with intracranial EEG recording, will benefit from two advanced
      electrophysiological examinations including magnetoencephalographic recording (MEG). )
      interictal electrophysiological abnormalities and high-resolution EEG recording (128
      electrodes) in addition to the usual examinations performed as part of the pre-surgical
      assessment, prior to cortectomy and / or intracranial EEG recording.

      Based on recent work conducted in humans, we postulate:

        -  that the MEG and the EEG HR make it possible to precisely determine the epileptogenic
           zone, by using two approaches of definition of the epileptogenic zone (zone operated in
           the cured patients, zone at the origin of the crises during the intracranial
           recordings), but that the MEG is a little more precise than the EEG HR for the
           determination of the epileptogenic zone (we will try to highlight a difference of about
           10%)

        -  that the quantitative study of the complementarity between EEG HR and MEG for modeling
           sources of epileptic spikes will show an added value in the use of both methods compared
           to the use of only one of the two methods

        -  that it is possible to determine the epileptogenic zone by determining the MEG model
           zone having the highest centrality value (hub) within the intercritical network by
           studying networks using graph theory.

    <description>MEG : Magnetoencephalography is the study of the magnetic fields produced by the electrical activity of the brain.
MEG signals are obtained while the patient is placed in a device specific to this technique. The latter comprises a recording chamber, recording sensors which are placed in a cryostat and an electronic measuring system. The magnetic fields are measured while the subject is placed in a shielded magnetic chamber protecting it from variations in the ambient magnetic field (displacement of metal masses, sector ...).
EEG HR: High Resolution EEG is defined as the recording of cerebral electrical activity with 128 electroencephalographic electrodes and with high temporal resolution usually followed by the use of source localization tools. The HR EEG is therefore derived from standard EEG techniques, but requires a higher number of electrodes and the use of source localization tools.</description>
