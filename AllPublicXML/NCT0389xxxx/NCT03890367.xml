      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate:

        -  the non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate (antibody titers ≥ 1:8) to meningococcal
           serogroup C following the administration of MenACYW conjugate or Nimenrix® as measured
           by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA). If this non-inferiority is
           demonstrated, then

        -  the non-inferiority of the antibody response (geometric mean titers [GMT]). If this
           non-inferiority is demonstrated, then

        -  the superiority of the antibody response (GMT).If this superiority is demonstrated, then

        -  the superiority of the seroprotection rate

      Or to demonstrate:

        -  the non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate (antibody titers ≥ 1:8) to meningococcal
           serogroup C following the administration of MenACYW conjugate or NeisVac-C® as measured
           by rSBA. If this non-inferiority is demonstrated, then

        -  the non-inferiority of the antibody response (GMT). If this non-inferiority is
           demonstrated, then

        -  the superiority of the antibody response (GMT)

           serogroup C following the administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as

           non-inferiority is demonstrated, then

        -  the non-inferiority of the antibody response (GMT). If this non-inferiority is

      Study duration per participant is approximately 30 days including: 1 day of screening and
      vaccination, a phone call and a safety-follow up/end of study visit at Day 8 and Day 30 after
      vaccine administration, respectively.

      Safety assessment includes solicited reactions within 7 days after vaccination, unsolicited
      adverse events (AEs) up to 30 days after vaccination, serious adverse events (SAEs) and
      adverse event of special interest (AESI) throughout the study.

             interfere with trial conduct or completion

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the
             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0 C). A prospective subject

             event has subsided

          -  Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first
             blood draw
