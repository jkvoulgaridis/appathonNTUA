      The current study adopted a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled mixed design, with
      Treatment (oxytocin, dopamine, and placebo) as a between-subjects factor, and Target (self,
      friend, and an identifiable stranger) and Feedback (desirable vs. undesirable) as
      within-subjects factors. Upon arrival, participants first completed a set of questionnaires,
      including mood measurements and other questionnaires related to optimistic or prosocial
      tendency. Participants then self-administered with the pharmacological challenge 40 min
      before the main task, i.e., the belief updating task where participants indicated and updated
      their beliefs about the future of oneself, a gender-matched best friend, and a gender-matched
      identifiable stranger. At the end, participants completed the mood measurement again, as well
      the debriefing questionnaires which designed to measure their beliefs about the experimental
      process.

      For the vicarious optimism task, participants completed three blocks of the two-session
      belief updating task where they were asked to estimate the likelihood of adverse life events
      happening to three targets: themselves (referred as Self), a gender-matched best friend
      (referred as Friend), and an identifiable stranger (whose name, brief description and picture
      were presented to the participants to get familiar with before the estimation, such as &quot;The
      stranger is Zhexing, a 25-year-old male, Chinese&quot;; referred as Stranger).

      Participants completed two estimation sessions for one target before beginning with the next
      target, and the order of targets was counterbalanced across participants within each group.
      For the first session of each target block, participants were first presented with 30
      different adverse life events (in a random order) and estimated the likelihood of each event
      happening to the target in the future (the 1st estimation, referred to as E1) on a self-paced
      basis. Participants were then presented with the probability of each event occurring to an
      average person in a similar environment (Feedback) for 2s. In the second session,
      participants estimated the likelihood of the same 30 events (in a random order) happening to
      the target person again without receiving feedback (the 2nd estimation, referred to as E2).

    <description>In the vicarious optimistic bias task, participants would make first estimation about the happening likelihood for each event for themselves, friend, and stranger and then receive feedback about the general likelihood of each event happened in future. After all events first estimation, participants would estimate all the event again. So, for the belief update, we used the second estimation value to minus the first estimation value to get the update value, as well as calculating the update value in desirable condition (first estimation &lt; feedback) and undesirable condition (first estimation &lt; feedback). Then investigated the general belief updating (gBU) and optimistic belief updating (using desirableBU-undesirableBU) for the three target (self vs. friend vs. stranger) in three treatment groups (Oxytocin vs. L-DOPA vs. Placebo)</description>
