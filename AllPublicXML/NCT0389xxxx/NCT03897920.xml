  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with de novo respiratory failure undergoing non invasive ventilation (NIV) present
      failure rates of mechanical ventilation ranging from 4 to 50%. Causes for NIV treatment
      failure are various but the onset of septic shock and subsequent multi-organ failure (MOF)
      seem play a critical role. Recent data show that the 37% of patients admitted to intensive
      care unit for de novo respiratory failure without any other organ failure experience multiple
      organ failure within the first days from admission. Early identification of hypoxic patients
      at major risk for MOF seems critical. Physiological studies have demonstrated that the
      underlying mechanisms for organ damage preceding MOF are those involved in the oxygen
      consumption (VO2)/oxygen delivery (DO2) mismatch. Doppler ultrasound indices of renal arteria
      resistance are directly correlated tot he VO2/DO2 mismatch. With this study we aim at
      investigating the correlation between Doppler ultrasound indices of renal arteria resistance
      in patients with de novo respiratory failure admitted to ICU and the onset of MOF within the
      first 7 days form admission.

    <description>A high frequency probe will be used together with the use of color or power Doppler to help vessel localization. As resistance to blood flow progressively increases from the hilar arteries toward the more peripheral parenchymal vessels, renal arteria resistive index (RRI) will be done at the level of the arcuate or interlobar arteries, adjacent to medullary pyramids. Measurements will be repeated in different parts of both organs (superior, median, and lower) when at least three reproducible waveforms have been obtained. An RRI will be calculated with the following formula: (peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity, and the mean value of three measurements at each kidney is usually considered. An RRI value 0.60 ± 0.01 (mean ± SD) is usually taken as normal with a value of 0.70 being considered the upper normal threshold</description>
