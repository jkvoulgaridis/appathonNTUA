  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study was to assess the performance of compression-strain US elastography in
      patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies over time and to study these findings with
      clinical and functional parameters as well as biochemical and electromyographic tests.

      This study will be carried out on four groups:

      Group (I): twenty children diagnosed to have idiopathic inflammatory myopathies(IIM)

        -  Group (II): twenty adults diagnosed to have IIM

        -  Group (III):20 healthy children matching age and sex as first control group to children
           with IIM .

        -  Group (VI):20 healthy adults matching age and sex as second control group to adults with
           IIM.

      All patients will be evaluated at baseline at &amp; 4-months follow up using Semi-Quantitative
      strain elastography

    <description>The MDAAT is a combined tool that includes the Myositis Disease Activity Assessment visual analog scale (VAS) (MYOACT) and the Myositis Intention to Treat Activities Index (MITAX).it Assesses 6 extramuscular organs to produce a global extramuscular score, and the muscle score, which gives a total disease activity index score. Scores range from 0-60 for the extramuscular MYOACT score and 0-70 for the total MYOACT score, and they range from 0-54 for the Extramuscular MITAX score and 0-63 for the total MITAX score. higher scores indicates worse outcome</description>

    <measure>HEALTH ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE (HAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6months</time_frame>
    <description>20 questions grouped into eight subscales (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, activities). (score = 0 to 3 with higher score means worse outcome ). The highest score for any question determines the score for the subscale in question. The HAQ disability index is calculated as the sum of the scores for various subscales,divided by the number of subscales responded to, and results in a score between 0 and 3. higher score means worse outcome</description>
