      Establish the effectiveness of the Bay Labs, Inc. EchoGPS software in enabling RNs to acquire
      echocardiograms. In this study an echocardiogram protocol using the EchoGPS interface with
      the Terason uSmart 3200t, an FDA 510(k)-cleared, commercially available ultrasound device
      will be performed. Participants will have two scans, one by a registered nurse (RN) using the
      Terason uSmart 3200t with EchoGPS (Study Exam) and one by a sonographer using the Reference
      Device without EchoGPS guidance (Control Exam), under the same protocol. Study is
      non-significant risk (NSR).

    <textblock>
      To validate clinical use of Bay Labs, Inc. EchoGPS guidance software by registered nurses
      (RNs) with no prior scanning experience to acquire limited two-dimensional echocardiograms.
      In this study an echocardiogram protocol using the EchoGPS interface with the Terason uSmart
      3200t, an FDA 510(k)-cleared, commercially available ultrasound device will be performed.
      Participants will have two scans, one by a registered nurse (RN) using the Terason uSmart
      3200t with EchoGPS (Study Exam) and one by a sonographer using the Reference Device without
      EchoGPS guidance (Control Exam), under the same protocol. Study is non-significant risk
      (NSR).

    <description>The primary endpoints for the study are separate patient-level assessments of whether the patient study is of adequate image quality to make a qualitative visual assessment for a particular clinical parameter (ie., Yes/No). Expert cardiologist readers will independently provide assessments and they will be blinded to the assessments from the other readers as well as whether the images were acquired by an RN or sonographer.
The Outcome Measure will be reported as the percentage of patient studies for which the panel of cardiologist readers adjudicated as being of sufficient image quality to make a particular clinical assessment.</description>

    <description>STUDY SOFTWARE non-significant risk (NSR) Bay Labs EchoGPS software interfaced with the Terason uSmart 3200t FDA 510(k)-cleared, commercially available ultrasound EchoGPS software communicates with the ultrasound image formation engine of the 510(k)-cleared Terason uSmart 3200t through an application programming interface (API). EchoGPS will be used to provide visual guidance feedback to users during image acquisition. For this study, RNs will use EchoGPS to perform limited echocardiogram examinations.</description>
