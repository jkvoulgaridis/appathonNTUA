  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study evaluating medical treatment before surgery in HER2-amplified early
      breast cancer patients. Patients receive chemotherapy with HER2-targeted antibodies and are
      randomised to receive the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab or not.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to investigate whether the rate of pCR, after optimal neoadjuvant
      anti-HER2 based systemic therapy, can be increased by addition of atezolizumab.

      Secondary aims are to assess safety and tolerability of this treatment combination, and to
      identify therapy predictive factors for the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and
      pertuzumab plus-minus atezolizumab with a backbone of chemotherapy, using modern molecular
      biological investigational procedures with analyses by repeated biopsies from an
      intra-patient longitudinal study design.
