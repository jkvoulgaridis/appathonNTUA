  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the reliability of POC ultrasound in estimating right and left atrium
      pressures in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. This study will compare
      hemodynamic measurements obtained from pulmonary artery catheters with those estimated from
      POC ultrasound using inferior vena cava (IVC) measurements and the presence of atrial septal
      bulge.

      For those patients admitted to the CCU who have pulmonary artery catheters placed by the
      primary team as part of their medical care, the investigators will collect hemodynamic data
      from their pulmonary artery catheters and echocardiographic data. Echocardiographic and
      hemodynamic data obtained from pulmonary artery catheters will be simultaneously collected at
      baseline (within 24 hours of catheter placement) and after 24 and 48 hours of intensive
      medical therapy if the pulmonary artery catheter is still in place at those times. The
      placement of the pulmonary artery catheter and the taking of hemodynamic measurements from
      the catheter will be done as per the primary medical team. The research team will not place
      any pulmonary artery catheters.

    <description>Right atrial pressure is the pressure in one of the chambers of the heart (the right atrium). It reflects the amount of blood returning to the heart. Normal right atrial pressure is 5 to 10 mm Hg. Low pressures indicate that less blood is returning to the heart than normal, higher pressures indicate that more blood is returning to the heart than normal. Higher pressures can occur for example, in patients with heart failure who are fluid overloaded.</description>

    <time_frame>Pressures will be estimated at baseline (within 24 hours of placement of pulmonary artery catheter upon admission to CCU)</time_frame>
    <description>Left atrial pressure is the pressure in one of the chambers of the heart (the left atrium). It represents the filling pressure of the left side of the heart before blood is pumped to the rest of the body. Normal left atrial pressure is 6 to 12 mm Hg. In patients with heart failure, the left atrial pressure may be high due to the heart failing to effectively pump blood to the rest of the body.</description>
