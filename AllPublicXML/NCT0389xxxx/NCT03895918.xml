      This trial studies how well a parenting skills intervention works in improving medication
      adherence in pediatric cancer patients. The parenting skills intervention provides support
      and skills training to parents who administer medicine daily to their child and may improve
      the childs taking of medications correctly as prescribed by the doctor. Ultimately, this may
      improve treatment outcomes, among children who are experiencing an illness.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To pilot test a novel parenting intervention. II. To examine the feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of the parenting intervention on child medication adherence among
      children who are experiencing an illness.

      OUTLINE: Participants with poor medication adherence are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      EARLY GROUP: Participants continue medication adherence monitoring over 1 week and then
      receive parental skills intervention sessions consisting of 4 integrated components: creating
      consistent medication routines, education in child management strategies, strategies for
      helping children adhere to medication, and training in specific parental behavioral
      techniques over 30 minutes weekly for 4 weeks.

      DELAYED GROUP: Participants continue medication adherence monitoring over 2 weeks and then
      receive parental skills intervention sessions consisting of 4 integrated components: creating
      consistent medication routines, education in child management strategies, strategies for
      helping children adhere to medication, and training in specific parental behavioral
      techniques over 30 minutes weekly for 4 weeks.

      LATE GROUP: Participants continue medication adherence monitoring over 3 weeks and then
      receive parental skills intervention sessions consisting of 4 integrated components: creating
      consistent medication routines, education in child management strategies, strategies for
      helping children adhere to medication, and training in specific parental behavioral
      techniques over 30 minutes weekly for 4 weeks.

    <description>Assessed using Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS) track caps.The project manager will conduct reviews of each child?s medical record to obtain data on the medication dose prescribed each day and dates when the medication was held for illness or toxicity. MEMS-based adherence variables will be constructed as a percentage based upon the ratio of the number of days with MEMS cap openings (X) to the number of days the medication was prescribed (N). Will remove days when the medication was held by the prescriber from the denominator (X/N x 100).</description>
