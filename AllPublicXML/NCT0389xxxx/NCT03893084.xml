    <intervention_model_description>The women who came to the institution were evaluated in terms of sample criteria and randomized sampling was divided into two groups. In order to be able to perform randomized sampling, random number table was obtained automatically by means of programs on internet sites by specifying the number of samples. The selection of the groups to the intervention and control group was determined by throwing a coin.
In the data collection phase of the study, 218 women were evaluated in terms of sampling criteria. 10 women (who did not meet the criteria or refused to participate) were excluded from the study. 208 randomized women were divided into two groups as intervention and control group. During the follow-up, 15 women in the intervention group and 13 women in the control group were excluded from the study or were excluded because of pregnancy.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The research was conducted by the researcher to evaluate the stages of behavior change related to the topics covered in preconceptional care. With the response to the questions, it is possible to determine which behavior change stage of the individuals. Women's behavioral changes were evaluated according to the five change stages on the transtheventional model. For the detailed evaluation of the individuals who are in the process of moving and maintaining, open-ended questions specific to each subject were asked.</description>

    <measure>Healthy Lifestyle Behavior Scale-II</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Walker et al. (1987) developed a scale to evaluate health-promoting behaviors related to the individual's healthy lifestyle. Validity and reliability study was conducted by Bahar et al. (2008). The scale consists of 52 items and all items are positive. The rating is in the form of a four-point likert (1), sometimes (2), often (3), regularly (4). The lowest score is 52 and the highest score is 208. The total score of the scale determines the healthy lifestyle behavior score. The scale consists of six sub-dimensions: Health responsibility, Physical activity, Nutrition, Spiritual development, Interpersonal relations, Stress management.</description>

    <measure>General Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale was developed by Ralf Schwarzer and Mattihias Jerusalem (1995) in order to make a general assessment of perceived self-efficacy. The validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted by Aypay (2010). The scale applied to individuals aged 12 years or older consisted of 10 items. Self-sufficiency scale scores vary from 1 to 4 each. The lowest total score obtained from the scale is 10 and the highest score is 40. The high score from the self-efficacy scale indicates that the self-efficacy level is high.</description>
