  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a 4-day, randomized study to determine the phototoxic potential of MC2-01 Cream
      when topical application to healthy skin is followed by light exposure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the potential of MC2-01 (CAL/BDP 0.005/0.042w/w%) Cream to cause a
      phototoxic reaction using a controlled photopatch test design. Because MC2-01 Cream is
      formulated for topical use and have shown to absorb light, it is necessary to determine the
      potential of this product to cause a phototoxic reaction after topical application and
      irradiation of the skin.

        <description>MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle will be applied each to two sites. One further site will function as control site and will remain untreated. 24 hours after product application, the test sites, including the untreated control site will be evaluated for cutaneous reaction. One set of MC2-01 and MC2-01 vehicle + the untreated control site will be designated for irradiation and the other set will remain non-irradiated. Possible changes in dermal reactions (erythema, edema and other signs of cutaneous irritation) at the 5 test sites, 24 and 48 hours post-irradiation is the outcome measure of the study</description>
