  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol is to determine safety, tolerability, recommended dose (RD),
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumour activity of IPN60090
      as a single agent (Part A) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Part B) or paclitaxel (Part
      C) in patients with advanced solid tumours and to evaluate food effect (Part D).
