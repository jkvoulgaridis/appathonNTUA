    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of a 8 week training period compared with
      control group in physical and mentally disabled adults. The effect was evaluated in relation
      to their physical status. Furthermore, physical activity was measured using steps and active
      minutes.

      This study aimed at making a quality assessment of a 8 week training period for adults with
      physical and mental disabilities. A control group was added to compare the effect of the
      training with no training. Before the training period the participants were tested in
      relation to their physical status: weight, height, fat%, blood pressure, Aastrand test, chair
      stand test and waist circumference. In addition to this, the participants were instructed to
      wear an accelerometer to measure step and active minutes for 2-3 days a work.

      The staff at the day center, where the participants works in daytime, were responsible for
      the physical training 2 times/week for 8 weeks. The training was an hour of combined aerobic,
      strength, balance and flexibility training.

      The participants were tested after the training period using the same test-protocol as
      before.
