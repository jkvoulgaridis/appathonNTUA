      The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of sufentanil combined with
      midazolam in bronchoscopy under conscious sedation. A retrospective analysis was conducted on
      all patients undergoing bronchoscopy applying sufentanil and midazolam under conscious
      sedation in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from September 2013
      to July 2017.

        According to guidelines of bronchoscopy, patients had no food by mouth for 4h and to allow
        clear fluids by mouth up to 2 h before bronchoscopy. Oxygen supplementation was given to
        the patients through the nasal cannula (2-5L/min, adjusted as needed). 2% lidocaine was
        applied for topical anesthesia. Sufentanil and midazolam were applied intravenously.
