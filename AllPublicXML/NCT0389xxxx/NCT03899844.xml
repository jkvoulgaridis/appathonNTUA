  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well a blood test can detect amyloid beta, a
      protein involved in Alzheimer's disease. Participants will be asked to complete an initial
      blood collection and cognitive testing, and a subset of participants will be asked to
      complete a larger blood collection, amyloid PET imaging, and an MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and currently has no
      disease-modifying treatments or simple, accurate diagnostic tests. Amyloid beta builds up in
      the brain and forms plaques in people with Alzheimer's disease, and the buildup of this
      protein is found decades before symptoms of dementia begin. A blood test may be able to
      quickly and inexpensively screen people for Alzheimer's disease clinical trials and
      eventually diagnose Alzheimer's disease in the clinic.
