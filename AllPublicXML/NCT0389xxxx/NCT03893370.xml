  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined as an impaired ability to move air
      within the lungs and is a major public health problem that is projected to rank fifth
      worldwide in terms of disease burden and third in terms of mortality. Chronic bronchitis (CB)
      is a common clinical phenotype within the umbrella of a COPD diagnosis and is classically
      defined as chronic cough and sputum production for 3 months a year for 2 consecutive years2,
      but many studies have used different definitions to define it- chronic cough and sputum
      production for one year or cough and sputum production on most days of the week. CB is
      associated with multiple clinical consequences, including; the worsening of lung function
      decline, increasing risk of acute exacerbations of COPD, increased risk of developing
      pneumonia, reduced health related quality of life, and an increase in all-cause mortality.

      The RejuvenAir® System is a cryosurgical device that applies medical-grade liquid nitrogen to
      the treatment area via a radial head catheter in a small, accurately directed spray.
      Cryotherapy with the RejuvenAir® System is designed to induce a regenerative endobronchial
      tissue effect by: 1) destroying via cryotherapy the abnormal surface epithelium that has
      become overgrown with mucin producing goblet cells, 2) thus allowing normal bronchial
      epithelium with a regrowth of ciliated epithelial cells that will facilitate the removal of
      mucins from the bronchial airways and 3) lead to a reduction in chronic inflammation and its
      accompanying mucosal swelling with resultant increase in the treated airway diameter. This
      reversal of inflamed epithelium may also lessen systemic inflammation.
