  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a common malignant tumor that poses a serious threat to human health. Small
      cell lung cancer accounts for about 20% of lung cancer. Precision medicine has recently been
      perfectly interpreted in many tumor types, but the treatment of small cell lung cancer is
      still bleak. The EC/EP regimen is the most classic chemotherapy regimen for small cell lung
      cancer with good results but is prone to drug resistance. In 2018, with the development of
      immunotargeting therapy, small molecule multi-target anti-angi drugs, PARP inhibitors, new
      chemotherapy drugs, etc., the treatment of small cell lung cancer has ushered in a new dawn.
      As a kind of highly selective multi-target anti-angiogenic TKI drugs,Anlotinib Hydrochloride
      is a kind of 1.1 innovative drugs with independent intellectual property rights in China,
      mainly acting on VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR and c-Kit. The latest ALTER1202 study confirms that
      anlotinib is significantly improved for PSC and ORR in SCLC patients who have previously
      received at least 2-line chemotherapy. OS data is not yet mature, but the benefits of the
      anlotinib group were observed. The adverse effects of anlotinib were consistent with
      expectations, no new adverse events were found, and safety was tolerated. Nowadays, the
      effective combination of traditional chemical therapy with molecular targeting and
      immunotherapy is the future development direction of lung cancer treatment. Therefore, this
      topic is designed to combine the efficacy of safety and safety with the treatment of
      anlotinib with the classic EC/EP chemotherapy regimen. Expected to get longer PFS and OS for
      patient benefit.
