  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is:

      To observe the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Abstral ODT for the alleviation of
      breakthrough cancer pain in Korean patients with various cancers in real-world clinical
      settings and supplement and expand the previous cross-sectional survey results.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-interventional, single-arm, non-randomized observational study
      designed to collect the efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of Abstral ODT for the
      treatment of breakthrough cancer pain in cancer patients in real-world outpatient and
      inpatient clinical settings.

      As the purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Abstral ODT in
      routine clinical practice, drug prescription and treatment will be determined according to
      the medical judgment of the investigator, regardless of enrollment to this study. During the
      patient's visit to the institution, Abstral ODT will be prescribed according to the judgment
      of the investigator, and study participation will be suggested for this patient. Whether to
      participate in this study or not will not affect the patient's treatment (physician's
      prescription or diagnostic and therapeutic decision).

      Due to the non-interventional observational nature of this study, there will be no visits or
      procedures to be performed mandatorily according to the protocol, and data will be collected
      at Week 1 (±3 days), Week 4 (±1 week), and Week 12 (±4 weeks) from the baseline visit
      according to the circumstances of clinical practice.

      Status of successful dose titration for Abstral ODT will be determined according to the
      criteria in which dose titration is deemed successful when all of the following are met, and
      ineffective when one of the following is not met: no additional dose is administered within 2
      h of administration of Abstral ODT during maintenance phase; Numeric Rating Scale scores at
      30 and 60 min after administration is reduced by ≥2; adverse drug reactions are tolerable for
      the subject.The overall procedures of this study are as follows.
