  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The only malignancy screening test among gynecological cancers is cervical cancer.

      Cytology examination and Hpv typing with smear are used as screening tests. Hpv positivity is
      detected in more than 90% of cervical cancers. However, only the Hpv 16-18 type positive
      patients undergo colposcopy in the routine screening program.

      Patients with Smear negative, Type 16-18 high-risk Hpv positivity are evaluated by quota
      after 1 year.

      the authors performed colposcopy with this study; authors aimed to compare the results of
      patients with type 16-18 Hpv positivity and type 16-18 high-risk Hpv positivity and to find
      out whether there was any difference between them.

      In this way, other high-risk Hpv types other than type 16-18 (31,33,35,45,51, etc.) may be
      exposed to premalign cervical lesions and possible cancer in a number of earlier and earlier
      periods by performing colposcopic examination instead of expecting to perform quota after 1
      year. we aimed to remove.
