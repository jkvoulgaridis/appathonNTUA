  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyrimoz™ was developed as a biosimilar to HumiraTM (INN: adalimumab) and Zessly™ was
      developed as a biosimilar to RemicadeTM (INN: infliximab). Within the Biosimilar Development
      Program of Hyrimoz™ and Zessly™, two clinical confirmatory efficacy and safety studies were
      conducted: Hyrimoz™ in plaque psoriasis and Zessly™ in rheumatoid arthritis. Both
      confirmatory Phase III studies demonstrated equivalent efficacy and similar safety and
      immunogenicity of Hyrimoz™ to HumiraTM and Zessly™ to RemicadeTM, respectively.

      The current study is designed to provide a systematic and consistent overview of the
      real-world data in biologic-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD). The
      data collected in this observational trial will be used to increase the knowledge of the
      effectiveness of Hyrimoz™ and Zessly™ in clinical routine care in patients with
      moderate-to-severe CD.
