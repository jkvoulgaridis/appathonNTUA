  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective longitudinal study which aims to compare oculomotor function and visual
      scanning behaviour (VSB) of participants who suffered concussion with healthy controls with
      no concussion. This study also aims to investigate the pattern of change in oculomotor
      function and visual scanning behaviour (VSB) in the participants over a 6-month period.

      Primary Objective

        -  To identify differences in oculomotor function and visual scanning behaviour (VSB)
           between participant with and without acute concussion

        -  To investigate patterns of change and recovery in oculomotor function and VSB in
           participants who suffered a concussion

      Secondary Objective

      • To investigate the association between the oculomotor function and concussion-related
      symptoms

      This is a prospective longitudinal study which aims to evaluate differences in oculomotor
      function and visual scanning behaviour (VSB) between participants who suffered acute
      concussion and healthy controls with no concussion. This study also aims to investigate the
      pattern of change in oculomotor function and visual scanning behaviour (VSB) in the
      participants over a 6-month period.

      Health information and concussion history: After obtaining informed consents, during the
      first visit, participants will be asked about their health history such as past medical
      history, medication history, substance use history, and family history. They will also be
      asked about their concussion history which includes number of concussions in the past, any
      comorbidity with the concussions, mechanism of injury, and any change in their levels of
      consciousness at the time of concussion.

      Self-reported outcomes: During each visit, participants will be asked on the presence or
      absence of concussion-related symptoms and the extent to which these symptoms affect their
      everyday functioning if present. The symptoms the participants will be questioned using the
      Rivermead Post-concussive Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ) as a standardized assessment
      (https://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/TBI.aspx#tab=Data_Standards) at each visit .

      Oculomotor function testing and visual scanning behaviour (VSB): During each visit,
      oculomotor data will be collected using Visual Attention Scanning Technology (VAST, EL-MAR
      Inc.). VAST is a technology that was developed to support advanced eye-tracking research
      application. Over the past 10 years the technology has been used in research studies in the
      University of Toronto, and University Health Network hospitals. Participants will be seated
      65 cm from the monitor, and their binocular gaze positions will be estimated 30 times/sec
      with an accuracy of 0.5º in visual angle. Following a calibration procedure, the participants
      will be instructed to look at a series of slides presented on the monitor, and their eye
      positions will be recorded. The eye positions will be segmented into fixations that are
      linked to the displayed images. Oculomotor functions testing includes testing self-paced
      saccadic (SPS) eye movements, fixation, anti-saccadic eye movements. Visual scanning
      behaviour (VSB) will be assessed using a set of images which require patients to look at the
      images and match them according to the instruction at the beginning of each test.

      Patients will be assessed at baseline (i.e. within 7 days of concussion) and three follow-up
      (f/u) visits (i.e. 1, 3, and 6 months after concussion).

      Healthy controls will be assessed at baseline and one follow-up visit (i.e. 6 months after
      the baseline).

      The entire assessment in each visit takes 30-45 minutes.
