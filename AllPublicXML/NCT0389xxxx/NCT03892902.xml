          -  Subject has a valid driving license for more than 5 years, has driven at least 3000
             km/year on average in the past 2 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

             conduct, or interpretation of the results.

          -  History or presence of rhythm disorders

          -  Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol.

        Study-specific criteria:

          -  Current or previous diagnosis of insomnia-related disorder according to the Diagnostic
             and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 (DSM-5) criteria.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of more than 21 units or an average daily intake of more than 3
             units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of more than 14 units or an
             average daily intake of more than 2 units (females). One unit is equivalent to a
             half-pint (approx. 250 mL) of beer or 1 measure (25 mL) of spirits or 1 glass (125 mL)
             of wine.

          -  Modified Swiss Narcolepsy Scale total score &lt; 0 at Screening or history of narcolepsy
             or cataplexy.
