  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients who
      undergo three-level oblique lateral lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) using ViBone,
      demineralized bone matrix (DBM), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). One product will be
      used on each level. Subjects will be followed for 12 months following surgery to assess
      degree of mineralization via computed tomography (CT) scan at 6 and 12 months, mean time to
      fusion, and maturation of fusion mass postoperatively via x-ray radiograph.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 120 patients undergoing three-level OLIF using ViBone, DBM, and BMP each on separate
      levels will be enrolled.

      Implantation of ViBone, DBM, and BMP will be randomized between the three levels.

      Subjects will be followed for a total of 12 months. Data and x-ray radiographs will be
      collected according to standard of care, including baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months
      post-surgery. Additionally, a CT scan will be required at 6 and 12 months.
