  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A history of breast cancer is a risk factor for the development of endometrial pathologies,
      such as typical and atypical glandular hyperplasia, endometrial polyps, uterine fibroids,
      endometrial adenocarcinoma and uterine sarcoma, probably due to some common risk factors (eg.
      obesity, nulliparity). Even if ethiopathogenesis for breast cancer and endometrial
      pathologies is not well established, both genetic factors and hyperestrogenic state may be
      play a pivotal role for their development. Indeed, relative hyperestrogenism is also the main
      target for the treatment of breast cancer. Currently used therapies for this purpose are
      selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs), such as Tamoxifen (TAM), and third
      generation non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs), such as letrozole and anastrozole.

      TAM has both agonist and antagonist properties, depending upon the individual target organ
      and circulating levels of serum estrogens: on the one hand, it blocks estrogen stimulation in
      breast tissue; on the other hand, TAM shows an ER agonist activity in the endometrium that is
      able to stimulate proliferation and, in some cases, it causes an increased risk of uterine
      pathologies. Women with hormone-dependent breast cancer have to use TAM for five to ten
      years. Many reports suggest that the risk of uterine pathologies increases with the time of
      administration.

      Considering these elements, the primary aim of this study will be to investigate the
      incidence of endometrial pathologies, especially of endometrial cancer, in different groups
      of breast cancer women undergoing diagnostic hysteroscopy.
