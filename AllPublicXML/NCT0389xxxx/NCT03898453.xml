  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist in an evaluation of the EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and
      Reprocessing) psychotherapy in the context on invasive primitive breast cancer. EMDR could
      then allow the affected patients to readjust their point of view on the pathology and thus
      promote more adapted behaviors or additional resources to cope with the disease. 190 Patients
      are going to be randomized in two groups : one group with EMDR psychotherapists and one group
      with support psychotherapists. Patients will receive 8 sessions. We expect that patient in
      EMDR psychotherapists group will have an higher decrease of anxiety score, depressive score
      (CES-D) and PTSD score, and a higher increase in quality of life.
