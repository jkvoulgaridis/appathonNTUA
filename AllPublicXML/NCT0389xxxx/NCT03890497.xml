  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following a recommendation on October 2017 meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts
      (SAGE) on Immunization; low- risk bOPV-using countries may adopt 2 dose fIPV schedule prior
      to global OPV cessation as it provides better seroconversion than 1 full dose IPV and in the
      post-cessation era, the 2 fIPV doses will provide sufficient (above 90%) seroconversion.
      Countries, which delayed the introduction of IPV or had a vaccine stock-out, should provide 1
      full dose or 2 fIPV doses to all children who were missed as soon as supply becomes
      available. The IPV supply situation is expected to improve in 2018; all countries are
      expected to have access to IPV for their routine immunization programmes from the end of the
      first quarter of 2018.

      While immunogenicity after one and two doses of IPV and fIPV has been estimated when
      administered to younger children ; the immunogenicity of IPV (or fIPV) when administered at 9
      months of age or later is not known. We propose to conduct a study to assess the
      immunogenicity of one and two doses of fIPV and IPV when administered between 9-13 months of
      age.

    <description>The inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) developed by Salk was the first available polio vaccine licensed in 1955 in the United States. The current formulation of IPV got licensed in 1987 and has a higher potency than the original Salk IPV. Almost 100% of children two months of age or older who receive 2-3 doses of intramuscular (IM) IPV achieve high antibody levels against the all three serotypes. IPV (.5mL) can be administered subcutaneously (SC) or IM and fractional (0.1 ml) doses of IPV are generally administered intradermally</description>
