      -  Evaluate for accuracy and reproducibility of data collected via the participant-operated
           Walk.Talk.Track. (WTT) app combined with Apple Watch during in-clinic, technician
           proctored 6MWT's.

             -  Determine whether the WTT app on the Apple Watch can accurately collect information
                on distance traveled and heart rate (HR) during in-clinic 6MWT run by American
                Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines

             -  Determine whether participants can operate the WTT app and Apple Watch effectively
                to gather accurate data in a monitored and home-based setting

        -  Prospectively monitor for changes in WTT app recorded 6MWT results following initiation
           of therapy in a treatment naïve cohort of PAH participants

             -  Evaluate whether changes from baseline in 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) and heart
                rate recovery at one minute (HRR1) as well as other variables that have been
                associated with disease severity in PAH and left-sided heart disease (resting HR,
                heart rate variability [HRV], chronotropic index [CI]) can be identified before the
                12-week follow up when comparing the treatment arm and the control arm

             -  Evaluate whether changes from baseline in the HRR1, resting HR, HRV and/or CI are
                more evident in treatment responders when compared to treatment non-responders.
