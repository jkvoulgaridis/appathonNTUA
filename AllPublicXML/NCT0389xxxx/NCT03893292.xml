  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement surgery is commonly performed for patients suffering from severe knee
      osteoarthritis. However, 20% of patients continue to experience pain after surgery. There is
      currently no standardized pain management protocol for pain after total knee replacement.
      Cooled radiofrequency ablation has been used successfully to alleviate spin-related pain and
      has recently been approved by the FDA to treat chronic knee arthritic pain. This pilot study
      aims to collect preliminary data on the use of cooled radiofrequency ablation in patients
      undergoing total knee replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients who undergo total knee replacement is rising significantly. However,
      many of these patients are dissatisfied with the results, because they continue to experience
      pain postoperatively. This pain can be debilitating and can also be associated with decreased
      quality of life. Given the increasing number of patients undergoing total knee replacement
      and a dissatisfaction rate of 8-44%, improvements must be made in pain management protocols
      to help decrease pain in the immediate postoperative period following total knee replacement.
      Cooled radiofrequency ablation is a procedure that uses water-cooled technology to denervate
      the sensory nerves. It is widely used in the spine and is increasingly being used in the knee
      to treat osteoarthritis. Existing studies have shown that it can significantly reduce pain in
      patients with chronic osteoarthritis. In terms of its potential benefit as a preoperative
      measure to minimize postoperative pain, the literature is sparse. Results from this study
      will be used to generate hypotheses and power for future studies.
