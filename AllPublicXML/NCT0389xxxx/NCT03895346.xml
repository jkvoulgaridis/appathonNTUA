  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a larger
      randomized clinical trial to test whether individuals with MCI can benefit from mental
      training programs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Half of participants will be randomized to a mindfulness group and half to a brain games and
      puzzles group as forms of mental training. Participants are adults with mild cognitive
      impairment. Participants will undergo neuropsychological testing, MRI scanning, and
      qualitative interviews to assess feasibility of conducting a larger randomized clinical trial
      in a population with mild cognitive impairment.
