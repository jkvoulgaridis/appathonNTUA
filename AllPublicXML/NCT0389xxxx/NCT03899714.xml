  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of cryotherapy application on hip
      adductors and ankle evertors on the Overall Stability Index (OSI), the Medio-Lateral
      Stability Index (MLSI), and the Antero-Posterior Stability Index (APSI) in healthy adult
      females.

    <textblock>
      Cryotherapy is one of the most common and inexpensive forms of treatment for both acute and
      chronic injuries. Yet, there is a deficiency in research concerning the impact of cooling on
      balance in healthy females

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned into one of two locations of the cryotherapy application. Some began the session with cryotherapy being applied on their ankle evertors, while others began the session with the cryotherapy being applied on their hip adductors.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Stability Index represented the variance of platform displacement in degrees from a leveled position in both the AP and ML directions. A high number is indicative of poor neuromuscular control, which may increase the potential for orthopedic injury or falling.</description>

    <description>Ice packs will be applied to the selected muscles according to the random selection that will be performed previously. The ice bags will be filled with crushed ice, weighing approximately one half of a kilogram. They will be wrapped in a thin cotton towel, and applied on the skin along the anatomical location of the tested muscles. For the ankle evertors, the ice bag will be applied to the lateral side of the ankle encompassing the lateral malleolus.The cryotherapy session will be lasted for exactly 20 minutes . Sessions will be separated by a 30-minute rest interval</description>

The ice bags will be filled with crushed ice, weighing approximately one half of a kilogram. They will be wrapped in a thin cotton towel, and applied on the skin along the anatomical location of the tested muscles. For the hip adductors, the ice bag will be applied to the medial side of the thigh, covering the entire area from the groin, to just above the knee joint. The cryotherapy session will be lasted for exactly 20 minutes . Sessions will be separated by a 30-minute rest interval</description>

    <description>Crushed ice in a plastic bag will be used, as it is a widely accessible and financially convenient method of cryotherapy. One half of a kilogram of ice will be placed in a plastic bag. The plastic bags will be 17 cm wide and 22 cm long. The air will be squeezed out of the bag and it will be sealed. The bag will be wrapped in a wet towel and applied to the tested area. Every five bags of crushed ice will be kept in an insulated foam container containing one kilogram of dry ice. Dry ice has a temperature of negative 80 degrees Celsius, and is used to keep the bags of crushed ice in a frozen state till the participants are briefed and the testing began.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  healthy females will participate in this study. All participants should have
             unrestricted ankle and hip joints range of motion as well as ankle and hip muscles
             strength grade four to five (using manual muscle testing).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if they had any previous history of hip
             or ankle joint neuromuscular or musculoskeletal injury or surgery, any pathology to
             the hip or ankle joints (i.e. abnormal ligament laxity and congenital deformities),
             any problems related to balance and stability.
