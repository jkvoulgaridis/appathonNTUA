    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of home-based functional exercise on patients with
      anterior cruciate ligament rupture reconstruction based on the health belief model. About 360
      participants will be randomly allocated into two groups. One group will randomized to receive
      precautions and rehabilitation progress reminders and other news by optimized WeChat applet
      regularly, while the other group will randomized to receive the rehabilitation exercise
      guidance during routine discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the development of national fitness and sports, the incidence of anterior cruciate
      ligament (ACL) injuries has increased. ACL reconstruction is the best treatment for ACL
      injury. The success rate of surgery is high, but the patient still needs to rehabilitate
      after surgery, otherwise it is difficult to fully recover knee function. However, the
      rehabilitation medical resources in China are obviously insufficient. Patients who have
      undergone ACL reconstruction usually return home to work according to the rehabilitation
      plan. However, the adherence is still poor, and it is difficult to achieve the expected
      effect. The WeChat public account and its affiliated applets have been widely used in
      different health fields. The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a guiding theory commonly used in
      health education to guide patients for behavioral changes. This study aims to use the WeChat
      small program to explore the effects of optimized the existing Peking University Third
      Hospital Sports Medicine WeChat small program by using HBM to improve the adherence of
      patients with home-based functional exercise after ACL injury reconstruction.

    <description>The Visual Analog or Analogue Scale (VAS) is designed to present to the respondent a rating scale with minimum constraints. Respondents mark the location on the 10-centimeter line corresponding to the amount of pain they experienced. This gives them the greatest freedom to choose their pain's exact intensity. It also gives the maximum opportunity for each respondent to express a personal response style. VAS data of this type is recorded as the number of millimeters from the left of the line with the range 0-100.
