  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) following female incontinence surgery ranges
      between 6-48%. The literature has shown mixed results of the therapeutic efficacy of
      cranberry extract to prevent UTI in females, with some promising preliminary work in the
      prevention of UTI's following gynecologic surgery. The researchers will conduct a study of
      the effect of cranberry extracts on preventing urinary tract infections following mid
      urethral slings, which are the most common urinary incontinence procedures.

      The researchers are going to perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of
      cranberry extract capsules for the prevention of UTI following incontinence surgery. They
      will recruit patients from a single hospital in a 24 month duration. Eligible participants
      are women undergoing elective incontinence procedures that does not involve fistula repair or
      vaginal mesh excision. The therapeutic regimen will be Theracran One cranberry capsules
      containing 36mg of proanthocyanidins and placebo cranberry capsules and placebo capsules.
      Both will be supplied by Theralogix Nutritional Sciences.

      Following randomization into treatment or placebo therapy, the participants will be asked to
      start prophylaxis on day of surgery for a duration of six weeks. The researchers will collect
      urine specimen via catheter upon insertion in the operating room. At time of discharge, the
      researchers will provide all participants with capsules for six weeks of the assigned regimen
      until they are seen for their post-operative visit.

      Participants will be told to contact research staff immediately and collect a urine specimen
      should they experience urinary symptoms consistent with UTI. The researchers will administer
      a brief structured interview regarding type and duration of symptoms and refer for treatment
      when necessary. Urine will be cultured using standard microbiologic techniques for the
      presence of uropathogens at one clinical laboratory.

      Participants will be asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire at the two week
      post-operative clinic visit and again at six weeks. At study exit, the researchers will
      collect capsule bottles to ensure and assess compliance.
