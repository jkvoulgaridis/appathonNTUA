  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to determine the safety and feasibility of
      detecting acoustic signals related to blood supply in subjects with acute large vessel
      occlusion (LVO) stroke by using the SONAS® device.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation will assess the performance of the SONAS® device in subjects with
      acute stroke admitted to the emergency department or stroke unit within 24 hours of symptoms
      onset and confirmed occlusion of either the proximal middle, distal M1-segment cerebral
      arteries, or distal internal carotid arteries (including carotid-T occlusion) by cerebral
      magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) or cerebral imaging computed tomography (cCT), including
      perfusion weighted (pw) imaging sequences, will be considered for the investigation.
