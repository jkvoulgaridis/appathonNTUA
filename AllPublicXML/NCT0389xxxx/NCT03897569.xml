      The study will investigate an association between ankle dorsiflexion and altered frontal knee
      kinematics during step down test in patients with PFPS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Altered frontal and transverse plane hip kinematics during single leg weight-bearing tasks
      are thought to be important contributors to patellofemoral pain (PFP). The closed chain
      nature of single leg tasks means that hip kinematics can be influenced by more distal
      mechanics, such as foot pronation.

      One of the often-studied distal movements theorized to cause PFPS is pronation of the
      subtalar joint. Pronation is a tri-planar movement that includes dorsiflexion, eversion, and
      abduction of the foot. Many studies have examined eversion characteristics of PFPS patients,
      but the dorsiflexion aspect of the movement has been shown to be a possible risk factor,
      restricting dorsiflexion was shown to increase medial knee displacement in young healthy
      adults. Conversely, when available dorsiflexion ROM is increased, medial knee displacement is
      thought to decrease.

      Patients with PFPS were observed to have a decreased DFROM (dorsiflexion range of motion) as
      compared to normal individuals, though this topic has not thoroughly been investigated.

    <description>Dorsiflexion measurements will be taken in 4 different positions and repeated and recorded 3 times in each position, Prone bent, straight knee and Standing bent, straight knee. Prior to the measurement, the participants completed two 30-second calf stretches The FPPA was determined as the angle at the knee formed by lines connecting the anterior superior iliac spine, the midpoint of the femoral condyles and the midpoint of the malleoli at the deepest part of the squat</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Anterior or retropatellar knee pain from at least 2 of the following Activities : (1)
             prolonged sitting; (2) stair climbing; (3) squatting; (4) running; (5) kneeling; and
             (6) hopping/jumping.

          2. Insidious onset of symptoms unrelated to a traumatic incident and persistent for at
             least 6weeks.

          3. VAS equal to or greater than 3.

          4. Age of the subject 18-35 years to limit the possibility that PFPS over age 35 may have
             been complicated by arthritic changes, and also the subjects should have closed
             epiphyseal growth plates.

          5. BMI under 30 kg/m2, both gender

        For the control group, subjects were recruited to this study if they had:

          1. No previous history or diagnosis of knee pathology.

          2. No pain with any of the above-mentioned provocative activities.

          3. No history of lower limb or spinal pathology.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of any of the following condition: meniscal or other intraarticular
             pathologic conditions; cruciate or collateral ligament involvement.

          2. A history of traumatic patellar subluxation or dislocation.

          3. Previous surgery in the lower extremities within the 12 months prior to participation
             in the study.

          4. Any balance impairments are secondary to a vestibular or neurological disorder or
             secondary to the use of medication.

          5. Any lower limb bony/congenital deformity
