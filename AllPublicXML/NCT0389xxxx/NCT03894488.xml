      This is a prospective single arm study with the study period from June 1st, 2019 to May 31st,
      2020. An historical control group will be used in the study, which includes all patients
      received HSCT but not GI panel detection between June 1st, 2018 to May 31st, 2019. All
      patients receiving HSCT within the year at SCMC will be enrolled in the study. The stool
      samples will be collected from each patient at 2-3 time points, including the day before
      pre-conditioning (T1), 28+-3 days after HSCT (T2), and the day severe diarrhea present (T3).
      All the stool samples will be detected by the FilmArray GI panel, and the results as well as
      other clinical information including the laboratory examinations will be recorded and
      analyzed.
