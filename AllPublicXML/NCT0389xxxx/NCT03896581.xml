    <measure>American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response at Week 16</measure>

    <measure>Psoriasis Area Severity Index 90 (PASI90) response at Week 4 in the subgroup of subjects with psoriasis (PSO) involving at least 3% body surface area (BSA) at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Area Severity Index 90 (PASI90) response is based on at least 90% improvement in the PASI score compared to Baseline.
The PASI is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI=average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0=no disease, the maximum score is 72=maximal disease.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI is derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living actives (using 20 questions). Each question is scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do). Thus, the mean also has a range from 0-3. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 24 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>There are 8 SF-36 domain scores. In addition to domain scores, the PCS scores are calculated from the 8 domains. Each of the 8 domain scores and the component summary scores ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status. A larger positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) is a state of disease activity deemed a useful target of treatment by both the patient and physician, given current treatment possibilities and limitations. Criteria covering all domains of the disease have been developed to determine whether or not a patient has reached MDA based on key outcome measures in Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA).
A subject is considered as having MDA if 5 or more of the following 7 criteria are fulfilled: 1) Tender joint count &lt;=1, 2) Swollen joint count &lt;=1, 3) PASI &lt;=1 or BSA &lt;=3; 4) Patient pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) &lt;=15, 5) Patient global activity VAS &lt;=20, 6) Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) &lt;=0.5 and 7) Tender enthesial points &lt;=1.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain (PtAAP) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PtAAP Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or 'Pain VAS' is part of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set of measures in arthritis. Subjects will assess their arthritis pain using a VAS where 0 is &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 is &quot;most severe pain.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease-12 (PsAID-12) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PsAID-12 is a patient-reported outcome measure for assessing the impact of Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) in 12 physical and psychological domains, including pain, fatigue, skin problems, work and/or leisure activities, functional capacity, discomfort, sleep disturbance, coping, anxiety/fear/uncertainty, embarrassment and/or shame, social participation, and depression. Each domain is assessed with a single question using a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. Each domain score is multiplied by a weighting factor and the results are then summed to provide the total score. The total score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse status. A score below 4 out of 10 is considered a patient-acceptable status. A change of 3 or more points is considered relevant absolute change.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this study may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized IPD and redacted study documents which may include: raw datasets, analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, blank case report form, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a pre-specified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if a determination is made that the data cannot be adequately anonymized.</ipd_description>
