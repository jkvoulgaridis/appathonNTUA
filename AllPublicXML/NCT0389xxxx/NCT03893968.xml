      Objectives: to compare patients' recall of information regarding postoperative self-care when
      being informed by either doctors or assistant nurses.

      Methods: a non-blinded randomized single-center controlled trial being conducted at a
      hand-surgical unit in Northern Sweden. Included are adult ambulatory patients about to
      undergo surgery in local anesthesia. Patients are randomized into two parallel groups, with
      the control-group being informed by doctors and the intervention-group by assistant nurses.
      Patients will be telephoned one week after surgery for assessment of information recall via a
      structured telephone-interview.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted within the hand-surgical unit at Norrland's University Hospital in
      Umeå, county of Västerbotten, in Sweden. There are three hospitals in this sparsely populated
      county of 55432〖km〗^2 with about 268000 in population. The hand-surgery unit serves both the
      local population and is a tertiary referral center.

      As the healthcare in Sweden is funded by taxpayers, the healthcare for patients is free,
      apart from a small nominal fee. There was a total of seven doctors and seven assistant nurses
      participating in the study, all having several years of experience working with hand-surgical
      care. Prior to the study, doctors had the formal responsibility of informing patients about
      their postoperative care. However, despite it being the surgeons' responsibility, the task of
      informing patients was at times performed by assistant nurses. After receiving the
      information, patients were discharged and left the clinic. Normally patients receive a
      complementary written information after being informed verbally. Patients included in the
      study did not receive the written information, since it might have been a confounding factor
      in understanding of information.

    <measure>Information recall</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A telephone-interviews were performed seven days after the surgery using a structured questionnaire. For the main objective, seven questions were asked testing patients recall/knowledge of their postoperative self-care. Each question evaluated the patients' knowledge of a unique aspect of postoperative self-care. The questionnaire is designed based on the postoperative info sheet received by patients after hand surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress and satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>During the telephone interview the patients could rate on a 1-10 scale their level of &quot;feeling of understood the information&quot;, stress, and satisfaction. &quot;Feeling of having understood the information&quot; means the patients perception of having fully understood all the information and knowing fully what to do when leaving the hospital. For assessing &quot;stress&quot;, the interviewer asked about the level of stress that the patient had experienced during the week following the surgery. Regarding &quot;satisfaction&quot;, the interviewer asked and assessed how satisfied the patients were with the way the personnel had informed the patient (e.g. not used difficult or confusing language, had given the patient time to ask questions etc).</description>
