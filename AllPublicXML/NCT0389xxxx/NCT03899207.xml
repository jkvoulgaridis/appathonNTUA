    <textblock>
      The study was conducted to determine the effect of acupressure and training, given to women
      under the guidance of health belief model for coping with premenstrual syndrome, on the
      premenstrual symptoms and quality of life.

      This study was conducted to as a randomized controlled trial. The population of the study was
      composed of all women with PMS registered in FHCs no. 4 and 14 located in the city center.
      The sample of the study consisted of women including 51 women in training +acupressure group,
      55 women in training group and 57 women in control group. The data were collected with
      Participant Information Form, PMSS and WHOQOL-BREF in the study. Training and acupressure
      were administered to the acupressure + training group. Only the training for coping with
      premenstrual syndrome was given to the training group. The data collection forms were
      reapplied to all groups 12 weeks after the pretest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premenstrual Syndrome is an important collection of symptoms affecting approximately
      one-fifth of women in reproductive age.

      Acupressure is an intervention found in the nursing intervention system and defined as
      applying constant and powerful pressure on certain/specific points of the body in order to
      reduce pain, provide relaxation and relief, and to prevent or reduce nausea. Many studies
      conducted in gynecology have shown that acupressure decreased menstrual distress,
      premenstrual symptoms, back pain in women experiencing dysmenorrhea, labor pain and nausea
      and vomiting during pregnancy. In addition, it was shown in the studies that training given
      for PMS decreased the premenstrual symptoms

    <time_frame>10 month</time_frame>
    <description>The premenstrual syndrome scale,The lowest score to be taken from the scale is 44 and the highest score is 220. High score shows an increase in the intensity of the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. If the total scale score is higher than 50% (110) of the highest score (220) in PMS scale, PMS is considered as &quot;present&quot;.In the calculation of WHOQOL-BREF scoring, 1st and 2nd items are evaluated independently while the answers obtained from the 3rd, 4th, 26th and 27th questions are reversely scored since they indicate negative statements. The scale does not have a total score. Higher scores obtained from the subscales of the scale indicate that the quality of life level is high.</description>
