    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess and compare the efficacy of tranexamic acid
      intradermal microinjection alone versus its combination with low power fractional CO2 laser
      in a sequential pattern.

      In all participants one half of the face will be randomly assigned to low power fractional
      CO2 laser while other side to Tranexamic acid intradermal microinjections on the 1st session.
      This split face session will be repeated every six weeks for 3 sessions.

      In addition, Tranexamic acid intradermal microinjections will be applied for full face at the
      2nd and 4th week of each split face session.

      The response will be evaluated by the Melanin and erythema Indices which will be measured
      using reflectance spectrophotometer, Dermoscopy and photography before starting the study,
      two and four weeks after the last session. The sessions will take 4 months for each patient
      and another one month free of sessions for follow up.
