  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      People with alcohol use disorder (AUD) have trouble controlling their drinking. Medications
      can help some people with AUD but are not effective for many others. Researchers want to test
      new drugs to better treat the disease.

      Objective:

      To see if the drug GLWL-01 is safe to use in people with alcohol problems. Also, to find out
      if the drug reduces the urge to drink alcohol.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18-70 who are seeking treatment for AUD

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under protocol 14-AA-00181.

      Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for up to 32 days. They may leave
      the hospital some of the time. All their meals will be provided. They cannot drink alcohol.

      Participants will take either the study drug or a placebo by mouth twice daily. They will not
      know which they are receiving.

      Participants will complete many questionnaires.

      Participants may have urine tests.

      Participants will complete tasks on a computer.

      Participants will have blood tests each day.

      Participants will taste and indicate their preference for sweet liquids.

      Participants blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, body temperature and weight, heart rate
      and rhythm will be measured.

      Participants will have breath testing to obtain information about smoking.

      Participants will be exposed to alcohol cues, water, and food cues in a bar-like room. Cues
      are things that might make them feel the urge to eat or drink alcohol.

      Participants will take part in a virtual buffet experiment. They will wear a virtual reality
      headset, walk around a virtual room, and select virtual food and drink.

      Background and Objective:

      Acyl-ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide that stimulates appetite and food intake. It is an
      endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1a). Preclinical studies
      suggest that acyl-ghrelin increases alcohol intake (Szulc, Mikolajczak et al. 2013, Cepko et
      al. 2014) and decreases in acyl-ghrelin and GHS-R1a function suppresses alcohol consumption
      (Kaur and Ryabinin 2010, Landgren et al. 2012, Bahi et al. 2013, Suchankova et al. 2013,
      Gomez and Ryabinin 2014, Suchankova, Engel et al. 2016 Furthermore, previous human studies
      indicate a positive correlation between endogenous ghrelin levels and alcohol craving and
      drinking (Addolorato, Capristo et al.2006). In clinical studies conducted by our group with
      individuals with AUD, intravenous (IV) acyl-ghrelin administration, versus placebo 1)
      increased alcohol craving during alcohol cue-exposure and 2) increased IV alcohol
      self-administration as well as decreased latency to first infusion of alcohol and 3)
      increased brain activation in the amygdala in anticipation of alcohol reward. Together, this
      preclinical and human data suggest that manipulating the ghrelin signal may be a novel and
      potentially effective pharmacological approach to treat individuals with alcohol use
      disorder.

      After the discoveries of GHS-R1a and acyl-ghrelin, a next step was identifying ghrelin
      O-acyltransferase (GOAT) the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of des-acyl-ghrelin (DAG)
      to acyl-ghrelin via octanoylation. GOAT is thus the master switch for the ghrelin system , as
      acyl-ghrelin, not DAG, is biologically active at the GHSR-1a. GOAT s structure is highly
      conserved, is produced by endocrine cells in the stomach and is co-expressed with ghrelin.
      Therefore, GOAT is a promising target for manipulating the ghrelin system by altering the
      peripheral acyl-to-total ghrelin ratio (where total ghrelin = acyl-ghrelin + DAG). Recently,
      the ghrelin system has been investigated as a potential treatment target for AUDs. As such,
      an oral bioavailable GOAT inhibitor offers encouraging potential as a treatment for alcohol
      use disorder. GLWL-01 is an existing GOAT inhibitor for which GLWL Research Inc. has recently
      and successfully completed a first-in-human safety clinical trial. The goal of this protocol
      is to conduct a proof-of-concept human laboratory study to assess a potential early signal of
      efficacy of GLWL-01 in relation to alcohol-related outcomes.

      Study population:

      Males and females (N = 43) with alcohol use disorder.

      Study Design:

      A within-subject, counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants will
      take GLWL-01 450 mg b.i.d. or matched placebo for a minimum of 4 days (Stage I). After a
      wash-out window, Stage II will take place during which the counterbalanced study drug will be
      administered for a minimum of 4 days.

      Primary outcome measure:

      The co-primary aims will be to determine whether: 1) the number of adverse events (AEs)
      experienced differ in the GLWL-01 condition, compared to placebo; and 2) GLWL-01, compared to
      placebo, reduces alcohol cue-elicited craving using a validated alcohol cue-reactivity
      procedure.

      Secondary outcome measures:

      The main secondary aim will be the effects of GLWL-01 on food choices using a virtual buffet
      experimental procedure. We will also monitor a wide range of behavioral measures including
      e.g., pain, anxiety, depression, alcohol craving and withdrawal, and smoking.

          -  Male or female individuals 18-70 years old (inclusive)

          -  Able to speak, read, write and understand English

          -  Most recent urine drug test for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, cocaine metabolites,
             morphine, oxycodone, methadone, amphetamine, &amp; buprenorphine is negative

          -  Most recent Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-revised (CIWA-Ar)
             score is less than or equal to 8

          -  Penn Alcohol Craving Score (PACs) is &gt;=15

        Males only:

        -Males agrees agree to sexual abstinence or to use a reliable method of birth control
        during the study and 3 months following the last dose of the study drug. Acceptable methods
        of birth control may include: 1) condom with spermicide; 2) diaphragm with spermicide; or
        3) female condom with spermicide.

        Females only:

        -Women of child-bearing potential may participate in the study:

          -  if they test negative for pregnancy (based on a urine pregnancy test) prior to
             initiation of treatment

          -  they must also agree to use either 1 highly effective method of contraception or a
             combination of 2 effective methods of contraception during the study.

               -  Highly effective method may include hormonal contraceptives (e.g., combined oral
                  contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants); intrauterine
                  device or/ intrauterine system; vasectomy and tubal ligation.

               -  Effective methods may include barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male
                  condom, female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge)

        Women may choose to use a double-barrier method of contraception. Barrier methods without
        concomitant use of a spermicide are not reliable or an acceptable method. Thus, each
        barrier method must include use of a spermicide. It should be noted that the use of male
        and female condoms as a double-barrier method is not considered acceptable due to the high
        failure rate when these methods are combined.
