          6. Subjects has a negative evaluation for tuberculosis within 4 weeks before initiating
             study treatment, defined as a negative QuantiFERON® test. Subjects with a positive or
             2 successive indeterminate QuantiFERON® tests are allowed if they have all of the
             following:

               -  No history of active tuberculosis or symptoms of tuberculosis

                  highly effective method of contraception

               -  Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential who are not using
                  birth control as described above must use a barrier method of contraception (eg,
                  condom) if not surgically sterile (ie, vasectomy)

               -  Subject is a surgically sterilized female or is documented to be postmenopausal.

          8. For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and
             a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to Day 1 and on subsequent
             visits at which study treatment doses are scheduled.

          9. Subjects must have results of a physical examination within normal limits or
             clinically acceptable limits to the Investigator prior to Day 1. The Investigator is
             encouraged to consult with the Medical Monitor (or appropriate designee) if there are
             questions regarding the significance of any out-of-range values.

         10. Subjects must be capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance
             with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form and in this
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have laboratory abnormalities at Screening including any of the
             following:

               -  Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase ≥2.5 × the upper limit of
                  normal

               -  Creatinine ≥2 × the upper limit of normal

               -  Serum direct bilirubin ≥1.5 mg/dL

               -  White blood cell count &lt;3.0 × 103/μL

               -  Any other laboratory abnormality, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, will
                  prevent the subject from completing the study or will interfere with the
                  interpretation of the study results.

          2. Subjects who have predominantly non-plaque forms of psoriasis specifically
             erythrodermic psoriasis, predominantly pustular psoriasis, medication-induced or
             medication-exacerbated psoriasis, or new-onset guttate psoriasis.

          3. Subjects with ongoing inflammatory skin diseases other than psoriasis or any other
             disease affecting the fingernails which may potentially confound the evaluation of
             study treatment.

          4. Subjects with fungal nail infection should be excluded from the study. Subjects in
             whom the Investigator suspects a fungal nail infection* (see Appendix 8) in addition
             to nail psoriasis should have scrapings sent for direct microscopy and fungal culture.
             If fungal culture or direct microscopy of nail scrapings turn out to be positive for
             fungal infection, the subject should be excluded from the study. *Subjects with fungal
             nail infection whose fungal culture will be sent to laboratory would have a Screening
             Period of 6 weeks.

          5. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, intend to become pregnant (within 6
             months of completing the study), or are lactating.

          6. Subjects with any infection or history of recurrent infection requiring treatment with
             systemic antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to Screening, or severe infection (eg,
             pneumonia, cellulitis, bone or joint infections) requiring hospitalization or
             treatment with intravenous antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to Screening.

          7. Subjects with any previous use of tildrakizumab or other IL-23/Th-17 pathway
             inhibitors, including p40, p19 and IL-17 antagonists for psoriasis.

             • Prior use of TNF-alpha inhibitors with a wash-out period of 12 weeks would be
             allowed. However, the number of subjects with prior use of TNF-alpha inhibitors would
             be capped at 40% and the analysis will be stratified based on prior use of these
             biologics.

          8. Subjects with a positive human immunodeficiency virus test result, hepatitis B surface
             antigen, or hepatitis C virus test result.

          9. Subjects with a prior malignancy or concurrent malignancy (excluding successfully
             treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in situ, squamous
             cell carcinoma of skin with no evidence of recurrence within 5 years or carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix that has been adequately treated).

         10. Subjects who have received live viral or bacterial vaccination within 4 weeks prior to
             Baseline or who intend to receive live viral or bacterial vaccination during the
             study.

         11. Subjects who are currently participating in another interventional clinical study or
             has participated in an interventional clinical study within 5 half-lives (of the drug)
             to wash out prior to randomization. (Subjects participating in observational studies
             or non- interventional registry studies may be included in the study).

         12. Subjects or a family member is among the personnel of the study center or
             Sponsor/designee staff directly involved with this study.

         13. Subjects who have any concomitant medical condition which in the opinion of the
             Investigator could affect the study outcome or present an unacceptable risk.

         14. Subjects who were hospitalized due to an acute cardiovascular event (such as
             myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, cardiovascular illness [eg, angina
             pectoris], or cardiovascular surgery [such as coronary artery bypass]) within 6 months
             before Screening.

         15. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not be a reliable participant
             in the study and those who can confound the results of the study.

         16. Subjects who have a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the previous year.

         17. Subjects who have high risk of suicidality at the Screening assessment based on
             Investigator's judgment or, if appropriate, as indicated by a response of &quot;yes&quot; within
             the last 12 months to Questions 4 or 5 in the suicidal ideation section, or any
             positive response in the behavioral section of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating
             Scale.

         18. Subjects with any other clinically significant laboratory abnormality, which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, will prevent the subject from completing the study or
             will interfere with the interpretation of the study results.
