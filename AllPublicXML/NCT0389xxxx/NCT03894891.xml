      This research is being performed to treat patient for head and neck cancer patients who have
      not received prior chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug or combination of interventions is
      being studied.

      Nivolumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      recurrent or advanced head and neck cancer (head and neck cancer that has come back or is
      incurable) but is considered investigational for head and neck cancer patients who have not
      received prior chemotherapy.

             be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose
             of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (ie, who are
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require
             contraception

             therapy are not excluded. Short-term corticosteroid dosing is permitted (i.e.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus carrier or a diagnosis of immunodeficiency. Any
             positive test result for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating presence of

             Hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) positive (except if HCV-RNA negative).

          -  Known non-infectious pneumonitis or any history of interstitial lung disease.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer, and
             low-risk prostate adenocarcinoma being managed with active surveillance. A history of
             another separate malignancy in remission without evidence of active disease in the
