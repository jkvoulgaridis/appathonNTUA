  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by thromboembolic
      events or pregnancy complications associated with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies
      (aPL-Abs). APS diagnosis needs the presence of both clinical and serological criteria
      (SAPORRO criteria, updated with Sydney criteria in 2006). However, no correlation between
      laboratory assays and the clinical thrombosis risk in patients with aPL-Abs was observed as
      only few patients with aPL-Abs developed clinical manifestations. Thrombin generation assays
      (TGA) is a global coagulation test that may represent a certain interest to evaluate
      thrombosis risk as a high thrombin generation capacity seems to be an independent risk factor
      for recurrent thromboembolic events. Another point of interest to assess the thrombotic risk
      is the detection of autoantibodies recognizing domain 1 of β2Gp1 (aβ2GP1-dm1). These
      autoantibodies are strongly related correlated with thrombotic and pregnancy manifestations.
      Recently, a commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for detection of aβ2GP1-dm1
      became available on Acustar® analyzer (HemosIL Acustar®, Instrument Laboratory, Bedford, USA)
      to facilitate aβ2GP1-dm1 research.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate two additional laboratory assays to improve the
      correlation between laboratory assays and the clinical thrombosis risk in patients with
      antiphospholipid (APL): thrombin generation assay and aβ2GP1-dm1. Each biological result
      (Antibodies to Domain 1 (Dm1) of β2-Glycoprotein 1 (aβ2GP1-dm1) and Thrombin Generation Test
      (TGT) parameters: endogen thrombin potential (ETP), lag time and time to peak) will be
      compared to the history of clinical thrombosis (venous or arterial thrombosis and/or
      obstetrical complications such as defined by the Saporro criteria updated with Sydney
      criteria in 2006) for each patient.
