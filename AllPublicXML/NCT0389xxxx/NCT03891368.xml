  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare organizations have increasingly formed quality-improvement Learning Collaboratives
      to improve care for specific populations; however, there are few data on the effectiveness of
      this strategy compared to conventional training approaches. The primary aim of this cluster
      randomized implementation trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual learning
      collaborative (VLC) in the implementation of a lifestyle intervention for persons with
      serious mental illness (SMI) in routine mental health settings, compared to typical
      implementation consisting of site training and one-on-one individual technical assistance
      (TA). The investigators hypothesize that VLC compared to TA will be associated with greater
      Program Participation, Program Fidelity, and a greater proportion of participants achieving
      clinically significant weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the existence of a variety of evidence-based health promotion practices, it is not
      well documented how to effectively transform community mental health organizations to embrace
      wellness as central to their mission and services. Healthcare organizations have increasingly
      formed quality-improvement Learning Collaboratives to improve care for specific populations;
      however, there are few data on the effectiveness of this strategy compared to conventional
      training approaches. The primary aim of this cluster randomized implementation trial is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual learning collaborative (VLC) in the implementation of
      a lifestyle intervention for persons with serious mental illness (SMI) in routine mental
      health settings, compared to typical implementation consisting of site training and
      one-on-one individual technical assistance (TA). Forty-eight mental health provider
      organizations from across the United States providing behavioral health services to people
      with SMI will be recruited to participate in collaboration with the National Council for
      Behavioral Health. The evidence-based practice to be implemented is the InSHAPE health
      coaching intervention for persons with SMI. Sites will be stratified by size and randomized
      to receive an 18-month intensive group-based VLC with monthly learning sessions or individual
      technical assistance with four scheduled conference calls over 18 months. Sites will be
      enrolled in three blocks of 16 sites each. The investigators will compare implementation VLC
      to TA with respect to service outcomes, implementation outcomes, and participant outcomes:

      Aim 1 (Service Outcomes): Compare the effectiveness of VLC to TA with respect to Program
      Participation as measured by the proportion of enrolled individuals who received an adequate
      exposure to the evidence-based practice, as defined by attending at least 50% of the InSHAPE
      Health Mentor sessions over 6 months.

      (H1) Hypothesis: VLC compared to TA will be associated with greater Program Participation.

      Aim 2 (Implementation Outcomes): Compare VLC to TA with respect to Program Fidelity as
      measured by the InSHAPE Fidelity Scale.

      (H2) Hypothesis: VLC compared to TA will be associated with greater Program Fidelity.

      Aim 3 (Participant Outcomes): Compare VLC to TA with respect to adult participants with SMI
      enrolled in the InSHAPE program achieving clinically significant weight loss (≥5% weight
      loss).

      (H3) Hypothesis: VLC compared to TA will be associated with a greater proportion of InSHAPE
      participants achieving clinically significant weight loss.

      Secondary aims:

      The investigators will also examine the following exploratory hypotheses: VLC compared to TA
      will result in (E1) more rapid Full Program Operation; (E2) greater Program Uptake; (E3)
      significantly improved participant health behaviors of physical activity and nutrition; and
      (E4) greater likelihood of Program Sustainability at 24 months. The investigators will also
      explore (E5) the effect of Organizational Change and VLC fidelity on Program Participation,
      and (E6) agency participation and adherence to the core elements of a Learning Collaborative
      as a predictor of InSHAPE program participation, InSHAPE program fidelity, and participant
      weight outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Program Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, 18, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Program Participation will be measured as the proportion of InHAPE participants who have been enrolled and have received adequate exposure to the intervention, defined by attending at least 50% of health mentor sessions over 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Program Fidelity</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Program Fidelity will be measured using the 22-item InSHAPE Fidelity Scale which assesses structural elements of program implementation in the domains of staffing, organization, and services. Items are rated on a 5-point behaviorally-anchored scale ranging from 1 (not implemented) to 5 (fully implemented) (e.g., weekly review of exercise objectives is scored 5 if 90-100% of required exercise logs are completed, a score of 1 represents 0-24%). The 22 items give a total score ranging from 22 to 110, with a higher score indicating stronger fidelity to the InSHAPE model.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Participant Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, quarterly through 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant Weight will be defined as clinically significant weight loss of ≥5% body weight since baseline, and weight will be measured to the tenth of a pound on a digital bathroom scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Full Program Operation defined as a 1.0 FTE Health Mentor with a caseload of 20 participants</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Full Program Operation will be measured by time to having 1.0 FTE Health Mentor with a caseload of 20 participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Program Uptake defined as the number of 1.0 FTE Health Mentors</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Program Uptake will be measured by the number of 1.0 FTE Health Mentors and participants served at 12 and 24 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Participant Cardiorespiratory Fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, quarterly through 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant Cardiorespiratory Fitness will be assessed using the 6-Minute Walk Test, which measures the distance an individual can walk in six minutes. An increase in distance of &gt;50 meters on the 6-MWT is associated with clinically significant reduction in risk for cardiovascular disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Participant Dietary Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, quarterly through 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant Dietary Behavior will be assessed using Weight Loss Behavior Stages of Change Scale. Higher scores indicate greater readiness to change dietary behaviors. An overall dietary behavior score consisting of the mean for the items related to three domains: portion control, consumption of dietary fat, and intake of fruits and vegetables will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Participant Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, quarterly through 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant Physical Activity will be assessed using the short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Summary scores will be calculated for vigorous activities obtaining an estimate of weekly metabolic equivalent expenditure (MET) minutes of vigorous physical activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Program Sustainability defined as having a Health Mentor who meets with at least one InSHAPE participant</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Program Sustainability at 24-month follow-up will be measured by the number of sites still implementing InSHAPE, as defined by having a Health Mentor who has a personal trainer certification and who meets with at least one InSHAPE participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Organizational Change that supports an organization's capacity to implement and sustain the InSHAPE program</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Organizational Change will be measured using the Dartmouth Organizational Structure Scale (DOSS), an 11-item interviewer-rated scale developed by the investigators. It measures a set of practices and procedures aimed at supporting the organization's capacity to implement and sustain the InSHAPE program. The content dimensions include leadership, financing, policies, agency commitment to the evidence-based practice, process and outcome monitoring for quality improvement, and other organizational factors found in prior implementation studies to be associated with successful implementation of evidence-based practices. Each DOSS item is scored on a 5-point behavioral-anchored continuum. The interviewer assesses five objective criteria for each item, giving one point for each criterion met for a maximum score of 5. The 11 items are summed, yielding a total DOSS score with possible values ranging from 11 to 55, with a higher score indicating greater organizational change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in VLC Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>VLC Adherence will be measured using an 11-item VLC Adherence Tool. The tool was developed by the investigators for the study based on a review of the literature, feedback from experts and the research team, and feasibility testing. Key domains include the extent to which a team engages in verbal participation, chat box participation, implementation progress, use of quality improvement tools or approaches, use of data collection to drive improvement, collaborative learning and sharing, and planning for program sustainment. VLC faculty score each team on every domain by consensus at the conclusion of each learning session based on a review of submitted homework, participation, and group interaction. Total score ranges from 0 (poor VLC adherence) to 41 (strong VLC adherence).</description>
