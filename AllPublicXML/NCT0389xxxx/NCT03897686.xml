  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this double-blinded controlled study is to assess clinical efficacy and safety of
      intra-articular polyacrylamide hydrogel with ions of silver in comparison with placebo (0.9%
      sodium chloride solution) in Kellgren Lawrence radiological grade II-III knee osteoarthritis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polyacrylamide hydrogel (hereinafter - PAHG) is intended for a symptomatic effect leading to
      the decrease of joint pain intensity and improvement of functional joint characteristics.
      Therefore PAHG is intended for symptom-modifying therapy of joint osteoarthritis (hereinafter
      - OA). The aim of this study is to estimate efficacy and safety of intra-articular injections
      of PAHG in comparison with saline solution. Men and women above 50 years with verified knee
      osteoarthritis in accordance with the ACR criteria will be randomized 2 groups depends on
      treatment (PAHG or saline solution). Each patient will receive to the target knee joint 4.0
      ml for one injection either PAHG or placebo with one-week interval between injections. Course
      - 2 injections. To avoid the joint overfilling with the dense, slowly resorbing material,
      with a good clinical result, the course of injections will be stopped. Primary and secondary
      efficacy endpoints, and safety parameters will be assessed on visits on Week 6, 13 and 25.
