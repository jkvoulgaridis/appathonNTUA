    <textblock>
      In the Low Anterior Resection of rectum for cancer, the section level of IMA and the need of
      SFM is still debated.

      The aim of this study is to explore the different impacts of high and low ligation with
      peeling off vascular sheath of inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) in low anterior resection of
      the rectum for cancer. This study purpose to demonstrate that low IMA ligation, sparing of
      left colic artery (LCA) and selective SFM results in higher anastomotic leakage rate than
      high IMA ligation with routine SFM (with the difference of more than 5%).

      Although TME is the standard curative operation for rectal cancer patients, who undergo low
      anterior resection (LAR) or abdominoperineal resection (APR) with a permanent colostomy, the
      strategy to restore the transit between colon and rectum (in case of LAR) is still debated in
      literature.

      Several studies comparing high-tie with low-tie ligation reported a stage-specific survival
      benefit for high-tie, but on the other hand recent studies demonstrated that low-tie, without
      splenic flexure mobilization (SFM), decreases the complexity of the laparoscopic procedure
      and could reduces the operating time with comparable oncological outcomes.

      The method of restorative surgery, after Total Mesorectal Excision (TME), largely depends on
      the length of the resected part of the colon, that is related to patient's anatomical
      features and the height of vascular ligation performed during the operation.

      In attempt to perform a radical paraaortic lymph node dissection the inferior mesenteric
      artery (IMA) is usually ligated at its origin and the Arcade of Riolan provides bloody supply
      to any distal anastomosis. Unfortunately the Arcade of Riolan is an inconstant finding and
      sometimes (26% of cases) is mandatory to mobilize the splenic flexure to ensure a safe and
      tension-free anastomosis. SFM is a time-consuming component of LAR, has the additional risk
      of iatrogenic splenic injury and is very difficult during a laparoscopic resection.

      In 2005 was demonstrated that routine SFM is not always necessary during anterior resection
      for rectal cancer.

      A recent retrospective analysis by Mouw showed that SFM was associated with wider margins and
      a decreased rate of inadequate nodal staging in patients undergoing LAR.

      This trial aims to demonstrate that low IMA ligation, sparing of LCA and selective SFM
      results in higher anastomotic leakage rate than high IMA ligation with routine SFM (with the
      difference of more than 5%). Furthermore this study purpose to evaluate the need to perform
      splenic flexure mobilization (SFM) in low ligation group and the, operation time, apical
      lymph nodes positive rate and short terms postoperative complication in both groups
