  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prazosin has shown effectiveness in treating Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder through improving
      sleep quality and global functioning. Given the significant evidence for its utility in
      treating PTSD, in combination with the fact that many anxiety symptoms overlap with PTSD
      (e.g.insomnia, hyperarousal, and irritability), it is essential to evaluate its potential
      effectiveness in treating symptoms of other anxiety disorder and patient tolerability.
