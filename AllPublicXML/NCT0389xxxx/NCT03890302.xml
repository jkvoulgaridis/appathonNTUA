  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is not fully understood. However, one of the
      substances secreted by certain cells in the body, interleukin-6 (IL-6), is believed to play a
      major role in chronic inflammation that is typical in RA. This study investigates the drug
      FB704A, which is believed to lower the inflammation caused by IL-6. This study will be in 2
      sequential parts: a single increasing dose part (Part 1) and a multiple-increasing dose part
      (Part 2). Subjects will receive either active or placebo drug by IV infusion. Subjects in
      both parts will have a short stay in the clinic at the start of the study, then will return
      for outpatient visits.
