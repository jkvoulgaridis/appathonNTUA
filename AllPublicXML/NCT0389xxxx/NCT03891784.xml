  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well abemaciclib works in treating patients with digestive
      system neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to other places in the body, do not respond to
      treatment, and cannot be removed by surgery. Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 4
      months for up to 1 year.
