  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants that undergo permanent cardiac pacemaker implantation can often present with
      challenging anesthetic management plans for the anesthesia provider. Typically, these
      procedures are performed in electrophysiology labs that are often in remote locations away
      from the main operating room suite. This presents the logistic challenges of not having
      standard anesthesia machines, equipment and medications readily available for these
      cases.Currently, the majority of these cases are done under local anesthesia with light to
      moderate sedation. However, when it comes to inserting more complex devices such as
      implantable cardiac defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices,
      participants may not be able to tolerate these more invasive and painful procedures with only
      local anesthetic as the primary mode of analgesia.

      Ultrasound-guided regional anesthetic techniques, in particular the pectoralis nerve blocks
      (PEC I and II) and the Transversus Thoracic Muscle plane block (TTP), offer an alternative
      mode of analgesia for these participants. PEC I blocks target the lateral and medial pectoral
      nerves by injecting local anesthetic in the fascial plane between the pectoralis major and
      minor muscles. PEC II blocks supplement the PEC I block by targeting the intercostal nerves
      with local anesthetic injected between the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles.
      The transversus thoracic plane block targets the anterior cutaneous branches of the
      intercostal nerves. In combination, these four blocks would provide analgesia of the upper
      anterior chest wall.(3)These would provide effective analgesia of the upper anterior chest
      wall.(7).

      However, there is a paucity of studies on the use of PEC blocks in cardiac pacemaker
      implantation procedures. There is a case report from 2014 on a 71 year-old male with an
      ejection fraction of 20% undergoing CRTD implantation, which showed that PECs block with
      moderate sedation using dexmedetomidine could be safely utilized to provide effective
      analgesia for the procedure.11 However, this was not a subcutaneous ICD that required
      tunneling of the coils. Thus there are no randomized controlled studies to investigate
      whether the use of peripheral nerve blocks as primary anesthetic choice could be a viable
      alternative for multiple participants undergoing subcutaneous ICD placement.

      This is a randomized controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of PEC I, PEC II,
      Transversus Thoracic plane blocks as the primary anesthetic in participants undergoing
      subcutaneous implantable defibrillator. There will be two groups; the nerve block group vs.
      general anesthesia group. The participants in the nerve block group will receive an
      ultrasound-guided nerve block in the electrophysiology suite prior to the start of the
      procedure. Participants will get a PEC I block with 10ml of 0.375% ropivacaine, PEC II block
      with 15ml of 0.375% ropivacaine, 15ml of 0.375% ropivacaine for TTP. PEC I block entails
      injecting local anesthesia between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles to
      anesthetize the medial and lateral pectoral nerves. PEC II block entails injecting local
      anesthetic between the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles to block the upper
      intercostal nerves. For Tranversus Thoracic Plane block, local anesthetic will be injected
      between the internal intercostal muscle and the Transversus Thoracic muscle. The participants
      in the nerve block group will get mild sedation during the nerve blocks (midazolam 1-2mg IV
      and fentanyl 50-100mcg IV). After block placement, patient will be given a 0.3mcg/kg bolus of
      dexmedetomidine, then an infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.4mcg/kg/hr- 0.7mcg/kg/hr r +/-
      propofol 25mcg/kg/min-100mcg/kg/min for sedation. The general anesthesia group of
      participants will get the current standard of care with an endotracheal tube with a
      combination of IV induction medications and volatile anesthetic. Research assistant will hand
      an enclosed envelope to the anesthesiologists with the name of the group consented patient
      will be in.

      Intraoperatively, the anesthesiologist will note if supplemental opioids and local anesthetic
      was required. Postoperatively, the PACU nurse will be asked to document pain scores according
      to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and total dose of opioids given. The distribution of the
      sensory block and motor weakness will be documented in the anesthesiologist's PACU discharge
      note. For postoperative data collection, opioid consumption totals and the pain scores at 30
      minutes after arrival in PACU and at discharge.
