    <textblock>
      This 16 week placebo-controlled study evaluates the safety and impact of two medical food
      study products, WBF10 and WBF11, consisting of commensal microbes. The primary endpoints were
      safety, glucose AUC during meal tolerance test and C reactive protein (CRP)..

    <textblock>
      Targeting the microbiome for treating metabolic syndrome has been gaining traction with
      multiple population studies demonstrating a difference between healthy individuals and
      patients with metabolic syndrome. Whole Biome has identified and created two medical food
      formulations (MFFs) aimed at improving metabolic syndrome via two mechanisms of action
      targeting the microbiome: (1) increasing butyrate production and (2) increasing mucin
      regulation.

      This randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study assesses the safety
      and metabolic effects of 2 MFFs on glucose control and the generalized inflammatory state
      associated with Type 2 Diabetes. The microbes have been fully characterized, certified as
      Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) and manufactured to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
      standards. The target population was patients with Type 2 Diabetes who either had not been
      treated with antidiabetic agents or treated with metformin +/- a sulfonylurea. Subjects were
      randomized in a balanced manner to receive capsules containing placebo, WBF10 or WBF11.

    <description>Subjects respond to 14 questions; 7 anxiety focused and 7 depression focused. Responses of &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;not much&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot; and &quot;definitely&quot; are translated to a numerical score of 0 to 4 respectively. For 2 of the depression related questions, the scoring scale is reversed. The individual numerical scores are added to provide an overall score which is interpreted as follows: 0 to 7 graded a non-case, 8 to 10 graded a borderline case and 11+ graded a case. An increase in the overall numerical score from baseline to Week 12 represents worsening and a decrease in the numerical score from baseline to Week 12 represents improvement.</description>
