  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research, the study team will use brain imaging to evaluate the presence of
      neuroinflammation in the brains and spinal cords of patients with low back pain, and whether
      CBD effects levels of neuroinflammation. The efficacy of CBD use for low back pain treatment
      will also be evaluated by observing whether CBD administration will reduce neuroinflammation
      and low back pain symptoms.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to test whether &quot;glial cells&quot; (the immune cells of the
      brain and spinal cord) that are active in patients with low back pain can be reduced with
      CBD. Previous studies have showed that patients with chronic low back pain demonstrated
      elevations in brain levels of the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of glial
      activation.

      To test this hypothesis, the study team will image the brains and spinal cords of patients
      suffering from low back pain using integrated magnetic resonance- positron emission
      tomography (MR-PET), and a radiotracer called [11C]PBR28, which tracks levels of glial
      activation.

      The efficacy of CBD as a treatment for chronic low back pain will be evaluated. The study
      team will observe whether 4 weeks of CBD treatment may reduce glial activation along with
      self-reported low back pain symptoms. To this end, patients will be evaluated clinically
      and/or re-scanned after completing the 4-week trial of minocycline.

      This study will be enrolling individuals who have been suffering from chronic low back pain.

    <description>Epidiolex, an agent within the anti-epileptic drug class, will be used. Epidiolex, Greenwich Biosciences Inc.'s CBD formulation, is a 100 mg/mL purified oral solution. The recommended starting dosage is 2.5mg/kg taken twice daily (5mg/kg/day). After one week, the dosage will be increased to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg/kg twice daily (20 mg/kg/day). At the end of the first week, the patient will increase the dose to 10 mg/kg twice daily for the following week.</description>
