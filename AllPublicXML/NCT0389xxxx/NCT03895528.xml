    <textblock>
      This treatment IND protocol will allow patients with HGPS and progeroid laminopathies access
      to lonafarnib, the only compound shown to have an effect on the HGPS disease process
      resulting in improved outcomes (Gordon et al, 2018). There are no approved treatments for
      HGPS and progeroid laminopathies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of HGPS or progeroid laminopathy by qualified medical doctor (based
             on common phenotype as described in Gordon 2015 and Merideth 2008). Confirmation with
             genetic testing is preferred but not required.

          -  Adequate hepatic function as defined by SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) â‰¤ 5 times upper
             limit of normal range for age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Taking medications or foods that are known to be moderate or strong inducers or
             inhibitors of CYP3A4 or sensitive CYP3A substrates; or if a patient is taking one of
             these drugs and cannot safely discontinue or take an alternative drug, the dose of the
             inhibitor/inducer must be adjusted per the treating physician

          -  Taking digoxin, a P-gp substrate with a narrow therapeutic window.

          -  Severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2).

          -  Uncontrolled infection.

          -  Presence of any active clinically relevant medical condition that in the opinion of
             the treating physician would preclude patient from safely participating in the
             program.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant while on therapy.
