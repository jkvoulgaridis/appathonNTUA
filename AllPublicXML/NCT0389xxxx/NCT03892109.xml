  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interrelationship of restorative dentistry and periodontics is a dynamic one. The
      interactions between restorative dentistry and periodontal health have been well-documented
      both clinically and histologically.

      The interplay between periodontics and restorative dentistry is present at many fronts,
      including location of restorative margins, alloy sensitivity, crown contours, and response of
      the gingival tissues to restorative preparations.

      Periodontal tissues form the foundation for proper esthetics, function, and comfort of the
      dentition, as well as the periodontal health at the restorative gingival interface consider
      as prerequisite for successful outcome.

      Success of fixed prosthodontics restorations is largely dependent upon the long term health
      and stability of the surrounding periodontal structures.

      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of 4 new gingival
      retraction systems; traxodent, Gingitrac, Nocord, and cord , on the basis of the time taken
      for placement, hemorrhage control ,the amount of horizontal gingival displacement and
      periodontal parameter (PI, GI, CAL and PD).

      The interplay between periodontics and restorative dentistry is present at many fronts,
      including location of restorative margins, alloy sensitivity, crown contours, and response of
      the gingival tissues to restorative preparations.

      And from fixed prothodontic point of view there are several factors affect the success and
      durability of restorations. In general, the type of impression making, setting accuracy,
      material flow, temperature, humidity, mixing, disinfection and pouring time have effects on
      the final accuracy of the indirect restorations. Supra-gingival margins are effective in
      periodontal health maintenance, but do not provide optimal aesthetics.

      The primary factor in defective record of marginal details is due to the inefficacy of the
      gingival displacement technique.

      Traditionally, procedures for soft-tissue management and isolation are classified into three
      main approaches: Mechanical, chemical or surgical.

      material and method:-

      40 subjects were selected requiring fixed prosthesis according to inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.

      The 4 gingival retraction systems were used on the prepared abutments randomly. The time
      taken for placement of each retraction system was recorded.

      Hemorrhage score will be recoreded. The horizontal retraction was measured on polyether
      impressions made before the retraction and after retraction using stereoscope.

      The periodontal parameter (PI, GI, CAL and PD) will be recorded pre-operative, 1 day
      post-operative and 7 days post-operative.
