    <textblock>
      Ideal bone graft should possess osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive properties.
      Unfortunately, all of these are solely found within the autogenous graft that is available
      only in limited quantities, and it is associated with substantial post-surgical morbidity,
      However in this study Silica-calcium phosphate composite (SCPC) confirmed clinically,
      radiographically, histomorphometricand immunohistochemically the vitality and functionality
      of the newly formed bone. Histology and immunohistochemistry demonstrated maturation of the
      newly formed bone as indicated by presence of osteocytes, Haversian systems, blood vessels,
      compact mineralized collagen type I and high immune staining for osteopontin.

      Alveolar ridge resorption following teeth extraction leads to 50% loss in bone width over one
      year period which corresponds to 5 -7 mm mainly from the buccal rather than palatal\lingual
      aspects. Several calcium phosphates from bovine and synthetics sources are used for
      preservation of extraction socket; however with variable degrees of success. The aim of the
      present study is to evaluate clinically, radiographically and histologically the effect of
      Silica-calcium phosphate composite (SCPC) granules on new bone formation qualitatively and
      quantitatively following socket augmentation. This case series study was performed in five (n
      = 5) participants (one male and four females), all participants underwent socket augmentation
      procedures and dental implant placement in a staged approach. All participants were fully
      informed about the procedures, including the surgery, bone substitute materials and implants.
      Each participant had one extraction socket to be grafted with silica-calcium phosphate SCPC
      dental bone graft granules and the contralateral socket served as ungrafted control.
      Clinical, radiographic and histological evaluation was assessed.

    <description>Participants underwent socket augmentation procedures and dental implant placement in a staged approach. Atraumatic extraction of badly decayed tooth was performed. The socket was debrided with curettes and alveolar spoons; the granulation tissue was carefully removed. Free gingival gingival graft (1.5 to 2 mm thick) was taken from the area between the first and second premolar, 5 mm from gingival margin. Bioactive porous SCPC dental bone graft granules in the size range 90-710 micron were mixed with saline and loosely packed in the extraction sockets as per the manufacturer. The grafted SCPC granules were covered with free gingival graft obtained from the palatal tissues and sutured to stabilize the grafting material in place.</description>

    <description>5 patients had bilateral decayed upper premolar or anterior teeth, in one side SCPC graft was inserted in socket and in the contralateral site was a control, 5 months months postoperative core biopsies were taken from both grafted sockets and control ungrafted sockets during implant insertion. The biopsy samples from SCPC-grafted and control ungrafted sockets were fixed, decalcified and embedded into paraffin wax. All samples were serially sectioned in serial 5μm-thin sections were stained separately with Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, Sirius red and Mason trichrome and immunostaining with osteopontin.</description>
