      An Open-label, One way, Two period Comparative study To Determine The effect of Morning
      Versus Evening administration of Empagliflozin 10mg on Its Pharmacokinetics And
      Pharmacodynamics in Healthy Adults
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen(16) healthy subjects will receive a single oral dose of Empagliflozin at the
      evening(Period I) and after a seven days washout period, the same 16 subjects will receive a
      single oral dose of Empagliflozin at the morning(Period II).

      In both Periods(I and II), blood samples will be collected from each volunteer ethylene
      diamine tetra-acetic acid(KEDTA) containing tubes prior to drug administration then samples
      will be obtained at 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48
      hours(h) after drug administration.

      These samples will be centrifuged and the plasma harvested and stored at −80°C until assay.

      Urine samples will be collected over the first 24h after oral administration of the drug with
      sampling being at the following intervals: 0 to 4h, 4 to 8h, 8-12h, 12 to 24hr.
