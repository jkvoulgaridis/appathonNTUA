  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Plan and Pledge pilot will incorporate behavioral economics approaches (nudges) into the
      pre-existing STAR self-test fixed-site distribution program, implemented by Wits Reproductive
      Health and HIV Institute (Wits RHI) at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South
      Africa. The objective of this pilot is to examine the use of commitment strategies to
      increase uptake of HIV self-testing in South Africa.

      This study will use a cluster randomized trial design to test the effectiveness of
      interventions designed to increase usage of self-test and reporting of results by HIV
      self-tests recipients. Specifically, this study will examine the use of commitment and
      planning prompts to increase the uptake of HIV self-testing in the Tshwane district in South
      Africa. The intervention will build on the implementation procedures of STAR program (HIV
      Self-Testing Africa). The two arms in the study will be: 1) Usual care, &quot;Promote&quot;: A card
      with information to report results via WhatsApp, similar to the existing card used in the
      STAR program. with a dedicated Usual care WhatsApp number (different from the existing
      campaign numbers). 2) Plan and Pledge: A card with the information from the Usual Care card
      plus a brief template to &quot;make a plan&quot; and &quot;make a pledge&quot; for test completion and results
      reporting, to take the test. The card will include a dedicated Pledge and Plan WhatsApp
      number.

      Self-test distribution team-day pair will serve as the unit of randomization (i.e. two pairs
      of STAR field staff will be randomized by arm and by day. Clusters of individuals will
      receive self-tests at a distribution site from a pair of STAR field staff on an individual
      day). Computer-generated randomization will be used to assign site-day clusters to the 2
      study arms. The study will take place at the STAR community fixed-point distribution sites in
      Tshwane District, South Africa.

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will receive a card with information to report results via WhatsApp, similar to the existing card used in the STAR program. This card will have a dedicated Usual Care WhatsApp number (different from the existing STAR program numbers).
Potential self-test recipients will be shown the WhatsApp card and instructed on how to anonymously report use of self-test to the WhatsApp number. Recipients will be instructed to message the WhatsApp number for the following reasons:
1. So study staff know the self-test recipients used the test and it went ok. 2. So study staff can help the self-test recipients understand the results of the test. 3. If the self-test recipients need support from study staff to access care and services.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will revive the Usual Care WhatsApp card and and a brief template to &quot;make a plan&quot; and &quot;make a pledge&quot; for test completion and results reporting, to take the HIV self-test. The card will include a dedicated Plan and Pledge WhatsApp number.
Potential self-tester recipients will be shown the WhatsApp card, including Plan and Pledge statements, and will be encouraged by STAR field staff to use the card in their own time to make a plan and sign the pledge as part of receiving the test kit and instructions for how to complete the card. Importantly, testers will be able to keep the card for themselves. There is no expectation to share the plan or the pledge signature with the STAR field staff who distribute self-tests. Field staff will clarify for self-tests recipients that the Plan and Pledge process and card do not change the confidentiality of testing in any way.</description>
