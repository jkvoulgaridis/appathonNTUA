  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placebo effects held an ambivalent place in health care for at least two centuries. On the
      one hand, placebos are traditionally used as controls in clinical trials to correct for
      biases and the placebo response is viewed as an effect to be factored out in order to isolate
      and accurately measure the effects of the treatment. On the other hand, there is scientific
      evidence that placebo effects represent fascinating psychoneurobiological events involving
      the contribution of distinct central nervous as well as peripheral physiological mechanisms
      that influence pain perception and clinical pain symptoms and substantially modulate the
      response to pain therapeutics. Therefore, placebo effects have shifted from being a challenge
      for clinical trials to a resource to trigger the reduction of pain based on endogenous
      mechanisms that can be activated in the brain to promote hypolagesia, self-healing, and
      well-being. This is relevant in acute pain settings given that chronic opioid users die
      within approximately 2.5 years of being prescribed their first opioid medication to treat
      acute pain.

      The overall hypothesis is that observational learning influences neural pain modulation and
      cognition systems, including processes associated with mentalizing (the ability to
      cognitively understand mental states of others), empathy (the ability to share an emotional
      experience), and expectancy (the anticipation of a benefit). The objective is to determine
      the brain mechanisms of observationally-induced analgesia using brain mapping approaches that
      target changes in blood oxygenation and oscillatory activity in the brain, thus enabling
      investigators to draw inferences about the localization and extent of neurobiological
      activation underlying hypoalgesia driven by observation. Therefore, the investigators
      designed innovative experiments using pharmacological fMRI, EEG, and combined EEG-fMRI
      measurements.

      Analgesic effects can also occur without formal conditioning and direct prior experience
      because crucial information necessary to build up expectations of analgesia can be acquired
      through observation of a therapeutic benefit in others. Placebo analgesic effects following
      the observation of a benefit in another person are similar in magnitude to those induced by
      directly experiencing an analgesic benefit. These observations emphasize that contextual cues
      substantially modulate the individual placebo analgesic effects.

      In this project, the investigators propose a compelling research agenda to explore the neural
      mechanisms of hypoalgesia driven by observation as a foundation for future development of
      novel nonpharmacological pain therapies using pharmacological functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and combined EEG/fMRI. It builds on a decade of
      experience in placebo research in PI Colloca's lab and with University of Maryland
      collaborators experienced in brain mapping and pain research. In Aim 1, the investigators
      will determine the role of endogenous opioids on the neural mechanisms of
      observationally-induced hypoalgesia by using the opioid antagonist naloxone in a functional
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) setting. In Aim 2, the investigators will identify the
      impact of empathy by exploring how being in the immersive environment can enhance
      observationally-induced analgesia. In Aim 3, the investigators will leverage the EEG/fMRI to
      determine the neural EEG/fMRI transient changes that could co-occur when socially-induced
      expectations are violated.
