  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the dominant arm is compared with the non-dominant arm in overhead athletes there is a
      serious internal rotation limitation in the dominant arm. Due to overhead activity, adaptive
      changes in shoulder joint mobility and flexibility are indicated. Internal rotation
      limitation is often associated with increased external rotation. One of the reason of this
      adaptive change is posterior shoulder tightness which is common in overhead athletes as well
      as in volleyball players. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of stretching
      program on the range of motion, flexibility of posterior shoulder muscles and functional
      performance.
