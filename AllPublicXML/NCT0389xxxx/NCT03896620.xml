  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A tissue biopsy is currently the only clinical test or procedure that is able to confirm the
      initial diagnosis of soft tissue or metastatic sarcoma and evaluate its progress during
      treatment. However, tissue biopsy collection can be challenging (depending on the location of
      the tumor), and this procedure poses physical risks to the patient. A tissue biopsy also
      needs to be recollected at various time points in order to assess if the patient is
      responding to treatment.

      In this project, the investigator would like to collect blood samples in addition to the
      sample of the tumor that will be collected before treatment is started. The investigator
      would like to analyze both blood and tumor, in hopes of identifying new biomarkers of sarcoma
      that can help the study doctors better diagnose sarcoma for patients in the future without
      needing to collect a piece of their tumor.

      A biomarker is something found in the blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can be used
      to measure the progress of disease, how a treatment is working, or its likelihood of being
      successful. In this project, the investigator would like to compare ctDNA from blood to the
      DNA in the tumor. ctDNA, or circulating tumor DNA, is DNA originating from the tumor that is
      present in the blood. It can be assessed by taking an additional sample of blood when it will
      be collected for normal laboratory tests. These biomarkers may also help the study doctors
      detect how a patient is responding to their treatment or help predict their response to
      future treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators wish to prospectively collect blood samples from 25
      patients with localized soft tissue sarcomas and 25 patients with metastatic sarcoma (schema
      III) at various time points outlined. The presence/absence, as well as the change of ctDNA in
      circulation, will then be measured after the therapies administered and correlated with
      overall survival, progression-free survival and local control.

      The risks to the subjects enrolled on this study include the general risks of undergoing the
      standard procedures, such as blood draws, imaging, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and
      surgery, which will be discussed prior to the therapies and images each patient undergoes.
      The risks of the procedures are not risks of the study with exception to blood draws. There
      is also a risk of loss of confidentiality, but the data will be deidentified once acquired.
      Thus, this risk is minimal.

      In this project, the investigator will do genetic testing on blood and tumor samples. Whole
      genome sequencing will be included as part of the genetic testing for this research. Genetic
      testing will be done because the study doctor would like to identify new biomarkers of
      sarcoma.
