  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Vorinostat in addition to
      standard of care anti-epileptic drugs in pediatric patients with medically refractory
      epilepsy. All participants entering the treatment phase will receive Vorinostat.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vorinostat is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDAC). HDACs catalyze the removal
      of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of proteins, including histones and transcription
      factors. Valproic acid, a broad anti-epileptic drug, commonly used as first line treatment in
      epilepsy, has also been shown to inhibit HDAC activity .

      It is it is anticipated that Vorinostat in a population of pediatric patients with epilepsy
      will be well-tolerated, similar to that seen with valproic acid and other normally prescribed
      anti-epileptic drugs.

      Participants consenting to participate will enter a 4-week screening period to ensure
      eligibility. Eligible participants will then enter the 6-week treatment phase. Participants
      will be seen for a final Safety Follow-up visit 6 weeks after end of treatment. Participants
      who are enrolled and complete all study procedures will be in the study for a total of 16
      weeks.
