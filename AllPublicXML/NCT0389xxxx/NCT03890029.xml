  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research program has addressed three reactive adaptations evident in pain, PTSD, and
      obesity. In this project, the focus will be on PTSD as a model of stimulus-based reactive
      responses to unpredictability or threat, and the investigators propose to test the efficacy
      of the goal-directed skills training (GRIT) program for restoring predictive responding and
      homeostasis. The challenge of how best to cultivate psychological resilience in the face of
      stress, trauma, and social adversity among disadvantaged populations is a complex question
      best answered with a translational research approach. This research' intent is to help
      African American women who are dealing with stress after traumatic experiences. It will
      specifically study Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, a disorder that affects people who have
      experienced severe traumas. It is associated with a number of overwhelming emotional
      symptoms. These include sleep difficulties, depression and anxiety, flashbacks and nightmares
      of the traumatic events.

      The training is an 8-week skill building program that helps people use positive experiences
      from their past to cope with current difficulties. The investigators will collect blood
      samples for future research to understand how the body's stress response changes as a result
      of this training

      This project will utilize an intervention that is to encompass tenets of the New Wave
      therapies in two important respects:

        1. The project's emphasis is on capacity development. The project's focus reaches beyond
           symptoms to restore and build resilience strengths that nurture in the face of
           challenge. The concept of resilience first entered the psychological and psychiatric
           literature with the study of children suffering from stress and disadvantage who,
           nevertheless, were functioning well. Protective factors included the presence of caring
           adults and achievement at school . Bonds and achievement have remained the most
           persistent findings in decades of research .

        2. The investigator's aim is to restore and build capacities displaced by symptoms. This
           will be accomplished by identifying the lost capabilities in narratives of survival and
           identifying neuroscience models that capture symptoms and lost capacities as
           bio-behavioral response systems that become visible in extreme environments. Narratives
           of exceptional survival in extreme situations are characterized by engagement with their
           circumstances in ways that kept individuals well, by social relatedness, and by an
           efficient stress response . For example, while imprisoned in the Hanoi Hilton, Robert
           Shumaker built a dream house and counted the feet of lumber and number of nails that
           would needed. Fellow inmates also developed a tapping code to communicate with each
           other. Thus, Shumaker was engaged, was socially connected through tapping and, while
           engaged, was not hyper-responsive to the threat around him. The positive survival
           responses are a marked contrast to the symptoms of PTSD described earlier, such as
           hyperarousal or intrusive thoughts. What distinguishes resilient adaptation in extreme
           situations from PTSD is that the resilient activities are characterized by goal-directed
           actions while PTSD is characterized by stimulus-driven responses. The distinction of
           goal-directed versus stimulus-based responding is extensively developed in the
           neuroscience and cognitive literature. Action research has identified intention-based
           and stimulus-based actions in which self-initiated actions involve brain mechanisms and
           cognitive processes distinctly different from reflexive or responsive movement.

      Broadly conceived, humans have two types of responses to the environment: they act to achieve
      results or goals in the environment, thus changing the environment, or they respond to and
      accommodate the demands of the environment and are changed by it. This distinction has its
      parallels in other areas of human functions. Attention studies have identified voluntary
      control of attention (endogenous) that is goal-directed versus automatic reflexive control
      (exogenous) in which external objects or events claim a subject's attention. A number of
      cortical models are relevant to goal-directed action and stimulus-based responding, among
      them the work on intention and reactivity by Astor-Jack and Haggard or the studies of Hannus
      and colleagues on stimulus-driven and user-driven control of visual attention.

      Perhaps most relevant is the predictive and reactive control system (PARCS) developed by Tops
      and colleagues.

      These two basic bio-behavioral programs control behavior in different environments, the
      reactive program being most adaptive in unpredictable environments and the predictive program
      most effective in highly predictable environments. The reactive program is guided by
      momentary feedback from the environment and responses are close in time and space. The
      predictive program guides behavior in a feed-forward manner that plans for the future,
      simulates alternatives, and makes predictions. In PTSD, stimulus-based responding prevails
      and displaces goal-directed responding at multiple levels of functioning: cortical,
      endocrine, affective, cognitive - indeed, the entire bio-behavioral system of predictive
      responding.

      The abundant research on goal-directed action versus stimulus-based responding has few
      parallels in clinical psychology or psychiatry. Hints emerge in eudamonic well-being that is
      goal-directed and required for challenging situations and goal-relevant motivational
      constructs of self-efficacy or locus of control. This study draws on the extensive
      neuroscience framework to formulate a model of resilient and traumatic responses and proposes
      an approach that restores goal-directed responding that will simultaneously reduce the
      dominance of stimulus based symptoms of PTSD. This is a 5 year study with the anticipation of
      148 enrolled.

In the Color-Word Interference subset the participant names color patches, reads words naming colors printed in black ink, names the ink color in which color words are printed in an incompatible ink color, and switches back and forth between naming the dissonant ink color and reading the conflicting words; More accurate = better outcome.</description>

    <description>Once potential participants have given consent and determined eligible, they will undergo an initial assessment.Pre, post- and follow-up testing. This consists of verbal scales including emotional well-being scales and mental health symptom scales. They will be administered in a group 30-60 minute session. Neuropsychological testing and psychophysiological tests given will require 90 minutes. Neuropsychological testing will be completed at pre and post testing only. In order to ensure unbiased assessment, pre- and post- and follow-up testing will be conducted by individuals blinded to study condition.
Randomization. After pre-testing, all individuals will be randomly assigned to either the active treatment group or minimal attention control condition. After this, intervention participants will meet in small groups of 10 per group for 90 minutes/week over five weeks for resilience training. After five weeks, all participants will be post-tested.</description>
