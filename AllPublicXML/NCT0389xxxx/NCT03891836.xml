    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms are higher among women and its prevalence among university students was
      reported to be higher than the general population .There are various risk factors of
      depressive symptoms among university students, lower socioeconomic status, poor academic
      performance, overweight, life stressors, family history of psychiatric disorders, sleeping
      problems, and exposure to patients' suffering. Several studies were conducted among medical
      students in different Egyptian Universities to detect prevalence of depressive symptoms which
      were 42.9% in Al-Azhar Uni-versity, Cairo, 60.8% in Fayoum University, 59.2% in Mansoura
      University and 57.9% in Alexandria University.

      A sense of control means having a feeling of autonomy, of choosing how you spend your time,
      of doing your own work in your own way, which is a key component of happiness. Depressive
      symptoms more common in those who feel there is little they can do to change important things
      in their lives.

      Medical education is considered stressful. Medical students have psychological and academic
      stressors during their revolution from insecure students to young knowledgeable physicians,
      which were determined to be associated with depressive symptoms and decrease the quality of
      life and academic achievements.
