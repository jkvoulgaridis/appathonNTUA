      Accrue samples for the further development and clinical validation of a blood-based cell-free
      DNA (cfDNA) quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay as a potential
      biomarker for early non-response to therapy in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most anticancer drugs are effective only in subgroups of patients, and our current
      understanding of tumor biology does not allow us to predict accurately which patient will
      benefit from a specific therapeutic regimen. The definitive proof of the effectiveness of a
      therapy is improvement in clinical symptoms and survival. Imaging is generally used to assess
      therapeutic effects earlier and more objectively. Current response assessment is based
      primarily on changes in tumor size as measured by CT or other anatomic imaging modalities.

      Cadex Genomics has developed an analytically validated cell-free DNA (cfDNA) quantitative
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay that utilizes standard qPCR platforms for
      processing, this test can reliably obtain results from small blood volumes and possesses
      exceptionally high analytical sensitivity of circulating cfDNA.

      The purpose of this study is to accrue samples for the further development and clinical
      validation of a blood-based cell-free cfDNA qPCR assay as a potential biomarker for early
      non-response to therapy in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer
      (CRC) and breast cancer (BC).

    <measure>DNA Integrity Index as a predictor of progressive disease in a cohort of metastatic patients (250 Lung Cancer (NSCLC, SCLC), 250 CRC and 250 BC patients as compared to standard RECIST/iRECIST criteria.</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months to accrue patient for initial development</time_frame>
    <description>A total of 750 subjects (250 stage IV Lung Cancer, IV 250 CRC and IV BC) will be enrolled consecutively into the study. Blood specimens will be collected at the initiation of therapy and 12 to 16 days after the initiation of therapy. A course of therapy is defined as chemotherapy, immunotherapy or oral therapy. Standard baseline RECIST or iRECIST will be recorded before the initiation therapy and again at 9-12 weeks. For those patients who are receiving single agent regimen consisting of immunotherapy alone there will be an additional blood draw prior to administration of the second course of therapy. The Integrity Index will be evaluated for predicting early non-response to therapy as compared to standard RECIST/iRECIST results.</description>

        A total of 750 subjects with Lung Cancer, CRC or BC will be enrolled consecutively into
        each cancer group. It is expected that each group will enroll 250 subjects each. As each
        group meets its enrollment goals, that group will close to further enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Age ≥ 18 years.

        Documented stage IV NSCLC, SCLC, BC or CRC (can be new diagnosis, persistent or recurrent
        disease):

        BC patients who meet the following criteria:

        ER+/HER2- and has failed hormone therapy within the last two years, or ER+/HER2+ or,
        ER-/HER+ or, HER2-/ER-/PR- (TNBC), and Has ≥ 1 measurable non- bone lesion as measured per
        RECIST or, If bone only disease, has two or more measurable (&gt; 1 cm by RECIST)
        predominantly lytic bone lesions

        Planned initiation of new systemic first- or second-line treatment or subsequent therapies
        with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy or combination thereof. Or continuation
        of the current line of therapy after RECIST/iRECIST evaluation which coincides with end of
        the cycle of therapy and prior to initiation of the next cycle of therapy.

        If baseline blood draw is planned prior to first cycle of a line (1st, 2nd, 3rd etc) of
        therapy, measurable disease with CT or MRI or PET/CT monitoring should be completed within
        4 weeks prior to baseline blood draw.

        If baseline test is performed at the completion of a cycle of therapy, CT or MRI or PET/CT
        monitoring should be completed to coincide with end of cycle of therapy and prior to
        baseline blood draw.
