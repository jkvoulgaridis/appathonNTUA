    <textblock>
      The Long-term goal of this project is to develop upper limb rehabilitation interventions that
      can be utilized for cervical Spinal Cord Injury survivors.

      This Study will utilize a novel method of non-invasive brain stimulation in conjunction with
      upper limb training given for 15 visits over a period of 3 weeks.

      The Study will include the following site visits:

        -  Eligibility Screening and Informed Consent Visit.

        -  Four testing visit in which motor function of the upper limb and neurophysiology will be
           measured

        -  Fifteen intervention visits during which patients will receive upper limb training in
           conjunction with non-invasive brain stimulation

        -  Repeat testing of motor function and neurophysiology of the upper limb following
           completion of intervention visits

        -  a Follow-up visit completed 3 months after the completion of interventions

      This is a phase I/II Multi-site Clinical Trial. In this phase I/II randomized controlled
      study, 18 cervical spinal patients with upper limb impairments will receive non-invasive
      brain stimulation tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation) to the area in the brain
      controlling the weaker muscle of the weakest upper limb while receiving training for 5 days a
      weeks for 3 weeks. The primary outcome will be motor limb impairment, and secondary outcomes
      will be tests of functional ability, spinal excitability, and strength and dexterity. Safety
      and feasibility of pairing tDCS with rehabilitation will also be explored and include adverse
      effects, subject/investigator blinding, and attrition to 3 month follow-up.

    <masking_description>Subjects will be randomly assigned by the Cleveland Clinic biostatistician to receive either active or sham tDCS. The tDCS will be pre-programmed with codes for active and sham stimulation. The code will be given to the intervention team by the biostatistician. Investigators analyzing functional outcome data and neurophysiology data will receive coded data that conceals the identity of the subject.</masking_description>
