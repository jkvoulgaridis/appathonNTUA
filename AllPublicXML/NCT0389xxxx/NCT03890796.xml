  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the results from an intervention designed to encourage older adults
      with dementia for their engagement in activities through their active participation of
      activity scheduling (AS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study compares two interventions by using a 12-week longitudinal randomized controlled
      trial. For the first 2 weeks, all participants receive the same health care education
      program. Then for the following 10 weeks, participants will be randomized to either one of
      the two following groups with different conditions. For the control group, participants
      receive ten session of dementia care education. For the experimental activity scheduling
      group, participants receive ten session of dementia care education, plus weekly activity
      scheduling (AS) practice that focus on pleasant event scheduling and improving communication.

    <measure>Chinese version of the Caregiver Burden Interview Scale (Chinese ZBIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 22-item instrument measures caregiver stress. Areas assessed include the perceived health and psychological well-being of the caregiver, financial impact, social life, and the relationship between the caregiver and the care recipient. The Chinese version has been tested with family caregivers of community-dwelling persons with dementia. Its correlation with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was 0.59 (p&lt;0.001). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.99. The split-half correlation coefficient was 0.81 (Chan, 2005). higher values represent higher stress level of caregivers</description>

    <measure>Chinese Caregiver Activity Survey (Chinese CAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-item CAS to assess the amount of time that caregivers spend taking care of people with dementia during the 24 hours before the investigation. It covers six areas of daily living: communication, using transportation, dressing, eating, looking after the appearance of people with dementia, and supervising them. The total score the Chinese CAS is calculated by summing the total time that caregivers spend on assistance with these areas of daily living (Prince, 2004).</description>
