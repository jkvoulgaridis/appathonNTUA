  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attrition of skills after basic life support (BLS) training is common. Psychology studies
      have established that for basic memory recall tasks, spaced learning strategies improve
      retention. Spaced learning is often organized as a refresher or 'booster' course after
      initial training. This study aims to investigate if this principle holds true for BLS skills,
      which require rapid memory recall and efficient deployment of procedural skills while under
      time pressure.

      Health care professionals who have not received BLS training in the 6 months leading up to
      the date of participation will be recruited from local health care institutions in the
      greater-Ottawa area. Participants will be randomized into one of three groups: early booster,
      late booster, or no booster (control). Currently, no booster is the educational standard. The
      early booster group will receive a booster at 3 weeks, the late booster at 2 months, and no
      booster for the control. All participants will undergo BLS training, an immediate post-test,
      and a retention post-test at 4 months. Post-tests involve a simulated cardiac arrest
      scenario. Raters will be blinded to the group allocation and simulation test order.
