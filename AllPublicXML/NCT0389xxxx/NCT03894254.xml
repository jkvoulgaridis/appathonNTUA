  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Alzheimer's disease or related disorders (ADRD) are among the most disabling diseases
      because of their main features such as cognitive impairment, loss of functional autonomy and
      behavioural disorders. In absence of current curative treatment, the identification of the
      predictive risk factors of progression of the disease, evaluated through its main symptoms,
      represents a major stake of public health. The Investigators aim at developing a regional
      database, which includes the patient medical records on a prospective basis, in collaboration
      with the medical and administrative staff and with the University hospital computer science
      departments.

      The main objective is to study the predictive factors associated with change in functional
      autonomy level, measured every 6 to 12 months in memory centres across Region Auvergne
      Rhone-Alpes in France.

      The real-life study population will consist in about 5250 patients with ADRD. The inclusion
      period will be of 3 years, the length of follow-up of each patient will be of 10 years max
      for a total study length of 13 years.

    <description>This is study carried out in current practice. Patients are undergoing a medical examination in a memory center, with extensive and systematic evaluations for the study involving the following tests: IADL, DAD6, New AGGIR, NPI, and mini-Zarit) assessing the functions (autonomy, behavior and caregiver burden).</description>
