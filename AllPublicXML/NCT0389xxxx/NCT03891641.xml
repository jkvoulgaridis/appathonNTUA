  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of a new exercise device (TREDLR) designed to facilitate repetitive
      ankle flexion/extension movements (i.e., &quot;treadling&quot;) through a momentum-driven internal
      flywheel while seated. The specific goals of this project are to explore improvements in
      mobility and exercise capacity in individuals who treadle compared to a control group.
