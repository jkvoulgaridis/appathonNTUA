    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomized, expanded/phase II study in subjects with metastatic
      castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who progressed after either abiraterone or
      enzalutamide.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of proxalutamide and
      determine the RP2D for Ph III and/or other confirming studies.

      Subjects will be randomized into the 2 treatment arms.

      This study is an open-label, randomized, expanded/phase II study in subjects with metastatic
      castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who progressed after either abiraterone or
      enzalutamide. All subjects will be randomized to take 400 mg or 500 mg of GT0918 by oral
      administration once daily on an empty stomach (2-3 hours after a meal) for initial treatment
      of 6 months. Randomization of subjects will be stratified by prior therapy (abiraterone or
      enzalutamide).

      Subjects will continue treatment with GT0918 (proxalutamide) at their assigned dose on an
      empty stomach until disease progression, intolerable toxicities (AEs), or withdrawn consent.
      A post-treatment period of 4 weeks will commence that concludes with an end-of-study visit.

      Disease progression will be assessed by three methods over the duration of the study.
      Subjects will be assessed for biochemical (PSA) progression measured monthly, as well as
      radiographic progression by CT scan or/and bone progression by radionuclide bone scan every
      12-weeks. Progressive disease will be considered on the occurrence of the first assessed
      progression event. Subjects with PSA progression only may continue the study until
      radiographic or bone progression at the discretion of the Investigator and with agreement by
      the sponsor or their authorized medical monitor.
