  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide information regarding the sequential administration of two vaccines
      adjuvanted with AS01.

      The aim of this study is to understand immunogenicity and safety of NTHi-Mcat vaccine when
      administered sequentially after Shingrix vaccine and to compare to the immunogenicity of
      NTHi-Mcat vaccine administered alone. This study will also provide information regarding
      whether a specific time period is required between the administration of these two different
      vaccines containing the same adjuvant- AS01 components.

      The population of this study will include healthy smokers and ex-smokers of 50 to 80 years of
      age which will be used as a proxy for the COPD population.

             ligation or occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and;
             has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and; has agreed to continue
             adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after
