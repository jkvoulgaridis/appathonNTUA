      This phase I trial studies best dose and side effects of liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) and how well it works in treating patients with high risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia that has come back or has not
      responded to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of CPX-351 in patients with intermediate-2 or
      high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). (Dose Escalation Stage) II. To determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous CPX-351 in patients with intermediate-2 or
      high-risk MDS. (Dose Escalation Stage) III. To further characterize the safety and
      tolerability of CPX-351 in patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS. (Dose-Expansion
      Stage) IV. To evaluate preliminary efficacy of CPX-351 in patients with intermediate-2 or
      high-risk MDS. (Dose-Expansion Stage)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall response (OR) rate. II. To assess overall survival. III. To assess
      duration of response. IV. To assess relapse-free survival. V. To assess safety profile.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. After 2-5 weeks, patients who do not achieve a complete response
      (CR)/CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi)/CR with incomplete platelet recovery
      (CRp), have acceptable or no toxicity, and have stable disease and no disease progression may
      receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients who achieve at least a hematological improvement (HI)
      response, receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1
      and 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 5-8 weeks, patients who do not show clinically
      significant disease progression or unacceptable toxicity may receive liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine for up to 12 additional cycles.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.
