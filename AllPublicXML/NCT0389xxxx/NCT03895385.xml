    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events (AE) from Baseline to Safety Follow Up</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Safety Follow Up (up to Day 140)</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC(0-28) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to day 28.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area under the BKZ plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable concentration (AUCt)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 140)</time_frame>
    <description>The AUCt is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable concentration (AUCt) of BKZ as determined using the linear trapezoidal rule.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area under the BKZ plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 140)</time_frame>
    <description>The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC) of BKZ is calculated as AUC=AUCt+Clast/λz, where Clast is the last quantifiable plasma concentration and λz is the apparent terminal elimination rate constant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum observed BKZ plasma drug concentration (Cmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 140)</time_frame>

    <measure>Time of occurrence of the maximum observed BKZ plasma drug concentration (tmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 140)</time_frame>
    <description>Tmax is the time to reach maximum plasma concentration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent terminal half-life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at predefined time points (up to Day 140)</time_frame>
    <description>Apparent terminal half-life, reported in units of days, as determined via simple linear regression (slope=-λz) of natural log (ln) concentration versus time for data points in the terminal phase of the concentration-time curve. t1/2 is calculated as ln2/λz.</description>
