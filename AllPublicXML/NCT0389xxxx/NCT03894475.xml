  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators compared the ventilation parameters for volume and flow obtained from
      standard spirometry procedures from patients presently monitored and treated for asthma or
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using AioCare (HealthUp Sp. z o.o., Serial
      Number: MS082017005412, software version: MySpiroo app 1.1.14) as the tested device and
      Spirometer USB CPFS/D (MGC Diagnostics) as the reference, which required calibration prior to
      each session. Spirometry measurements were performed on sixty-two patients (forty-four
      females (58±17 years old) and eighteen males (52±19 years old)) at the Institute of
      Tuberculosis and Lung Disease in Warsaw, Poland. Participants were asked to perform correct
      spirometry examinations (which means at least three technically correct exhales and meeting
      repeatability criteria for FEV1 and FVC) on both measuring devices with a five-minute break
      between devices to prevent respiratory muscle fatigue. The highest value from all acceptable
      spirometry results was then used for analysis. All spirometry examinations followed ERS/ATS
      standards.

    <description>AioCare is an ultraportable, handheld hardware module that contains the MEMS-based flow sensor and electronics, with a dedicated mobile application that works on iOS and Android operating systems. The unit is used with a disposable mouthpiece fitted to the tip of the flow tube, and a nose clip. AioCare is connected to its dedicated mobile application, which contains software that will show flow-volume graphs and results in real time. The device encompasses all of the widely used spirometry parameters, including: peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, forced expiratory flow at 25% of expiration (FEF25), forced expiratory flow at 50% of expiration (FEF50), forced expiratory flow at 75% of expiration (FEF75), and forced expiratory volume in 6 second (FEV6).</description>
