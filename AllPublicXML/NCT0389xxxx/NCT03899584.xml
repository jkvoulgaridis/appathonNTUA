  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      150 patients with clinically complete chronic spinal cord Injury will be included in a
      randomized, parallel, placebo controlled, multi-centric, phase III trial. Patients will be
      evaluated before starting the medication, and at the end of the treatment in the locomotor,
      sensory, grade of independence, sensitivity and control of bladder and anal sphincters,
      quality of life, and psychogenic erection in males. Patients will be divided randomly into
      two groups where one will receive placebo and the other one 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) in a
      maximum of 30 weeks in increasing doses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with chronic AIS A tetraplegic or paraplegic with an MRI showing cord
      continuity will be recruited in the departments of neurology, neurosurgery or rehabilitation
      from hospitals of Social Security Mexican Institute (IMSS) in 8 states . Just patients who
      meeting inclusion criteria, will be selected for the study until reach 150. After signing an
      informed consent, they will be randomized into 75 for the intervention arm and 75 for the
      placebo arm. All patients will receive capsules for daily consumption according to their
      assignment. They will receive ascending doses of the drug starting with 10 milligrams and
      progressively increasing every 2 to 4 weeks 10 mg until reaching the maximum dose proposed
      according to weight (maximum 1 mg/kg/d). Questionnaires and functional evaluations will be
      administered at the beginning of the study, and at the end of the treatment to evaluate the
      efficacy. The evaluations include the International Standards for Neurological Classification
      of Spinal Cord Injury motor and sensory Scale, the Spinal Cord Injury Independence Measure
      (SCIM III), quality of life (SF-36), sphincter bladder/anal sensation/control in both genders
      and psychogenic erection in males as primary outcomes.

      After the follow-up period, all test results will be analyzed and compared to determine the
      efficacy and safety of 4-aminopyridine. The Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square test will be used
      for statistical analysis.

    <measure>Changes in Sensory Function</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This function will be examined using the ASIA International Standards for the Neurological and Functional Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. Sensory function will be evaluated and qualify for two modes, pin prick / light touch in all dermatomes. The first one will be measured with the sharp and blunt end of a safety pin and the last one will be evaluated with a cotton ball. A scale of 3 points (0- 2) will be used depending on whether the modality is normal (2), diminished (1) or absent (0). A score of 2 for each of the 28 key sensory points tested on each side of the body would result in a maximum score of 56 for pin prick, 56 for light touch, and a total of 112, higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Motor function</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Motor function will be examined using the ASIA International Standards for the Neurological and Functional Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. Muscle strength will be evaluated in each of the 20 key muscles, five in each limb, representing segments of the spinal cord C5 through T1 and L2 through S1, using a six-point rating scale (0-5). There is a maximum score of 25 for each extremity, totaling 50 for the upper limbs and 50 for the lower limbs. Changes in motor score (total range from 0 to 100, higher values represent a better outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the functional assement of Spinal Cord Independence</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Spinal Cord Independence Measure version III (SCIM III) has 16 questions on self-care, respiratory and sphincter management and mobility in and out of home, which ranges from 0 (total dependence) to 100 points (total Independence).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Sphincters function</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The function of the anal sphincter and the bladder will be evaluated. The anal function will be qualified as a sensation when the patient can differentiate when the rectum is full and ready to empty and control when the patient can stop the fecal evacuation with enough time to reach the bathroom and eliminate the fecal material. The function of the bladder will be classified in the same way as the anal function. Positive or negative will be the final result of sensation and control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of overall quality of life score as measured by Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-36 (SF-36) has 36 questions. Each question has a score, which will be transformed into a 0 to 100 scale, where 0 corresponds to &quot;the worst health state&quot; and 100 to &quot;the best health state&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Mean International Index of Erectile Function</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The international Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) contains 15 questions, rated from 0 or 1 to 5, yielding an overall score of 5-75 points. A score of 1-10 indicates severe erectile dysfunction, 11-16 moderate dysfunction, 17-25 mild dysfunction, and greater than 25 &quot;normal&quot; function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be measured by occurrence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TRAEs); data will represent the number of participants with abnormal laboratory values and/or adverse events that are related to treatment.</description>
