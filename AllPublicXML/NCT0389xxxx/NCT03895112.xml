  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased levels of TGF-β1 were detected in serum, plasma and BM and positively correlated
      with both grade of BMF and extent of leukemic cell infiltration in the marrow. TGF-β likely
      plays a dual role in promoting myelofibrosis and myeloproliferation, both of which are the
      bone marrow morphologic hallmark of MF. AVID200 is a drug that targets TGF-β1 and TGF-β3. The
      study team hypothesizes that inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway in MF will decrease the
      fibrogenic stimuli leading to myelofibrosis and concomitantly interrupt myeloproliferation
      and restore normal hematopoiesis.

      This is a first in human, open-label, multicenter, Phase I/Ib trial of AVID200. Patients must
      have intermediate-2 or higher primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-essential thrombocythemia or
      polycythemia-vera related MF (Post ET/PV MF). This study will enroll up to 24 patients.
      AVID200 is delivered by IV infusion on day 1 of each 3 week cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, open-label, multicenter, Phase I/Ib trial of AVID200. To date,
      there is no therapy for MF evaluated in the clinic that clearly demonstrates the ability to
      target the malignant HSC and result in effective and reproducible bone marrow morphologic,
      cytogenetic and molecular responses. Medicinal therapies that result in disease course
      modification are urgently needed in this chronic and progressive myeloid malignancy. TGF-β
      likely plays a dual role in promoting myelofibrosis and myeloproliferation, both of which are
      the bone marrow morphologic hallmark of MF. The study team proposes that inhibiting the TGF-β
      signaling pathway in MF will decrease the fibrogenic stimuli leading to myelofibrosis and
      concomitantly interrupt myeloproliferation and restore normal hematopoiesis. AVID200 is a
      fusion protein containing TGF-β receptor ectodomains fused to a human Fc IgG domain. AVID200
      is a potent TGFβ trap with antibody-like properties which has pM potency against two of the
      three TGFβ ligands, TGFβ1 and β3.

          -  Have predisposing conditions that are consistent with development of aneurysms of the
             ascending aorta or aortic stress (for example, family history of aneurysms,

          -  Any serious, unstable medical or psychiatric condition that would prevent, (as judged
             by the Investigator) the subject from signing the informed consent form or any
             condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or known active hepatitis A, B,
