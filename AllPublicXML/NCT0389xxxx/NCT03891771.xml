  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study evaluates whether a telemonitoring platform of activities of daily living
      amongst the elderly can improve their quality of life. Participants will be randomised to two
      different follow-up strategies, one comprising a monitoring platform and the other standard
      visits at a healthcare facility. Quality of life will be assessed using standardised
      questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly participants at perceived socioeconomic risk will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either a telemonitoring platform in their houses or standard health care. The
      platform will include sensors able to detect falls, nocturia (which have been previously
      validated) and sensors for environmental variables including humidity, carbon monoxide levels
      and temperature. In addition, a wearable panic button will be provided for participants
      allocated to the sensor platform which will allow them to obtain help in case of an
      emergency. The sensor platform will be connected to emergency services and healthcare
      providers,and they should receive and react to any anomaly detected in their readings.

      Participants will be followed up for 10 months. Quality of life questionnaires, including the
      World Health Organisation's WHOQOL-BREF and the EQ-5D for health-related quality of life,
      will be used to address potential intervention effects.

    <description>This scale is designed to assess the overall quality of life of the respondent using 5-point Likert scales. Higher scores mean a better quality of life. WHOQOL-BREF is divided in 4 domains, including physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment. The mean score for each domain is used to calculate the domain score. Scores can then be added together to obtain an overall score. Therefore, scores in the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire range from 4 to 20 points.</description>

    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life score using the EuroQOL-5D (EQ-5D) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) is a standardised questionnaire that allows to quantify health-related quality of life. It is divided in two sections, a descriptive section and a visual analogue scale (VAS) at the end of the questionnaire. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ-VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. Results are presented as a descriptive profile or as an index value calculated from the descriptive component which is country-specific. Visual analog values can range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating an overall better health-related quality of life.</description>
