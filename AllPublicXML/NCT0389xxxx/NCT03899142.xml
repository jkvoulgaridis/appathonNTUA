  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sanquin Plasma Products BV developed a new manufacturing process for the Quin plasma products
      in order to improve viral safety and to remove procoagulant activity. Since the new
      manufacturing process will be the same for all Quin products, a clinical study with one of
      the Quin products is sufficient for marketing authorisation of all new Quin products.
      HepBQuin will serve as model for all other Quin products. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are
      considered as a surrogate indicator of efficacy.
