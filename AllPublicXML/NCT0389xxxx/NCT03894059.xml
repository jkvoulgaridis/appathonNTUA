  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest is the number one cause of death in Canada. It is often the first symptom of
      cardiac disease for the victims. Eighty-five percent of victims collapse in their own home.
      Fifty percent collapse in the presence of a family member. Bystander cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR) can improve the chance to survive a cardiac arrest by three to four
      times, but needs to be started quickly. In most communities, less than 30% of victims receive
      CPR before the ambulance arrives. Currently, only 8% of cardiac arrest victims can leave the
      hospital alive.

      Many things have been tried to improve the number of times people do CPR. So far, the only
      thing that really increased the number of times that someone did CPR is when 9-1-1 attendants
      started to give CPR instructions to callers over the phone. The only problem is that about
      25% of cardiac arrest victims gasp for air in the first few minutes. This can fool the 9-1-1
      callers and attendants into thinking that the victim is still alive.

      The investigators have looked at all the studies on how to help 9-1-1 attendants to recognize
      abnormal breathing over the phone. The investigators have also learned what should be taught
      after finishing a large survey with 9-1-1 attendants from across Canada. This survey was done
      with the help of psychologists and other education experts. It measured the impact of
      attitudes, social pressures, and 9-1-1 attendants' perceived control over their ability to
      recognize abnormal breathing and cardiac arrest. Then the investigators developed a teaching
      tool which helped Ottawa 9-1-1 attendants recognize abnormal breathing. When they could do
      that, they could also recognize more cardiac arrest.

      The main goal of this project is to use the tool developed in Ottawa in more centres to help
      9-1-1 attendants save the lives of even more cardiac arrest victims across Canada.

          -  That are of presumed cardiac origin;

          -  That occur in the catchment area of our participating sites; and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiac arrest witnessed by paramedics after their arrival (no opportunity for
             bystander intervention);

          -  Patients younger than 16 years of age (cardiac arrest usually respiratory and rare in
