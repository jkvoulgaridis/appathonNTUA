  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of nebulisation in patients with bilateral
      tubal ligation in the first postoperative year, the amount of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia and
      menstrual bleeding, recurrent vaginitis and cystitis.

      A retrospective analysis of bilateral tubal ligation with optional modified Pomeroy technique
      in the family planning unit and evaluation of the results of patients who underwent Neural
      Therapy during and postoperatively will be evaluated.

    <description>Postoperative dysmenorrhea in the first postoperative year was evaluated by viscous pain scale (VAS) in patients who underwent bilateral tubal ligation with the modified Pomeroy technique. There is no pain at zero points according to visuel pain scale;Ten points are very severe - unbearable pain.
patients will score between one to ten pains.</description>
