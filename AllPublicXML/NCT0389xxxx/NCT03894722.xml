  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of
      povidone iodine (PVP-I) on postoperative swelling and trismus when used as a coolant and
      irrigation solution during the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Facial Swelling (assessed 3 facial lines (in millimeters) for determination of difference in facial contours before and after surgery)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative (on the day of surgery)- postoperative 2nd day-postoperative 7th day</time_frame>
    <description>For the assessment of facial swelling, three facial lines (in milimeters) were measured with a digital tape on the operated side using following (4) landmarks: the external canthus of the eye, the gonion angle, the lower border of the tragus, soft pogonion and the mouth commissure
Facial Lines between:
the external canthus of the eye- the gonion angle
the lower border of the tragus-the mouth commissure
the lower border of the tragus- soft pogonion</description>

    <time_frame>Preoperative (on the day of surgery)- postoperative 2nd day-postoperative 7th day.</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of trismus was assessed by measuring the distance between upper and lower incisal borders of the central incisors with a digital caliper.</description>
