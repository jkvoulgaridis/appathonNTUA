  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction and defective placental vascularization are hypothesized to be
      significant causes of preeclampsia. In preeclampsia, due to vascular endothelial dysfunction,
      vasoconstriction and platelet activation can result in severe features which alter pregnancy
      outcomes. However, studies have shown that acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) can decrease
      endothelial dysfunction leading to decreased platelet aggregation which reduces adverse
      outcomes. The objective of our study is to determine if Aspirin has a dose-dependent response
      for modifying biomarkers reflective of maternal endothelial dysfunction when indicated for
      preeclampsia prevention in a cohort of women identified at risk for developing preeclampsia.

      Pregnant women who are at risk for preeclampsia will be randomized to receive either 81mg
      Aspirin or 162mg Aspirin daily starting from 11-16 weeks of gestation until 36 weeks of
      gestation. A third, control group of women at low risk for preeclampsia will not receive
      aspirin. All women will be assessed with uterine artery Doppler studies and mean arterial
      blood pressures at three time points during pregnancy. Blood, urine, and cord blood samples
      will also be collected.

      Eligible women will be identified in the late first or early second trimesters. Once
      recruited, women will be randomly assigned to either 81 mg or 162 mg per day dosing
      schedules. The randomization scheme will vary based on the body mass index (BMI) with
      separate schemes for women &lt;=30 kg/m2 versus &gt;30 kg/m2. Ultrasonographic assessment of
      biophysical biomarkers will be obtained at 11-16 weeks, 18-22 weeks, and 28-32 weeks
      gestation. Biologic samples of serum and urine will be obtained at the 11-16 week and 28-32
      week visit. Upon delivery, cord blood and a placental specimen will also be obtained.
      Medication treatment will continue until 36 weeks gestation. Pregnancy and neonatal outcome
      data will be recorded.
