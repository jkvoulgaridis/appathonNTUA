  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency (RF) can be used to treat splenic trauma because of its excellent coagulation
      hemostasis. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of RF-assisted spleen-preserving surgery
      with that of conventional splenorrhaphy/splenectomy in the treatment of blunt splenic injury.

      A total of 122 patients with splenic trauma admitted to two tertiary referral centers from
      June 2011 to June 2014 were included in this prospective cohort study. The 67 patients at one
      center were treated by radiofrequency-assisted spleen-preserving therapy (RF group), and the
      55 patients admitted at the other center underwent conventional treatment (CT group).
      Demographics and clinical characteristics of the two groups were comparable.

      Compared to traditional splenorrhaphy and splenectomy, RF-assisted splenic hemostasis and
      salvage was safe, effective and easy to use in the treatment of splenic injuries. In
      particular for high-grade splenic injuries, these techniques preserved sufficient splenic
      tissue without any increase in patients with surgical risk.
