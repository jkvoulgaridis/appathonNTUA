  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip arthroplasty is a treatment widely used in most inflammatory, traumatic and degenerative
      conditions of this joint. The longevity of implants may be disappointing in some cases,
      despite the promising results obtained during in vitro simulations. Early loco-regional or
      systemic dissemination, known since the 1990s, of wear particles from these prosthesis may
      reduce their life span.

      The analysis of the particles in the synovial fluid and in the articular tissues by electron
      microscopy after digestion or directly by optical microscopy, will improve the knowledge on
      the mechanisms of wear.

      This category 3 study is based on the case-control model and will be conducted in a national
      reference center (hospital la Croix-Rousse- Lyon). It will include a population of adult
      patients.
