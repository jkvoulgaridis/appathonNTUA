    <description>Subjects will be assigned into niraparib 100mg+brivanib 200mg, niraparib 200mg+brivanib 200mg, niraparib 200mg+brivanib 400mg, niraparib 200mg+brivanib 600mg dose group at the first day of the first cycle.</description>

    <description>Niraparib will be administered as a flat-fixed dose (100mg or 200 mg, daily) depending on the cohort the patient is enrolled to, and not by body weight or body surface area. Each dose should be swallowed whole without chewing. The consumption of water is permissible. Patients should take doses at approximately the same times each day, and record this information in the patient diary. Patients will be provided with a diary in which to record their intake of study drug. However, the actual number of doses taken by the patient must be calculated from the number of tablets dispensed and returned.</description>
