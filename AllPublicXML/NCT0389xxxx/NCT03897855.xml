  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the elderly, we can see a post-traumatic syndrome associated with an event that occurred
      before old age that had not previously manifested or not fully manifested.

      This little-known pathology and notable psychiatric co-morbidities (depression, anxiety) can
      take in elderly subjects different masks that interfere with diagnosis and treatment.

      The data in the literature suggest that this Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder with Delayed
      Expression (TSPT-R) may be related to a deficiency of the executive functions of inhibition,
      and more particularly a deficit of mental memory inhibition and therefore the removal of
      unwanted memories.
