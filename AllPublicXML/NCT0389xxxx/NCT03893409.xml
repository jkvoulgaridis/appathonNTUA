        subjects (n= 5000). Sites Investigators will be respiratory physicians working in the
        respiratory department of our sites, which must be tier 2 or tier 3 hospitals in China,

        investigational drugs will be applied to the patients. Statistical analysis will be
        conducted by epidemiology &amp; statistics work group from Chinese Academy of Sciences, using
        SAS and R software. Paper-based questionnaire administration will also be used.
        Questionnaire variables will be checked before data entry. During the study, PI will be in
