             pregnancy test at screening (all participants except for postmenopausal participants)

          -  Any evidence of heart block or bundle branch block

          -  History of liver or renal dysfunction (estimated creatinine clearance less than [&lt;] 90
             milliliter per minute (mL/min) at screening, calculated by the Modification of Diet in
             Renal Disease (MDRD) formula), significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that
             in the Investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability),
             endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplastic, or
             metabolic disturbances

          -  Past history of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (example [eg], premature
             ventricular contractions, premature atrial contractions, extrasystoli, tachycardia at
             rest), history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (eg, hypokalemia,
             family history of long QT Syndrome)
