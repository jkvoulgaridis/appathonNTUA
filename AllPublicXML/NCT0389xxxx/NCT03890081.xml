  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a major health problem in 35% of the general population in
      most developed countries. In addition to interventional therapies, the cognitive and
      behavioral abilities of the patient, are important for the solution of chronic pain. All of
      these abilities of patients are called coping strategies of pain.

      The Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) is commonly used to measure methods of coping with
      various forms of chronic pain, including musculoskeletal pain. CSQ aims to evaluate the
      frequency and success of coping strategies with cognitive and behavioral pain. The validity
      and reliability of the questionnaire was tested and satisfactory results were obtained and it
      became a widely used tool in pain studies. The aim of this study was to translate and
      culturally adapt the original English version of the CSQ into Turkish version and to assess
      the validity and reliability of this instrument in patients with chronic musculoskeletal
      pain.

    <measure>Reliability of Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>As a result of the internal consistency analysis, Cronbach's Alpha coefficient was found to be 0.913. This value indicates that the scale has a high level of internal consistency.
For the test-retest analysis of the Turkish version (CSQ-T), a 48-hour time interval was considered to be appropriate, and 40 participants were included in the test. As a result of the analysis, the ICC value was computed for the total score of the scale, which was found to be fairly high (0.876). The results revealed that both the sub-parameters and the total score of the CSQ, and thus the CSQ itself are stable over time.
Based on these findings, the Turkish version of the questionnaire appears to have high reliability.</description>

    <measure>Validity of Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Construct validity was measured by comparing the responses of the scales of the CSQ-T with the responses of the scales of the HADS and SF-36. The total CSQ-T correlated to the anxiety subscale of the HADS with a score of r:-0.603 and to the depression subscale of the HADS with scores of r:-0.471. The SF-36 &quot;PCS&quot; (r: 0.790) and &quot;MCS&quot; (r:822) subscales were observed to have a good and very good correlation with the total score of CSQ-T.
Based on these findings, the Turkish version of the questionnaire appears to have high validity.</description>
