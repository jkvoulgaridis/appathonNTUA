    <time_frame>At Visit 2 (Day 3 ± 2 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A specific ruler will be provided to the investigator in order to measure the VAS score. The subject will mark on the ruler the point that he/she feels represent his/her perception of his/her current pain. The VAS score will be directly measured by the investigator with a scale in millimetres. The VAS score will be filled in the CRF.</description>

    <measure>Condition of the wound</measure>
    <time_frame>At Visit 2 (Day 3 ± 2 days) and Visit 3 (Day 21 or earlier, as soon as the wound is epithelialized)</time_frame>
    <description>The wound bed condition will be evaluated regarding 6 condition items: bleeding, maceration, inflammation, infection, ratio necrotic/ fibrinous/ granulation/ epithelisation tissue, and tissue in-growth in the dressing holes, by means of the following 4-points scale: none, mild, moderate, severe. The percentage of each modality for each condition items will be calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>At Visit 2 (Day 3 ± 2 days) and Visit 3 (Day 21 or earlier, as soon as the wound is epithelialized)</time_frame>
    <description>The condition of the surrounding skin will be assessed regarding different conditions: inflammatory signs, irritation, allergic rash/eczema, blistering, skin stripping, maceration, dry, trauma to wound edges, product degradation on the skin, hematoma, other. These condition items will be assessed by means of the scale Yes/No. The percentage of each modality will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Global assessment of exudate management</measure>
    <time_frame>At Visit 2 (Day 3 ± 2 days) and Visit 3 (Day 21 or earlier, as soon as the wound is epithelialized)</time_frame>
    <description>This will use a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test including treatment groups and baseline wound exudation status (none, light and moderate/heavy).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator's global assessment of the product</measure>
    <time_frame>At Visit 2 (Day 3 ± 2 days) and Visit 3 (Day 21 or earlier, as soon as the wound is epithelialized)</time_frame>
    <description>The global assessment of the dressing will be performed by the investigator regarding the following items: ease of handling, ability to maintain its integrity, ease of application, ability to be repositioned during application, conformability, wound adhesion, ability of dressings to stay in place, transparency, ability to transfer wound fluid to the secondary dressing, ease / speed of removal, overall impression, and absence of residue.
Each item will be evaluated by means of the following scale: very good, good, poor, and very poor.
The percentage of each modality will be presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's global assessment of the product</measure>
    <time_frame>At Visit 3 (Day 21 or earlier, as soon as the wound is epithelialized)</time_frame>
    <description>The global assessment of the dressing will be performed by the subject regarding the following items: ability to maintain its integrity, ability of dressings to stay in place, transparency, comfort of the patient, ability to transfer wound fluid to the secondary dressing, ease/speed of removal, overall impression.
Each item will be evaluated by means of the following scale: very good, good, moderate, poor, very poor.
The percentage of each modality will be presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety endpoint: frequency and character of device deficiencies (DDs), adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse device effects (ADEs), serious adverse device effects (SADEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Visit 2 (Day 3 ± 2 days) and Visit 3 (Day 21 or earlier, as soon as the wound is epithelialized)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety analyses will be descriptive overall and by dressing group. Any local and general adverse events occurring and those already present, but worsening, during the course of the investigation will be described on the safety population. Frequencies will be provided per dressing group and overall describing the type of event: device deficiency (DD), adverse event (AE), serious AE (SAE), adverse device effect (ADE), serious ADE</description>
