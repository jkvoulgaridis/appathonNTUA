  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meta-analysis studies have demonstrated that isometric training with handgrip promotes
      reductions in clinical blood pressure, reaching 8 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 4 mmHg
      for diastolic. However, the effects of this training modality on ambulatory blood pressure,
      which is better discriminant of cardiovascular risk than clinical BP, remains uncertain.
      Thus, the ISOPRESS Network, consists of researchers from Brazilian institutions of education
      and research (Federal University of Santa Catarina, Federal University of Amazonas, Federal
      University of Sergipe, Federal Rural University of Pernambuco and Education and Research
      Center from Albert Einstein Hospital), will conduct a multi-center study to analyze the
      effects of isometric handgrip training on clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in
      patients with hypertension. For this, each research center will conduct a randomized
      controlled trial with medicated patients with hypertension, of both sex. The participants
      will be randomized into two groups: isometric handgrip training group (HBT: n = 25 per
      center) and control group (CG: n = 25 per center).Subjects assigned to the HBT will train
      three times per week, four sets of 2-min isometric contractions (using alternate hands) at
      30% of maximal voluntary contraction, during 24 weeks. Subjects randomized to the CG will
      perform stretching and relaxation exercises three times per week, during 24 weeks. The
      evaluations will occur in three moments: baseline, post-12 and post-24 weeks. The primary
      outcome will be ambulatory blood pressure, while clinic blood pressure and cardiac autonomic
      modulation will be analyzed as secondary outcomes. For data analysis, in addition to
      descriptive statistics, two-way ANOVA for mixed model will be applied for within and between
      groups comparison. The level of significance that will be adopted is p&lt;0.05.
