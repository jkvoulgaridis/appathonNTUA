  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate and compare the effect of balance and proprioception
      exercises with strengthening exercises on muscle strength, pain, proprioception, function and
      quality of life in knee osteoarthritis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Damage or loss of mechanoreceptors in osteoarthritis patients affects balance and
      proprioception. There are studies showing that proprioceptive deficit is associated with the
      onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis leading to pain and disability. Because the
      proprioception provides a sense of power generation and allows the power output to be better
      regulated. When the literature is examined, studies investigating the effects of
      proprioception and balance exercises on muscle strength, function and pain are limited.

      In our study patients will be randomly divided into two groups: Group I (Proprioception and
      Balance) and Group II (muscle strengthening exercises). While Group I will be applied
      Proprioception and Balance training exercises, Group II will be applied closed and open
      kinetic strengthening exercises. Two group will perform exercise 3 times a week during 8
      weeks.

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>WOMAC will be filled first time at baseline and second time after 4 weeks and third time after 8 weeks rehabilitation program . After treatment &quot;change&quot; will be assessed</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC is widely used self-administered health status measure used in assessing pain, stiffness and function in patients with OA of the knee or hip. The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).
The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will perform first time at baseline and second time after 4 weeks and third time after 8 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a 10 cm line with anchor statements on the left (no pain) and on the right (extreme pain). The patient is asked to place a vertical mark on the scale to indicate the level of intensity of his or her pain.</description>

    <measure>Pressure Algometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will perform first time at baseline and second time after 4 weeks and third time after 8 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure algometry is one of a number of outcome measures that manual therapy practitioners are able to use in both clinical and research settings. The pressure algometer is used to determine the pressure pain threshold of specific muscle and bone locations.</description>

    <measure>Hand-Held Dynamometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will perform first time at baseline and second time after 4 weeks and third time after 8 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>Handheld dynamometers are one of the most objective and consistent tools to use when muscle testing. It is an ergonomic hand-held device for objectively quantifying muscle strength.</description>

    <time_frame>Evaluation will perform first time at baseline and second time after 4 weeks and third time after 8 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic dynamometer is a well known device to measure active and passive JPS and also provides target angle result without any researcher bias/It has shown good reliability and validity for measuring position sense.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will perform first time at baseline and second time after 4 weeks and third time after 8 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of health related quality of life. The RAND 36-Item Health Survey taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health.</description>

    <measure>Global Rating of Change Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will perform first time at baseline and second time after 4 weeks and third time after 8 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>Global rating of change (GRC) scales are very commonly used in clinical research, particularly in the musculo-skeletal area These scales are designed to quantify a patient's improvement or deterioration over time, usually either to determine the effect of an intervention or to chart the clinical course of a condition. Global Rating of Change Scale will be used to evaluate patients' satisfaction from treatment.</description>

    <measure>Aggregated Locomotor Function (ALF) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will perform first time at baseline and second time after 4 weeks and third time after 8 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>The aggregated locomotor function (ALF) score, a simple measure of observed locomotor function, using timed walking, stairs and transfers, was developed and evaluated for intra-tester reliability, criterion-related validity and responsiveness in a sample of patients with knee osteoarthritis.</description>
