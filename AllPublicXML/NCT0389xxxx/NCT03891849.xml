  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Octreotide is used to decrease portal pressure of cirrhotic patients admitted for variceal
      bleeding. When patients are in haemorrhagic shock, the recommended drug to increase arterial
      pressure is norepinephrine. Microcirculatory effects of octreotide when it is added to
      noradrenaline has not been investigated yet. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect
      of octreotide plus norepinephrine for patient with haemorrhagic shock after variceal
      bleeding.

    <time_frame>one hour after octreotide perfusion</time_frame>
    <description>microcirculatory flow index will be measured with sidestream dark field handheld microscope. Baseline is before octreotide perfusion. Flow characteristics of the microvasculature will be quantified using the microcirculatory flow index (MFI) according to the recommendations from the consensus on microcirculatory imaging by De Backer et al. This index will be calculated after the image will be divided into four quadrants, and the predominant type of flow (absent = 0, intermittent = 1, sluggish = 2, abnormal = 3, and hyperdynamic = 4) would be estimated in the vessels smaller than 25 μm by the operator. The final MFI score is a value obtained from the average score of the four areas.</description>
