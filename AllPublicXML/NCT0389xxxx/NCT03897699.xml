  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can enhance the therapeutic effect of mindful
      breathing training (MBT) for adolescent depression. The objective is to enhance connectivity
      between the DLPFC with the amygdala and Default Mode Network (DMN) circuits as well as to
      enhance emotion regulation abilities and decrease rumination to reduce symptoms of
      depression. This will aid in the development of novel treatments for depression.

      Aim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting and randomizing adolescents with
      depression to a research protocol involving MBT and tDCS. The investigators expect that
      adolescents will be willing to enroll in a randomized trial involving MBT and tDCS.

      Aim 2: To test the tolerability of MBT and tDCS in adolescents. The investigators expect that
      MBT will be well-tolerated and that active tDCS will show no difference in tolerance compared
      to sham stimulation.

      Aim 3: To examine whether tDCS can enhance the effects of MBT. The investigators expect the
      MBT + tDCS group will show greater reduction in depressive symptoms compared to the MBT +
      sham stimulation group.

      Aim 4: To examine the mechanisms of MBT +/- tDCS treatment. The investigators expect that
      depression symptom improvement will be associated with decreased rumination, improvements in
      emotion regulation, increased task-based and resting state DLPFC-DMN and DLPFC-amygdala
      connectivity, as well as increased DLPFC activation and reduced amygdala activation during
      rumination and emotion processing tasks. The investigators also expect reduced alpha
      asymmetry and reduced LPP amplitude during emotion regulation and emotion processing. The
      investigators expect these changes will be greatest in the active tDCS + MBT group.

    <measure>Change in DLPFC Connectivity</measure>

    <measure>Change in Depression MADRS-S</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale - self-assessment (MADRS-S) measures change in severity of depression symptoms over time. Treatment response will be measured using the MADRS-S and a ~50% reduction in depression severity, i.e. total MADRS-S score, will indicate a positive response to treatment.
The scale includes 9 items that are rated by participants on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 - 3. Half-point scores are also possible, i.e 0.5, 1.5, 2.5. Participants rate their symptoms from over the past 3 days and the range of total possible scores is 0 - 27, with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. Bondolfi et al. (2010) found good internal consistency for the MADRS-S, as well as good concurrent validity between the MADRS (clinician administered) and the MADRS-S. Lastly, the MADRS-S was found to be sensitive to change in depression symptoms over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mindfulness MAAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS) measures presence or absence of awareness of what is happening in the present . The MAAS consists of 15 items. Participants are requested to rate each item according to a 6-point Likert scale with the following options: &quot;Almost Always&quot;, &quot;Very Frequently&quot;, &quot;Somewhat Frequently&quot;, &quot;Somewhat Infrequently&quot;, &quot;Very Infrequently&quot;, and &quot;Almost Never&quot;. Brown &amp; Ryan (2003) reported that the MAAS was internally consistent and a reliable measure. A higher score on the MAAS indicates a greater awareness of inner experiences and mindfulness. In the present study, an increase in the total MAAS score would indicate an increase in presence of awareness of what is happening in the present.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Rumination RRS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) measures rumination, which refers to thoughts and behaviors centered around one's symptoms and their causes, as well as potential consequences. Nolen-Hoeksema, Morrow, &amp; Fredrickson (1993) reported that ruminative thoughts correlated with depressed mood. They further reported a consistency in ruminative responses over a 30-day period. The RRS will be used to measure changes in rumination in the present study. The measure consists of a total of 22 statements that describe ruminative thoughts and participants are requested to rate each statement on a scale of 1 - 4, 1 being &quot;Almost Never&quot; and 4 being &quot;Almost Always&quot;. Change in rumination corresponds with a change in the total RRS score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mindfulness FMI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) assesses curious attitude toward the mindfulness experience. The FMI contains 14 statements related to mindfulness experiences. Participants are requested to rate each statement according to a 4-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Rarely&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;. An increase in the FMI total score would indicate an increase in mindfulness. Walach et al. (2006) reported that the FMI is a valid and reliable measure of mindfulness.</description>

    <description>Measure of occurrence of negative side-effects from treatment. Side effects will be collected via participant self-report. Number of serious and non-serious adverse events will be considered in determining safety of the treatment. A higher number of adverse events will indicate lower treatment safety.</description>
