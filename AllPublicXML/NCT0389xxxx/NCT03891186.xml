  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metacognitive training (MCT) for schizophrenia has been used in several countries, but its
      efficacy remains unclear. MCT is a program group that consists of changing the cognitive
      infrastructure of delusions.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the Portuguese version of the metacognitive
      training programme and its effects on psychotic symptoms, insight to the disorder and
      functionality

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial that will be realized in six psychiatric institutions of
      Portugal. Pilot study will be carried out initially. The sample will be constituted by
      individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (experimental group (n=30) and control group (n=30).
      The evaluation instruments will be utilized are PSYRATS, BCIS, PSP and WHODAS 2.0 applied to
      both groups in three different moments. In experimental group the eight MCT modules will be
      applied over four weeks.

      The objective is to compare the outcomes associated with &quot;treatment-as-usual&quot; and the
      benefits of implementing the Metacognitive Training for Schizophrenia.

      The hypothesis to be validated in this trial are:

        -  the schizophrenic patients who integrate the experimental group and participate in the
           MCT program will reduce the severity of psychotic symptoms and will present a better
           insight to disease and a better functioning on the final of the program than the control
           group;

        -  in participants that participating in the MCT program, the psychotic symptoms decrease
           at the end of the program and in the follow up (three months later) and the awareness
           for the disease and functioning improves.

    <masking_description>Eligible participants will be recruited by the investigators in collaboration with the multidisciplinary team of each institution. A baseline assessment will be carried out and the instruments will be applied after informed consent by participants. Participants will be randomly allocated to either Metacognitive Training (MCT) (experimental group). The control group will not participate in the MCT program. In both groups will be maintained the TAU. The variables for whom the participants are stratified are educational level, duration of mental disorder and type of treatment. All participants will be re-assessed at the end of the program and three months later. The program will be applied during four weeks (two session per week).</masking_description>

    <time_frame>PSYRATS will be applied a week before the first session of Metacognitive Training.</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is a structured interview that assesses the detailed measurement of delusions and hallucinations. The PSYRATS have 17 items and two subscales: one subscale assesses delusions (6 items) and the other subscale assess hallucinations (11 items). Each item has a classification of five points (0-4). The total score is the sum of all points. It is was developed by Haddock, McCarron, Tarrier and Faragher in 1999 (validated for the Portuguese population by Telles-Correia et al in 2017).</description>

    <measure>Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) - moment 1</measure>
    <time_frame>BCIS will be applied a week before the first session of Metacognitive Training</time_frame>
    <description>This scale has 15 items and it is a self-response questionnaire that was developed by Beck, Baruch, Balter, Steer, &amp; Warman in 2004 and evaluated the consciousness of the illness. The BCIS is comprised of two subscales: self-reflectiveness and self-certainty. The total score for each scale is the sum of the item scores that comprise it (see below). The BCIS composite index is calculated as self-reflectiveness minus self-certainty. Poorer cognitive insight is indexed by lower scores on the self-reflectiveness subscale, higher self-certainty scores, and lower BCIS composite index scores.
Step 1. Score every item on the BCIS from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;3&quot; according to the following rule:
&quot;Do Not Agree at All&quot; = 0
&quot;Agree Slightly&quot; = 1
&quot;Agree a Lot&quot; = 2
&quot;Agree Completely&quot; = 3 (in process of validation to Portuguese population by investigators of this study)</description>

    <description>MCT is a group program with eight modules referring to common cognitive and biases in solving problems in schizophrenia. The following topics of MCT are: attribution blaming and taking credit (module 1), jumping to conclusions (modules 2 and 7), changing beliefs (module 3), deficits in theory of mind and social cognition (modules 4 and 6), overconfidence in (memory) errors (module 5) and depression and low self-esteem (module 8). Each session lasts 45 to 60 minutes and follows a protocol defined in the manual &quot;Metacognitive Training for Psychosis (MCT)&quot; that is currently available in 35 languages (available in www.uke.de/mkt).</description>
