  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a rare disease characterized by an increase in pulmonary
      vascular resistance, leading to a progressive decline in cardiac output (CO).Since cardiac
      output is correlated with the prognosis of the disease, the conduct of a right heart
      catheterization (thermodilution measurement, reference technique) during the annual follow-up
      visit of patients in competences centres is recommended. In practice, it is not
      systematically performed because of it is invasive, with potential risk for the patient, and
      there is limited logistical capacity for its implementation. The estimation of cardiac output
      is thus often based on cardiac ultrasound but its measurement is potentially biased.

      Starling ™ SV is a non-invasive cardiac output monitor based on thoracic bio-reactance
      measurement. Several clinical studies have shown that cardiac output measured by
      bio-reactance is strongly correlated with the measurement obtained by catheterization in
      different indications. Rich et al. (2013) assessed bio-reactance specifically in 50 patients
      with Pulmonary Hypertension compared with thermodilution. The results showed that the
      measurement of cardiac output by bio-reactance was feasible in these patients, had a better
      accuracy than by catheterization, and was reliable for detecting changes in cardiac output
      after a vasodilatation test.

      The Starling ™ SV monitor could thus have a place in the follow-up of patients who are being
      treated for Pulmonary Hypertension. Since it is a rapid, non-invasive examination, it could
      be performed on an outpatient basis, especially as a first-line test to check the stability
      of the CO, thus avoiding the systematic use of right heart catheterization, which would then
      be reserved only to patients for whom the measurement by bio-reactance would show a decrease
      of cardiac output compared to the previous value. Before being able to propose this use in
      current practice, it is necessary to carry out a pilot study which will make it possible to
      explore the interest of bio-reactance in this situation.

Then, the ability of the relative variation of cardiac output measured by thoracic bio-reactance to predict the patient's status (stable or unstable) will be assessed.</description>
