  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 healthy recreationally active men and woman aged 18-35 will participate in the study.
      There will be three treatments involved: Caffeinated ketone supplements, non-caffeinated
      ketone supplement and water-placebo. Participants will complete the protocol three times and
      the treatment order will be systematically rotated to avoid any order effect. The three main
      trials will be separated by at least 1 week. After providing the corresponding treatment,
      participants will be given 30 minutes and after, they will perform a standardized 10-minute
      warm-up, followed by the 20 km time trial and a 30-second all-out Wingate test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some researchers support that a state of ketosis, reached through the use of ketogenic diet,
      has the potential to improve athletic. To attain such state, individuals must restrict
      carbohydrate intake to a maximum of 50g/ day or 10% while keeping protein intake moderate.
      One of the biggest challenges to achieve and maintain ketosis is complying with the diet due
      to its restrictive nature. Consequently, manufacturers have developed supplements that can
      induce a state of ketosis acutely (~1 hour). Unfortunately, there is very little evidence
      supporting the use of these supplements to enhance athletic performance. Hyperketonemia
      (blood ketone concentration &gt; 0.2 Mm) seems to elevate the rate of utilization of ketone
      bodies. These changes in substrate utilization may allow athletes to preserve, something that
      would be advantageous for exercise performance. Ketone salts have been shown to elevate the
      concentration of ketones in blood and as such they may allow the body benefit from the
      apparent sparing of carbohydrates. Manufacturers now provide ketones salts combined with
      other ingredients such as caffeine. However it is unknown whether or not the addition of
      these ingredients has any positive or negative effect on athletic performance. Caffeine alone
      has been shown to improve athletic performance in several studies. Therefore, the purpose of
      this study is to compare the effectiveness of a caffeine free ketone salt supplement vs a
      caffeinated ketone salt supplement and their effects on a 20km time trial and a 30 second
      all-out Wingate test.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a double blind repeated measures cross over study. There will be three treatments involved: Caffeinated ketone supplements, non-caffeinated ketone supplement and water-placebo. Participants will complete the protocol three times and the treatment order will be systematically rotated to avoid any order effect. Design of the study is composed of two performance tests 30 minutes following supplementation. All participants will arrive in a fed state to the laboratory. the corresponding treatment will be provided and 30 minutes later, they will perform a 20 km time trial. 10 minutes after the time trial, participants will perform a 30 second all-out Wingate test.</intervention_model_description>
