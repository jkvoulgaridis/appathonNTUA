    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of Health Support Activities (Animal Assisted Intervention, Clows,
      Musicians) in the reduction of pain and distress in children undergoing venipuncture.

      Hypothesis: the investigators expect a reduction in in pain and distress.

    <textblock>
      Venipuncture is one of the most unpleasant procedures for children. Previous studies
      demonstrated the effectiveness of distraction techniques in reducing anxiety and pain but no
      one compares the specific activities of animals assisted intervention (AAI), clowns and
      musicians for this procedure.

      In the Hospital involved in the present study, venipuncture service has a week schedule for
      Health Support Activities. In specific days children can benefit of Health Support Activities
      as part of routine care.

      Aims of the present study are: evaluate efficacy of AAI, clowns and musicians in the
      reduction of childrens' distress and pain during venipuncture with respect of a control group
      undergoing venipuncture in the days where Health Support Activities are not scheduled;
      compare distress and pain levels between groups; evaluate caregiver's anxiety and its
      influence on child pain and distress; explore parents' and staff opinion.

    <measure>Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Distress assessment is one for every participant and begins when child enter in the venipuncture room and lasts until the child exit the venipuncture room, in the day of recruitment. .</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Behavioral Distress Scale - BBDS is an observational measure that assess children's procedure-related distress with 12 discrete component steps involved in venipuncture, in order to observe specific demands for compliance on the child during the procedure. Observers record the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the target behaviors during each step. Operational definitions of the target behaviors for each category are: 1) Non interfering Distress Behaviors; 2) Potentially Interfering Distress Behaviors; 3) Interfering Distress Behaviors. The number of steps in which a behavior occur is summed and divided by the total number of steps, then multiplied by 100 to yield percentage of steps with occurrence scores for each behavioral category. The number of steps in which behaviors from any of the three distress behavior categories occur is summed and divided by the total number of steps multiplied by three, then multiplied by 100 to obtain the Total Distress Score.</description>

    <description>Numerical scales, based on age, Wong Baker Scale. The Wong Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (Wong &amp; Baker, 1998) is a self-report scale for children older than 3 years old, that shows a sequence of faces ranging from a happy face at 0 level, that means &quot;No hurt&quot;, to a crying face at 10th level, that means &quot;Hurts worst&quot;.</description>

    <description>Numerical scale, Visual Analogue Scale - VAS. VAS is used from the age of 7 years old, is a self-report numerical scale ranging from 0, that means &quot;No pain&quot;, to 10, that means &quot;worst pain&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Parent's anxiety assessment is one for every participant, measured in the waiting room before child enters in the venipuncture room, in the day of recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report scale (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAI). The STAI is a self-report anxiety behavioral instrument for adults. It consists of two separate subscales: one assessing trait anxiety (baseline, Y1), the other assessing the state anxiety (situational, Y2). Each subscale is composed by 20 items, rated on a 4-points Likert scale and separately analyzed. Total score for each subscale range from 20 to 80, with higher scores denoting higher levels of anxiety.</description>
