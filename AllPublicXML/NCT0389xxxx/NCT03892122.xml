      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome affect up 12% in adult population. It is associated with an
      increase rate of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, depression and adverse cardiovascular
      events. The evaluation of upper airway obstruction is vital to obtain site-specific
      treatment. Drug Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE) is a routinely exam which allows the direct
      observation of the upper airway during sedative induced sleep. Propofol and Dexmedetomidine
      are sedatives approved for all diagnostic examinations that required sedation.

      are sedatives approved for all diagnostic examinations that required sedation.

      It's a Randomized Controlled study. 28 participants will be enrolled and randomized in two
      groups: in the first group the sedation state will be performed with Propofol, while in the
      second group will be used Dexmedetomidine for allow sedation state. The study will be
      evaluate the different hemodynamic and respiratory changes during sedation in these two
      different groups and differences in obstructive endoscopic anatomical patterns. This will be
      the first study in whic Dexmedetomidine and Propofol will be compared according to European
      DISE Recommendation published in august 2018 (references)

    <description>Sleep endoscopy will be performed by a Target Controlled Infusion system (BRAUN perfusion system) using Schneider model in effect-site (cerebral) targeted infusion 50-ml prefilled syringe of 1% propofol. Schneider system is a complex pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that allows to obtain different rates of drug from the values of age, height, weight and lean body mass of the patient
. The starting dose of propofol will be 2-2,5 mcg ml−1 and increments of 0.2 mcg ml−1 took place when the new cerebral concentration of propofol will be reached, and never before 5 minutes. In this way, the investigators will be realized a slow technique of TCI propofol infusion according to European working group</description>

    <description>Propofol will be infused with TCI (Target Controlled Infusion) pump. TCI system has been developed to provide improved convenience and control during intravenous anaesthesia. The basic principle is that the anesthetist sets and adjusts the target blood concentration— and depth of anesthesia—as required on clinical grounds.
Infusion rates are altered automatically according to a validated pharmacokinetic model. TCI technology uses different pharmacokinetic modeling to control the infusion rate of the pump, which allows for a direct control of the sedative agent brain concentration rather than its blood concentration. (de vito 2017) The development of target-controlled infusion (TCI) technology has increased the number of indications for propofol sedation in clinical practice. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that propofol-based TCI allows for the accurate control of sedation during DISE and results in an authentic reproduction of the sleep process.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dexmedetomidine</intervention_name>
    <description>is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, which seems to act on the locus coeruleus (LC) or to the preoptic hypothalamus to decrease wakefulness, with almost no effect on respiratory depression. Dexmedetomidine exerts its hypnotic action through activation of central pre- and postsyn¬aptic alpha2-receptors in the locus coeruleus, thereby inducting a state of unconsciousness similar to natural sleep, with the unique as¬pect that patients remain easily arousable and cooperative. Comparing with propofol, dexmedetomidine provides a state of sedation closer to natural sleep and lesser upper airways muscular relaxing effect, even at the increased anesthetic dosage Otherwise, Dexmedetomidine is characterized by a slightly longer onset of action (5-10 minutes), and patients take longer timing to recover..The sedative action of Dexmedetomidine can be reached by means of infusion technique (starting dose: 1 μg/kg over 10 minutes; maintenance infusion rate: 0,7 μg/kg/h).</description>
