  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Electro-Convulsion-Therapy (ECT) is a well accepted treatment option in severe
      depression. The quality of ECT is evaluated basing on minimal seizure duration (&gt;15sec), the
      sympathic response and the postictal EEG-suppression.

      For the treatment general anaesthesia is needed. On the other hand anaesthesia strongly
      influences the quality of the seizure. The goal is to find an anaesthesia-depth that is
      needed for the well-being of the patient and allows a good ECT.

      In daily routine the dose of anesthetic agents and the assesment of anesthesia-depth is based
      on the subjective estimation of the anesthetist and also on ealier interventions.

      The aim of the study is to assess any correlation between measured anesthesia-depth using the
      Narcotrend TM and the Quality of the ECT.
