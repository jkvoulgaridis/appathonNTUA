  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about discussion between clinicians and their patients
      related to lung screening. Survey answers will be collected from both clinicians and their
      patients.

    <description>Perceived Smoking-Related Stigma will be measured using the 5-item Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma Scale (Smoking-Related Subscale). The response scale is 1 = strongly disagree, to 4 = strongly agree, and scores range from 5 to 25 (high stigma). Cronbach's alphas were 0.75 to 0.89 in prior studies.</description>

    <intervention_name>Patient Trust in the Medical</intervention_name>
    <description>Medical Mistrust will be measured using the 5-item Patient Trust in the Medical Profession Scale.80 The five-point Likert responses measure the extent to which patients perceive their clinician to be honest, caring more about convenience, thorough and careful, and trusted. The range of scores is 5 to 25 (higher mistrust). Reliability and validity have been well established with a Cronbach‟s alpha of 0.84.</description>

    <intervention_name>Decision Conflict Scale - Lung Cancer Screening</intervention_name>
    <description>The DCS is a 16-item Likert-response item scale that has been modified for the lung cancer screening and smoking cessation contexts. The DCS was developed by O‟Connor,74-75 and validated in many health decisions including breast cancer screening with Cronbach‟s alphas ranging from 0.78 to 0.81. 74-75 Despite its name, the DCS measures more than decision conflict to encompass personal perceptions of perceived decision-making quality such as feeling the choice is informed, values based, and likely to be implemented as well as expressing satisfaction with the decision. 74-75 The DCS is comprised of items with response options ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The items are summed to total scale score with lower scores reflective of higher decision conflict and higher scores reflective of lower decision conflict.</description>
