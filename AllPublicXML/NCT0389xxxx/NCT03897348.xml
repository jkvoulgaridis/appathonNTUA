  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed project is to improve the treatment of individuals with AUD.
      The investigators will conduct the first pilot human laboratory study to assess the effects
      of two doses of lacosamide on alcohol drinking and craving. The investigators will assess its
      effects on reducing alcohol intake using a human laboratory method, the Yale Alcohol Drinking
      Paradigm (ADP). The investigators will also assess the feasibility of the Alcohol Drinking
      Paradigm (ADP) in order to position our research team to have the capacity to conduct future,
      larger, hypothesis-testing human laboratory-based experiments designed to test the efficacy
      of potential alcohol treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      4 heavy-drinking non-treatment seeking male community volunteers with a diagnosis of AUD will
      attend 3 ADP sessions and subsequently receive 3 different interventions, 100 mg of
      lacosamide, 200 mg of lacosamide and placebo.

      The ADP sessions is a one day human laboratory session taking place at the SFVA Medical
      Center. This human laboratory session involves the self-administration of alcoholic beverages
      by research participants under highly structured, observed conditions in order to evaluate
      the study intervention (100 mg lacosamide vs. 200 mg lacosadmide vs. placebo) on alcohol
      craving and alcohol consumption.
