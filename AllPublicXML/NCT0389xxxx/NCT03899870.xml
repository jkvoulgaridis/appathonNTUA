  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and a major cause of cancer
      deaths worldwide. Recurrence after curative surgery is one of the major factors affecting the
      long-term survival and its frequency is estimated to be 22.5% at 5 years. of which 12% have
      local recurrence. The overall survival in case of recurrence of 11% at 5 years.

      Several patient-, tumor-related and treatment-related prognostic factors have been found to
      be associated with the risk of recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma. Some of these factors
      such as TNM stage, lymphatic and perineural invasion and vascular emboli have been found to
      affect recurrence free survival in most studies. While the impact of other factors such as
      distal resection margin, tumor size, extra capsular spread and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
      on recurrence remains controversial. Moreover, most of the previous studies on prognostic
      factors have been from American and European countries with very little data from African
      countries. Recognition of these factors helps in identification of high-risk patients who
      require close and more rigorous postoperative surveillance. Hence this study was conducted to
      determine the factors affecting recurrence after curative resection of rectal cancer in
      African population.

    <description>Patients underwent anterior or low anterior resection. Patients with tumors in the lower third of the rectum where anal sphincters could not be preserved underwent abdominoperineal resection. In majority of the cases, inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) was ligated caudal to the origin of the left colic artery. For the tumors of the upper rectum, partial excision of the mesorectum was performed up to the minimum of 5 cm from the inferior aspect of the tumor. For the tumors of the middle and low rectum a total mesorectum excision was done with the minimum distal mucosal margin of 1 to 2 cm. Ileostomy was performed in cases where colon was poorly prepared, anastomotic leak test was positive or colonel anastomosis was made. In most of the cases, open surgery was performed. Laparoscopic surgery was performed in selected cases. Wide local excision was performed in selected cases with T1 tumors without locoregional lymphadenopathy.</description>

    <description>Patients with locally advanced disease (T3, T4) or lymph nodal positive disease were offered neoadjuvant therapy. In the neoadjuvant therapy, we used 45 Gy in 25 fractions with concurrent 5-fluorouracil [5-FU] and patients were operated 8 to 10 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy. In some cases, especially the elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities, we used short-course pelvic radiation therapy which included 25 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week.</description>

    <description>Patients with locally advanced disease (T3, T4) or lymph nodal positive disease were offered adjuvant therapy. In most of the cases, FOLFOX (leucovorin, 5-FU, oxaliplatin) regimen was used and for elderly patients who could not tolerated this regimen, we used oral capecitabine.</description>
