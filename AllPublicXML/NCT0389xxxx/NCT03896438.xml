  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive neuromodulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) , is
      emerging as an important therapeutic tool with documented effects on brain circuitry, yet
      little is understood about h ow it changes cognition. In particular, tDCS may have a critical
      role to play in generalization, that is how training in one domain generalizes to unlearned
      or unpracticed domains. This problem has resonance for disorders with cognitive deficits,
      such as schizophrenia.

      Understanding how tDCS affects brain circuity is critical to the design and application of
      effective interventions, especially if the effects are different for healthy vs. psychiatric
      populations. In previous research, one clue to the mechanism underlying increased learning
      and generalization with tDCS was provided by neuroimaging data from subjects with
      schizophrenia undergoing cognitive training where increases in thalamocortical (prefrontal)
      functional connectivity (FC) predicted greater generalization.

      The premise of this proposal is that increases in thalamocortical FC are associated with the
      generalization of cognitive training, and tDCS facilitates these increases. The overarching
      goals of this proposal are to deploy neuroimaging and cognitive testing to understand how
      tDCS with cognitive training affect thalamocortical circuitry in individuals with and without
      psychosis and to examine variability in response within both groups.

      Study 1 will compare right prefrontal, left prefrontal and sham tDCS during concurrent
      cognitive training over 12 weeks in 90 healthy controls. Study 2 will be similar in all
      aspects but will examine 90 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and
      include clinical assessments. Results of the study will provide crucial information about
      location of stimulation, length of treatment, modeled dosage, trajectory and durability
      needed to guide future research and interventions for cognitive impairments.

    <time_frame>baseline; mid-test (week 6); post-test (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete MRI sessions on a 3T scanner located in the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at the University of Minnesota. To calculate FC, we will characterize the global and local network connectivity using a graph theory analysis. This will be formed by extracting the fMRI time courses from ninety regions of interest, based on ROIs defined by the freesurfer T1 parcellation. We will focus on low frequency (0.06-0.125 Hz) oscillations in the BOLD signal. We will estimate the functional connectivity by computing the absolute value of the Pearson's correlation between all possible pairs of time series, creating a 90 x 90 (N x N) connectivity matrix. The network topology metrics, characteristic path length and clustering coefficient, will be computed from the connectivity matrix, averaged over a threshold range representing .1 to .3 of the maximum possible number of edges in the graph. We will also measure global strength and diversity of the nodes.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline; mid-test (week 6); post-test (week 12); follow-up (week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Intends to provide a relatively brief evaluation of key cognitive domains relevant to schizophrenia and related disorders. The composite score is calculated as a sum of all T scores from the battery's sub tests. Composite scores range from 213 (0.1 %tile) to 487 (99.9 %tile).</description>

    <measure>Change in N-back score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; mid-test (week 6); post-test (week 12);</time_frame>
    <description>The n-back measures working memory capacity. The participant is presented with a series of stimuli and instructed to indicate with a button press when the current stimulus matches the stimulus that appeared a pre-determined number (n) of trials before. Both accuracy (percentage of correct responses) and reaction time (milliseconds) will be recorded, and d' (d prime) will be calculated as a measure of signal detection. Increase in d' signifies improved signal detection, i.e. a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline; mid-test (week 6); post-test (week 12); follow-up (week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Measures functional capacity by assessing skills involved in everyday tasks important to daily living. Points are scored for each of two sub scales based on the participant's correct performance of items in the sub scale (incorrect: 0 points, correct: 1 or 2 points). Points are used to derive a sub scale score by dividing points scored by the number of items in the sub scale (percentage correct) and multiplied by 50. The two sub scale scores are then added to derive the total score, with a possible range of 0-100. Higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline; mid-test (week 6); post-test (week 12); follow-up (week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Measures symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia. Scores are assigned for symptom categories based on a semi-structured clinical interview with anchored severity scales (1-7) for each symptom category. Total score is derived by adding up individual symptom scores, resulting in a total score range of 24-168. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. A decrease in scores over time would indicate symptom reduction, i.e. a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Measures of symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia with an emphasis on negative symptoms. Scores are assigned to symptom categories based on a semi-structured clinical interview with anchored severity scales (0-6 or 0-9). Total score is derived by adding up individual symptom scores, resulting in a total score range of 0-90. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. A decrease in scores over time would indicate symptom reduction, i.e. a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Three different stimulation montages will be programmed: right, left and sham. During the Ramp periods, 2 mA current will be delivered to both AF3 and AF4 with an ascending (RampUp) and descending ramp (RampDown) over 30 sec via two saline soaked electrode sponges (~ 25cm²; current density = 0.08 mA/cm²). In this way, all subjects experience the same sensation on both sides to blind them to condition. During the Constant period, current will be set based on the Condition: Right - 2mA AF4 anode-AF3 cathode; Left - 2mA applied to AF3 anode-AF4 cathode; Sham - current turned off.</description>
