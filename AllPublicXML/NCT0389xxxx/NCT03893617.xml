  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the impact of psychological stress on DNA integrity by
      conducting an experiment under controlled conditions with healthy volunteers to directly test
      the extent to which acute stress increases DNA damage, while simultaneously testing the
      blocking effects of pre-treatment with propranolol, and exploring key hypothesized mediators
      and moderators of the severity of the DNA damage.
