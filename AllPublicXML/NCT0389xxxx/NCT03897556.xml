  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will examine the effectiveness of a guaraná nutrition energy bar supplement on
      cancer-related fatigue based on scores from fatigue questionnaires. Participants will be
      randomized to one of three study arms: 1) two guaraná energy bars/day, 2) one guaraná energy
      bar/day 3) usual-care only/ no guaraná energy bars during study in cancer patients who have
      completed cancer treatment. We would also like to find out if this energy bar supplement
      improves physical performance, mood and reduces plasma glutamine and inflammation.
