  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, single dose, sequential group study to compare the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of pretomanid in the following two groups of subjects: 1) those with mild,
      moderate, and severe renal impairment including those with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) not
      needing dialysis; and 2) matched subjects with normal renal function. The study will be
      conducted in two parts. Part A will enroll subjects from Groups 1A and 2 (i.e. 6 healthy
      matched controls and 6 subjects with ESRD, not on dialysis). A decision to enroll subjects
      into Part B (i.e. to investigate mild, moderate and severe renal impairment) will be
      conducted after the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the parent compound and safety of subjects
      enrolled in Part A have been reviewed. Part B will be conducted if the results of Part A
      demonstrate that patients with ESRD, not on dialysis have different exposures to pretomanid
      that may impact safety or efficacy relative to the exposures of healthy subjects. If the
      decision is taken to conduct Part B, 6 subjects each with mild, moderate and severe renal
      impairment (Groups 3, 4, 5) will be enrolled together with additional healthy matched
      subjects (Groups 1B-1D). Part B, treatment Groups 3, 4, and 5 will be initiated concurrently
      when each subject in Groups 1A and 2 has completed Part A of the study. The approximate
      patient involvement will be 3 months. The primary objective is to evaluate the PK of
      pretomanid after a single oral dose of 200 mg in subjects with renal impairment compared to
      matched healthy controls.

      single oral dose of 200 mg pretomanid in renally impaired subjects to matched healthy
      controls; and 2) to measure representative plasma pretomanid metabolites (M19 and M50) for
      analysis.
