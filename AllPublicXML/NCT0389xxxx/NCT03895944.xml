  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical study to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics (primary objectives) and efficacy
      (secondary objective) of ET190L1-ARTEMIS™2 T-cells in patients with Cluster of
      Differentiation (CD) 19+ B cell Leukemia and Lymphoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARTEMIS™ is a novel chimeric T-cell therapy that in pre-clinical studies, functionally
      matches the efficacy of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells, but dramatically reduces the
      release of cytokines upon killing of target positive tumors. The molecular target for
      ET190L1-ARTEMIS™ is Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19), which is expressed on B cell
      Lymphomas and B cell Leukemias. ET190L1-ARTEMIS™ is a second generation ARTEMIS™ receptor
      engineered with a human Fab antibody domain against CD19. This clinical study evaluates the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of ET190L1-ARTEMIS™ T-cells in patients with relapsed/refractory
      B-cell lymphoma and B-cell Leukemia.
