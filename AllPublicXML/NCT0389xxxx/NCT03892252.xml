    <textblock>
      Guided by the idea of combining disease differentiation with syndrome differentiation in
      traditional Chinese medicine, this study used the form of questionnaire to summarize the
      changes of TCM syndromes, TCM constitution types in colorectal cancer patients before and
      after surgery. The Next-generation sequencing technology was used to explore the changes and
      differences of intestinal microorganisms before and after surgery. The correlation between
      changes of TCM syndromes, TCM constitution types, intestinal microbial evolution and tumor
      biological characteristics in colorectal cancer patients before and after surgery was
      analyzed. To explore the rationality of TCM in the prevention and treatment of colorectal
      cancer recurrence and metastasis in order to guide the individualized treatment and dietary
      regulation of TCM.
