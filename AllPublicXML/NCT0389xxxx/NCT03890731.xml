      The purpose of this study is to enable participants, currently receiving regorafenib in a
      Bayer-sponsored clinical trial, to continue treatment after their respective study has been
      closed. Patients participating in this study will be observed to collect information on how
      safe the drugs are and how this treatment is tolerated.

      The primary objectives of the study are a) to allow patients from Bayer-sponsored trials to
      continue regorafenib treatment after their respective study has been completed, and b) to
      further assess the safety of regorafenib. Secondary objective is the documentation of drug
      tolerability.
