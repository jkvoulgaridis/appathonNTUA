  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this graduate research study is to compare hydrostatic and vacuum casting
      techniques using patient mobility indicators, volume displacement, comfort, and overall
      satisfaction outcomes in trans-tibial amputees.

        -  Informed Consent

        -  Subject will be casted using both the hydrostatic and vacuum system techniques

      Visit 2 (7-10 days after Visit 1)

        -  One of two sockets will be randomly assigned and fitted/aligned by investigators

        -  Subject will be asked to perform a Timed Up and Go Test followed by a Six-Minute Walk
           Test

    <description>The Ohio Willow Wood Omega Tracer 3-dimensional image capture device and associated Omega shape capture software will be used to determine the volumes of each socket type, comparing the vacuum and aqua casting volume metrics. The scanning variables of width, depth, and length will determine the total displacement of each socket type. It has been determined that laser scanning is a valid and reliable method for accurately measuring volume fluctuations between casting methods.</description>

    <description>Participants will be cast using vacuum casting (Ottobock Harmony) method. The method of casting will be randomized via RNG. Participants will be fitted with both sockets and dynamic alignment procedures will be performed. This 15-minute fitting and alignment period will address any extreme gait deviations and initial socket discomforts. After fitting, the participant will then be given a 15-minute adjustment period to wear the device. We will then begin the assessment phase, beginning with the timed Get-Up and Go test and followed by the 6-Minute Walk test. Each patient will perform 3 rounds of each test and patient order will be determined at random. The participants will be given a 10 min break between each series of tests. At the end, a questionnaire will be given.</description>
