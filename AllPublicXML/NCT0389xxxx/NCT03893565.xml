  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic
      relapsing and remitting inflammation of the colon and rectum. There remains a high unmet need
      for novel treatments that achieve a higher rate of efficacy in resolving disease symptoms,
      and inducing and maintaining mucosal healing to achieve long-term corticosteroid-free
      remission. T cells are integral to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and clinical
      experience with anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies has established the principle of T
      cell-targeted therapies in the disease. GSK2831781 causes targeted depletion of Lymphocyte
      activation gene-3 (LAG3+) T cells, and has shown preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy in
      plaque psoriasis. It is therefore hypothesized that GSK2831781 will selectively deplete
      activated mucosal T cells in ulcerative colitis, but with relative sparing of resting T
      cells. This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and dose-response
      of GSK2831781 in participants with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis. The study
      consists of a 5-week screening window, 10-week Induction Phase, 30-week double-blind Extended
      Treatment Phase (ETP) with 42-week Follow-Up Phase. Non-Responders identified following the
      Week 10 assessment will be allocated to open label treatment, consisting of Induction (Weeks
      12 to 22), an Open label ETP (Weeks 22 to 42) and a follow-Up to Week 54. Approximately 242
      participants will be included in the study.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be initially randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive GSK2831781 or Placebo. Further, randomization to (GSK2831781 Dose Level 1 to 4 IV [intravenously] or placebo) will be done at a ratio of 2:3:3:3:2 for a double-blind induction phase. Week 10 Responders will receive subcutaneous (SC) doses of GSK2831781 every 4 weeks (q4w). Responders in placebo treatment arm will continue to receive blinded placebo through SC dosing in a double-blind ETP. Non-responders to double blind induction phase at Week 10 will switch to open label induction where they will be administered same induction dosing schedule of GSK2831781 from Week 12 to 22 followed by an open label ETP (Weeks 22 to 42) and a follow-up to Week 54. Open-label induction phase participants will be assessed for responder status at Week 22. Responders from this phase will receive GSK2831781Maintenance dosing SC q4w until Week 38, while Non-Responders to open label ETP will discontinue treatment.</intervention_model_description>

             disease-unclassified, Crohn's disease, infectious colitis, or ischemic colitis.

          -  Participants with fulminant ulcerative colitis (as defined by 6 bloody stools daily
             and 1 or more of body temperature &gt;=100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (or 38 degree Celsius) or

             planned surgery for ulcerative colitis.

          -  Participants with any uncontrolled medical conditions, other than active ulcerative
             colitis, that in the opinion of the investigator put the participant at unacceptable
             risk or interfere with study assessments or integrity of the data. Other medical
             conditions should be stable at the time of screening and be expected to remain stable

             the Medical Monitor's discretion). b) A history of opportunistic infections within 1
             year of screening (e.g. Pneumocystis jirovecii, aspergillosis or Cytomegalovirus
             colitis). This does not include infections that may occur in immunocompetent
             individuals, such as fungal nail infections or vaginal candidiasis, unless it is of an
             unusual severity or recurrent nature. c) Recurrent or chronic infection or other
             active infection that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might cause this study to
             be detrimental to the participant. d) Symptomatic herpes zoster within 3 months prior
             to screening. e) History of tuberculosis (active or latent), irrespective of treatment
             status. f) A positive diagnostic tuberculosis test at screening (defined as a positive
             QuantiFERON test). In cases where the QuantiFERON test is indeterminate, the
             participant may have the test repeated once and if their second test is negative they
             will be eligible. In the event a second test is also indeterminate, the investigator
             has the option to undertake Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) testing. If the PPD
             reaction is less than (&lt;) 5 millimeter (mm), then the participant is eligible. If the
             reaction is &gt;= 5mm, or PPD testing is not undertaken, the participant is not eligible.
             g) Positive Clostridium difficile toxin test during screening. However, rescreening
             can be undertaken following successful treatment.

             (unless the participant has a documented history of selective immunoglobulin A
             deficiency).

          -  A major organ transplant (e.g. heart, lung, kidney, liver, pancreas) or hematopoietic
             stem cell/marrow transplant.

          -  Any planned major surgical procedure during the study.

             in situ of the uterine cervix (within 3 years) that has been fully treated and shows
             no evidence of recurrence.

          -  A change in dose of oral sulfasalazine or aminosalicylate within 2 weeks prior to
             Baseline endoscopy.

          -  Greater than 20 mg per day oral prednisolone (or equivalent), or a change in dose of
             corticosteroid within 2 weeks prior to Baseline endoscopy, or anticipated inability to
