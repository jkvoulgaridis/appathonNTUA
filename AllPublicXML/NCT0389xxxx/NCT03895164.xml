  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stunting and anemia amongst under-two children are attributable to poor nutrient intakes. The
      study evaluates the effectiveness of nutrition education on local specific food-based
      complementary feeding recommendation (CFR) to improve dietary patterns and nutritional
      intakes, as well as reduce stunting and anemia among under-two children.
