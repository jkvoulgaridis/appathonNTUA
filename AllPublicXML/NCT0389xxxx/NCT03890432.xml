  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survival and the outcomes of critically ill patients are strongly influenced by
      insulin-therapy and nutritional support. The GLUCOSAFE 2 pilot study, aims to test the
      performance and the security of the new GLUCOSAFE 2 software, developed by the model-based
      medical decision support of Aalborg University (Denmark) and adapted to the clinical needs in
      the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Geneva University Hospital (HUG). This new device is
      based on a mathematical model of the glucose-insulin metabolism and attempts to give advices
      for better glycaemia control and nutritional therapy. The GLUCOSAFE 2 study hypothesizes that
      the use of the Glucosafe 2 software will allow better glycaemia (&quot;Time-in-target&quot;) control
      and better achievement of nutritional energy and protein targets in comparison to the local
      protocols.
