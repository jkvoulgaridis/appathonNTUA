        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18

          -  The subject or the subject's legally authorized representative has signed and dated an
             Informed Consent Form.

          -  Patient has been treated with another Stent-retriever device without achieving
             successful reperfusion and continues to have angiographic confirmation of a Large
             Vessel Occlusion (LVO) in the same vessel or likely resulting from the same clot.

          -  mRS 0-1 prior to this stroke.

          -  The Geometric Clot Extractor is used to attempt revascularization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently participating in an investigational (drug, device, etc.) clinical trial that
             may confound study endpoints. Patients in observational, natural history, and/or
             epidemiological studies not involving intervention are eligible.

          -  Confirmation of positive pregnancy test according to site specific standard of care
             (e.g. test, verbal communication).

          -  Patients who had direct aspiration via syringe/mechanical pump prior to GCE.

          -  All patients with severe hypertension on presentation (SBP &gt; 220 mmHg and/or DBP &gt; 120
             mm Hg). All patients, in whom intravenous therapy with blood pressure medications is
             indicated, with hypertension that remains severe and sustained despite intravenous
             antihypertensive therapy (SBP &gt;185 mmHg and/ or DBP &gt;110 mmHg).

          -  Known cerebral vasculitis.

          -  Known cancer with life expectancy less than 12 months.

          -  Stenosis, or any occlusion, in a proximal vessel that requires treatment or prevents
             access to the site of occlusion.

          -  Intracranial stenosis that prevents access to the site of occlusion.

          -  Computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evidence of recent/ fresh
             hemorrhage on presentation.

          -  Baseline computed tomography (CT) or MRI showing mass effect or intracranial tumor
             (except small meningioma).

          -  Evidence of dissection in the extra or intracranial cerebral arteries.

          -  Occlusions in multiple vascular territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or
             anterior/posterior circulation).
