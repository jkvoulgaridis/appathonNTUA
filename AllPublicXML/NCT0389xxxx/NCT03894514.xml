  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical procedure applied as a common solution to
      overcome limitations produced by advanced stages of severe gonarthrosis. The procedure has
      high prevalence, high associated costs, and is considered to be cost-effective.
      Rehabilitation is essential to optimize outcomes. However, in clinical practice, the length
      of rehabilitation for each patient may be highly variable, and the programmed times may lack
      the necessary objectivity. Current limitation of resources and increasing prevalence make
      essential to generate strategies to optimize surgical results, so that the use of resources
      of the health system is efficient without detriment to the patient's benefit. For this
      purpose, objective and pragmatic information must be available, and should be based on
      scientific evidence in order to assist in making clinical decisions. Indeed, a number of
      demographic, biomedical and psychosocial factors have been identified as predictors of TKA
      results (i.e weight, age, expectations...). Some of them have been associated with the need
      for hospital resources after surgery. However, most researches base their predictions in
      retrospective studies, which are limited in the type of variables that can be used (clinic
      history), quality of registries, and limitations of retrospective designs. On the other hand,
      most of prospective researches base their predictions in a limited number of outcomes. To
      overcome this limitations, this project has been designed as a prospective observational
      study with two observations of each patient.

        -  The primary goal is to implement a multi-variable prediction model of TKA outcome, so
           that the procedure become optimal in two aspects : patient recovery (social and economic
           benefit) and use of health system resources (economic benefit). The implementation
           requires a processing of the information sampled through various algorithms and
           innovative data processing in this field, based on data mining and machine learning
           techniques. This will be used in search of the model with the greatest predictive
           capacity.

        -  As a secondary objective, information extracted from patients both in the final stages
           of the condition, and in the medium term after the intervention will allow to study the
           functional and psychosocial reality of the subjects with knee osteoarthritis.

    <measure>Oxford knee Score (OKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from preoperative assessment to six months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Reported Outcome questionnaire to specifically assess the patient's perspective of outcome following Total Knee Arthroplasty. The OKS consists of twelve questions covering function and pain associated with the knee. Each question is scored from 0 to 4 (0 being the worst outcome and 4 being the best). The overall score is the sum of all items and can range from 0 to 48, with higher scores corresponding to better outcomes</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ-short form)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from preoperative assessment to six months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses the types of intensity of physical activity and sitting time that people do as part of their daily lives. It consists of open-ended questions surrounding individuals' last 7-day recall of physical activity. Total physical activity is estimated in metabolic (MET) MET-min/week and time spent sitting. Then three level or categories are proposed (1=low, 2=moderate and 3=high level of physical activity)</description>

    <measure>Euro Quality of Life 5D questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from preoperative assessment to six months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, with 3 possible answers; the score is obtained from the possible binary combination of answers, and interpreted using the visual analogue scale validation technique for the Spanish population.</description>

    <description>Yesavage Scale. The short form of this questionnaire consists of a 15-item self-report assessment used to identify depression in older adults. Questions are answered &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, and results consider and individual to be non depressed (normal&lt;5), probably depressed (mild=5&lt;10) and very likely to ve depressed (severe&gt;10)</description>
