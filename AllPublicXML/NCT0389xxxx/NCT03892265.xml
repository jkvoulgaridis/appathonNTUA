  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will establish a longitudinal cohort of 3,000 adults &gt;18 years in
      Port-au-Prince using multistage random sampling, and follow them for 2 to 3.5 years depending
      on the timing of study enrollment to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular
      disease risk factors and diseases. Cardiovascular risk factors include hypertension,
      diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, kidney disease, poor diet, cigarette smoking, physical
      inactivity, and inflammation. Cardiovascular disease include myocardial infarction, heart
      failure, stroke, and CVD mortality. It is anticipated that hypertension prevalence will be
      â‰¥10% in 18-30 year olds, that hypertension incidence will be &gt;10 events/1000 person years.
      Association of determinants and risk factors with CVD will also be examined. Whole blood,
      serum, plasma, stool, and urine samples will be biobanked for future studies.

      Investigators propose a 5-year observational study which includes establishing a
      population-based longitudinal cohort to determine the prevalence and incidence of
      cardiovascular risk factors and diseases in Haiti. Cardiovascular risk factors include
      hypertension, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, dyslipidemia, smoking, alcohol use, physical
      inactivity, poor diet, and inflammation. Cardiovascular diseases include myocardial
      infarction, heart failure, stroke and cardiac death. The cohort will include 3,000 adults
      (&gt;18 years) living in Port-au-Prince who will be followed for 2 to 3.5 years, depending on
      time of study enrollment. Participants will be selected via multistage random sampling using
      census blocks . The GHESKIO Community Advisory Board and GHESKIO community health workers
      (CHWs) will conduct community sensitization about the study prior to study recruitment. CHWs
      will introduce the study to selected households and individuals, who will then be referred to
      the research team at GHESKIO for informed consent and study enrollment procedures.
      Participants will complete the study enrollment, 12- and 24-month study visits at GHESKIO.
      These study visits include a study questionnaire, measurement of blood pressure and
      assessment for cardiovascular symptoms and events. Laboratory measures and an
      electrocardiogram will be done at study enrollment and the 24-month visit. Participants will
      also provide blood, urine and stool samples for biobanking at study enrollment and again at
      24 months (blood only). CHWs will perform home visits at 6 and 18 months on all participants
      (and every six months after 24 months for patients with longer follow-up) to update locator
      information, measure blood pressure, and ask about cardiovascular symptoms and events. CHWs
      will also call the participant every three months to confirm contact information. Any
      participant who reports a cardiovascular symptom or event to research staff at any time
      during the study will be referred to the GHESKIO clinic or to a GHESKIO-affiliate hospital
      for clinical care. The research team will abstract data from medical records of referred
      patients on information regarding diagnosis codes, laboratory results, diagnostic imaging and
      cause of death.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The prevalence of CVD risk factors including HTN, diabetes, obesity, cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, kidney disease, poor diet, physical inactivity, and inflammation will be calculated. Prevalence will be reported for categorical risk factors (e.g., HTN), and mean and standard deviation will be estimated for continuous risk factors (e.g., BP, lipid levels). The research team will also estimate the prevalence of each CVD outcome including MI, HF, and stroke.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for 2-3.5 years depending on timing of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will calculate the incidence rate of each CVD risk factor per 1000 person years (PY) of follow-up among participants without the respective CVD risk factor at baseline using a Horvitz-Thompson type estimator accounting for unequal sampling weights. Similarly, investigators will calculate the incidence rate of each CVD outcome among participants without the respective CVD at baseline.</description>

      Biologic specimens include blood and urine specimens. A blood sample will be assessed for
      hematology, serum creatinine, glucose, cholesterol, and lipids (high-density lipoprotein and
      low-density lipoprotein), HIV-1, and finger prick lead level at the GHESKIO laboratory at
      baseline. Serum creatinine, glucose, cholesterol and lipids will be repeated at 24 months. A
      urine sample will be assessed for a urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) using urine
      supernatant samples at enrollment and 24 months.

      Biobanked specimens (whole blood, plasma, urine) will be collected on all participants at
      enrollment and at 24 months (blood only).

        The study population will include 3,000 adults &gt;=18 years from a population-representative
        sample. Participants will be selected via multistage random sampling. Investigators will
        randomly select approximately 2,045 GPS waypoints across census blocks with the number of
        waypoints per block proportional to the IHSI estimated population size of each block. GPS
        waypoints will be randomly selected from satellite area maps, using ArcGIS software, and
        identified with GPS devices.
