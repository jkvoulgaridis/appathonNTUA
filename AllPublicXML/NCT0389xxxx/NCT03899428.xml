  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that over 50% of HCC cases worldwide are related to chronic HBV. There are
      approximately 350-400 million people across the world infected with HBV, the majority reside
      in or originate from Asia. Each year HBV accounts for 749,000 new cases of HCC and 692,000
      HCC-related deaths. The annual incidence of HCC is estimated to be &lt;1% for non-cirrhotic HBV
      infected patients and 2-3% for those with cirrhosis.

      While the most approved nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) suppress HBV replication through
      inhibition of HBV‐DNA polymerase and are reported to reduce the risk of HCC incidence,
      however, such risk is not completely eliminated under NA treatment. The recent availability
      of commercial quantitative assays of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has enabled
      quantitative HBsAg to be used as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment response in CHB. It
      has been suggested that HBsAg decline during lamivudine or entecavir therapy is slower and
      less pronounced compared to interferon treatment, despite a higher effect on HBV DNA
      suppression. Based on HBsAg kinetics, it has been estimated that the predicted median time to
      HBsAg loss in patients treated with lamivudine or entecavir is more than 30 years. Thus,
      treatment that can induce rapid decline of HBsAg would have clear advantage in reducing the
      treatment duration required to achieve HBsAg-loss.

      Interestingly, in a recent preliminary study, 12-weeks of treatment with nivolumab has showed
      the modest effect on HBsAg decline in HBeAg negative CHB patients. Thus, in this clinical
      trial, the investigator will investigate whether immune checkpoint therapy is more effective
      in inducing HBsAg decline compared with target therapy in HBsAg-positive patients with
      advanced stage HCC.
