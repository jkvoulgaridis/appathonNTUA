  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week treatment, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group comparison
      feasibility study to evaluate the effectiveness of the Albuterol eMDPI Digital System (DS),
      including inhaler, App, DHP (Cloud solution), and dashboard, to optimize outcomes in patients
      at least 13 years of age or older with asthma.

      The study will consist of a screening visit, a 12-week open-label treatment period, and a
      follow-up telephone call (2 weeks following treatment completion).

      Patients with suboptimal asthma control will be enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to 1 of 2 parallel groups stratified by investigational center: DS group patients
      utilizing the Albuterol eMDPI DS, including inhaler, App, DHP (Cloud solution), and
      dashboard, and CC group patients who will be treated with their standard of care
      albuterol-administering rescue inhalers and will not use the DS during the treatment period.
