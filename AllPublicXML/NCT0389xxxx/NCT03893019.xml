  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase l multi-centric, single arm, prospective, open, dose-escalation study in
      patients with unresectable stage III oder IV melanoma. The trial will include 15 adult
      patients. The trial is a classic 3+3 design with 1 Log dose increments and maximum 3 dose
      levels of the intravenously administered MB-CART20.1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I trial will be the first trial with CD20 CAR transduced T cells in Europe
      targeting melanoma. The rationale for the trial is based on the finding that melanoma cancer
      sustaining cells express CD20 and that targeting CD20+ cells in preclinical model has a
      strong antitumor effect.

             be allowed if HbsAb is present, negative testing of HCVAb, negative human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1/2 test within 6 weeks prior to enrollment.
