      To evaluate the effects of DAAs on HRQL in patients with liver cirrhosis secondary to chronic
      HCV infection
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C has been associated with substantial resource utilization as a result of its
      effect on the liver as well as other organ systems (the extrahepatic manifestations of HCV).
      It has been widely reported to have a profound negative impact on patient's health-related
      quality of life (HRQL).

      The reduction of HRQL is probably also due to physical and psychiatric symptoms as a direct
      consequence of this chronic infection and its sequelae (such as cirrhosis). The chronic
      inflammation is believed to signal the brain and to give rise to neurovegetative symptoms
      (e.g. malaise and fatigue) and to amongst others depression and concentration difficulties.
      Possibly, also the brain itself is infected by HCV . The Egyptian government introduced
      Sofosbuvir as the first DAAs into Egypt through the government funded National Treatment
      Program. These agents are highly efficacious with significantly fewer side effects .

      To date, there is only one study reported about how Egyptian HCV patients receiving the new
      DAAs perceive their HRQL. This study is first one to be done in Upper Egypt to assess
      health-related quality of life of HCV patients receiving direct acting antivirals (DAAs)
      therapy prior and at the end of therapy

    <description>The Short Form (SF)-36 Health Survey was used to measure HRQL. The SF-36 generates a profile of HRQL outcomes by measuring health across eight different dimensions: physical functioning, role limitation because of physical health, social functioning, vitality, bodily pain, mental health, role limitation because of emotional problems and general health. Responses to each question within a dimension are combined to generate a score from 0to100; where100 indicates &quot;good health&quot;</description>

        Patients with hepatitis C related liver cirrhosis being treatedusing the Egyptian National
        Guidelines will be enrolled. According to the most updated treatment protocol, patients
        undergo therapy for a relatively short period (3 to6 months).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with hepatitis C related liver cirrhosis (diagnosed clinically laboratory and
             by imaging).

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Eligible for starting DAAs therapy according to Egyptian National Guidelines will be
             enrolled.

          -  Follow up of those patients during and after DAAs therapy (clinically
             ,laboratory,imaging and with a questionnaire ) to determine HRQL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             e. g. auto immune liver disease, PBC
