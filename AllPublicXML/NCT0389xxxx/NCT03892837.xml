  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet-rich plasma(PRP), is a concentrate of platelet-rich plasma protein derived from
      whole blood. The main components of it are platelets, leukocytes and fibrin. Autologous PRP
      treatment can avoid the immune rejection caused by exogenous growth factor and the spread of
      disease. Evidence of the efficacy and safety of PRP has been proven in many studies. Benign
      central airway stenosis is characterized by airway compromise involving the larynx, trachea,
      or bronchi and will lead to devastating consequences. Unfortunately, the incidence of this
      disease is increasing steadily. As most important treatment for benign airway stenosis,
      respiratory intervention has become one of the most common treatments to fight the disease.
      However, the restenosis caused by tissue hyperplasia, wound repair and scar formation after
      treatment is still common, which remains the limitation of respiratory intervention.
      Long-term efficacy of repeated interventional treatment is unsatisfying, too. Several studies
      have discovered similar mechanism between stenosis of tracheal to hyperplastic scar of skin,
      both of which are relative with deep structure injury such as the intrinsic layer of airway
      mucosa. PRP has shown significant efficacy for hyperplastic scar of skin. Correspondingly,
      PRP will be applied as treatment of refractory benign airway stenosis to reduce restenosis by
      inhibit the formation of granulation.
