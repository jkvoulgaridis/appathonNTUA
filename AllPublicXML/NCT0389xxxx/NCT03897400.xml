  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease reduces fertility by inducing inflammation both directly and in the fallopian
      tubes and ovaries and indirectly through surgical interventions and tubal adhesions
      associated with disease treatment. Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) is a reliable indicator of
      ovarian reserve in women. The aim of this study was to compare serum AMH levels in women with
      Crohn's disease and healthy controls. In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate
      AMH and ovarian capacity in the study group with crohn's disease and in the control group
      without disease.
