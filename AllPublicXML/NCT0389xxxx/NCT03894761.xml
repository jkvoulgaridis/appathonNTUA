  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who were diagnosed as rotator cuff syndrome by clinical examination and magnetic
      resonance imaging will be included in this prospective study.

      Demographic data (gender, age, education level, occupation), shoulder pain duration, history
      of trauma to the shoulder, smoking, dominant arm and diabetes will be questioned and body
      mass indexes will be calculated. Active shoulder range of motion of the patients will be
      measured by goniometer and recorded .

      Specific tests, which are important for rotator cuff lesion, will be performed to determine
      whether they are positive or not.

      Magnetic resonance imaging of the patients with shoulder pathology will be recorded.

      A visual analog scale will be used to determine the intensity of day and night pain. Shoulder
      Shoulder Pain and Disability Index to assess shoulder disability of patients, SF-36 form will
      be filled by patient to evaluate the effect of shoulder pathology and Kinesiophobia Score to
      assess the avoidance of pain induced movement.

    <measure>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPDA) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions (for pain and for functional activities). The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use.
Each of the 13 items is to be rated with a number from 0 to 10:
For the pain score (first 5 items): 0 means no pain and 10 means worst pain imaginable;
For the disability score (last 8 items): 0 means no impairment and 10 means the patient requires help to perform that action.
Scores could theoretically range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating greater impairment. The total SPADI score was calculated by averaging the pain and disability subscale scores. The total SPADI score could also range from 0 to 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia is a 17-item self report checklist using a 4-point Likert scale that was developed as a measure of fear of movement or (re)injury.
The TSK is a self-completed questionnaire and the range of scores are from 17 to 68 where the higher scores indicate an increasing degree of kinesiophobia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Short Form-36</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body mass index</measure>

    <measure>Jobe test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's arm elevates to 90 degrees in the scapular plane, with the elbow extended, full internal rotation, and pronation of the forearm. This results in a thumbs-down position, as if the patient were pouring liquid out of a can, and the patient tries to resist this motion. This test is considered positive if the patient experiences pain or weakness with resistance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>drop-arm test</measure>

    <measure>Patte test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner places the patient's arm to 90 degrees in the scapular plane and flexes the elbow to 90 degrees . The patient is then asked to externally rotate against resistance. The test is positive if the patient is unable to perform external rotation.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner passively flexes the patient's elbow to 90 degrees and brings the shoulder into a position of 20 degrees of scaption. Next, the examiner passively takes the patient's shoulder into a position of maximal lateral rotation. The patient in then instructed to hold that position. A positive test is if the patient cannot maintain the position and the shoulder rotates internally.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lag sign test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The elbow is passively flexed to 90° and the shoulder abducted to 90° and held 5° off maximal external rotation. The patient is then asked to maintain the position actively while the examiner releases the wrist while maintaining support through the elbow.Patients will be evaluated for positive test or negative test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gerber lift-off test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is examined in standing and is asked to place their hand behind their back with the dorsum of the hand resting in the region of the mid- lumbar spine. The dorsum of the hand is raised off the back by maintaining or increasing internal rotation of the humerus and extension at the shoulder.
Inability to move the dorsum off the back constitutes an abnormal lift-off test and indicates subscapularis rupture or dysfunction.</description>
