    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to recruit and train men to promote HIV self-testing to their
      network members in their camps and examine the efficacy of a peer-led HIV self-testing
      intervention on the uptake of HIV testing among men.

    <textblock>
      The research is the first evaluation of an unsupervised HIV self-testing strategy in Tanzania
      focusing on networks of heterosexual men. The reasons for focusing on heterosexual men is
      because heterosexual contact is the primary mode of HIV transmission in Tanzania and data
      from our previous trial indicate that 97% of the male camp members are heterosexual. Moreover
      it will be the first intervention to engage male peer leaders to promote HIV self-testing in
      their social networks in Tanzania. We will build on previous work our research team has
      conducted to identify 'camps' or local venues where young men socialize with elected leaders
      and members pay membership dues. Our previous intervention has proven successful to recruit
      and train leaders from camps to serve as community health leaders in their respective camps,
      with the goal of changing social norms related to HIV and gender-based violence. A novel
      approach to the proposed research is that we will leverage the work we have conducted within
      camps with social networks of men to test the acceptability and feasibility of oral
      fluid-based HIV self-testing and confirmatory blood-based HIV testing within existing
      networks of men that we know we can access through stable social venues. We will recruit male
      camp leaders to train them about HIV self-testing and instruct them to return to their camps
      and engage their male peers by informing them about HIV self-testing for prior to our
      research team offering participants the opportunity to self-test.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants who agree to self-test will receive pretest counseling and a 10 minute demonstration, including a video in addition to verbal instructions, of how to use an oral self-test kit from a trained HIV counselor. After counseling, participants will receive 2 oral fluid self-test kits to conduct the self-test at home or in a private location during the next 3 months, a phone number to call in case they need assistance when performing the self-test at home, and a location where to return the used self-test kits and collect more test kits throughout the study period. Upon returning the used self-test kits after every 3 months, participants will be able to share their self-test result with the counselor. Participants will also be asked at each pick-up time to demonstrate they can use the kit to ensure participants continue to receive correct self-test results throughout the study period.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Camp members will receive information about HIV self-testing from peer educators who will be nominated by you and other camp members in your camp. Camp members in the STEP project will receive pretest counseling and a 10 minute demonstration. They will receive 1 oral fluid HIV self-test kit to conduct the self-test at home or in a private location during the next 1 month and a phone number to call in case you need assistance when performing the self-test at home. They will also receive information about the nearest HIV Care and Treatment Center where they can seek a confirmatory HIV test and start HIV treatment in the event of a positive self-test result.</description>
