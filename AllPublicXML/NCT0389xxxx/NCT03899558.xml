  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common lung disease, affecting 1.2 million
      people in the United Kingdom (UK). COPD patients suffer with episodes of worsening breathing
      symptoms called acute exacerbations (AECOPD). Exacerbations occur more often as the disease
      progresses and are a leading cause of emergency hospitalisation. Patients recovering from
      exacerbations are at high risk of deteriorating, with one quarter readmitted to hospital
      within thirty days. COPD thus imposes immense burdens on the National Health Service and
      patients.

      This research will investigate the effects of using humidified nasal high-flow (HNHF) during
      recovery from severe COPD exacerbations. HNHF delivers warmed, humidified air under flows of
      up to 60 litres per minute through a nasal interface. This has been shown to improve clinical
      outcomes, including exacerbation frequency, hospitalisations, breathlessness and quality of
      life amongst COPD patients with respiratory failure. It is thought to achieve this by
      improving secretion clearance and providing positive airways pressure which supports the
      breathing system.

      Patients admitted to St Thomas' Hospital, London with COPD exacerbations will be recruited.
      Prior to discharge, participants will be randomised to receive either usual care alone or
      usual care plus a HNHF device, which they will be trained to use for a regular period daily.
      Usual care includes inhalers, steroids and may include antibiotics.

      Participants will be followed up for 30-days after hospital discharge using weekly
      assessments, daily symptom diaries and wrist-worn watch-like devices that detect physical
      activity. This will enable evaluation of the clinical effects of HNHF on re-exacerbations,
      readmissions, breathlessness, physical activity and quality of life. Device usage will also
      be quantified. Participants who receive devices will be interviewed to explore their
      experiences. After the 30-day home follow-up period, a sub-group of participants will undergo
      detailed breathing tests during and after exercise to explore the effects of HNHF on the
      respiratory system.
