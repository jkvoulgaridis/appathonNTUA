  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the data of the patients who were hospitalized due to trauma in intensive care
      unit (ICU) were examined in their first development. The mortality rate and the factors
      affecting mortality in these patients were determined

    <textblock>
      In this study, 107 trauma patients were examined. Patients were divided into two groups
      according to ICU results: survivors (Group 1) and deceased patients (Group2). Patients were
      rated in terms of age, Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) , mean platelet volüme (MPV), lactat
      value, intensive care unit stay, APACHE 2 soring systems. Mortality rate and the factors
      affecting this rate were examined.

      83 of the patients were male (77.58%) and 24 were female (22.42%). The mean age was 46 years.
      The mean value of lactate level was 3.25. MPV mean value was 10.34. NLR mean value was 8.23
      and Apache 2 score mean value was 22.8. The average length of stay in hospital was 11.33
      days. When the intergroup mortality was evaluated in terms of the relationship between
      continuous variables, there was a statistically significant difference in apache 2 score. No
      statistically significant difference was found between age, lactate, MPV, NRL and length of
      hospital stay.

      NRL, MPV, Lactate levels were not suitable for evaluation of trauma patients as a early
      prognostic factor in the first day ICU admission. The investigators think that the use of
      trauma scoring systems such as apache 2 related to mortality during first hospitalization in
      ICU is more appropriate.
