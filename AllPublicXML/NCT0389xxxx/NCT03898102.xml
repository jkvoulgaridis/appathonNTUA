  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II randomized trial to investigate whether supplementation of zinc decreases the
      incidence of HFSR that occurs after treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, regorafenib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate the effect of zinc supplementation on improving
      regorafenib treatment safety and efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      (mCRC). The difference in grade 2 or worse hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) incidence within
      the first 8 weeks of regorafenib treatment between two arms will be examined as the primary
      objective.
