  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of avelumab and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
      and see what effects (good and bad) that this combination treatment has on subjects with
      recurrent bladder cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be exams, tests and procedures to see if the patient is eligible for the study.
      Some are part of regular cancer care and others are part of the study. Subjects will also
      need to complete a research questionnaire at certain points in the study.

      Subjects will receive treatment of avelumab and intravesical BCG until unacceptable toxicity
      or tumor progression.

      Study participation is up to three years.
