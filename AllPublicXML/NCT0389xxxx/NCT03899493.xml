  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the uterus, abdominal wall, pelvic floor and brain interact
      during labor and parturition. It will uses electromyography (EMG) to compare the
      characteristics of the uterus, abdominal wall and perineum in subjects with and without
      various pregnancy characteristics.

      EMG will help established burst frequency and characteristics of the uterus compared to other
      parts of the body during labor and delivery. Other parts of the body may include abdominal
      surfaces (for uterine, abdominal, maternal EMG and fetal heart rate monitoring), perineal
      surface (for perineal muscles monitoring) and the maternal scalp (brain monitoring). EEG
      measures the electrical activity of the brain. The activity is recorded using wire electrodes
      attached to the scalp or mounted on a cap placed on the head. E MG measures electrical
      activity from muscles. It uses wire electrodes placed on the skin over the muscles.

      Pregnant adult volunteers and patients who present to the investigator's institution may be
      eligible for this study.

      Participants will lay or sit in a semi-reclining chair with sticker electrodes placed on the
      body surface area of interest. Muscle and/or brain activity will be measured with EEG and EMG
      recordings.

      Objectives

        -  To define the relationship between uterine electrical activity EMG during labor and
           parturition to various phases of labor and cervical dilations.

        -  To define the relationship between uterine and body site electrical activity EMG and
           brain EEG during labor and parturition in patient with hypertensive disorders of
           pregnancy

        -  To characterize electrical activity of pelvic floor muscles in relationship to uterine
           and abdominal muscles during delivery between subsets of patients

        -  To examine the electrical activity of women in preterm labor and those with labor
           dystocias to observe the effects of various treatments, which may have an impact on
           preventing or augmenting labor progress.

        -  To observe the impact of naturally occurring pregnancy pathology and common obstetrical
           interventions on the changes in uterine, abdominal, pelvic floor and brain EEG/EMG
           characteristics as compared to health normal gravid patients.

      Study Population:

      Pregnant volunteers greater than 18 years of age who speak English.

      Design:

      During the course of the participant's admission, they will be dispositioned to usual
      obstetric care which may include minimal intervention if spontaneous labor, induction of
      labor or augmentation of labor as indicated. As part of the study protocol, enrolled
      participants will be monitored with external sensors/transducers. The device will be attached
      to a patient's body, which may include the abdominal surface, perineal surface and the
      mother's scalp by trained study staff through electrical leads that are connected to
      commercially available EMG or EEG electrodes that have adhesive material in contact with the
      surface of the patient. Recordings will be made at specific times during labor
