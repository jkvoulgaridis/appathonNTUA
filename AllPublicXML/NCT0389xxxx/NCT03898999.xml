  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ankle is an important joint to maintain a good balance within the population of the older
      adult. As people get older, problems appear in this joint. Many of these problems affect the
      correct joint range of the ankle. There is evidence to suggest that a lower range of motion
      in the ankle can negatively affect balance and, consequently, increase the risk of falls in
      the elderly. It would be interesting to assess if this relationship is true. The aim of the
      study will be to study if the state of the joint range of the ankle is related in some way to
      balance and falls in the elderly.
