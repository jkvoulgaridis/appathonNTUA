  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Bank and the government of Nigeria are implementing a results-based financing (RBF)
      project for the states of Nasarawa, Adamawa, and Ondo. This project provides incentives for
      improving performance at critical levels within the Nigerian health system and aims to
      address some of these challenges. The primary goal of the impact evaluation of this project
      is to determine if providing financial incentives linked directly to performance increases
      the quantity and quality of maternal and child health (MCH) services.

      In each of the three selected States,the project finances the following interventions:

        1. Performance incentives to State Government and Local Government (LGA) agencies that are
           triggered by Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) that reflect strengthened supervision
           and enhanced operational support for improving health systems performance. These
           performance incentives would be paid out on an annual basis.

        2. In half of the LGAs in each state, one facility per ward will receive Performance-Based
           Financing (PBF) wherein payments are made directly to individual health facilities based
           on the quantity and quality of a set of pre-defined services provided by each facility.
           These performance incentives would be paid out on a quarterly basis.

        3. In the other half of the LGAs in each state one facility per ward will receive
           Decentralized Facility Financing (DFF) or equivalent financing that is not be linked to
           any service delivery targets. These payments would be made on a quarterly basis.

      The evaluation of the PBF arm, which consists of making payments to health facilities
      conditional on performance, but within an environment of comparable levels of overall
      financing, will rely on experimental assignment. The effect of the PBF intervention will be
      identified by comparing outcomes in the LGAs receiving PBF versus those receiving DFF in the
      three project states. In each of these three States, the LGAs will be randomly assigned to
      either the PBF package or to the DFF package.

    <description>At least one primary healthcare centre per ward and one General Hospital per selected LGA (in 50% of LGAs in each of the 3 states) and one secondary hospital per State will be contracted by the State Primary Health Care Development Agency ) , to deliver specified services at an agreed price. Selection of which services to focus on is based on priorities identified by the Federal Government of Nigeria and the states in 2010-2015. Initial prices for each service were based on shadow prices of providing the service and have been adjusted based on implementation experience.</description>
