  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assisted animal therapy (AAT) is getting more and more used worldwide, in such areas as
      gerontology, psychiatry, or oncology. It is a complementary therapy, and benefits for
      patients are various, including decrease of anxiety. In ICU, some case reports exist, but no
      study has ever been made in order to prove its benefits, not even its feasibility.

      In ReAnimal, the investigator aims to compare a group of patients receiving assisted animal
      therapy, versus a group of patients not receiving it. Primary objective will be the evolution
      of anxiety scores between the 2 groups of patients. Secondary objectives will be the
      comparison of mood scores, post traumatic stress syndrome scores, pain scores, and
      physiologic parameters such as blood pressure, cardiac frequency. The investigating team will
      also compare multi drug resistant bacteria incidence between the 2 groups. In the assisted
      animal therapy group, patients will also be asked to answer a satisfaction questionnaire.
