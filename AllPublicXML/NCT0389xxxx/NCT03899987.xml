      This phase II trial studies how well aspirin and rintatolimod with or without
      interferon-alpha 2b work in treating patients with prostate cancer before surgery. Aspirin
      may help to keep the prostate cancer from coming back. Rintatolimod may stimulate the immune
      system and interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Interferon-alpha 2b
      may improve the body's natural response to infections and may slow tumor growth. It is not
      yet known how well rintatolimod, aspirin, and interferon-alpha 2b work in treating patients
      with prostate cancer undergoing surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the immunomodulatory effectiveness of the combination of rintatolimod and aspirin
      with or without recombinant interferon alfa-2b (interferon [IFN]-alpha), in participants with
      localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and toxicity of the treatment combinations in participants with
      localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.

      II. Assess the antitumor activity between treatment arms.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the resected tumor tissue specimen and surrounding tissue samples of both study
      arms (pre versus [vs] post-chemokine modulatory [CKM] treatment, with vs without CKM, CKM
      doublet vs CKM triplet) with regards to infiltrating T cell subtypes, effector T cell
      (Teff)/regulatory T cell (Treg) ratios, CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC); the
      expression of chemokine receptors and immune checkpoint molecules on immune cells; local
      expression of Teff-attracting chemokines and Treg/MDSC-favoring chemokines; ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) signatures of groups of immune-regulatory genes that are modulated by the CKM regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive aspirin orally (PO) three times a day (TID) from day -5 to 7 days
      prior to surgery. Patients also receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b intravenously (IV)
      over 20 minutes and rintatolimod IV over 2 hours on days 1-3, 8-10 and 15-17 in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo radical prostatectomy
      on or between day 22-26.

      ARM II: Patients receive aspirin PO TID from day -5 to 7 days prior to surgery and
      rintatolimod IV over 2 hours on days 1-3, 8-10 and 15-17 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo radical prostatectomy on or
      between day 22-26.

      ARM III: Patients undergo radical prostatectomy about 4 weeks after enrollment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

    <description>This will be assessed by the increase in the total number of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the radical prostatectomy specimen (measured as cell density of CD8+ cell by immunohistochemistry), comparing Arm A versus Arm B versus Arm C. Will be natural log transformed prior to analysis. The primary analysis will consist of testing the single degree of freedom planned contrast at alpha = .10 that the 3 treatment means are in the ratio of 3:2:1 (contrast coefficients 3, -2, -1) for groups A, B and C, respectively groups. If this test rejects the null hypothesis of no group differences, will proceed to estimate group means and pairwise differences between groups with 90% confidence intervals. Non-overlapping confidence intervals will serve as evidence of differential treatment effects.</description>
