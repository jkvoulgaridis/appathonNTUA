  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a 12-week jump rope exercise program
      on body composition, blood pressure, insulin resistance, and academic self-efficacy in
      prehypertensive adolescent obese girls. Forty-eight prehypertensive adolescent obese girls
      participated in this study. The girls were randomly divided into the jump rope exercise
      intervention group (EX, n=24) and control group (CON, n=24). The EX group performed a jump
      rope training program at 40-70% of their heart rate reserve (HRR) 5 days/week for 12 weeks
      (sessions 50 minutes in duration). The CON group did not participate in any structure or
      unstructured exercise protocol. Blood pressure, body fat percentage, waist circumference,
      blood glucose and insulin, homeostatic model assessment - insulin resistance, and Academic
      Self-Efficacy were measured before and after the 12-weeks study.

    <description>Each jump rope exercise session of the program was performed for 50 minute, with a 5 minute warm-up and cool-down. Sessions were performed once a day, 5 days a week, for 12 weeks. The program consisted of various main jump rope exercises (1 line 2 jump, jumping feet together, running jumping, open side jump, open back and forth jump, rock paper scissor jump). The warm-up and cool-down consisted of static stretching, walking, and jogging. Intensity of exercise was gradually increased form 40-50% heart rate reserve (HRR) in weeks 1-4 and 60-70% HRR in weeks 9-12. Each training session was supervised by the researchers. Ever subject wore a heart rate monitor during the whole training session in order to maintain the designated training intensity.</description>
