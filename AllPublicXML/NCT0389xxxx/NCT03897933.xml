    <description>A Research assistant, blinded to the group allocation, interviewed patients and collected data at 5 times intervals ( 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, hours) in the 24 hours postoperatively. Patients were asked to rate their pain using verbal analog scale, where 0= no pain and 10= worst pain possible.</description>
