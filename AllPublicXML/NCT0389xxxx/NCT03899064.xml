  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a 6-week, Randomized study evaluating the potential of MC2-01 Cream to induce a
      photoallergic skin reaction in Healthy subjects, using a controlled photopatch test design.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the potential of MC2-01(CAL/BDP 0.005/0.064 w/w%) Cream to induce a
      photoallergic skin reaction. Because MC2-01 Cream is formulated for topical use and has shown
      to absorb light within the range of natural sunlight, it is necessary to determine the
      potential of this product to cause a photoallergic reaction after application to the skin.

    <intervention_model_description>The study consist of an Induction phase, where treatments (MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle) were applied to 2 test sites each (n=4), followed by irradiation/non-irradiation and evaluation 24, 48 or 72 hours post-irradiation. This was repeated in total 6 times over an 3 weeks period. The induction phase was followed by a challenge phase, where treatments (MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle) were applied to each two naive test sites and another naive test site was untreated. 24 hours of product application, one of each test sites (MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle) + the untreated test site were irradiated. Possible changes in dermal reaction (erythema and edema) was evaluated at all 5 test sites, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-irradiation.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Within-subject Comparison of Dermal Reaction by the Overall Numeric Rating of Erythema and Edema at 5 Defined Test Sites, After Application of MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 Vehicle or Untreated at Defined Test Sites, Followed by Irradiation.</measure>

    <description>After an induction phase, where subjects were treated with MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle and irradiation, the challenge phase was initiated.
MC2-01 Cream and MC2-01 vehicle was applied to each two naive test sites. Another naive test site was untreated. 24 hours after product application, one of each test site (MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle) + the untreated site were irradiated. Possible changes in dermal reaction (erythema and edema) was evaluated at all 5 test sites 24, 48 and 72 hours post-irradiation and these evaluations are the outcome measure of the study.
The following visual scores was used to express the response observed at each timepoints: Erythema: 0-3 where 0 represents no reaction and 3 represents marked/severe erythema. Edema: 0-2 where 0 represents no reaction and 2 represents definite edema with erosion/vesiculation. The diagnosis of photosensitization response will be made by the investigator based on review of the scored skin responses of both erythema and edema.</description>

        <title>Within-subject Comparison of Dermal Reaction by the Overall Numeric Rating of Erythema and Edema at 5 Defined Test Sites, After Application of MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 Vehicle or Untreated at Defined Test Sites, Followed by Irradiation.</title>
        <description>After an induction phase, where subjects were treated with MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle and irradiation, the challenge phase was initiated.
MC2-01 Cream and MC2-01 vehicle was applied to each two naive test sites. Another naive test site was untreated. 24 hours after product application, one of each test site (MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle) + the untreated site were irradiated. Possible changes in dermal reaction (erythema and edema) was evaluated at all 5 test sites 24, 48 and 72 hours post-irradiation and these evaluations are the outcome measure of the study.
The following visual scores was used to express the response observed at each timepoints: Erythema: 0-3 where 0 represents no reaction and 3 represents marked/severe erythema. Edema: 0-2 where 0 represents no reaction and 2 represents definite edema with erosion/vesiculation. The diagnosis of photosensitization response will be made by the investigator based on review of the scored skin responses of both erythema and edema.</description>

        <description>After an induction phase, where subjects were treated with MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle and irradiation, the challenge phase was initiated.
MC2-01 Cream and MC2-01 vehicle was applied to each two naive test sites. Another two naive test sites were untreated. 24 hours of product application, one of each test site (MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle and untreated) were irradiated.
Possible changes in dermal reaction (erythema and edema) was evaluated at all 6 test sites, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-irradiation and these evaluations are the outcome measure of the study. The following visual scores was used to express the response observed at each timepoints: Erythema: 0-3 where 0 represents no reaction and 3 represents marked/severe erythema. Edema: 0-2 where 0 represents no reaction and 2 represents definite edema with erosion/vesiculation. The diagnosis of photosensitization response will be made by the investigator based on review of the scored skin responses of both erythema and edema.</description>

        <description>After an induction phase, where subjects were treated with MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle and irradiation, the challenge phase was initiated.
MC2-01 Cream and MC2-01 vehicle was applied to each two naive test sites. Another two naive test sites were untreated. 24 hours of product application, one of each test site (MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle and untreated) were irradiated. Possible changes in dermal reaction (erythema and edema) was evaluated at all 6 test sites, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-irradiation and these evaluations are the outcome measure of the study.
The following visual scores was used to express the response observed at each timepoints: Erythema: 0-3 where 0 represents no reaction and 3 represents marked/severe erythema. Edema: 0-2 where 0 represents no reaction and 2 represents definite edema with erosion/vesiculation. The diagnosis of photosensitization response will be made by the investigator based on review of the scored skin responses of both erythema and edema.</description>

          <title>Within-subject Comparison of Dermal Reaction by the Overall Numeric Rating of Erythema and Edema at 5 Defined Test Sites, After Application of MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 Vehicle or Untreated at Defined Test Sites, Followed by Irradiation.</title>
          <description>After an induction phase, where subjects were treated with MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle and irradiation, the challenge phase was initiated.
MC2-01 Cream and MC2-01 vehicle was applied to each two naive test sites. Another two naive test sites were untreated. 24 hours of product application, one of each test site (MC2-01 Cream, MC2-01 vehicle and untreated) were irradiated. Possible changes in dermal reaction (erythema and edema) was evaluated at all 6 test sites, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-irradiation and these evaluations are the outcome measure of the study.
The following visual scores was used to express the response observed at each timepoints: Erythema: 0-3 where 0 represents no reaction and 3 represents marked/severe erythema. Edema: 0-2 where 0 represents no reaction and 2 represents definite edema with erosion/vesiculation. The diagnosis of photosensitization response will be made by the investigator based on review of the scored skin responses of both erythema and edema.</description>
          <population>As the study is a within subject evaluation of dermal reactions, after application on two sites with MC2-01 cream, two sites with MC2-01 vehicle and one site untreated, followed by either irradiation or non-irradiation, all subjects received all 5 different treatments.</population>

The 4th day in the challenge phase was considered the last visit for the subjects. AEs assessed as reasonably possibly related to the treatment had to be followed until they were resolved or until the medical condition of the subject was stable.</time_frame>
