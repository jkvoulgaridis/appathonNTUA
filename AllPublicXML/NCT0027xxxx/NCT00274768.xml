      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well capecitabine works in treating patients
      with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with a
           fixed-dose of capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical benefit, time to treatment failure (TTF), safety, and toxicity
           profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenetics in these patients.

        -  Correlate pharmacodynamic effects of this drug with toxicity and response in these
           patients.

        -  Determine compliance and adherence to this regimen and correlate with PK parameters in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive a fixed-dose of oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
