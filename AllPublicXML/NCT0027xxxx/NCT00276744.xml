      RATIONALE: Treating tumor tissue in the laboratory with different drugs may help doctors find
      the best drug for treating individual patients with pancreatic cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying an individualized drug treatment selection process,
      based on laboratory results, for treating patients with pancreatic cancer that can be removed
      by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Establish tumor xenografts from patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
           who undergo surgical resection at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

        -  Determine the activity of a series of 10 anticancer drugs against these tumors in ex
           vivo studies.

        -  Determine the response rate, time to treatment failure, and 6-month survival rate in
           patients whose tumors were xenografted and treated in the mouse when treated with the
           most active agent identified in that model.

        -  Define determinants of susceptibility and resistance to the drugs in xenografted tumors.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Part I (surgical resection, tumor xenografts generation, and drug selection): Patients
           undergo surgical resection. The resected tumor tissue is implanted in laboratory mice to
           generate tumor xenografts. The mice are then treated with a series of 10 approved
           anticancer drugs, whose anticancer activity are ranked from the most to the least
           effective based on response of the tumor xenografts. The most effective drug is
           identified for the individual patient. Patients for whom no drug is found to be
           effective are removed from the study. Patients who develop progressive disease after
           surgical resection and after mice data is available proceed to part II.

        -  Part II (individual patient treatment): Patients receive the most effective drug
           identified in part I in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The
           drugs may include bortezomib, capecitabine, cetuximab, docetaxel, erlotinib
           hydrochloride, gemcitabine hydrochloride, irinotecan hydrochloride, mitomycin C,
           sirolimus, or thalidomide.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas and peripancreatic adenocarcinoma, including distal cholangiocarcinoma,
             duodenal carcinoma, and ampullary pancreatic not amenable to curative treatment.

          3. ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          4. Age ≥ 18 years old.

          5. Expected survival &gt; 12 weeks.

          6. No prior treatment for recurrent disease.

          7. Willingness of male and female subjects, who are not surgically sterile or
             postmenopausal, to use reliable methods of birth control (oral contraceptives,
             intrauterine devices, or barrier methods used with a spermicide) for the duration of
             the study and for 30 days after the last dose of test article.

          8. Adequate liver, renal and bone marrow functions.

        WBC &gt; 3,500 cells/mm3 ANC &gt; 1,500 cells/mm3 Platelets &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9
        g/dl Serum creatinine 2 mg/dl Bilirubin 2 mg/dL ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase 5 times
        the upper limit of normal

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Patients in whom histologic or cytologic diagnosis is not consistent with
             adenocarcinoma.

          2. Patients in whom histologic or cytologic diagnosis is consistent with non epithelial
             origin tumors, including adenosquamous, islet cell, cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma,
             carcinoid, small or large cell carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma and melanoma

          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

        4. Patients who have had any previous surgery, excluding minor procedures, dental work,
        skin biopsy, etc. within 4 weeks of enrollment.

        5. Uncontrolled medical conditions that could potentially increase the risk of toxicities
        or complications when treated with chemotherapy. Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting
        in an inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior
        surgical procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease.

        6. Active infections.

        7. History of another neoplasm except for non-metastatic, nonmelanoma skin cancers, &lt; 5
        years prior to enrollment.

        therapy (except alopecia).

        11. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of the chemotherapy
        agents to be tested on the developing fetus are not known. Because there is an unknown but
        potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother
        with MMC, breast feeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with the drug.

        12. Patients must not have documented history of clinically significant cardiovascular
        disease including myocardial infarction (within 12 months prior to randomization), unstable
        angina, grade II or greater peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled congestive heart
        failure or uncontrolled hypertension (SBP&gt;170, DBP&gt;95).

        13. Patients with non informative xenograft data including patients whose tumors do not
        take in the mice, who progress before mice data is available or whose tumors do not respond
        to any of the selected agents.

Tumors will be implanted in nude mice and treated with a set of 8 commercially available anticancer drugs. Drugs will be ranked based in their activity from most to least active. Patients will then proceed to receive adjuvant treatment based on physician discretion and will be followed until disease progression.

PART B: At the time of progression, patients will be evaluated for Part B of the study and treated with the drug selected in Part A as the most active using approved doses and schedules of administration.</description>
