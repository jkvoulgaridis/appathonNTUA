  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is the leading cause of longterm renal transplant loss.
      Angiotensin-II may play a role in the development and progression of CAN. Angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) comprise a drug class that inhibit the effects of
      angiotensin-II. However these drugs have been reported to cause elevated potassium and
      creatinine levels in some renal transplant patients. Yet, there are now several retrospective
      reports of long term benefits of improved renal function and graft survival in renal
      transplant recipients. There have been no reports of prospective randomized controlled trials
      of ACEI in renal transplant patients in the early post transplant period.

      The purpose of the present study is to assess the safety of enalapril, a drug in the ACEI
      class, when started 1-3 month post transplant. This is a double-blinded, randomized control
      trial of enalapril vs. placebo in new renal transplant patients with serum creatinine values
      no higher than 2.5mg/dl and normal serum potassium levels. The study drug will be
      administered for 6 months. Patients will be monitored in the renal transplant clinic every
      1-4 weeks according to routine protocol. Clinical end-points will be occurence of potassium
      &gt;5.9mEQ/L or sustained increase in serum creatinine &gt;30% from baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All new renal transplant recipients with functioning allografts and serum creatinine less
      than 2.6 mg/dl within the first 3 month post transplant would be eligible for this study of
      the safety of enalapril 5 mg vs placebo. Patients with serum potassium persistently over 5.5
      mEQ/L would be excluded. This is a double-blinded randomized control study. End-points of the
      study are a persistent rise in serum creatinine of &gt;30% from baseline not otherwise explained
      by clinical evaluation, and persistent serum potassium &gt;5.9mEQ/L. Study duration is 6 month.
      At the end of the study patients will be continued on ACEI if clinically stable

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Creatinine is a waste product that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles of the body. It is excreted through the kidneys. High serum creatinine levels in the blood indicate that the kidneys aren't functioning properly. Increase in serum creatinine of 30% would be a safety concern and requires clinical management.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in potassium levels assessed at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Potassium is a chemical that is critical to the function of nerve and muscle cells, including those in your heart. Potassium levels must be kept within a very narrow concentration range. High Potassium levels are a sign of worsening kidney function. An occurence of serum potassium greater than 5.9 mEq/L is a safety concern and requires clinical management.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) assessed at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>eGFR is a number based on your blood test for creatinine, a waste product in your blood.It tells how well your kidneys are working. A normal eGFR is 60 or more. A 25 percent decrease in eGFR indicates that the kidneys may not be working well. This is a safety concern and requires clinical management.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Erythrocytosis is a condition in which your body makes too many red blood cells (RBCs). Too many red blood cells can make your blood thicker than normal and lead to blood clots and other complications.</description>
