    <measure>For FS MDPI Versus Fp MDPI: Change From Baseline in 1-Hour Postdose Percent Predicted Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was the volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration as measured by spirometer. The baseline 1-hour trough morning percent predicted FEV1 was defined as the predose trough morning percent predicted FEV1 measurement at the randomization visit (Baseline [Day 1]) at the investigational center. The IMP dose was administered right after the predose FEV1 measurement (within a 10 minute window). Participant then performed 1-hour (±10 minutes) postdose lung function assessments on Week 12 at the investigational center.</description>

    <measure>For Fp MDPI Versus Placebo: Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of the Percent Predicted Trough Morning FEV1 at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was the volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration as measured by spirometer. Baseline trough morning percent predicted FEV1 was defined as the average value of recorded (nonmissing) morning assessments 5 out of the last 7 days prior to randomization. The first day before randomization consisted of the electronic patient diary entry at home on the morning of the randomization visit (Baseline [Day 1]) and the first day postrandomization consisted of the electronic patient diary entry at home on the morning of the day after the randomization visit (Baseline [Day 1]). For postdose weekly average of trough morning percent predicted FEV1 measurements, the values were the averages based on the available data for that week. The averages were calculated as the sum of morning FEV1 values divided by the number of nonmissing assessments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Average of Daily Trough Morning (Predose and Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over the 12 Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. Morning PEF was determined in the morning, before administration of IMP or rescue medications. Baseline trough morning PEF was defined as the average value of recorded (nonmissing) morning assessments 5 out of the last 7 days prior to randomization. The first day before randomization consisted of the electronic patient diary entry at home on the morning of the randomization visit (Baseline [Day 1]) and the first day postrandomization consisted of the electronic patient diary entry at home on the morning of the day after the randomization visit (Baseline [Day 1]). For postdose weekly average of trough morning PEF measurements, the values were the averages based on the available data for that week. The averages were calculated as the sum of morning PEF values divided by the number of nonmissing assessments.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Average of Total Daily (24 Hour) Use of Albuterol/Salbutamol Inhalation Aerosol (Number of Inhalations) Over Weeks 1 Through 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the number of inhalations of rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI) each morning and evening in the electronic patient diary. An entry of 0 inhalations indicated no rescue medication was needed. To calculate the total daily use of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (number of inhalations), the electronic patient diary entry on randomization visit (Baseline [Day 1]) was defined as the first day of analysis. The weekly average of the total daily inhalations was the average based on the available data for that week. The average was calculated as the sum of total daily inhalations over the 7 days for each analysis week divided by the number of nonmissing assessments. LS mean and standard error (SE) were obtained using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Average of the Total Daily Asthma Symptom Score Over Weeks 1 Through 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptom scores were recorded in the patient diary. Each participant assessed the symptoms of cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness and entered a single score that was inclusive of all symptoms. Daytime Symptom Score (determined in the evening) ranged from 0=No symptoms during the day to 5=Symptoms so severe that I could not go to work or perform normal daily activities. Nighttime Symptom Score (determined in the morning) ranged from 0=No symptoms during the night to 4=Symptoms so severe that I did not sleep at all. The total daily asthma symptom score was the average of the daytime and nighttime scores. The total daily asthma symptom score ranged from 0 - 9 with 0=no symptoms during the day or night and 9=severe symptoms both day and night. The weekly average was calculated as the sum of total daily asthma symptom scores over the 7 days for each analysis week divided by the number of nonmissing assessments. LS mean and SE were obtained using MMRM.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control (Measured by Childhood Asthma Control Test [C-ACT] Score) Over the 12 Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>C-ACT was a simple, participant-completed tool used for the assessment of overall asthma control. The first 4 items of the test were completed by the participant, while the last 3 items were completed by the participant's parents/legal guardians/caregivers. A total sum score based upon responses to all items was calculated to provide an overall measure of asthma control. The derived C-ACT score ranging from 0 to 27. These scores spanned the continuum of poor control of asthma (score ≤5) to complete control of asthma (score ≥25), with a cut off score of 19 indicating participants with poorly controlled asthma. LS mean and SE were obtained using MMRM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Onset of Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The time to first onset of effect, defined as the first decrease from baseline in daily rescue medication use, was calculated based on the number of inhalations of rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane metered-dose inhaler [HFA MDI] [90 mcg ex actuator] or equivalent) recorded by the participant each morning and evening in the patient diary built into the handheld device.</description>

        <title>For FS MDPI Versus Fp MDPI: Change From Baseline in 1-Hour Postdose Percent Predicted Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 12</title>
        <description>FEV1 was the volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration as measured by spirometer. The baseline 1-hour trough morning percent predicted FEV1 was defined as the predose trough morning percent predicted FEV1 measurement at the randomization visit (Baseline [Day 1]) at the investigational center. The IMP dose was administered right after the predose FEV1 measurement (within a 10 minute window). Participant then performed 1-hour (±10 minutes) postdose lung function assessments on Week 12 at the investigational center.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants. Here, 'Overall number of participants analyzed' signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure. Missing data was imputed using MNAR methodology for prematurely discontinue participants or MAR for completers with implausible data.</population>

          <description>FEV1 was the volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration as measured by spirometer. The baseline 1-hour trough morning percent predicted FEV1 was defined as the predose trough morning percent predicted FEV1 measurement at the randomization visit (Baseline [Day 1]) at the investigational center. The IMP dose was administered right after the predose FEV1 measurement (within a 10 minute window). Participant then performed 1-hour (±10 minutes) postdose lung function assessments on Week 12 at the investigational center.</description>

        <title>For Fp MDPI Versus Placebo: Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of the Percent Predicted Trough Morning FEV1 at Week 12</title>
        <description>FEV1 was the volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration as measured by spirometer. Baseline trough morning percent predicted FEV1 was defined as the average value of recorded (nonmissing) morning assessments 5 out of the last 7 days prior to randomization. The first day before randomization consisted of the electronic patient diary entry at home on the morning of the randomization visit (Baseline [Day 1]) and the first day postrandomization consisted of the electronic patient diary entry at home on the morning of the day after the randomization visit (Baseline [Day 1]). For postdose weekly average of trough morning percent predicted FEV1 measurements, the values were the averages based on the available data for that week. The averages were calculated as the sum of morning FEV1 values divided by the number of nonmissing assessments.</description>

        <description>Asthma symptom scores were recorded in the patient diary. Each participant assessed the symptoms of cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness and entered a single score that was inclusive of all symptoms. Daytime Symptom Score (determined in the evening) ranged from 0=No symptoms during the day to 5=Symptoms so severe that I could not go to work or perform normal daily activities. Nighttime Symptom Score (determined in the morning) ranged from 0=No symptoms during the night to 4=Symptoms so severe that I did not sleep at all. The total daily asthma symptom score was the average of the daytime and nighttime scores. The total daily asthma symptom score ranged from 0 - 9 with 0=no symptoms during the day or night and 9=severe symptoms both day and night. The weekly average was calculated as the sum of total daily asthma symptom scores over the 7 days for each analysis week divided by the number of nonmissing assessments. LS mean and SE were obtained using MMRM.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control (Measured by Childhood Asthma Control Test [C-ACT] Score) Over the 12 Week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>C-ACT was a simple, participant-completed tool used for the assessment of overall asthma control. The first 4 items of the test were completed by the participant, while the last 3 items were completed by the participant's parents/legal guardians/caregivers. A total sum score based upon responses to all items was calculated to provide an overall measure of asthma control. The derived C-ACT score ranging from 0 to 27. These scores spanned the continuum of poor control of asthma (score ≤5) to complete control of asthma (score ≥25), with a cut off score of 19 indicating participants with poorly controlled asthma. LS mean and SE were obtained using MMRM.</description>
