  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the ability of optical head‐mounted display technology
      to enlarge the visual field of patients with severe visual field loss due to retinal
      dystrophy and to improve mobility and patient‐reported outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide it is estimated that 191 million people have moderate to severe visual impairment
      (MSVI) and an additional 32.4 million are blind. Patients with uncorrectable MSVI may undergo
      low vision rehabilitation (LVR), which has been shown to improve functional abilities, such
      as mobility. However, existing LVR strategies do not adequately address severe visual field
      constriction.

      In this pilot study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that optical head-mounted
      display (HMD) technology expands constricted visual fields and improves mobility outcomes for
      patients with retinal dystrophy. We will use the Moverio HMD platform which is considered a
      non-significant risk device. Outcomes for patients with retinal dystrophy will be compared to
      normal age-matched controls.
