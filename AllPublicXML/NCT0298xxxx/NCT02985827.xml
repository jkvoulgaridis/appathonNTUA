      The purpose of the study is to analyze the sensation to eye drops containing menthol in
      people with healthy eyes and in people with dry eyes. This study also examines the
      temperature of your eye using an Infrared Camera.

      Dry eye disease (DED) has been defined as a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular
      surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability
      with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the
      tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface1. An estimated 25 million Americans are
      reported to have dry eye disease (DED)2, which is a number that will only increase with the
      U.S. aging population3. The only treatment currently available in the U.S. targets
      inflammation on the ocular surface. Because dry eye is a complicated disease that encompasses
      many conditions of the eye, diversified ways to treating the disease are necessary. Some
      recent studies suggests that some Dry Eye symptoms are caused by corneal cold thermoreceptors
      (such as TRPM8) chronically firing at below-normal thresholds. It thus logically follows that
      dry eye patients could be distinguished from normal patients by possessing higher symptom
      responses secondary to topical application of menthol, a potent agonist of TRPM8. If dry eye
      patients indeed have lower threshold firing of TRPM8, agonizing TRPM8 with menthol will
      elicit a more severe symptom response, given equal concentrations across populations.

      To fully elucidate this relationship between TRPM8 agonists, sensation, and tear film
      cooling, two dry eye populations will be tested - one population which has exhibited symptom
      response to a previous dry eye agent, and one population with no symptom response to the same
      agent.

        <title>Sum of the Cooling Scale For Rohto (r) Hydra</title>
        <description>Participants completed the cooling scale after receiving 1 dose of Rohto (r) Hydra at 6 time points (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 minutes post-treatment), and the scores were summed across these time points. The cooling scale was on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0=not cool and 10=very cool. The summed total was on a scale of 0= not cool and 60=very cool.</description>
