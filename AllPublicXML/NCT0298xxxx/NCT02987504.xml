  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study of intravenous (IV)
      samalizumab to determine its maximum tolerated dose (MTD), overall safety/tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, and efficacy in participants with advanced
      cancer. The study was terminated for administrative reasons and not due to any safety
      concerns.

    <description>Participants received escalating doses of 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg of samalizumab IV every 21 days. Enrollment at each dose level and safety assessments were completed prior to enrolling at the next dose level; intra-participant dose escalation was not allowed.
3 participants were enrolled into a dose cohort: If 0/3 participants developed dose limiting toxicities (DLT) within Cycle 1, enrollment began at the next higher dose to a maximum of 20 mg/kg. If 1/3 participants developed a DLT, the dose cohort was expanded to include 3 new participants. If 0/3 new participants developed a DLT within Cycle 1, enrolment began at the next higher dose level. If ≥1 of 3 new participants developed a DLT within Cycle 1, dose-escalation was terminated, and the dose level 5 mg/kg below the current dose was considered the MTD. If ≥2 of 3 participants developed DLTs within Cycle 1, dose-escalation was terminated, and the dose level 5 mg/kg below the current dose was considered the MTD.</description>

               -  Liver function: total bilirubin ≥1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) based on
                  the standard value of each institution, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
                  aminotransferase ≥2.5 x ULN based on the reference laboratory.

               -  Renal function: serum creatinine ≥1.5 x ULN based on the reference laboratory.

         10. Participant had ongoing immune-stimulated adverse events from other immunotherapies
             (for example, pneumonitis, thyroiditis, or hepatitis) or a history of pneumonitis.

         11. Participant had received chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy within
             the 28 days prior to first dose of study drug, or within a Washout Period for the
             chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy of 5 half-lives, whichever
             occurred first.

         12. Participant had toxicities from previous immunotherapy that had not resolved to Grade
             1.
