  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, randomized, blinded and placebo-controlled study to test the safety and
      efficacy of LMCSs for improving vaccine immune response.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot phase will consist of a 3 subject safety run-in, followed by 20 subject randomized
      phase to evaluate influenza vaccine response at 1 week and 4 weeks post infusion of LMSCs.
      This will be followed by a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled phase.
