  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-centre, open-label, placebo-device, cross-over study, with a 2x2
      complete block design in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to assess
      the benefits of delivering triple therapy using a single ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI)
      (closed triple therapy) versus delivering triple therapy using two different types of DPI
      (open triple therapy). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the proportion of
      COPD subjects who make critical errors when using a single ELLIPTA DPI versus those using
      combinations of DISKUS® with HANDIHALER®, or TURBUHALER® with HANDIHALER. At Visit 1, all
      subjects will demonstrate the use of ELLIPTA DPI, and HANDIHALER DPI in combination with
      either DISKUS DPI (in sub-study 1) or TURBUHALER DPI (in sub-study 2), based on the treatment
      sequences. At the end Visit 1, subjects will complete the inhaler preference questionnaire
      (PQ). There is no active treatment and subjects will continue to take their own prescribed
      COPD medication for the duration of the study. ELLIPTA and DISKUS are registered trademarks
      of the GSK group of companies; TURBUHALER is a registered trademark of AstraZeneca and

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Making at Least One Critical Error After Reading the Patient Information Leaflets (PIL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were provided with the relevant section of the PIL, explaining correct use, for each DPI they were to be tested on. A critical error was defined as an error that was most likely to result in no, or a significantly reduced amount, of medication being inhaled by the participant. After reading the PIL for each DPI to be tested, participants demonstrated the DPI and critical errors made by the participants while using each DPI were recorded by the Healthcare Professional (HCP) on the checklists provided. Percentage of participants making at least one critical error after reading PIL were reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were provided with the relevant section of the PIL, explaining correct use, for each DPI they were to be tested on. A critical error was defined as an error that was most likely to result in no, or a significantly reduced amount, of medication being inhaled by the participant. After reading PIL for each DPI to be tested, participants demonstrated the DPI and errors made by the participants while using each DPI were recorded by the HCP on the checklists provided. If a participant made errors while demonstrating DPI, HCP provided instruction on the correct use of the DPI. The participant then repeated the demonstration of DPI use, and the HCP recorded the critical errors made on the checklists. Percentage of participants making at least one critical error after the first instruction from the HCP were reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Making at Least One Critical Error After the Second Instruction From the HCP</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were provided with the relevant section of the PIL, explaining correct use, for each DPI they were to be tested on. A critical error was defined as an error that was most likely to result in no, or a significantly reduced amount, of medication being inhaled by the participant. After reading the PIL for each DPI to be tested, participants demonstrated the DPI and errors made by the participants while using each DPI were recorded by the HCP on the checklists provided. If a participant made an error while demonstrating DPI use after first instruction from the HCP, then the HCP provided instructions again on the correct use of the inhaler. The participant then demonstrated the DPI for one last time, and the HCP recorded the critical errors made on the checklists. Participants making at least one critical error after the second instruction from the HCP were reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Making at Least One Overall Error After Reading the PIL</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were provided with the relevant section of the PIL, explaining correct use, for each DPI they were to be tested on. Overall error was defined as an error including critical and non-critical errors made by the participants while demonstrating DPI use after reading the PIL. For each DPI to be tested, overall errors including critical and non-critical errors made by the participants while demonstrating DPI use after reading the PIL were recorded by the HCP on the checklists provided. Percentage of participants making at least one overall error after reading the PIL were reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Instructions (0, 1 or 2 Times) From the HCP Which Are Needed to Demonstrate Correct Inhaler Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>In each sub-study, if the participant made error while demonstrating the use of the DPI after reading the PIL, the HCP demonstrated the correct usage instructions to the participant. The participant was then asked to demonstrate the DPI again. Any errors made were recorded by the HCP, and the same process was repeated one more time. In total, the HCP instructed the participants on the use of the DPI up to two times after which there were no assessment scheduled. Number of participants with instructions (0, 1 or 2) needed to demonstrate correct DPI use by the participants were reported.</description>

    <measure>The Median Time to Demonstrate Correct Inhaler Use (T1+T2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>For each DPI being tested, the total time taken from when participant started reading the PIL until when correct use was demonstrated (that is the time required to read PIL, and two attempts for correct use of DPI following instructions provided by the HCP ) was recorded. A participant who did not demonstrate correct use at the end of the time period was censored. The median time to demonstrate correct DPI use (minutes) is taken from the Kaplan-Meier analysis. If more than 50% of the data is censored therefore the median is not applicable.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>For each DPI being tested, the time taken from when participant started reading the PIL until when correct use was demonstrated with no need of instructions by HCP was reported. A participant who did not demonstrate correct use at the end of the time period was censored. The median time to demonstrate correct DPI use (minutes) is taken from the Kaplan-Meier analysis. If more than 50% of the data is censored therefore the median is not applicable.</description>

    <measure>Time Taken to be Given Instruction by the HCP (up to 2 Times) on Use of the Inhaler and to Demonstrate Correct Inhaler Use (T2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The time in minutes from when the HCP started to instruct participant for the correct use of DPI until correct use was demonstrated including maximum of two attempts only, was recorded. A participant who did not demonstrate correct use at the end of the time period was censored. Participants who demonstrated correct use after reading the PIL (T1) were included with a time of 0 for T2. The median time to demonstrate correct DPI use (minutes) is taken from the Kaplan-Meier analysis. If more than 50% of the data is censored then the median is not applicable. Participants who demonstrated correct use after reading the PIL are included with T2=0.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Preference Based on Responses to the Preference Questionnaire, Which Considered the Number of Steps Required to Take the COPD Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants demonstrated the use of ELLIPTA, and depending on the substudy DISKUS plus HandiHaler or Turbuhaler plus Handihaler. At the end of Visit 1, participants completed specific versions of the inhaler PQ (PQ1, PQ2, PQ3 or PQ4) according to the questionnaire they were randomized to. Participants assessed the inhaler preference based on the number of steps needed to take the COPD medication. Participants checked the response from the choice of ELLIPTA, DISKUS + HandiHaler (sub-study 1), Turbuhaler + Handihaler (sub-study 2) and No Preference. Number of participants with treatment preference based on responses to the preference questionnaire were reported.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This is a randomized, multi-center, open-label, cross-over study comparing Placebo ELLIPTA Dry Power Inhaler (DPI) with either Placebo DISKUS DPI + Placebo Handihaler or Placebo Turbuhaler plus Placebo Handihaler to assess correct inhaler use. A total of 5 centers, 3 in the Netherlands and 2 in the United Kingdom participated in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 160 participants were screened. Eighty were assigned to sub-study 1 and 80 to sub-study 2 according to naivety to inhalers in each sub-study. One participant in sub-study 2 withdrew consent prior to device assessment. Therefore 80 par in sub-study 1 and 79 par in sub-study 2 are included in the intent to treat population.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Making at Least One Critical Error After Reading the Patient Information Leaflets (PIL)</title>
        <description>Participants were provided with the relevant section of the PIL, explaining correct use, for each DPI they were to be tested on. A critical error was defined as an error that was most likely to result in no, or a significantly reduced amount, of medication being inhaled by the participant. After reading the PIL for each DPI to be tested, participants demonstrated the DPI and critical errors made by the participants while using each DPI were recorded by the Healthcare Professional (HCP) on the checklists provided. Percentage of participants making at least one critical error after reading PIL were reported.</description>

        <description>In each sub-study, if the participant made error while demonstrating the use of the DPI after reading the PIL, the HCP demonstrated the correct usage instructions to the participant. The participant was then asked to demonstrate the DPI again. Any errors made were recorded by the HCP, and the same process was repeated one more time. In total, the HCP instructed the participants on the use of the DPI up to two times after which there were no assessment scheduled. Number of participants with instructions (0, 1 or 2) needed to demonstrate correct DPI use by the participants were reported.</description>

          <description>In each sub-study, if the participant made error while demonstrating the use of the DPI after reading the PIL, the HCP demonstrated the correct usage instructions to the participant. The participant was then asked to demonstrate the DPI again. Any errors made were recorded by the HCP, and the same process was repeated one more time. In total, the HCP instructed the participants on the use of the DPI up to two times after which there were no assessment scheduled. Number of participants with instructions (0, 1 or 2) needed to demonstrate correct DPI use by the participants were reported.</description>

        <description>Participants demonstrated the use of ELLIPTA, and depending on the substudy DISKUS plus HandiHaler or Turbuhaler plus Handihaler. At the end of Visit 1, participants completed specific versions of the inhaler PQ (PQ1, PQ2, PQ3 or PQ4) according to the questionnaire they were randomized to. Participants assessed the inhaler preference based on the number of steps needed to take the COPD medication. Participants checked the response from the choice of ELLIPTA, DISKUS + HandiHaler (sub-study 1), Turbuhaler + Handihaler (sub-study 2) and No Preference. Number of participants with treatment preference based on responses to the preference questionnaire were reported.</description>
