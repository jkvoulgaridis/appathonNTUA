  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of professional and peer care managers in improving
      linkage to and engagement in outpatient care after an emergency department (ED) discharge, as
      well as the mechanisms by which engagement occurs. The study will use a multi-site randomized
      trial study design across 8 EDs in South Carolina with telepsychiatry programs; each site
      will have one professional care manager (social worker or nurse) and one peer specialist care
      manager. Eligible subjects at each site will be randomized to a one-year treatment engagement
      intervention, the Coordination, Access, Referral and Evaluation (CARE) Program with either a
      peer or professional care manager, resulting in a total of 290 participants across sites. The
      CARE program will focus on shared decision-making between care managers and patients, and
      combines the traditional medical model of care management with a recovery-based approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Existing literature indicates that there is potential effectiveness of care management
      delivered by mental health professionals in improving treatment engagement and reducing
      inpatient readmissions and that certified peer specialists may be able to deliver an array of
      mental health services of similar or better quality as mental health professionals. However,
      there have been no studies comparing certified peer specialists to professionals in
      interventions to increase treatment engagement and reduce readmissions. This study will be
      the first to examine the potential benefits and tradeoffs between these two groups of
      providers.

      There is an urgent need to improve care transitions for patients with mental disorders seen
      in emergency departments (ED). Care management can improve treatment engagement after ED
      discharge for patients with mental disorders, and certified peer specialists hold promise in
      providing these services. However, there are no data comparing care management delivered by
      peers and professionals in these settings. With funding from a Patient-Centered Outcomes
      Research Institute (PCORI) grant the study team will be able to implement a manualized care
      management program to improve follow-up and treatment engagement for patients in South
      Carolina, supported by preliminary data and experience from work previously conducted by the
      study team.

      The overall goal of the project is to compare the effectiveness of professional and peer care
      managers in improving linkage to and engagement in outpatient care after an ED discharge, as
      well as the mechanisms by which engagement occurs. The study will use a multi-site randomized
      trial study design across 8 EDs in South Carolina with telepsychiatry programs; each site
      will have one professional care manager (social worker or nurse) and one peer specialist care
      manager. Eligible subjects at each site will be randomized to a one-year treatment engagement
      intervention, namely the Coordination, Access, Referral and Evaluation (CARE) Program with
      either a peer or professional care manager, resulting in a total of 290 participants. The
      CARE program will focus on shared decision-making between care managers and patients, and
      combines the traditional medical model of care management with a recovery-based approach.

    <description>This outcome was operationally measured as at least one outpatient visit for a mental health problem in the 30 days after discharge from the emergency department. Data were obtained from the South Carolina Office of Revenue and Fiscal Affairs (RFA). The RFA data warehouse pulls client-specific data from an array of health and human services facilities, agencies and organizations and makes possible the integration of data from disparate sources at the client level by means of an internally assigned unique tracking number.</description>

    <description>Each participating site will have a nurse or social worker to provide care management. Training activities will include modules for each of the key domains covered in the intervention: shared decision making, action planning; motivational interviewing; and mental health as a cornerstone of recovery, working effectively within the mental health system; and self-care and stress management.</description>

    <description>Each participating site will have a peer specialist to provide care management. Peer specialists will have a minimum of a high school education, a history of a mental illness, be self-described as 'in recovery,' and have reliable transportation to the study site. All certified peer specialists will receive training in a curriculum that supports identifying and pursuing goals for recovery; developing and documenting recovery-focused treatment plans; and supporting linkages with community-based services. Peers learn to help other individuals with mental health conditions to facilitate mental health dialogues; explore mental health choices and options; identify and work with a clinician; and obtain access to community health supports.</description>
