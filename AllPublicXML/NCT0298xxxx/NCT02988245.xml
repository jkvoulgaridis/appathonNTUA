  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is one of the most important preventable contributors to disease and death in
      the United States and represents the most common condition seen in the primary care setting.
      Approximately 78 million adults living in the U.S. have hypertension with more than 5 million
      new diagnoses made each year. Unfortunately, despite a significant impulse in the medical
      community to move towards an &quot;individualized medicine&quot; approach to patient centered
      treatment, the current clinical treatment strategy is based on a set algorithm which does not
      take into account individual patient differences. As a result hypertension is often
      sub-optimally treated based on &quot;population averages&quot;, rather than a person's genetic make-up,
      with significant burden on our health care system. In fact, 40% of patients who are adherent
      to their blood pressure therapy (taking their medicines as prescribed by their clinician) do
      not have their blood pressure under control. Previous work has demonstrated significant
      functional polymorphisms within the kidney, vessels, and heart that will likely predict a
      patient's response to blood pressure pharmacotherapy. Previous work by our group, utilizing a
      retrospective design, has determined that the addition of genetic knowledge to prescribing
      can improve therapeutic guidance and decrease the time to blood pressure control
      significantly. Despite this, to date, there are no prospective trials to guide blood pressure
      therapy using multiple organ systems that are important in the three most common classes of
      drugs: diuretics, vasodilators, and beta-blockers. The objective of this clinical trial is to
      determine the efficacy of genetically guided therapeutic options for pharmacologic treatment
      of essential hypertension in newly diagnosed patients.

      Specific Aim:

      To determine the efficacy of genetically guided therapeutic options for pharmacologic
      treatment of essential hypertension, when compared to conventional standard of care (JNC 8
      guideline directed therapy).

      Hypothesis A: Patients randomized to genetically guided blood pressure therapy will have
      significantly reduced time to optimal blood pressure control compared to conventional
      standard of care.

      Hypotheses B: Patients randomized to genetically guided blood pressure therapy will have
      significantly greater absolute blood pressure reduction compared to conventional standard of
      care.

      Hypothesis C: Patients randomized to genetically guided blood pressure therapy will have to
      take fewer classes of blood pressure medicines in order to achieve blood pressure control.

      Secondary Aim:

      To determine if genetically guided blood pressure therapy reduces number of medication
      changes in patients with hypertension.

      Hypotheses: Patients randomized to genetically guided blood pressure therapy will have
      significantly less medication changes.
