  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence (FI), defined as the involuntary passage of stool for more than 3 months
      and is a devastating disease. The negative impact on quality of life has been consistently
      demonstrated. The prevalence of FI is probably underestimated in most studies. Currently
      conservative treatment is only modestly effective and surgical treatment is complex and
      expensive with less than optimal efficacy.

      The investigators developed an &quot;anal tape&quot; using a commercially available elastic band with a
      special adhesive that is approved for use in the skin. A special design of the tape can be
      applied to the skin surrounding the anus providing support and additional pressure forces to
      the anal sphincter.

      This is a 4 week, prospective, non blinded, cross-over study to explore the efficacy and
      safety of this device in patients with FI. The primary endpoint will be improvement in
      quality of life.

    <measure>Any Improvment in the Fecal Incontince Quality of Life Scale (FIQoLs)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQoL is a validated, condition-specific tool that evaluates quality of life (QoL) in patients with fecal incontinence (FI) it consisting of 29 questions, subdivided into four domains: Lifestyle, Coping/Behavior, Depression/Self‐perception, and Embarrassment. Item 1, general health, is graded from 1 &quot;excellent&quot; to 5 &quot;poor&quot; and is reversely scored. Items 2 to 28 are graded on a 4‐point Likert‐scale (1 = lower QoL). Item 29, FI specific depression, is graded from 1 &quot;extremely so&quot; to 6 &quot;not at all.&quot; The average score for each domain is calculated separately and is calculated only if half or more of the items in the particular domain have been answered. Scales range from 1 to 5, with a 1 indicating a lower quality of life. Each domain or subscale is reported separately (Range 1 to 5), a total score including all four domains is not calculated.</description>

    <measure>Mean Wexner Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Wexner Scale is a measure of frequency and severity of anal incontinence. It comprises five items, three regarding frequency of involuntary passage of gas, liquid, or solid stool, frequency of pad wearing, and frequency of lifestyle alteration, scored in a 5-point Likert-scale (never=0, rarely=1, sometimes=2, usually=3, always=4). A sum of all scores from 0 to 20 is calculated with higher scores meaning more severe incontince.</description>

    <measure>General Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>General satisfaction with the device was assessed using a standard 100 mm visual analog scale. Patients were asked to grade their satisfaction with the device between 0 and 100 by drawing a perpendicular line in the 100 mm visual analog scale. Then the distance in mm was measured in mm from 0 to the perpendicular line and the score was calculated. Higher scores meaning better satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Willingness of the Patient to Continue Using the Anal Tape After the Study.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Willingness of the patient to continue using the device was assessed using a standard 100 mm visual analog scale. Patients were asked to grade their willingness to use the device in the future between 0 and 100 by drawing a perpendicular line in the 100 mm visual analog scale. Then the distance in mm was measured in mm from 0 to the perpendicular line and the score was calculated. Higher scores meaning better satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Mean Wexner Score</title>
        <description>The Wexner Scale is a measure of frequency and severity of anal incontinence. It comprises five items, three regarding frequency of involuntary passage of gas, liquid, or solid stool, frequency of pad wearing, and frequency of lifestyle alteration, scored in a 5-point Likert-scale (never=0, rarely=1, sometimes=2, usually=3, always=4). A sum of all scores from 0 to 20 is calculated with higher scores meaning more severe incontince.</description>
