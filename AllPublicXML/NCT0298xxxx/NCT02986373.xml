      Participants who had completed all doses of study drug and the Week 24 visit of M16-002
      (NCT02719171; the lead-in study) were eligible to enroll in M16-244 (this study).
      Participants were allowed to either finish the Week 24 visit of the lead-in study and take
      the first dose of study drug for this study on the same day, or delay the start of this study
      up to 8 weeks if needed.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs) are defined as an AE that began or worsened in severity after initiation of study drug and 20 weeks (140 days) after last dose.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Lead-in Study), Week 24 (Lead-in Study)</time_frame>
    <description>The mTSS is a measure of change in joint health. X-rays of hands, wrists, and feet (including distal interphalangeal joints) were obtained at Week 24 and Week 48. Totals for hands and feet for erosion scores (range 0 to 320) and joint space narrowing scores (range 0 to 208) were calculated and added to obtain the mTSS (range = 0 [normal] to 528 [maximal disease]). An increase in mTSS from Baseline represents disease progression and/or joint worsening; no progression was defined as a change of ≤0.5. Baseline is defined as baseline in the lead-in study.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Lead-in Study), Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis that consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 represents no disability and 3 very severe, high-dependency disability. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI score of &lt; 0.5. Negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Baseline is defined as baseline in the lead-in study.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 determined participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 5-8 comprise the mental component of the SF-36. Scores on each item were summed and averaged (range = 0-100); a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. Baseline is defined as baseline in the lead-in study.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs) are defined as an AE that began or worsened in severity after initiation of study drug and 20 weeks (140 days) after last dose.

        <description>The mTSS is a measure of change in joint health. X-rays of hands, wrists, and feet (including distal interphalangeal joints) were obtained at Week 24 and Week 48. Totals for hands and feet for erosion scores (range 0 to 320) and joint space narrowing scores (range 0 to 208) were calculated and added to obtain the mTSS (range = 0 [normal] to 528 [maximal disease]). An increase in mTSS from Baseline represents disease progression and/or joint worsening; no progression was defined as a change of ≤0.5. Baseline is defined as baseline in the lead-in study.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis that consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 represents no disability and 3 very severe, high-dependency disability. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI score of &lt; 0.5. Negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Baseline is defined as baseline in the lead-in study.</description>

        <title>HAQ-DI: Change From Baseline (in the Lead-in Study) to Week 12</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis that consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 represents no disability and 3 very severe, high-dependency disability. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI score of &lt; 0.5. Negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Baseline is defined as baseline in the lead-in study.</description>

        <title>SF-36 PCS Score: Change From Baseline (in the Lead-in Study) to Week 12</title>
        <description>The SF-36 Health determined participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 comprise the physical component of the SF-36. Scores on each item were summed and averaged (range = 0-100); a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. Baseline is defined as baseline in the lead-in study.</description>

        <title>SF-36 MCS Score: Change From Baseline (in the Lead-in Study) to Week 12</title>
        <description>The SF-36 determined participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 5-8 comprise the mental component of the SF-36. Scores on each item were summed and averaged (range = 0-100); a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. Baseline is defined as baseline in the lead-in study.</description>
