    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of infographics, compared to standard
      PLS format, in presenting information, in terms of understanding and remembering research
      results by consumers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two different formats
      of the same systematic review summary (Infographics, PLS). The content of these two formats
      is based on the same systematic review, but the ways of data presentation will differ: visual
      presentation in plain language and plain language only. The interventions will be delivered
      online in November 2016, with members of the consumers' groups for pregnancy and parenting -
      RODA (&quot;Roditelji u akciji&quot;, engl.&quot;Parents in action&quot;), which gathers different types of
      consumers: pregnant women, young mothers and parenting and pregnancy advisors; and the
      members of the Association for Patients' Rights. The trial will be voluntary and anonymous.
      The survey will consist of 5 parts, in the following order: 1) one format of the summary
      (randomly assigned), 2) health numeracy, 3) demographic data 4) comprehension test of the
      information given in the summary, and 5) user friendliness of information and overall
      satisfaction with the given summary assessed by survey.

    <time_frame>One month (30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The questions will focus on understanding the benefits and risks of the intervention and the quality of evidence described in the systematic review. There will be 10 open ended questions, which will be assessed by two assessors, and the total score will be the sum of correct answers (total score ranging from 0-10). Higher scores would represent greater understanding of the content.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reading Experience</measure>
    <time_frame>One month (30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>This section of the survey will include 5 questions about the experience of participants about the text they read, measured on a 10-point Likert type scale, where 1 means do not agree at all and 10 means fully agree. The total score is the sum of scores on all five answers (minimum 5, maximum 50). Greater scores indicate more positive reading experience.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>User Friendliness</measure>
    <time_frame>One month (30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>This section of the survey will have 5 questions concerning how easy it was for the participant to find relevant information, measured by a 10-point Likert type scale where the answer 1 means I do not agree at all and 10 means I fully agree. The total score is the sum of scores on all the answers (minimum 5, maximum 50). Higher scores indicate greater perception of the summary format as more user friendly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Health Numeracy</measure>
    <time_frame>One month (30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>This section will use 6-item General health numeracy test (Osborne et al., 2013) in order to determine how much our participants understand the basic health instructions regarding numeracy dimension. For each correct answer, the participants receive one point and the total score is the sum of all correct answers.</description>

          <title>Understanding of the Summary Content</title>
          <description>The questions will focus on understanding the benefits and risks of the intervention and the quality of evidence described in the systematic review. There will be 10 open ended questions, which will be assessed by two assessors, and the total score will be the sum of correct answers (total score ranging from 0-10). Higher scores would represent greater understanding of the content.</description>
