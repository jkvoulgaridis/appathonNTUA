  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compare chronic (one week) of a 'normal' meat diet with one week of mycoprotein consumption,
      with or without a reduced nucleotide content, on markers of metabolic health, such as uric
      acid concentrations, blood glucose control and blood lipid profiles.
