    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well danvatirsen and durvalumab work in treating patients
      with pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and mismatch repair deficient colorectal
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body and does not respond to treatment.
      Danvatirsen may be used to block the production of proteins needed for tumor cell growth.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving danvatirsen and durvalumab may work better at treating pancreatic cancer,
      non-small cell lung cancer and mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate disease control rate (DCR) at 4 months. II. Evaluate tumor-based biomarkers in
      paired pre and post treatment biopsies (10 in each arm, 30 total) that may correlate with
      treatment or prospectively identify patients likely to respond to treatment with danvatirsen
      (AZD9150) in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) (may include PD-L1 expression,
      phosphorylated or total STAT3 expression, tumor genetics, characterization of immune
      infiltrates, or other stratification markers).

      III. Explore the relationship between PD-L1 protein levels in the membrane of circulating
      tumor cells obtained by peripheral blood draws prior to, during, and after treatment with
      clinical endpoints including treatment efficacy and toxicity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the frequency of dose limiting toxicities. II. Evaluate frequency of objective
      response (as defined as partial response [PR] or complete response [CR] according to Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria).

      III. Evaluate duration of response (DOR) measured from the time measurement criteria are
      first met for CR or PR, whichever is first recorded, until the first date that recurrent or
      progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented.

      IV. Evaluate best overall response (including CR, PR, stable disease [SD], and PD, according
      to RECIST version 1.1 criteria).

      V. Evaluate progression free survival (PFS) from allocation to the first documentation of PD
      as determined by the investigator or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the relationship between radiologic metrics (radiomics) prior to, during, and
      after treatment with clinical endpoints including treatment efficacy and toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive danvatirsen intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 7, 5 and 3 prior to cycle
      1, then on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Patients also receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 1-3 months, then
      every 2 months thereafter.

             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade &gt; 1. Exceptions are alopecia
             and/or anorexia. The eligibility of patients who are still experiencing irreversible
             toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by the study drugs in this

             ulcerative colitis)

          -  Has a history of primary immunodeficiency

          -  Has undergone an organ transplant that requires use of immunosuppressive treatment

          -  Has a history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis from any cause

          -  Has a history of allergic reactions attributed to the study treatments (AZD9150 or

             unsuitable for participation in the study. Such comorbidity may include, but is not
             limited to, uncontrolled intercurrent illness such as active infection, severe active
             peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, myocardial infarction within 6 months before entry,
             congestive heart failure, symptomatic congestive heart failure, active cardiomyopathy,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  As judged by the investigator, has any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             diseases such as active bleeding diatheses, is positive for human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV), or has active hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV)

          -  Has a known history of tuberculosis

          -  Has a condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the
             evaluation of the study drugs or the interpretation of patient safety or study results

          -  Has received a live attenuated vaccine within 28 days before the first dose of study
             drug

          -  Judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and
             requirements

          -  Patients with clinically active brain metastases (known or suspected) are excluded
             unless the brain metastases have been previously treated and are considered stable.
             Stable brain metastases are defined as no change on CT scan or magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) scan for a minimum of 2 months AND no change in steroid dose for a
             minimum of 4 weeks, unless change due to intercurrent infection or other acute event
