    <measure>Percentage of Participants by Improvement Rating (Improved and Not Improved) of Their Dynamic Radial Cheek Lines as Assessed by the Participant Using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 45</time_frame>
    <description>Participants graded the improvement of their dynamic radial cheek lines using the GAIS 5-point scale where -2=much worse to +2=much improved. Participants who rated their improvement as -2, -1, or 0 (much worse, worse, or no change, respectively) were grouped as Not Improved and those who rated their improvement as +1 or +2 (improved or much improved, respectively) were grouped as Improved. The percentages of participants who rated their cheek lines as Improved and Not Improved are reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Roughness (Ra) of the Radial Cheek Lines at Maximum Smile as Assessed by DERMATOP®</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 45</time_frame>
    <description>The DERMATOP® is a fringe projection system used to measure wrinkles. The system collects 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) images and then calculates the roughness, texture, and amplitude of wrinkles. To ensure that repeat measurements are made in the same area, the angles of the camera were recorded, and a red positioning laser was used to mark the edge of the chin. In addition, a 2D picture of the baseline measurements was taken by the machine to position subsequent measurements. Measurements are presented in micrometers (μm). A negative change from Baseline (pre-treatment) indicates that the roughness of wrinkles decreased.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants by Improvement Rating (Response) of the Participants' Dynamic Radial Cheek Lines as Assessed by the Investigator Using the GAIS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 45</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator graded the improvement of the participant's dynamic radial cheek lines on both sides of their face using the 5-point GAIS where -2=much worse to +2=much improved. Responders are participants with a score of +1 or +2 (improved or much improved, respectively) on both sides; partial responder are participants with a score of +1 or +2 on only one side; and no-responders are participants with a score lower or equal to 0 on both sides. The percentages of responders, partial responders, and no-responders are reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants by Self-Perceived Age Category as Assessed by the Self-Perception of Age (SPA) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 45</time_frame>
    <description>The SPA questionnaire consists of one question: &quot;How do you think your facial appearance looks compared to your age TODAY?&quot; Participants could choose one of three possible answers: &quot;I look my current age,&quot; &quot;I look younger,&quot; or &quot;I look older.&quot; The percentage of participants in the following SPA categories is reported: I look my current age, I look younger and I look older.</description>

    <measure>Mean Score for the Level of Naturalness of the Appearance of Participants' Dynamic Radial Cheek Lines as Assessed by a Participant Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 45</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to indicate their level agreement with the following statement: &quot;The treatment of my smile lines gave me a natural look.&quot; Responses were scored from 0 to 10, where 0=not at all to 10=very much.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Texture (Rz) of the Radial Cheek Lines at Maximum Smile as Assessed by DERMATOP®</title>
        <description>The DERMATOP® is a fringe projection system used to measure wrinkles. The system collects 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) images and then calculates the roughness, texture, and amplitude of wrinkles. To ensure that repeat measurements are made in the same area, the angles of the camera were recorded, and a red positioning laser was used to mark the edge of the chin. In addition, a 2D picture of the baseline measurements was taken by the machine to position subsequent measurements. Measurements are presented in micrometers. A negative change from Baseline (pre-treatment) indicates that the texture of wrinkles improved.</description>
