    <description>The composite complete remission (CRc) rate is defined as the proportion of participants whose best response is complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp], or CR with incomplete hematological recovery [CRi]) after treatment with quizartinib.</description>

    <description>Event-free survival is defined as the time from date of registration until documented refractory disease, relapse after response of composite complete remission (CRc = complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp], or CR with incomplete hematological recovery [CRi]), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <description>Leukemia-free survival (LFS) is the time from the first documented response of CRc until documented relapse or death from any cause. The analysis for LFS will be conditional on the participant having a documented best response of CRc.</description>
