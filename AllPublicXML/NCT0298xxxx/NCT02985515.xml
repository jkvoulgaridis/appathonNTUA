  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the efficacy of a 12-week smell training
      intervention for participants with olfactory dysfunction following an infection of the upper
      respiratory tract.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Olfactory dysfunction affects up to fifteen percent of the general population and can cause
      significant psychosocial distress including decreased appetite, reduced self-hygiene, and
      mood disturbances.

      This study aims to study the efficacy of smell training for patients with olfactory
      dysfunction following a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Eligible participants will
      complete a 30-day course of budesonide nasal saline irrigation. Participants who do not show
      improvement in their olfaction based on composite smell and taste tests will be eligible to
      receive a baseline resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and complete a 12-week smell training
      intervention program. Smell training involves participants smelling 4 odors (phenyl ethyl
      alcohol, eucalyptus, lemon, and eugenol) twice a day for 12 weeks. Following completion of
      smell training, participants will undergo repeat smell and taste tests as well as rs-fMRI to
      ascertain the efficacy of smell training.

    <description>Eligible participants will be provided with a &quot;NeilMed&quot; Sinus Rinse Regular Bottle Kit and a one-month supply of USP Grade Sodium Chloride &amp; Sodium Bicarbonate Mixture commercially prepared packets. Participants will need to purchase distilled water or boil tap water for five minutes for use with the saline irrigation. The contents of two capsules (0.5mg budesonide each) will be dissolved into &quot;NeilMed&quot; Sinus Rinse Regular Bottle along with the saline rinse. Both nasal cavities will be irrigated once daily for 30 days.
Participants who do not have objective improvement in their olfaction after the trial of budesonide irrigation will have a baseline resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and undergo 12 weeks of smell training. Smell training involves the participants smelling 4 vials of essential odors twice a day for 12 weeks. Following smell training, participants will have their smell ability re-evaluated and a second rs-fMRI performed.</description>
