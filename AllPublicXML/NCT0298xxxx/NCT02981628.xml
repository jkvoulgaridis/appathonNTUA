    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well inotuzumab ozogamicin works in treating younger patients
      with B-lymphoblastic lymphoma or CD22 positive B acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come
      back or does not respond to treatment. Immunotoxins, such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, are
      antibodies linked to a toxic substance and may help find cancer cells that express CD22 and
      kill them without harming normal cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the morphologic response rate (complete response [CR] + complete response
      with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) following one cycle of treatment with inotuzumab
      ozogamicin (InO) in children with relapsed or refractory CD22+ B acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (B-ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the CR/CRi rate following 2 cycles of InO therapy. II. To determine the
      safety of single agent InO administered at the adult recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) to
      pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD22+ B-ALL.

      III. To determine the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry in responding
      patients.

      IV. To determine the incidence, severity, and outcomes of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome
      (SOS) of the liver in patients during InO therapy and following subsequent treatment,
      including myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      V. To estimate the 3-year event-free survival (EFS), 3-year overall survival (OS), and among
      responders duration of CR/CRi for pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL
      treated with InO.

      VI. To describe InO pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity in pediatric patients in the presence
      of overt leukemia and in remission.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the levels of leukemic blast CD22 surface expression and site density, and to
      explore the correlation with cytogenetics and clinical outcomes after treatment with InO.

      II. To explore potential mechanisms of resistance to InO therapy including CD22 splice
      variants and intracellular signaling pathways.

      III. To explore the impact of InO on humoral immune function and peripheral B cell
      populations.

      IV. To describe the level of MRD by next-generation high-throughput sequencing (HTS)
      techniques which may detect low level leukemic blast populations that have altered CD22
      expression.

      V. To prospectively explore candidate SOS biomarkers including the endothelial marker of
      inflammation Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) and the hepatic specific complement marker L-ficolin.

      VI. To explore the use of prophylactic ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to prevent hepatic damage
      and SOS during InO therapy and subsequent HSCT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then yearly for 4 years.
