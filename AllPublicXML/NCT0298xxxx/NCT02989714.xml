  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single arm, multi-site phase Ib/II clinical trial of standard doses of High
      Dose Interleukin-2 (HD IL2) (600,000 IU/kg/dose intravenously during two 5-day cycles 9 days
      apart) in IL-2 eligible clear cell metastatic RCC (Renal Cell Carcinoma) subjects in
      combination with Nivolumab.

      Investigators hypothesize that concurrent PD-1 inhibition synergistically enhances the
      anti-tumor immune response to HD IL-2 in metastatic clear cell RCC. Investigators postulate
      that the combination of the two therapies would result in an increase in the overall response
      rate, complete response rate, and improved survival outcomes compared to either of the
      individual therapies.

             mixed) with radiologic or histologic or cytologic evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Subjects may have received up to 2 prior lines of systemic therapy (excluding any
             neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy) including anti-VEGF or VEGFR inhibitor (e.g. sorafenib,
             pazopanib, sunitinib, bevacizumab, axitinib) or mTOR inhibitor (e.g. everolimus or

             prostate cancer definitively treated without recurrence or with biochemical recurrence
             only, or any other cancer fully treated or from which the subject has been
             disease-free for at least 2 years.
