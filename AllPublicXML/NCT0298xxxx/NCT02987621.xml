  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project the investigators will be using non-invasive brain stimulation on people with
      multiple sclerosis (PwMS) to improve leg muscle function. Two groups of participants will be
      recruited. One group will perform strength testing with and without the brain stimulation.
      The second group of participants will perform a fatigue task, pulling against a wire at a low
      level of force, with and without the brain stimulation. This type of brain stimulation has
      been shown to transiently improve strength and fatigue measures in other populations, e.g.
      aged, Parkinson's, and improve cognitive abilities in people with multiple sclerosis. It is
      the investigator's hope that the increases in performance seen in other patient groups will
      also occur in people with multiple sclerosis. Future investigations will look to apply the
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique during physical rehabilitation to improve short and
      long term outcomes related to physical function.

    <measure>Leg Muscle Strength With and Without tDCS.</measure>
    <time_frame>At session 1 and minimum of 7 days later</time_frame>
    <description>Knee extensor strength will be tested with tDCS (less than 10V) and sham stimulation (0V). Participants performed maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) with the knee extensors to objectively determine the weaker leg as more-affected, which was afterwards confirmed by the subject's self-report and used for the subsequent endurance task. This task consisted of a sustained isometric contraction at 15% MVC until volitional task termination and was immediately followed by a post MVC.
During tDCS, stimulation intensity was ramped up to 2 mA, started 90 second sprior to the task, and extended until task failure or a maximum stimulation length of 20 minutes. For Sham, the current was ramped up to 2 mA, but turned off after 30 seconds.</description>

    <description>Knee extensor endurance (fatigue) will be tested with tDCS (less than 10V) and sham stimulation (0V), as reported as time to failure.

    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>At session 1 and minimum of 7 days later</time_frame>
    <description>After completion of the tDCS/Sham strength assessment participants will perform a 6 minute walk test. The test will be performed in a cordoned off hallway with 2 cones placed 30 meters apart. Once the participants begin walking, a timer will be started and the distance covered every min will be recorded. Participants are allowed to stop and rest during the test if required. Every minute during the walk test participants will be asked their rating of perceived exertion (RPE, 0-10 scale).</description>

        <title>Leg Muscle Endurance With and Without tDCS.</title>
        <description>Knee extensor endurance (fatigue) will be tested with tDCS (less than 10V) and sham stimulation (0V), as reported as time to failure.
During tDCS, stimulation intensity was ramped up to 2 mA, started 90 second sprior to the task, and extended until task failure or a maximum stimulation length of 20 minutes. For Sham, the current was ramped up to 2 mA, but turned off after 30 seconds.</description>

            <description>Participants will perform leg muscle strength testing with tDCS. On a separate day they will repeat the leg muscle strength testing with Sham stimulation.
Leg strength testing will be measured by performing a series of maximal effort knee extension, knee flexion, plantar/dorsi-flexion trials. Furthermore, participants perform a 6 minute walk.

        <title>6 Minute Walk Test</title>
        <description>After completion of the tDCS/Sham strength assessment participants will perform a 6 minute walk test. The test will be performed in a cordoned off hallway with 2 cones placed 30 meters apart. Once the participants begin walking, a timer will be started and the distance covered every min will be recorded. Participants are allowed to stop and rest during the test if required. Every minute during the walk test participants will be asked their rating of perceived exertion (RPE, 0-10 scale).</description>

            <description>Separated by a minimum of 7 days, participants will perform leg muscle strength and fatigue testing once with tDCS and once with Sham in a counterbalanced order.
Leg muscle strength testing will be measured by performing a series of maximal effort knee extension, knee flexion, plantar/dorsi-flexion trials. Note: the 6 minute walk test was not conducted.
The fatigue testing will be measured by time to fatigue with isometric contraction of the knee extensors.
