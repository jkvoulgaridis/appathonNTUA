  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to define the metabolic characteristics of individuals with
      Lean Diabetes. We aim to determine whether differences in body composition, including any
      differences in lipid (fat) deposition, exist compared to individuals with either known forms
      of diabetes (eg, type 1 and type 2), or individuals without diabetes. Diabetes affects the
      ability of the body to process glucose (sugar). Therefore, we also plan to investigate the
      ability of the hormone insulin to regulate changes in glucose in these individuals.
      Developing a greater understanding of the features of this condition could have tremendous
      therapeutic benefit for these individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      India has the world's highest prevalence of diabetes, expected to rise to 80 million by 2030.
      This includes many patients with Lean Diabetes, which is a form of diabetes identified
      clinically by early onset, high insulin requirements, absence of other pancreatic disease,
      and low body mass index (typically â‰¤17 kg/m2) at presentation. Despite its prevalence, Lean
      Diabetes remains a relatively unknown disease that stirs conflicting opinions regarding its
      classification, diagnostic criteria, and pathogenesis.

      In this study, the investigators will study individuals meeting the criteria for Lean
      Diabetes, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and patients without diabetes using a procedure
      called a &quot;pancreatic clamp&quot; study. During the clamp procedure, glucose (a sugar) and insulin
      (a hormone produced in the pancreas that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood) are
      infused with an intravenous catheter, and blood samples are collected periodically throughout
      the procedure to measure blood sugar levels and the levels of several hormones that are found
      in the body and are related to glucose metabolism. Endogenous glucose production (a measure
      of the body's production of sugar) will also be measured. Participants will also have a fat
      biopsy, and will be given a mixed meal challenge which is a test that detects hyperglycemia
      and glucose intolerance.

      The overall goal of this study is to define the metabolic characteristics of individuals with
      Lean Diabetes and to determine which differences exist compared to individuals with other
      known forms of diabetes or individuals without diabetes.
