      Primary Objective:

      To compare the efficacy of alirocumab (Praluent®) with standard of care (SoC) on coronary
      atheroma progression (percent change in normalized total atheroma volume [TAV]) after 9
      months of treatment in participants who had acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within 4 weeks
      prior to randomization, with hypercholesterolemia treated with statin.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the efficacy of alirocumab (Praluent®) with SoC on secondary endpoints
           including absolute change in percent atheroma volume and normalized TAV after 9 months
           of treatment.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab (Praluent®) on low-density lipoprotein
           cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein
           cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) after 9 months treatment.

        -  To evaluate the safety of alirocumab (Praluent®) including the occurrence of
           cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease death, non-fatal myocardial infarction,
           fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke, unstable angina requiring hospitalization)
           throughout the study.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 39 active centers in Japan. Overall 214 participants were screened between 15 November 2016 and 02 November 2017, of whom 8 were screen failure and 206 were randomized to either alirocumab arm or standard of care (SoC) arm.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified by ‘on statin therapy’ or ‘not on statin therapy’ at the time of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) onset.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Standard of Care</title>
          <description>During the study period, participants randomized to the SoC arm, in a non-blinded manner, received orally, stable dose of statin therapy (atorvastatin greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 10 milligram per day [mg/day] or rosuvastatin &gt;=5 mg/day) with optional dose adjustment (within the range approved by health authority). In participants receiving statin monotherapy, non-statin, non-proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (non-PCSK9) inhibitor lipid modifying therapies (LMTs) could be added by the investigators, if low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target level less than (&lt;) 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) could not be achieved.</description>

Statin (atorvastatin &gt;=10 mg/day or rosuvastatin &gt;=5 mg/day) and non-statin LMTs were continued at the same doses after ACS diagnosis unless modifications were necessary. Alirocumab (Praluent®) dose was increased to 150 mg Q2W at Week 14, if the Week 12 LDL-C was &gt;=100 mg/dL.</description>
