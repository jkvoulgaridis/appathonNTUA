  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two part study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase 2 dose of
      PDR001 in combination with sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in
      first line. There will be a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part.
