  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the relationship between the bile acids, fatty acids
      (fatty acids are part of the diet) and bacteria that are present in the intestines.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is emerging evidence that alterations in bile acids and SCFA associated with IBS could
      be associated with changes in the gut microbiota. In addition to modulating levels of
      intraluminal organic acids, it has been hypothesized that gut microbiota may alter local
      immune responses, modulate visceral pain responses, and impair gut barrier function.

      Our overall goal is to investigate the relationship between fecal bile acids, SCFA and the
      gut microbiota in IBS. Results of this pilot study could reveal insights into the interplay
      of the gut microbiota and small molecule mediators of IBS to suggest targeted clinical
      strategies for improved diagnosis and management of this important syndrome.

      AIM 1: Test the hypothesis that fecal organic acids (SFCA and bile acids) and fecal
      microbiota play an important role in IBS.

      AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that there is association between colonic transit and fecal
      microbiota in IBS
