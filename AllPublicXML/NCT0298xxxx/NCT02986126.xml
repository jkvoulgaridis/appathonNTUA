  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms and disorders are among the most common adult health conditions with a
      lifetime prevalence of 15-20% and are a leading cause of disability /morbidity worldwide.
      Although evidence-based approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), antidepressant
      medications, and depression collaborative care and quality improvement (QI) programs
      integrating depression care into primary health care can improve depression outcomes and
      disparities, racial / ethnic disparities continue to persist. Concurrently, according to a
      2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, little information exists on how to address the high
      rates of depression among sexual and gender minorities.

      Our study randomizes depressed, LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, queer), racial
      / ethnic minority adults to an evidence-based agency-level, depression quality improvement
      (QI) training [Resources for Services (RS)] and technical support alone or to a resiliency
      class (RC+), a 7-session resiliency, cognitive behavioral therapy class to enhance mood +
      automated mobile text reminders about basic reminders and care follow-up impact on improving
      adult patients' depressive symptoms. Depression QI (RS) training will be offered to three
      clusters of four to five LGBTQ-focused programs: two clusters in LA (Hollywood and South LA)
      and one cluster in NO. Clusters are comprised of one primary care, one mental health, and two
      to three community agencies (e.g., faith-based, social services/support, advocacy). All
      programs will receive depression QI training. Enrolled adult depressed patients (n=320) will
      be randomized individually to RC+ or RS (depression QI) alone to assess effects on primary
      outcomes: depressive symptoms [8-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-8) score and
      secondary outcomes: mental health quality of life [12-item mental composite score (MCS-12) ≤
      40], Resilience (Brief Resilience Scale), mental wellness, and physical health quality of
      life [12-item physical composite (PCS-12)score] at 6- and 12-month follow-up.

      Depressive symptoms and disorders are among the most common adult health conditions and are a
      leading cause of disability /morbidity worldwide. Although evidence-based approaches such as
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), antidepressant medications, and depression collaborative
      care and quality improvement (QI) programs integrating depression care into primary health
      care can improve depression outcomes and disparities, racial / ethnic disparities continue to
      persist. Concurrently, according to a 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report notes little
      information exists on how to address the high rates of depression among sexual and gender
      minorities, largely composed of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGBTQ) individuals. Limited
      comparative effectiveness data exists to know what treatments and services options improve
      health disparities due to patient characteristics such as race / ethnicity, and sexual
      orientation.

      &quot;Resilience Against Depression Disparities (RADD)&quot; randomizes enrolled depressed, LGBTQ,
      racial / ethnic minority adults (n=320) to an agency-level, evidence-based depression quality
      improvement (QI) intervention [Resources for Services (RS)] training and technical support
      and then randomizes individuals to Resources for Services alone or to Resiliency Class+, a
      7-session resiliency, depression cognitive behavioral therapy class + automated mobile text
      reminders about basic reminders and care follow-up impact on improving adult patients'
      depressive symptoms over 6- and 12-months. RS training will be offered to three clusters of
      four to five LGBTQ-focused programs: two clusters in LA (Hollywood and South LA) and one
      cluster in NO. Clusters are comprised of one primary care, one mental health, and two to
      three community agencies (e.g., faith-based, social services/support, advocacy). All programs
      will receive RS (depression QI training). All enrolled adult depressed patients will be
      within programs participating in RS (depression QI) trainings. Half of enrolled participants
      will be randomized to the Resilience Class +.

    <description>Resources for Services (RS) is an evidence-based depression QI toolkit developed for primary care, but adapted for health- and community-based programs. Protocols support training licensed providers in clinical assessment, medication management, and CBT; all staff in team management; and non-clinical staff in addressing patient safety, screening, behavioral management skills (behavioral activation, problem solving) to enable education, coordination, and referral. RS is offered as an initial 1-day / 8-hour training with follow-up through 12 webinars, 3 each on team management, medication management, psychotherapy, and case management. Programs will be invited to have a staff lead per training component, with no limit on number of staff at trainings. Training experts include a psychiatrist, psychologist/CBT trainer, case manager, support staff, and patient / community advocate liaison. All enrolled study participants will be nested within programs participating in RS.</description>

    <description>Resiliency Classes (RC) are a manualized, 7-session, CBT, psychoeducation class, lead by community health workers, that teaches skills to enhance mood. The RC manual covers: Session 1 - &quot;What Affects Your Mood and Resilience;&quot; Session 2 - &quot;Pleasant Activities Can Help Improve Your Mood and Make You Resilient;&quot; Session 3 - &quot;What Gets In The Way of Pleasant Activities: Harmful Thoughts and How to Change Them;&quot; Session 4 - &quot;How to Increase Your Resilience Through Support from Others;&quot; Session 5 - &quot;My Personal Resiliency Plan: Goal Setting;&quot; Session 6 - &quot;Celebrate Your Resiliency: Graduation&quot; Each RC will be 90-120 minutes in duration; once a week in community settings with up to 10 participants. RC will be supplemented with automated mobile text reminders about basic concepts and follow-up for care. Half of enrolled participants will be randomized to the Resiliency Class +. As of July 12, 2018, we will be offering bus tokens and $5 for completion of a satisfaction survey.</description>

    <ipd_description>We will work with the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) staff as the findings emerge to determine the potential value of some or all of the dataset being made publicly available, which would require additional funding from PCORI to complete. In general PCORI works with investigators to make a complete, cleaned, de-identified final data set with detailed descriptions contained within the study protocol available to PCORI for use as a publicly available dataset after study completion.</ipd_description>
