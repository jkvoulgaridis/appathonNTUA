  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site, safety and feasibility study of the SalutarisMD SMD-DA
      system for retrobulbar minimally invasive episcleral brachytherapy device in patients
      receiving and not responding to anti-VEGF therapy for nAMD. The trial will be open label and
      non-randomized. The study intervention is a one-time intervention and requires no alteration
      to the standard of care during the follow-up period.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive a single brachytherapy treatment and 36 months of follow-up.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of active CNV or PCV due to nAMD

          -  Poor or non-responsive to FDA approved intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for nAMD

          -  BCVA 20/63 or worse Snellen equivalent in the study eye

          -  Ability to understand nature/purpose of trial and to provide informed consent

          -  Ability to undergo diagnostic tests and surgical interventions

          -  Ability to follow instructions and complete the trial including all scheduled visits
             and follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neovascularization other than due to AMD

          -  Sub-foveal lesion hemorrhage obscuring &gt;50% of lesion

          -  Targeted neovascular lesion with greatest linear dimension &gt;3750 microns or &lt;1000
             microns as determined by angiography

          -  Presence of subretinal fibrosis, including disciform scar, or retinal pigment
             epithelial (RPE) atrophy that is extensive or foveal threatening in the study eye

          -  An existing retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear

          -  Previous treatment (excluding vitamins) for nAMD in the study eye other than anti-VEGF
             therapy in the last 6 months

          -  A change in anti-VEGF agent in the previous two administrations

          -  Anticipate a change to the anti-VEGF agent during the conduct of the study

          -  Other clinically significant ocular co-morbidity including, but not limited to,
             glaucoma, optic neuropathy of any cause, maculopathy / retinopathy of any cause other
             than nAMD, scleritis, enophthalmos, microphthalmia, or other co-morbidities that in
             the investigator's opinion could require medical or surgical intervention to prevent
             or treat visual loss or media opacity that might result from that condition (i.e.
             severe cataracts).

          -  Previous intraocular surgery in study eye other than for uncomplicated
             phacoemulsification cataract extraction

          -  High myopia indicated by a history of refractive error of - 6D or greater (spherical
             equivalent), demonstrated myopic degeneration, or axial length of &gt;26.5mm.

          -  Subjects with orbital structural abnormalities, such as small (axial length &lt;21 mm),
             deep set globes or other globe dystopias that, in the investigator's clinical
             judgment, would require a change in the angle of insertion or increase the risk of
             structural damage from retrobulbar anesthesia, sub-Tenon's anesthesia, or retrobulbar
             device positioning.

          -  Media opacity sufficient to preclude adequate fundoscopy, OCT, or angiography

          -  Uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g. controlled hypertension is acceptable)

          -  Type I or type II diabetes mellitus

          -  Any previous therapeutic radiation to the head or neck or other areas that may have
             resulted in a radiation dose to the retina.

          -  On anticoagulation or dual anti-platelet therapy with abnormal coagulation panel
             results.

          -  Patient unsuitable for IV or local anesthesia

          -  Any contraindication to anti-VEGF, fluorescein, indocyanine green, topical and local
             anesthetics, topical antiseptics, or topical antibiotics to be used during the study

          -  Active ocular or periocular infection or intraocular inflammation

          -  Fellow eye with a BCVA of 20/63 Snellen Equivalent or worse, with advanced AMD
             (neovascular or non-exudative AMD with foveal geographic atrophy), or other vision
             threatening disease that is not eligible for vision restoring treatment (i.e.
             inoperable cataracts).

          -  Fellow eye is receiving anti-VEGF therapy

          -  Have received any investigational treatment for any indication in the previous 30 days

          -  Any condition which, in the investigators' opinion, would conflict or otherwise
             prevent the subject from complying with the required procedures, schedule or other
             study conduct
