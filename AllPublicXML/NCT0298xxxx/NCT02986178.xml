    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) in adult patients
      with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma. The objective of
      this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy (anti-tumor response and survival) of
      PVSRIPO in recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma.

      Patients will be administered PVSRIPO intratumorally via convection-enhanced delivery (CED)
      using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the tumor. Retreatment
      with PVSRIPO is allowed, provided retreatment eligibility criteria are met.

      All patients who receive PVSRIPO treatment will be included in efficacy and safety analyses.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA SUMMARY:

          1. Patients must have a recurrent (first or second recurrence only, including this
             recurrence; transformation from a lower grade tumor to a WHO grade IV malignant glioma
             will be considered a first recurrence) supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma
             based on imaging studies with measurable disease (a minimum measurement of 1 cm and
             maximum of 5.5 cm of contrast-enhancing tumor) with prior histopathology consistent
             with a WHO grade IV malignant glioma confirmed by the site's neuropathologist or the
             neuropathologist's designate.

          2. Male patients who are sexually active are eligible if he and/or his partner(s) meets
             the criteria outlined in the protocol. Female subjects are eligible if he and/or his
             partner(s) meets the criteria outlined in the protocol.

          3. Age ≥ 18 years of age.

          4. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) Score ≥ 70%.

          5. Prothrombin and Partial Thromboplastin Times ≤ 1.2 x normal prior to biopsy.

          6. Total bilirubin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic

          7. Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 prior to biopsy.

          8. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 prior to biopsy.

          9. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL unsupported is necessary for eligibility on study;
             however, because of risks of intracranial hemorrhage with catheter placement, platelet
             count ≥ 125,000/μL is required for the patient to undergo biopsy and catheter
             insertion, which can be attained with the help of platelet transfusion.

         10. Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x normal range prior to biopsy.

         11. Positive serum anti-PV titer prior to biopsy.

         12. The patient must have received a boost immunization with trivalent inactivated IPOL™
             (Sanofi-Pasteur) at least 1 week, but less than 6 weeks, prior to administration of
             the study agent.

         13. At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the presence of recurrent
             tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis.

         14. A signed IRB-approve informed consent form (ICF).

         15. Able to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA SUMMARY:

          1. Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          2. Patients with an impending, life-threatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on
             the assessment of the study neurosurgeons, their designate, and the reviewer
             designated by the sponsor.

          3. Patients with severe, active co-morbidity, defined as in the protocol.

          4. Patients with a previous history of neurological complications due to PV infection.

          5. Patients who have not recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemo- and/or
             radiation therapy. Guidelines for this recovery period are dependent upon the specific
             therapeutic agent being used.

          6. Patients may not have received tumor treating fields (≤ 1 week), chemotherapy or
             bevacizumab ≤ 4 weeks [except for nitrosourea and lomustine (≤ 6 weeks); metronomic
             dosed chemotherapy, such as daily temozolomide, etoposide or cyclophosphamide (≤ 1
             week)] prior to starting the study drug.

          7. Patients may not have received immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the study
             drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy.

          8. Patients may not be less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy of the brain, unless
             progressive disease outside of the radiation field or 2 progressive scans at least 4
             weeks apart or histopathologic confirmation.

          9. Prior to enrollment, has not completed all standard of care treatments, including
             surgical procedure and radiation therapy (at least 59Gy) as outlined in the protocol.

         10. Patients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord;
