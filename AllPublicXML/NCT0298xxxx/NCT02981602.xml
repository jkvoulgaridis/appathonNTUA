    <textblock>
      This study examines the effects of IONIS-HBVRx or placebo (3:1 randomization) administered
      subcutaneously to treatment-naïve patients who are chronically infected with HBV and the
      effects of subsequent nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment on these patients.

    <description>The safety and tolerability of IONIS-HBVRx will be assessed by determining the incidence, severity, and dose relationship of adverse effects and changes in the laboratory parameters by dose. Safety results in subjects dosed with ISIS 505358 will be compared with those from subjects dosed with placebo.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 70 years

          -  Chronic HBV infection ≥6 months (e.g., positive for serum HBsAg ≥ 6 months)

          -  Plasma HBV DNA ≥ 2 x 1000 IU/mL (HBV DNA adequately suppressed for exploratory
             nucleos(t)ide analogue experienced cohort)

          -  Serum HBsAg ≥ 50 IU/mL

          -  Exploratory nucleos(t)ide analogue experienced cohort only: currently taking and have
             been taking tenofovir or entecavir without changes in drug, dose level and/or
             frequency of administration for ≥ 12 months and expect to continue taking without
             change through to the end of their participation in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or prior receipt of anti-HBV nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy. Patients who have
             failed prior interferon treatment, greater than 6 months prior to Screening, may be
             evaluated for possible participation in the study (not applicable for exploratory
             nucleos(t)ide analogue experienced cohort)

          -  History of liver cirrhosis and/or evidence of cirrhosis as determined by any of the
             following:

               1. Liver biopsy (i.e., Metavir Score F4) within 2 years of Screening, or

               2. Fibroscan &gt; 12 KPa, within 12 months of Screening, or

               3. AST-to-Platelet Index (APRI) &gt; 2 and Fibrosure result &gt; 0.7 within 12 months of
                  Screening For patients without a test for cirrhosis in the above timeframes,
                  Fibroscan, or APRI and Fibrosure, may be performed during the screening period to
                  rule out cirrhosis

          -  History of liver failure as evidenced by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and/or
             gastric or esophageal varices

          -  History of liver disease other than Hepatitis B

          -  Co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or
             hepatitis D virus (HDV)

          -  BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2

          -  History of, or suspected presence of vasculitis

          -  Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant

          -  Currently taking, or took within 3 months of Screening, any immunosuppressing drugs
             (e.g., prednisone)

          -  Diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma as evidenced
             by screening alpha-fetoprotein ≥ 200 ng/mL. If the screening alpha-fetoprotein is ≥ 50
             ng/mL and &lt; 200 ng/mL, the absence of liver mass must be documented by imaging within
             6 months before randomization

          -  Clinically-significant abnormalities aside from chronic HBV infection in medical
             history (e.g., previous acute coronary syndrome within 6 months of Screening, major
             surgery within 3 months of Screening, uncontrolled diabetes) or physical examination

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          -  History of extrahepatic disorders possibly related to HBV immune complexes (e.g.,
             glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa)

          -  History of excess alcohol consumption within 6 months of Screening

          -  History of drug abuse or dependence, or recreational use of drugs: within 3 months of
             Screening for soft drugs (such as marijuana) and within 1-year of Screening for hard
             drugs (such as cocaine, phencyclidine [PCP])
