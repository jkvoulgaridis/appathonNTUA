  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an investigational treatment (teduglutide) is
      safe and effective in Japanese children (age 4 months through 15 years of age) with SBS who
      are dependent on parenteral support. This study will also evaluate how teduglutide moves
      through the body (pharmacokinetics) and how it affects the body (pharmacodynamics).
