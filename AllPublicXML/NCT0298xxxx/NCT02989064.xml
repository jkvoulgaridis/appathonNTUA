    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is designed as a cell dose escalation trial in HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*02:06
      subjects with MAGE-A10 positive urothelial, melanoma or head and neck tumors. The study will
      enroll subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 using a modified 3+3 cell dose escalation
      design, to evaluate dose limiting toxicities and determine the target cell dose range.
      Following the dose escalation phase, additional subjects will be enrolled at the target cell
      dose range to further characterize safety and the effects at this cell dose.

      The study will take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the
      blood, and send them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study
      will be the subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of
      attacking and destroying cancer cells. When the MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells are available, subjects
      will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by
      T cell infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of genetically changed T
      cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with urothelial, melanoma or
      head and neck cancer.

      Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician after receiving their T cells for the
      next 6 months. After that, subjects will be seen every 3, 6, or 12 months according to the
      Schedule of Procedures. All subjects completing or withdrawing from the interventional
      portion of the study will enter a long term follow-up phase for observation of delayed
      adverse events and overall survival for 15 years post-infusion.
