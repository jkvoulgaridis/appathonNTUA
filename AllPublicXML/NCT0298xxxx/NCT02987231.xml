    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate clinically and through the concentration of
      inflammatory markers, the results of 6 months of electrical stimulation associated with
      coronally advanced flap for treatment of gingival recession.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, parallel and controlled clinical trial. The population evaluated in
      the study was selected at Institute of Science and Technology (ICT), São José dos Campos,
      College of Dentistry.

      Sixty patients presenting gingival recession will be divided in 2 groups:

        -  CAF group: coronally advanced flap for root coverage and sham electrical stimulation

        -  CAF+ES group: coronally advanced flap for root coverage plus electrical stimulation.

      All surgical procedures were performed by a single operator (MPS). The gingival recession
      defects were randomly treated by either the trapezoidal-type of coronally advanced flap plus
      connective tissue graft (CAF+CTG). In brief description, CAF treatment was performed by
      starting with two divergent releasing incisions lateral to the recessed area. A sulcular
      incision was made to unite the releasing incisions and the flap was raised beyond the
      mucogingival junction (MGJ) in split-full-split thickness. The connective tissue graft was
      removed from the palate and sutured in position. Sling sutures were placed to stabilize the
      flap in a coronal position 2 mm above the cement-enamel junction (CEJ), followed by
      interrupted sutures to close the releasing incisions.

      For electrical stimulation, a unit consisting of a signal generator (WaveFactoryCo., Ltd.,
      Tokyo, Japan), a power supply (KikusuiElectronicsCo., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and circuit board
      will be used. Conductive electrodes for electrical current application will be applied to the
      vestibular gingival surface on each side of the flap, at a distance of 3 mm from the relaxing
      incisions and an alternating current of 100 microamperes (μA) at 9 kilohertz (kHz), will be
      distributed in order to traverse the operated area. A single application of electrical
      stimulation will be given for 120 seconds, once a day for a week. The electric current will
      have its visualization optimized through an oscilloscope. Patients randomized to the Control
      Group (SHAM) will receive the simulation of the electrical stimulation (ES) process.

      Clinical, esthetics, and comfort of patients parameters were assessed at 45 days, 2, 3 and 6
      months after the procedure.

      Quantitative data were recorded as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and normality was tested
      using Shapiro-Wilk tests. The probing depth (PD), relative gingival recession (RGR), clinical
      attachment level (CAL), keratinized tissue thickness (KTT), keratinized tissue width (KTW),
      and dentin hypersensitivity (DH) values were examined by two-way repeated measures ANOVA to
      evaluate the differences within and between groups, followed by a Tukey test for multiple
      comparisons when the Shapiro-Wilk p value was ≥ 0.05. Those presenting Shapiro-Wilk p values
      &lt; 0.05 were analyzed using a Friedman test (for intragroup comparisons) and Mann-Whitney
      tests (for intergroup comparisons). Patients' esthetics and discomfort measures using visual
      analog scale (VAS) were analyzed by T-tests. The frequency of complete root coverage was
      compared using χ2 tests. Intergroup root coverage esthetic score (RES) comparisons were
      performed with a T-test. A significance level of 0.05 was adopted.

    <description>The Root Coverage Esthetic Scale (RES; Cairo et al. 2009) was performed by two blinded and independent examiners (CFA and IFM) at the 6-month post-operative assessment. This score evaluates five variables: level of the gingival margin, marginal tissue contour, soft tissue texture, mucogingival junction alignment, and gingival color. Because complete root coverage was the primary treatment goal, and the other variables were considered secondary, the value assigned for root coverage was 60% of the total score, whereas 40% was assigned to the other four variables. With regard to the assessment of the final position of the gingival margin, 3 points were given for partial root coverage, and 6 points were given for complete root coverage; 0 points were assigned when the final position of the gingival margin was equal or apical to the previous recession. One point was assigned for each of the other four variables. The final score ranged from 0-10, higher values were considered better.</description>

            <description>CAF treatment was performed by starting with two divergent releasing incisions lateral to the recessed area. A sulcular incision was made to unite the releasing incisions and the flap was raised beyond the mucogingival junction (MGJ) in split-full-split thickness. Sling sutures were placed to stabilize the flap in a coronal position 2 mm above the CEJ, followed by interrupted sutures to close the releasing incisions. Patients randomized to the SHAM Group will receive the simulation of the electrical stimulation process.

The flap was raised beyond the mucogingival junction (MGJ) in split-full-split thickness. Sling sutures were placed to stabilize the flap in a coronal position 2 mm above the CEJ. For electrical stimulation, a unit consisting of a signal generator, a power supply, and a circuit board will be used. Conductive electrodes for electrical current application will be applied to the vestibular gingival surface on each side of the flap, at a distance of 3 mm from the relaxing incisions and an alternating current of 100 μA at 9 kHz, will be distributed in order to traverse the operated area. A single application of electrical stimulation will be given for 120 seconds, once a day for five days after surgery.

        <title>Root Coverage Esthetic Score</title>
        <description>The Root Coverage Esthetic Scale (RES; Cairo et al. 2009) was performed by two blinded and independent examiners (CFA and IFM) at the 6-month post-operative assessment. This score evaluates five variables: level of the gingival margin, marginal tissue contour, soft tissue texture, mucogingival junction alignment, and gingival color. Because complete root coverage was the primary treatment goal, and the other variables were considered secondary, the value assigned for root coverage was 60% of the total score, whereas 40% was assigned to the other four variables. With regard to the assessment of the final position of the gingival margin, 3 points were given for partial root coverage, and 6 points were given for complete root coverage; 0 points were assigned when the final position of the gingival margin was equal or apical to the previous recession. One point was assigned for each of the other four variables. The final score ranged from 0-10, higher values were considered better.</description>
