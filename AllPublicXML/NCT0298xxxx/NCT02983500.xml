      The PRO Xie project will recruit a representative cohort of patients with advanced lung or
      advanced pancreatic cancer with a high risk for the development of cancer cachexia.

      Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) are assessed in a real life setting by a questionnaire
      consisting of 20 questions: QoL is measured by SF12, fatigue by FACIT-F and cachexia by FAACT
      questionnaires, respectively.

      These data will determine the potential need for anti-cachexia treatment in those patients,
      as well as the number of underweight patients, the evaluation of general QoL, fatigue and
      cachexia and the evaluation of malnutrition.
