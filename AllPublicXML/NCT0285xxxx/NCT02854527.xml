First, they were administered a single dose of 0.25 milligram (mg) tablet of Digoxin (reference 1 or R1). Second, they were administered a single dose of 0.1 milliliter (mL) or 1 mg oral solution of Furosemide (R2). Third, they were administered a single dose of test cocktail (T) comprised of 0.25 mg of Digoxin, 0.1 mL (1 mg) of Furosemide, 0.1 mL (10 mg) of Metformin hydrochloride and 10 mg of Rosuvastatin. Fourth, they were administered a single dose of 0.1 mL (10 mg) oral solution of Metformin hydrochloride (R3).

Second, they were administered a single dose of 0.1 milliliter (mL) or 1 mg oral solution of Furosemide (R2). Third, they were administered a single dose of 10 mg film-coated tablet of Rosuvastatin (R4). Fourth, they were administered a single dose of 0.25 milligram (mg) tablet of Digoxin (R1). Fifth, they were administered a single dose of test cocktail (T) comprised of 0.25 mg of Digoxin, 0.1 mL (1 mg) of Furosemide, 0.1 mL (10 mg) of Metformin hydrochloride and 10 mg of Rosuvastatin.
All drugs were administered orally with 320 mL of non-sparkling drinking water after overnight fasting of 10 hours.</description>
