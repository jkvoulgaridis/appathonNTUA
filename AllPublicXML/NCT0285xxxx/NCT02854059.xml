  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability in patients diagnosed
      with asymptomatic antibody-mediated TTP with low ADAMTS13 activity after receiving single
      intravenous dose of IdeS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin G-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes (IdeS) is an IgG specific
      endopeptidase which cleaves IgG molecules and efficiently neutralizes Fc-mediated activities.
      IdeS-mediated IgG degradation constitutes a novel therapeutic principle for the treatment of
      IgG-driven human diseases.

      In addition to assessing the safety and tolerability of IdeS the study will also assess the
      efficacy of IdeS to significantly increase the ADAMTS13 activity and decrease the
      anti-ADAMTS13 antibody levels in patients diagnosed with asymptomatic antibody-mediated TTP
      with low ADAMTS13 activity.

    <measure>Safety and Tolerability as Measured by Type, Frequency and Intensity of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From dosing until end of follow up on day 64</time_frame>
    <description>Data on AEs were obtained if spontaneously reported by the patient, if reported in response to an open question from the study personnel or if revealed by observation.
A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any AE occurring after administration of the IMP and within the time of the residual drug effect period (i.e. 30 days after IMP administration).
AEs reported in ClinicalTrials.gov include TEAEs and post-treatment AEs, i.e. all AEs occurring after administration of IdeS until end of study.
Please refer to Adverse Event section for details on reported AEs</description>

    <time_frame>From day of dosing until end of follow up on day 64</time_frame>
    <description>ADAMTS13 is an enzyme which is inhibited in patients with TTP. The efficacy of IdeS on ADAMTS13 activity was measured througout the study as change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients for Whom a Decreased ADAMTS13 Activity Returned to Normal Levels at Different Time-points in the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of dosing until end of follow up on day 64</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAMTS13 activity in TTP patients is decreased. The efficacy of IdeS on ADAMTS13 activity was assessed throughout the study to identify the time-point of return to normal levels.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Change From Baseline in Pharmacodynamics as Measured by Level of IgG</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of dosing until end of follow up on day 64</time_frame>
    <description>IdeS cleaves IgG molecules. The concentration of uncleaved IgG in the patient's serum was measured throughout the study to determine change from baseline following IdeS administration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients Showing IdeS Immunogenicity as Measured by Anti-drug Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of dosing until end of follow up on day 64</time_frame>
    <description>Most humans have been infected with S. pyogenes which is the origin of IdeS. It was therefore expected that patients in this study might have antibodies against IdeS before being exposed to IdeS in the study. The concentration of ant-IdeS antibodies was measured before dosing and throughout the study.</description>

        <description>Data on AEs were obtained if spontaneously reported by the patient, if reported in response to an open question from the study personnel or if revealed by observation.
A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any AE occurring after administration of the IMP and within the time of the residual drug effect period (i.e. 30 days after IMP administration).
AEs reported in ClinicalTrials.gov include TEAEs and post-treatment AEs, i.e. all AEs occurring after administration of IdeS until end of study.

A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as any AE occurring after administration of IdeS and within the time of the residual drug effect period (i.e. 30 days after IdeS administration).
AEs reported in ClinicalTrials.gov include TEAEs and post-TEAEs, i.e. all AEs occurring after administration of IdeS until end of study</desc>
