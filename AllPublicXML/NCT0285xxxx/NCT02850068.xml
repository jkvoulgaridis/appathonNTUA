  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to test a new treatment method, geniculate artery embolization (GAE), to reduce
      the severity of pain and disability caused by knee osteoarthritis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The primary aims of this study are to determine if geniculate artery embolization
      (GAE) will reduce the severity of pain as well as global disability (resulting from the
      combination of pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities) caused by knee OA
      and if it can be performed safely. The secondary aim is to determine if GAE can result in the
      decreased necessity for ongoing conservative OA therapies such as medication therapy and
      joint injections.

      Participants: Twenty patients with knee osteoarthritis resulting in knee pain that is
      refractory to conservative therapies, who are not planning to undergo surgery within 6
      months.

      Procedures (methods): This will be an open label 24-month pilot study with a small population
      undergoing GAE to determine safety and efficacy. Clinical procedures and evaluations will
      consist of a preoperative screening assessment to determine if the potential study subject
      meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, enrollment, surgical procedure for geniculate
      artery embolization, and follow-up visits at 24 hours, 1, 3 &amp; 6 months. An MRI will be
      performed at the 1-month visit to detect a change in synovial vascularity and to exclude
      complication.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index will be used to measure function. This is a score derived from a questionnaire in which the patient answers questions regarding rheumatic symptoms, stiffness, pain and how it affects the ability to function. Participants are asked to rate each question on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 = None, 1 = Slight, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Very, 4 = Extremely) for the level of difficulty to complete each task. The categories are then totaled for an overall score out of 96. Higher values indicate greater levels of pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Pain (mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;.</description>

    <description>Reduction in the number or strength of previously initiated OA medical therapy (e.g. NSAIDs) at 6 months follow-up, which will be summarized using counts and simple statistics (percentage of participants with a reduction in medication therapy at month 6 months).</description>

    <description>Geniculate artery embolization (GAE) is a new procedure that is being used to reduce pain and disability (resulting from pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities) caused by knee osteoarthritis (OA). Embolization is a procedure where physicians intentionally block the blood vessels to specific areas of the body to prevent blood flow to that region. By doing this, the decrease in blood flow will decrease the size of the area of interest. In this case, the goal is to decrease the size of inflammatory tissue around the knee, resulting in improvement of pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities from OA.</description>

        <title>Patient Function (Units on a Scale)</title>
        <description>Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index will be used to measure function. This is a score derived from a questionnaire in which the patient answers questions regarding rheumatic symptoms, stiffness, pain and how it affects the ability to function. Participants are asked to rate each question on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 = None, 1 = Slight, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Very, 4 = Extremely) for the level of difficulty to complete each task. The categories are then totaled for an overall score out of 96. Higher values indicate greater levels of pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

            <description>Patients in this study will receive the geniculate artery embolization (GAE) procedure. The primary aims will be to determine if geniculate artery embolization (GAE) will reduce pain and disability (resulting from pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities) caused by knee osteoarthritis (OA).
Geniculate Artery Embolization: Geniculate artery embolization (GAE) is a new procedure that is being used to reduce pain and disability (resulting from pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities) caused by knee osteoarthritis (OA). Embolization is a procedure where physicians intentionally block the blood vessels to specific areas of the body to prevent blood flow to that region. By doing this, the decrease in blood flow will decrease the size of the area of interest. In this case, the goal is to decrease the size of inflammatory tissue around the knee, resulting in improvement of pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities from OA.</description>
