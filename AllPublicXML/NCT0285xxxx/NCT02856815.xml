      ILC-IIT-05 is randomized, open-label, multi-center phase 2 clinical trial. To confirm
      clinical efficacy and safety between 'Immuncell-LC group' and 'non-treatment group', primary
      outcome, recurrence free survival(RFS) will be evaluated.

      For secondary outcome, overall survival(OS), changes of Alpha Feto Protein(AFP), correlation
      of between myeloid-derived suppressor cell change and prognosis, adverse event, ECOG-PS and
      hematological examination will be evaluated.
