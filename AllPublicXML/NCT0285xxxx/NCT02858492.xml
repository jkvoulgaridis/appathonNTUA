  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first study with GSK2982772, a receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1) kinase
      inhibitor, in subjects with moderate to severe RA who are currently being treated with
      disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The primary objective of the study is to
      investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat oral doses of GSK2982772 in subjects with
      moderate to severe RA. In addition to the PK, a number of experimental and clinical endpoints
      will be employed to obtain information on the PD, and preliminary efficacy in subjects with
      active RA. Although no formal hypothesis will be tested, these endpoints will enable a
      broader understanding of the mechanism of action and potential for clinical efficacy of
      GSK2982772 in RA. After a screening period of up to 30 days, approximately 24 subjects will
      be randomized to receive either GSK2982772 or placebo for 84 days (12 weeks), followed by a
      follow-up period (28 days). The total duration of participation in the study will be
      approximately 20 weeks from screening to the last study visit.

    <description>The DAS28-CRP is a composite measure of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis calculated from the sum of tender joint count 28 (TJC28), swollen joint count (SJC28), CRP and patient global assessment of disease activity (PtGA). The formula used to calculate DAS28 score was 0.56 multiplied by square root of TJC28 plus 0.28 multiplied by square root of SJC28 plus 0.36 log of (CRP plus 1) plus 0.014 multiplied by PtGA plus 0.96. Scores of DAS28-CRP ranged from 0.96 to 9.4 with higher scores indicating greater disease burden. A DAS28-CRP score of &lt;=2.6 suggested remission, &lt;3.2 suggested a low level of disease activity, while a score of &gt;5.1 suggested a high level of disease activity. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Categorical DAS28-CRP Response Using European League Against Rheumatism [EULAR] Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-CRP scores were categorized using EULAR response criteria. Response at a given time point was defined based on the combination of current DAS28 score and the improvement in the current DAS28 score relative to Baseline. The definition of no response, moderate response and good response was as; if current DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and DAS28 decrease from Baseline (&gt;1.2: good response), (&gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2: moderate response) and (&lt;=0.6: no response); if current DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and DAS28 decrease from Baseline value (&gt;1.2: moderate response), (&gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2: moderate response) and (&lt;=0.6: no response) and if current DAS28 &gt;5.1 and DAS28 decrease from Baseline value (&gt;1.2: moderate response), (&gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2: no response) and (&lt;=0.6: no response). If the post-Baseline DAS28-CRP score was missing, then the corresponding EULAR category was set to missing.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Categorical American College of rheumatology20/50/70 (ACR20/50/70) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>The ACR score was based on improvement from Baseline in tender joint counts and swollen joint counts. A participant had achieved ACR20 if he experienced &gt;=20 percent improvement from Baseline in Tender Joint count 28 (TJC28) and Swollen Joint Count 28 (SJC28) and a &gt;=20 percent improvement from Baseline in 3 out of 5 of the following assessments: participant pain assessment on a 100 millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (VAS), participant global assessment on a 100 mm VAS scale, physician global assessment on a 100 mm VAS scale, C-reactive protein and Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Similarly, ACR50 and ACR70 are calculated using 50 or 70 percent improvement from baseline respectively. For all visits, if any of the component scores were missing; then those scores were considered as not having met the criteria for improvement.</description>

        specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
        individual subject should be determined and documented prior to initiation of the study. In
        other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an
        individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject
        from the trial. For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT correction formula,

      <recruitment_details>The study evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of GSK2982772 in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either GSK2982772 60 milligram (mg) or placebo to be taken orally twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID) for 84 days.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 99 participants were screened, of them, 47 participants were screen failures and 52 participants were enrolled. Of them, 51 participants received study treatment. One participant was enrolled in the study but never received study treatment as eligibility criteria for dose was not met.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Case Clinical Chemistry Parameters of Potential Clinical Importance (PCI)</title>
        <description>Clinical chemistry parameters included alanine amino transferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate amino transferase (AST), calcium, creatinine, glucose, potassium, sodium and total bilirubin. PCI ranges were ALT(high): &gt;=2*Upper limit of Normal(ULN) units per liter(U/L), albumin(low): 30 millimoles per liter(mmol/L), alkaline phosphatase(high): &gt;=2*ULN U/L, AST(high): &gt;=2*ULN U/L, calcium: &lt;2(low) or &gt;2.75 mmol/L(high), creatinine (high): increase from Baseline &gt;44.25 mmol/L, glucose: &lt;3(low) or &gt;9 mmol/L(high), potassium: &lt;3(low) or &gt;5.5 mmol/L(high), sodium: &lt;130(low) or &gt;150 mmol/L(high) and total bilirubin(high): &gt;=1.5*ULN micromoles per liter(µmol/L). Participants were counted in the worst case category if their value changes (to low or to high), unless there is no change in their category. Only those clinical chemistry parameters with PCI values (to low and to high) have been presented.</description>

        <description>Hematology parameters included hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocytes, platelet counts, total neutrophils and white blood cells (WBCs). PCI ranges were &lt; 0.075 (decrease from baseline) or &gt;0.54 proportion of red blood cells in blood (high) for hematocrit, &lt;25 (low) or &gt;180 grams per liter (g/L) (high) for hemoglobin, &lt;0.8 x10^9 cells per liter (cells/L) for lymphocytes (low), &lt;100 (low) or &gt;550 x10^9 cells/L(high) for platelets, &lt;1.5 x10^9 cells/L (low) for total neutrophils and &lt; 3 (low) or &gt;20 x10^9 cells/L (high) for WBCs. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes (to low or to high), unless there is no change in their category. Only those hematology parameters with PCI values (to low and to high) have been presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Case Any Increase in Urinalysis Results Post-Baseline Relative to Baseline by Microscopy Method</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected to assess glucose, ketones, occult blood and protein by dipstick method. Microscopy was performed only on urine samples showing an abnormality on the dipstick. Microscopy was performed for hyaline casts, red blood cells and white blood cells. Results for microscopy parameters hyaline casts, red blood cells and white blood cells were categorized as 'any increase from Baseline', which imply any increase in their count in the urine sample. Only participants with worst case any increase from Baseline values are presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Heart Rate at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>12- lead ECG was measured on each day using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measured PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula (QTcB) and QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF). ECG was measured in semi-supine or supine position after 5 minutes rest. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG PR Interval, QRS Duration, QT Interval, QTcB and QTcF at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>12- lead ECG was measured on each day using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measured PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval QTcB and QTcF. ECG was measured in semi-supine or supine position after 5 minutes rest. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bone Erosion Total Score by &quot;Outcome Measures in Rheumatology, Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (OMERACT-RAMRIS)&quot; Scoring System</title>
        <description>A total of 25 locations in the hand and wrist were evaluated for RAMRIS bone erosions. Individual location scores range from 0 (no erosions) to 10 (91 to 100 percent of bone eroded) based on the proportion of eroded bone compared to the &quot;assessed bone volume&quot; on all available images. The final bone erosion score was the sum of the individual location scores. The total score from the 25 locations ranges from 0 to 250, with 0 implying no bone erosion and 250 implying 91 to 100 percent bone eroded. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Bone Erosion Total Score by &quot;Outcome Measures in Rheumatology, Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (OMERACT-RAMRIS)&quot; Scoring System</title>
          <description>A total of 25 locations in the hand and wrist were evaluated for RAMRIS bone erosions. Individual location scores range from 0 (no erosions) to 10 (91 to 100 percent of bone eroded) based on the proportion of eroded bone compared to the &quot;assessed bone volume&quot; on all available images. The final bone erosion score was the sum of the individual location scores. The total score from the 25 locations ranges from 0 to 250, with 0 implying no bone erosion and 250 implying 91 to 100 percent bone eroded. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bone Erosions by the Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Quantitative (RAMRIQ) Scoring System</title>
        <description>RAMRIQ bone erosions (normalized) was a quantitative measurement from the bones and synovial capsules of the joints from the most affected (or dominant hand if equally affected). It was calculated as the sum of the individual measurements of the volume of bone erosions divided by sum of the individual measurements of the bone volume. The total score ranged from 0 to 1, with 0 implying no erosive damage. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Synovitis by RAMRIQ Scoring System</title>
        <description>RAMRIQ synovitis (normalised) was a quantitative measurement from the bones and synovial capsules of the joints from the most affected (or dominant hand if equally affected). It was calculated as the sum of the individual measurements of the volume of enhancing pannus (VEP) divided by sum of the individual measurements of the joint volume. The total score ranged from 0 to 1, with 0 implying no synovitis. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

        <description>A total of 25 locations in the hand and wrist were evaluated for RAMRIS bone edema or osteitis. Individual location scores range from 0 (no edema) to 3 (67 to 100 percent involvement of original articular bone) based on the proportion of estimated originally non-eroded bone involved. The final bone edema or osteitis score is the sum of the individual location scores. The total score from the 25 locations ranges from 0 to 75, with 0 implying no bone edema or osteitis and 75 implying 67 to 100 percent involvement of original articular bone.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bone Edema by RAMRIQ Scoring System</title>
        <description>RAMRIQ bone edema (normalised) was a quantitative measurement from the bones and synovial capsules of the joints from the most affected (or dominant hand if equally affected). It was calculated as the sum of the individual measurements of the Volume of bone edema divided by sum of the individual measurements of the bone volume. The total score ranged from 0 to 1, with 0 implying no bone marrow lesions. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Joint Space Narrowing by Modified CARLOS</title>
        <description>A total of 20 locations in the hand and wrist were evaluated for CARLOS joint space narrowing/cartilage loss. Individual location scores range from 0 (no cartilage loss or Joint Space Narrowing) to 4 (complete ankylosis) in increments of 0.5 based on the amount of narrowing present in a given joint. The final cartilage loss score was the sum of the individual location scores. The total score from 20 location ranged from 0 to 80, with 0 implying no cartilage loss at any location and 80 implying complete ankylosis. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Contrast agent volume transfer constant (Ktrans) relates to the exchange of contrast agent between the blood plasma and the tissue extravascular extracellular spaces and reflects blood flow and capillary permeability. Ktrans was measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) tracer kinetic modeling in the most affected hand/wrist at indicated time points. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) Scores</title>
        <description>The DAS28-CRP is a composite measure of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis calculated from the sum of tender joint count 28 (TJC28), swollen joint count (SJC28), CRP and patient global assessment of disease activity (PtGA). The formula used to calculate DAS28 score was 0.56 multiplied by square root of TJC28 plus 0.28 multiplied by square root of SJC28 plus 0.36 log of (CRP plus 1) plus 0.014 multiplied by PtGA plus 0.96. Scores of DAS28-CRP ranged from 0.96 to 9.4 with higher scores indicating greater disease burden. A DAS28-CRP score of &lt;=2.6 suggested remission, &lt;3.2 suggested a low level of disease activity, while a score of &gt;5.1 suggested a high level of disease activity. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from Baseline value.</description>

Similarly, ACR50 and ACR70 are calculated using 50 or 70 percent improvement from baseline respectively. For all visits, if any of the component scores were missing; then those scores were considered as not having met the criteria for improvement.</description>
