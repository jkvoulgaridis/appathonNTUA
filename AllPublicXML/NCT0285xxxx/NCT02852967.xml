      This phase 2, two-period, dose-finding, placebo-controlled study was performed on adult male
      and female subjects to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subjects with moderate to severe
      chronic plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.

      Period 1: Double-blind Treatment Period

      The first part of the study was double-blind and placebo-controlled. Approximately 110
      subjects were to be randomly assigned to each of 5 dose cohorts in a 1:1:1:1:1 manner. Each
      cohort was to have 22 subjects who met eligibility criteria. Subjects were to be treated with
      oral KD025 tablets or placebo tablets as follows:

        -  Cohort 1: 200 mg KD025 once daily (QD)

        -  Cohort 2: 200 mg KD025 twice daily (BID)

        -  Cohort 3: 400 mg KD025 QD

        -  Cohort 4: 600 mg/day KD025 (400 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening)

        -  Cohort 5: Matching placebo BID

      Subjects in each of the 5 cohorts in Period 1 were to be treated with study medication for a
      period of 16 weeks.

      [Note: Originally, a sample size of 36 subjects per cohort was to provide approximately 90%
      probability ≥ 1 subject in the 5 cohorts would experience an adverse event (AE) that had an
      underlying rate of ≥ 6% and approximately an 80% probability of ≥ 1 subject in the cohort
      would experience an AE that had an underlying rate of ≥ 4%. However, due to a newly available
      plaque psoriasis treatment, the study was terminated early with 110 subjects.]

      Period 2: Open-label Treatment Period

      The second part of the study was open-label treatment with oral KD025. All subjects who were
      treated for 16 weeks with KD025 were given the option to receive KD025 400 mg QD for an
      additional 32 weeks (Week 16 through Week 48). Subjects who had received placebo for 16 weeks
      were given the option to receive KD025 400 mg QD for 32 weeks (Week 16 through Week 48).

      Follow-up Period

      All subjects had a safety evaluation 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

      Efficacy was assessed by the following scores at scheduled time points throughout the study:

        -  Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI): Measure of psoriasis disease severity using
           average redness, thickness, and scaliness of lesions (each lesion graded 0 to 4),
           combined into single score ranging on a scale from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximum
           disease)

        -  Physician's Global Assessment (PGA): Physician's assessment of a subject's psoriasis,
           relative to Baseline, ranging on a scale from 1 (100% clearing of psoriasis) to 6 (poor
           to no clearing)

        -  Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI): Skin disease-specific instrument for assessing
           impact of disease on subject's quality of life (QOL), ranging on a scale from 0 (no
           effect on subject's life) to 30 (extremely large effect on subject's life)

      Safety was assessed by;

        -  AEs and serious AE (SAEs)

        -  Physical examination (PE)

        -  Vital sign (VS) measurements

        -  Clinical laboratory evaluations

        -  Electrocardiograms (ECG)

        -  Reasons for discontinuation due to toxicity analyses

      Pharmacodynamics (PD) was assessed by the concentration and changes in interleukin-17 (IL-17)
      levels in blood.

      The maximum duration for subjects who completed Period 1 was 24 weeks (up to 28-day
      screening, 16-week treatment [Period 1], and 4 weeks follow-up). The maximum duration for
      subjects who completed Period 2 was 56 weeks (up to 28-day screening, 32-week treatment
      [Period 2], and 4-week follow-up).

                  regarding use of alcohol, have levels repeated and participation in the study
                  should have been discussed with the medical monitor.)
