    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response, safety and reactogenicity after
      receiving combined DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine when administered as a three-dose primary vaccination
      course at 3, 4.5 and 6 months of age and as a booster dose at 18 months of age in Russian
      healthy children according to the Russian immunisation schedule

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  Major congenital defects.

          -  Serious chronic illness.

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or
                  ≥38.0°C for rectal route.

               -  Subjects with a minor illness without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of
                  the investigator.
