    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effectiveness of a 6-week, group-based, cognitive behavioural
      therapy (CGBT) program for women with anxiety disorders (with or without comorbid depressive
      symptoms) during pregnancy or early postpartum. The CBGT program was evaluated compared to a
      6-week waitlist condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders affect up to 15% of women in the perinatal period (i.e., pregnancy,
      postpartum) and are a serious mental health concern. Anxiety disorders often coexist with
      depression and result in high distress and an impaired ability for new mothers to take care
      of themselves and their babies. In spite of the high prevalence of anxiety disorders during
      pregnancy and postpartum, research and clinical attention in this area is lacking and no
      empirically supported psychological treatments exist. Further, since many pregnant or
      postpartum women are unable or choose not to take medication for their mental health
      symptoms, establishing an effective non-pharmacological alternative is imperative.
      Cognitive-behavioural therapy is a well established psychological treatment for anxiety and
      mood disorders, with moderate to large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.5-1.3). The investigators
      developed a novel group-based cognitive-behavioural treatment program (CBGT) for perinatal
      women with anxiety disorders. In an initial, single-sample pilot study (Green et al., 2015),
      a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression was found from pre to
      post-treatment, along with reported high levels of treatment satisfaction. The purpose of the
      current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment using a larger sample and a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT).

    <measure>State-Trait Inventory of Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in anxiety symptoms will be assessed through the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA; Gros et al.,2007) to examine whether CBT for perinatal anxiety is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms. Items on the STICSA are rated on a 4-point likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much so), with higher scores indicating worse anxiety symptoms. The STICSA has two subscales (i.e., cognitive subscale and somatic subscale) and a total score that will be used in analysis. Ten items comprise the cognitive subscale, meaning scores can range from 10-40. Eleven items comprise the somatic subscale, meaning scores can range from 11 -44. The total score is a sum of both subscales with possible total scores in the range of 21-84.</description>

    <description>Changes in intolerance of uncertainty will be assessed through the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12; Carleton, R. N., Norton, M. P. J., &amp; Asmundson, G. J, 2007) to examine whether CBT for perinatal anxiety is effective in reducing intolerance of uncertainty. Items on the IUS-12 are rated on a 5-point likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all characteristic of me) to 5 (entirely characteristic of me). Higher scores indicate great levels of intolerance of uncertainty and are associated with worse outcomes. The IUS-12 has a total score, along with two subscale scores. The prospective anxiety subscale comprises of seven items, with possible scores ranging from 7-35. The inhibitory anxiety scale comprises of five items, with possible scores ranging from 5-25. The total IUS-12 score is calculated by summing the two subscales, meaning total scores range from 12-60.</description>
