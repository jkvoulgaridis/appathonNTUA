  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although vitreous hemorrhage (VH) from proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) can cause
      acute and dramatic vision loss for patients with diabetes, there is no current,
      evidence-based clinical guidance as to what treatment method is most likely to provide the
      best visual outcomes once intervention is desired. Intravitreous anti-vascular endothelial
      growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy alone or vitrectomy combined with intraoperative PRP each
      provide the opportunity to stabilize or regress retinal neovascularization. However, clinical
      trials are lacking to elucidate the relative time frame of visual recovery or final visual
      outcome in prompt vitrectomy compared with initial anti-VEGF treatment. The Diabetic
      Retinopathy Clinical Research Network Protocol N demonstrated short-term trends consistent
      with a possible beneficial effect of anti-VEGF treatment in eyes with VH from PDR, including
      greater visual acuity improvement and reduced rates of recurrent VH as compared with saline
      injection. It is possible that a study with a longer duration of follow-up with structured
      anti-VEGF retreatment would demonstrate even greater effectiveness of anti-VEGF for VH to
      avoid vitrectomy and its attendant adverse events while also improving visual acuity. On the
      other hand, advances in surgical techniques leading to faster operative times, quicker
      patient recovery, and reduced complication rates may make prompt vitrectomy a more attractive
      alternative since it results in the immediate ability to clear hemorrhage and to perform PRP
      if desired, often as part of one procedure. This proposed study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of two treatment approaches for eyes with VH from PDR: prompt vitrectomy + PRP and
      intravitreous aflibercept injections.

    <description>The primary outcome of visual acuity area under the curve at 24 weeks was primarily selected for sample size considerations. The long-term additional key outcomes and within-group outcomes will be equally important as the area under the curve outcome for evaluating the overall follow-up course for these two treatment approaches. Therefore, publication is not planned until the full 104 week follow-up has closed.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt;= 18 years Participants &lt;18 years old are not being included because
             proliferative diabetic retinopathy is so rare in this age group that the diagnosis may
             be questionable.

          2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)

        Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes is
        present:

          -  Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes

          -  Current regular use of oral anti-hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of diabetes

          -  Documented diabetes by American Diabetes Association and/or World Health Organization
             criteria 4. Able and willing to provide informed consent. 5. Patient is willing and
             able to undergo vitrectomy within next 2 weeks and the vitrectomy can be scheduled
             within that time frame.

             6. Vitreous hemorrhage causing vision impairment, presumed to be from proliferative
             diabetic retinopathy, for which intervention is deemed necessary.

               -  Note: Prior panretinal photocoagulation is neither a requirement nor an
                  exclusion.

               -  Subhyaloid hemorrhage alone does not make an eye eligible; however, presence of
                  subhyaloid hemorrhage in addition to the criteria above will not preclude
                  participation provided the investigator is comfortable with either treatment
                  regimen.

                  7. Immediate vitrectomy not required (investigator and participant are willing to
                  wait at least 4 months to see if hemorrhage clears sufficiently with
                  anti-vascular endothelial growth factor without having to proceed to vitrectomy).

                  8. Visual acuity letter score ≤78 (approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32) and at
                  least light perception.

                  9. Investigators should use particular caution when considering enrollment of an
                  eye with visual acuity letter score 69 to 78 (approximate Snellen equivalent
                  20/32 to 20/40) to ensure that the need for vitrectomy and its potential benefits
                  outweigh the potential risks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A potential participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are
             present:

               1. History of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis (including placement of
                  fistula if performed in preparation for dialysis) or kidney transplant.

               2. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude
                  participation in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood
                  pressure, cardiovascular disease, and glycemic control).

               3. Initiation of intensive insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections)
                  within 4 months prior to randomization or plans to do so in the next 4 months.

               4. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participant
                  undergoing elective vitrectomy surgery if indicated during the study.

               5. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of randomization that
                  involved treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval for
                  the indication being studied.

                  • Note: participants cannot receive another investigational drug while
                  participating in the study.

               6. Known allergy to any component of the study drug or any drug used in the
                  injection prep (including povidone iodine).

               7. Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 or diastolic above 110).

               8. If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment,
                  potential participant can become eligible.

               9. Systemic anti-vascular endothelial growth factor or pro-vascular endothelial
                  growth factor treatment within 4 months prior to randomization.

                  • These drugs cannot be used during the study.

              10. For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to
                  become pregnant within the next two years.

                  • Women who are potential participants should be questioned about the potential
                  for pregnancy. Investigator judgment is used to determine when a pregnancy test
                  is needed.

              11. Potential participant is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center
                  to an area not covered by another clinical center during the two years.

              12. Evidence of traction detachment involving or threatening the macula.

                  • If the density of the hemorrhage precludes a visual assessment on clinical exam
                  to confirm eligibility, then it is recommended that assessment be performed with
                  ultrasound as standard care.

              13. Evidence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

                  • If the density of the hemorrhage precludes a visual assessment on clinical exam
                  to confirm eligibility, then it is recommended that assessment be performed with
                  ultrasound as standard care.

              14. Evidence of neovascular glaucoma (iris or angle neovascularization is not an
                  exclusion).

              15. Known diabetic macular edema (DME), defined as either

              16. Optical coherence tomography central subfield thickness (microns):

              17. Zeiss Cirrus: ≥290 in women; ≥305 in men

              18. Heidelberg Spectralis: ≥305 in women; ≥320 in men OR

              19. Diabetic macular edema on clinical exam that the investigator believes currently
                  requires treatment.

              20. History of intravitreous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment within
                  2 months prior to current vitreous hemorrhage onset or after onset.

              21. History of intraocular corticosteroid treatment within 4 months prior to current
                  vitreous hemorrhage onset or after onset.

              22. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle,
                  any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or major ocular surgery
                  other than vitrectomy anticipated within the next 6 months following
                  randomization.

              23. History of vitrectomy.

              24. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to randomization.

              25. Aphakia.

              26. Uncontrolled glaucoma (in investigator's judgment).

              27. Exam evidence of severe external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis,
                  chalazion, or substantial blepharitis.
