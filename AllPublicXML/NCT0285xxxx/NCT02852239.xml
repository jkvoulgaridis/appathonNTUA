      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib and
      metabolites after a single oral dose of dabrafenib in subjects with renal impairment as
      compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function.

      This was a single-dose, open-label, parallel group single dose study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of a single oral dose of dabrafenib 100 mg in subjects with
      severe RI or ESRD compared to matched healthy subjects with normal renal function (control
      group).

      The study consisted of a screening period, a treatment period and a follow-up period.

      The Screening period started up to 28 days prior to dosing. Subjects who satisfied the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening were admitted for baseline evaluations, which was
      done locally by the investigator. In the treatment period, subjects received a single 100 mg
      oral dose of dabrafenib administered as two 50 mg capsules with a whole glass of
      non-carbonated water (approximately 240 mL) in the morning of Day 1 following an overnight
      fast (minimum 10 hours). Subjects were confined to the study facility from Day -1 to Day 5,
      for collection of serial blood and urine samples. Subjects were discharged on Day 5.

      In the follow-up period a telephone call was made to subjects 30 days post-dose to evaluate
      subject safety during the weeks after discharge from the facility. Adverse events occurring
      prior to Day 30 were followed until resolution or until judged to be permanent. Subjects
      returned to the clinic on Days 90 and 180 for the post-dose dermatological examination follow
      up.

      For this study, the terms &quot;investigational drug&quot;, &quot;study drug&quot; or &quot;study treatment&quot; refer to
      dabrafenib, administered as a single dose.
