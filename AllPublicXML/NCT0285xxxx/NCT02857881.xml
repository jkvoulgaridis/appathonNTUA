  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a symmetrical, bilateral, non-inflammatory, idiopathic corneal pathology,
      characterized by a progressive corneal thinning. This disease leads to a bombing of the
      cornea, inducing a strong corneal astigmatism, responsible for a loss of visual acuity
      sometimes very important, non-correctable by lens of glasses. Collagen Cross-Linking (CXL)
      and simple corneal de-epithelization are two common surgical technics aiming to slow the
      progression of this pathology. They consist in rigidifying the corneal structure in order to
      stabilize its deformation progression. Even though these technics are commonly performed,
      none of these strategies has proven their efficiency. The effects of CXL can be due to the
      superficial scarring reaction as well as the effects of corneal remodeling induced by the
      de-epithelization phase during a CXL procedure, and not due to the covalent links between
      collagen and fibrils, formed by the biochemical reaction resulting from the UV-A exposition
      in the presence of Riboflavine De-epithelization may be an equally effective treatment, when
      compared to CXL, but without long term secondary effects. Its association with a therapeutic
      photokeratectomy (PKT, surgical technic used to regulate the corneal surface, and eliminate
      its opacities in order to recuperate the transparency of the cornea) will aim to improve the
      regularity of the anterior corneal surface, thus allowing a better epithelial attachment
      (adhesion) and may allow a stromal inflammatory reaction, favorable to the improvement of
      corneal biomechanics. PKT is a reliable technic; however it has not yet proven its efficiency
      in the treatment of keratoconus.

      The purpose of this study is to describe the effects of de-epithelization associated with a
      therapeutic photokeratectomy in patients with evolutive keratoconus, by showing the
      proportion of patients who lost the evolutivity of their keratoconus, after 6 months and 1
      year, after an intervention of de-epithelization associated with therapeutic
      photokeratectomy.
