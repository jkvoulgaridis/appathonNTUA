  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of tiotropium +
      olodaterol fixed dose combination (FDC) compared to tiotropium monotherapy on the intensity
      of breathlessness during the 3min constant speed shuttle test (CSST).

      A secondary objective is to explore the relationship between reductions in breathlessness
      during the 3min CSST and reductions in breathlessness during activities of everyday living as
      measured by the dyspnea domain of the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) following
      bronchodilator therapy.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Intensity of Breathlessness Measured Using the Modified Borg Scale at the End of the 3 Minute (Min) Constant Speed Shuttle Test After 6 Weeks of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>At 3 min or end of exercise (if 3 min not achieved), patients were asked to estimate the intensity of breathing discomfort that they were experiencing by matching their subjective estimate to descriptive phrases that best described the intensity of each sensation using the Modified Borg Scale (MBS-S). The modified Borg scale is 10-point subjective scoring system, in which a patient rates effort of exertion while performing a particular activity. The scale is 0 to 10, the higher the score, the greater the perceived difficulty. Measure type is actually Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline After 6 Weeks of Treatment for Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire - Self Administered Individualized (CRQ-SAI) Dyspnoea Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>CRQ-SAI refers to the CRQ-Self-administered individualized format as it contains a dyspnea domain that is individualized to each patient. This version was derived from the original CRQ tool &amp; therefore, is scored on 7-point Likert-type scale (1: maximum impairment to 7: no impairment) for each 4 domains covering: dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function &amp; mastery. Dyspnea items may be selected from list of 26 suggested items or written in by the patients. The patients are asked to select up to 5 activities associated with breathlessness that they perform frequently and are most important to them. The scores for each question of each domain were added together and divided by the number of questions answered in each domain. The higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life in the respective domain. Measure type is actually Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline After 6 Weeks of Treatment for Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire - Self Administered Standardized (CRQ-SAS) Dyspnoea Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>CRQ-SAS was questionnaire to assess patients' perception of COPD and measures the impact of COPD on their life. This version was derived from the original CRQ tool &amp; therefore, is scored on 7-point Likert-type scale (1: maximum impairment to 7: no impairment) for each 4 domains covering: dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function &amp; mastery. The CRQ-SAS refers to the CRQ-Self-administered standardized format &amp; contains 20 questions. The first part of the questionnaire contains 5 standardized dyspnea questions and the patients must indicate how much shortness of breath they have experienced while performing each of these 5 activities. The scores for each question of each domain were added together and divided by the number of questions answered in each domain. The higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life in the respective domain. Measure type is actually Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, 2-period crossover, Phase IV study to evaluate the effects of once daily administration of orally inhaled tiotropium + olodaterol fixed dose combination compared with tiotropium on the intensity of breathlessness in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Patients attended specialist sites which then ensured that all patients met all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        <description>At 3 min or end of exercise (if 3 min not achieved), patients were asked to estimate the intensity of breathing discomfort that they were experiencing by matching their subjective estimate to descriptive phrases that best described the intensity of each sensation using the Modified Borg Scale (MBS-S). The modified Borg scale is 10-point subjective scoring system, in which a patient rates effort of exertion while performing a particular activity. The scale is 0 to 10, the higher the score, the greater the perceived difficulty. Measure type is actually Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline.</description>

        <description>At 1, 2 and 2.5 min during exercise, patients were asked to estimate the intensity of breathing discomfort that they were experiencing by matching their subjective estimate to descriptive phrases that best described the intensity of each sensation using the Modified Borg Scale (MBS-S). At 3 min or end of exercise (if 3 min not achieved), patients were asked to estimate the intensity of breathing discomfort that they were experiencing by matching their subjective estimate to descriptive phrases that best described the intensity of each sensation using the Modified Borg Scale (MBS-S). The modified Borg scale is 10-point subjective scoring system, in which a patient rates effort of exertion while performing a particular activity. The scale is 0 to 10, the higher the score, the greater the perceived difficulty. Measure type is actually Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline After 6 Weeks of Treatment for Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire - Self Administered Individualized (CRQ-SAI) Dyspnoea Domain Score</title>
        <description>CRQ-SAI refers to the CRQ-Self-administered individualized format as it contains a dyspnea domain that is individualized to each patient. This version was derived from the original CRQ tool &amp; therefore, is scored on 7-point Likert-type scale (1: maximum impairment to 7: no impairment) for each 4 domains covering: dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function &amp; mastery. Dyspnea items may be selected from list of 26 suggested items or written in by the patients. The patients are asked to select up to 5 activities associated with breathlessness that they perform frequently and are most important to them. The scores for each question of each domain were added together and divided by the number of questions answered in each domain. The higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life in the respective domain. Measure type is actually Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline.</description>

The CRQ-SAS refers to the CRQ-Self-administered standardized format &amp; contains 20 questions. The first part of the questionnaire contains 5 standardized dyspnea questions and the patients must indicate how much shortness of breath they have experienced while performing each of these 5 activities. The scores for each question of each domain were added together and divided by the number of questions answered in each domain. The higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life in the respective domain. Measure type is actually Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline.</description>
