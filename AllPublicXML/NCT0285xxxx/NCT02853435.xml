  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided in 2 parts. Part 1a is being conducted to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and relative bioavailability of the 2 free base tablet formulations (related
      compound [RC] and high shear wet granulation [HSWG]) compared to the reference capsule
      formulation under fasted conditions. This is a 3-period; cross-over study that will guide
      which gepotidacin formulation will be used for future studies. Following review of
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data in Part 1a, a decision will be made whether to proceed
      with Parts 1b and 2.

      Part 1b is a 2-period, cross-over study and will assess the effect of food on the PK of the
      selected gepotidacin tablet formulation from Part 1a. In Part 2, the PK of the selected
      gepotidacin tablet formulation from Part 1a in Japanese (2a) and Chinese (2b) subjects will
      be evaluated under fasted conditions.

      The duration of the study (from Screening to the Follow-up visit) will be approximately 44
      days (Part 1a), 41 days (Part 1b) and 38 days (Part 2a and 2b each), respectively. The
      approximate number of subjects enrolled in Part 1a will be 27 (9 subjects in each of the 3
      treatment sequences), 16 in Part 1b (8 subjects in each of the 2 treatment sequences) and 12
      Japanese and 12 Chinese subjects in Part 2a and 2b, respectively.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted across 2 centers in the United States from 04-August-2016 to 18-October-2017. Since the relative bio-availability of the roller compacted(RC) tablet formulation under fasted and fed conditions had been previously evaluated in Study BTZ117349 (NCT02045849), Part 1b was not conducted.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 48 participants were enrolled in the study of which 26 participants were randomized in Part 1a, 10 participants were randomized in Part 2 and 12 participants were part of Placebo-controlled Part 3.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 (Pre-dose) Extrapolated to Infinite Time (AUC [0-infinity]) of Plasma Gepotidacin for Part 1a</title>
        <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of gepotidacin were collected at Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours (Day 1), 24, 36 hours (Day 2) and 48 hours (Day 3) in Part 1a. For each sample, 3 milliliters (mL) of blood was drawn via an indwelling catheter and/or direct venipuncture into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetate anticoagulant. PK parameters were determined from the plasma concentration-time data and were calculated by standard non-compartmental analysis according to current working practices and using Phoenix WinNonlin Version 6.2.1 or higher. The PK Parameter Population consisted of all participants in the PK Population, for whom valid and evaluable PK parameters were derived. Statistics has been presented on geometric least square (LS) means.</description>

For each sample, 3 mL of blood was drawn via an indwelling catheter and/or direct venipuncture into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetate anticoagulant. PK parameters were determined from the plasma concentration-time data and were calculated by standard non-compartmental analysis according to current working practices and using Phoenix WinNonlin Version 6.2.1 or higher. Statistics has been presented on geometric LS means.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of chemistry parameters namely serum ALT, serum AP, serum AST and serum CK for Part 1a. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of hematology parameters namely blood Ery. MCHC and blood hemoglobin for Part 1a. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose-visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG Parameters PR Interval, QRS Duration, QT Interval, Corrected QT Interval Using Bazett's Formula (QTcB) and Corrected QT Interval Using Fridericia's Formula (QTcF) for Part 1a</title>
        <description>A 12 lead ECG was measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest using an ECG machine that measured PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QTcB and QTcF for Part 1a. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Urinalysis parameters assessed were urine ketones, urine glucose, urine occult blood, urine pH, urine specific gravity and urine protein. In this dipstick test, the level of ketones, glucose, occult blood, pH, specific gravity and protein in urine samples was recorded as negative trace, 1+, 3+, 5+, 6+, 7+ and 8+ (the plus sign increases with a higher level of ketones, occult blood, pH or specific gravity in the urine: 1+=slightly positive, 3+ to 5+=positive, 6+ and above=high positive). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urinalysis parameters by dipstick method up-to follow-up (5 to 7 days post last dose) in Part 1a. Only categories with significant values have been presented.</description>

        <description>Urinalysis parameters assessed were urine ketones, urine glucose, urine occult blood, urine pH, urine specific gravity and urine protein. In this dipstick test, the level of ketones, glucose, occult blood, pH, specific gravity and protein in urine samples was recorded as negative trace, 1+, 3+, 4+ 5+, 6+, 7+ and 8+ (the plus sign increases with a higher level of ketones, occult blood, pH or specific gravity in the urine: 1+=slightly positive, 3+ to 5+=positive, 6+ and above=high positive). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urinalysis parameters by dipstick method up-to follow-up (5 to 7 days post last dose) in Part 2. Only categories with significant values have been presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of chemistry parameters namely serum glucose, serum calcium, serum carbon dioxide, serum chloride, serum potassium, serum sodium and serum urea nitrogen for Part 3. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of chemistry parameters namely serum ALT, serum AP, serum AST and serum CK for Part 3. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of chemistry parameters namely serum albumin and serum protein for Part 3. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of hematology parameters namely blood basophils, blood eosinophils, blood leukocytes, blood lymphocytes, blood monocytes, blood neutrophils and blood platelets for Part 3. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters Blood Ery. MCHC and Blood Hemoglobin for Part 3</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of hematology parameters namely blood Ery. MCHC and blood hemoglobin for Part 3. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of hematology parameter namely blood Ery. MCV for Part 3. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of hematology parameter namely blood hematocrit for Part 3. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm.</description>

        <description>Single vital signs were measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest and included heart rate. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG Parameter Heart Rate for Part 3</title>
        <description>A 12 lead ECG was measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG Parameters PR Interval, QRS Duration, QT Interval, QTcB and QTcF for Part 3</title>
        <description>A 12 lead ECG was measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest using an ECG machine that measured PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QTcB and QTcF for Part 3. Baseline was defined as assessments performed on Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Values on Urinalysis by Dipstick Analysis Part 3</title>
        <description>Urinalysis parameters assessed were urine ketones, urine glucose, urine occult blood, urine pH, urine specific gravity and urine protein. In this dipstick test, the level of ketones, glucose, occult blood, pH, specific gravity and protein in urine samples was recorded as negative trace, 1+, 3+, 5+, 6+, 7+ and 8+ (the plus sign increases with a higher level of ketones, occult blood, pH or specific gravity in the urine: 1+=slightly positive, 3+ to 5+=positive, 6+ and above=high positive). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urinalysis parameters by dipstick method up-to follow-up (5 to 7 days post last dose) in Part 3. Only categories with significant values have been presented.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Values on Urinalysis by Dipstick Analysis Part 3</title>
          <description>Urinalysis parameters assessed were urine ketones, urine glucose, urine occult blood, urine pH, urine specific gravity and urine protein. In this dipstick test, the level of ketones, glucose, occult blood, pH, specific gravity and protein in urine samples was recorded as negative trace, 1+, 3+, 5+, 6+, 7+ and 8+ (the plus sign increases with a higher level of ketones, occult blood, pH or specific gravity in the urine: 1+=slightly positive, 3+ to 5+=positive, 6+ and above=high positive). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urinalysis parameters by dipstick method up-to follow-up (5 to 7 days post last dose) in Part 3. Only categories with significant values have been presented.</description>
