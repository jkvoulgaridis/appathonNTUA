    <measure>The Percentage of Patients With at Least 75% Reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI tool provides numeric scoring for a patient's overall psoriasis disease state, ranging from 0 to 72. Head (h), trunk (t), upper extremities (u) and lower extremities (l) areas were assessed; correspond to 10, 30, 20, and 40% of the total body area, respectively. The signs of severity, erythema (E), induration (I) and desquamation (D) of lesions were assessed using a numeric scale of 0 to 4 where 0 was a complete lack of cutaneous involvement and 4 was the severest possible involvement. The area of psoriatic involvement of these areas (Ah, At, Au, and Al) was given a numerical value: 0 = no involvement, 1 = &lt;10%, 2 = 10 to &lt;30%, 3 = 30 to &lt;50%, 4 = 50 to &lt;70%, 5 = 70 to &lt;90%, and 6 = 90 to 100% involvement.
PASI = 0.1(Eh+Ih+Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et+It+Dt)At + 0.2(Eu+Iu+Du)Au + 0.4(El+Il+Dl)Al.
Percentage = least squares means per treatment groups back transformed using inverse logit function.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Patients With a Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) ≤1 (Clear or Almost Clear) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) is a 5-point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the physician's assessment of the average thickness, erythema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions.
The assessment was considered &quot;static&quot;, which referred to the patient's disease state at the time of the assessment, without comparison to any of the patient's previous disease states (dynamic), whether at Baseline or at a previous visit. A lower score indicated less body coverage, with 0 being clear, 1 being almost clear, and 4 being.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Percentage of Patients Achieving a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) of 0 or 1 at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a subject-administered, 10-question, that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. It has a 1-week recall period. Every item score ranges from 0 (not relevant/not at all) to 3 (very much). Question 7 is a &quot;yes/no&quot; question where &quot;yes&quot; is scored as 3.
The DLQI total score was calculated by summing the scores of each question resulting in a range of 0 to 30 where 0-1 = no effect on subject's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on the subject's life.
The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired. If the answer to 1 question in a domain was missing, that domain was treated as missing. If 2 or more questions were left unanswered (missing), DLQI total score was treated as missing. Percentage = least squares means per treatment groups back transformed using inverse logit function.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Patients With at Least 75% Reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI tool provides numeric scoring for a patient's overall psoriasis disease state, ranging from 0 to 72. Head (h), trunk (t), upper extremities (u) and lower extremities (l) areas were assessed; correspond to 10, 30, 20, and 40% of the total body area, respectively. The signs of severity, erythema (E), induration (I) and desquamation (D) of lesions were assessed using a numeric scale of 0 to 4 where 0 was a complete lack of cutaneous involvement and 4 was the severest possible involvement. The area of psoriatic involvement of these areas (Ah, At, Au, and Al) was given a numerical value: 0 = no involvement, 1 = &lt;10%, 2 = 10 to &lt;30%, 3 = 30 to &lt;50%, 4 = 50 to &lt;70%, 5 = 70 to &lt;90%, and 6 = 90 to 100% involvement.
PASI = 0.1(Eh+Ih+Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et+It+Dt)At + 0.2(Eu+Iu+Du)Au + 0.4(El+Il+Dl)Al.

        <title>The Mean Percentage Improvement in PASI at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI tool provides numeric scoring for a patient's overall psoriasis disease state, ranging from 0 to 72. Head (h), trunk (t), upper extremities (u) and lower extremities (l) areas were assessed; correspond to 10, 30, 20, and 40% of the total body area, respectively. The signs of severity, erythema (E), induration (I) and desquamation (D) of lesions were assessed using a numeric scale of 0 to 4 where 0 was a complete lack of cutaneous involvement and 4 was the severest possible involvement. The area of psoriatic involvement of these areas (Ah, At, Au, and Al) was given a numerical value: 0 = no involvement, 1 =&lt;10%, 2 =10 to &lt;30%, 3 =30 to &lt;50%, 4 =50 to &lt;70%, 5 =70 to &lt;90%, and 6 =90 to 100% involvement.
PASI = 0.1(Eh+Ih+Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et+It+Dt)At + 0.2(Eu+Iu+Du)Au + 0.4(El+Il+Dl)Al.
Results based on PASI mean percentage improvement from Baseline after 16 weeks of treatment = overall mean + treatment group + Baseline PASI + prior exposure to a biological agent + random error.</description>

        <description>The Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) is a 5-point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the physician's assessment of the average thickness, erythema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions.
The assessment was considered &quot;static&quot;, which referred to the patient's disease state at the time of the assessment, without comparison to any of the patient's previous disease states (dynamic), whether at Baseline or at a previous visit. A lower score indicated less body coverage, with 0 being clear, 1 being almost clear, and 4 being.

        <title>The Percentage of Patients Achieving a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) of 0 or 1 at Week 16</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a subject-administered, 10-question, that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. It has a 1-week recall period. Every item score ranges from 0 (not relevant/not at all) to 3 (very much). Question 7 is a &quot;yes/no&quot; question where &quot;yes&quot; is scored as 3.
The DLQI total score was calculated by summing the scores of each question resulting in a range of 0 to 30 where 0-1 = no effect on subject's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect on the subject's life.
The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired. If the answer to 1 question in a domain was missing, that domain was treated as missing. If 2 or more questions were left unanswered (missing), DLQI total score was treated as missing.
