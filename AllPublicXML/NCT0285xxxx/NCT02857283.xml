  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Air pollutants including ozone have been implicated in affecting health outcomes. In
      particular, high level ozone exposure has been shown to affect pulmonary function and cause
      pulmonary inflammation. Troubling community-based work has implicated high ozone levels as
      being correlated with increased pediatric asthma emergency room visits. Because of adverse
      health effects, EPA standards for safe ozone levels have been set, currently at 0.07 ppm.
      Still, it is estimated that 100 million Americans live in areas where ozone levels
      periodically remain above the EPA standard. And while this EPA standard had been set based on
      available data, it remained unclear at the time whether naturalistic low-level ozone
      exposure, such as fluctuations between 0.06-0.08 ppm throughout the day, might affect health
      as well.

      This group previously examined lung function and inflammatory response in adults exposed to
      low-level ozone, 0.06 ppm exposure for 6.6 hours, while undergoing intermittent moderate
      exercise. The investigators found that in response to low-level ozone exposure (0.06 ppm)
      with exercise, lung function declines and neutrophilic airway inflammation is observed. What
      remains unclear, is whether low-level ozone alone - without exercise - will cause similar
      health effects.

      To mimic exposure to ozone on a typical summer day in a polluted city, the investigators will
      expose subjects to a varying level of ozone, form 0.06 ppm to 0.08 ppm, rather than a
      constant 0.07ppm. The variation from 0.06ppm to 0.08ppm, then back to 0.06ppm will occur each
      hour.

    <measure>% Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes (PMN) in Nasal Lavage Fluid: Change Immediately Post Exposure From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be exposed to either filtered air (FA), then ozone (O3), or O3, then FA. Nasal lavage fluid (NLF) will be collected from participants at a baseline visit within two weeks prior to each exposure, and at the following time points for each exposure: immediately after exiting the exposure chamber, and at 24 hours after the exposure.
The % PMN as a percentage of total inflammatory cells (total of monocytes and macrophages, PMN, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells) will be determined in each NLF collection by differential counts of cells on cytospin slides. The change in the values from baseline to immediately Post-Exposure will be calculated for each participant for each exposure. Values will be compared between FA and O3.</description>

    <measure>Left Ventricular Strain (LVS): Change Immediately Post-Exposure From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Left ventricular strain will be assessed at baseline prior to exposure (within two weeks), and immediately after the exposure by measuring global longitudinal strain (GLS), an echocardiographic measure of myocardial mechanics. GLS is measured using speckle tracking, a technique by which small myocardial footprints, or speckles, are tracked over the cardiac cycle to enable quantification of left ventricular systolic function. GLS is more sensitive than traditional measures of ventricular function, such as ejection fraction, in detecting clinically inapparent but prognostically important decrements in contractility. The change in global longitudinal strain will be calculated to determine the effect of ozone on left ventricular strain.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening visit and immediately post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>RNA isolated from nasal epithelial cell biopsies collected at the screening visit within six weeks prior to the first exposure and immediately after each exposure. RNA will be analyzed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to determine the impact of O3 on inflammatory gene expression. Gene expression has not yet been analyzed as of March 31, 2020 as it has been delayed by shutdown of the university laboratories due to the pandemic, and will be not be performed until after the reopening of the university.</description>

    <measure>Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD): Change Immediately Post-Exposure From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo assesment of flow-mediated brachial artery dilation by brachial ultrasound at baseline prior to exposure (within two weeks), and immediately after exposure to either FA or O3 to assess the impact of O3 exposure on endothelial function. Flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery (FMD) is a noninvasive index of vascular endothelial function. FMD is measured using high-frequency ultrasound, and is expressed as the percent change in arterial diameter in response to the reactive hyperemia induced by 5 minutes of forearm ischemia. Impaired endothelial function leads to atherosclerosis and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.</description>

        <title>% Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes (PMN) in Nasal Lavage Fluid: Change Immediately Post Exposure From Baseline</title>
        <description>Participants will be exposed to either filtered air (FA), then ozone (O3), or O3, then FA. Nasal lavage fluid (NLF) will be collected from participants at a baseline visit within two weeks prior to each exposure, and at the following time points for each exposure: immediately after exiting the exposure chamber, and at 24 hours after the exposure.
The % PMN as a percentage of total inflammatory cells (total of monocytes and macrophages, PMN, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells) will be determined in each NLF collection by differential counts of cells on cytospin slides. The change in the values from baseline to immediately Post-Exposure will be calculated for each participant for each exposure. Values will be compared between FA and O3.</description>

        <title>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) Concentrations in Nasal Epithelial Lining Fluid (ELF): Change Immediately Post-Exposure From Baseline</title>
        <description>Participants will be exposed to either filtered air (FA), then ozone (O3), or O3, then FA. Nasal epithelial lining (ELF) will be collected from participants at a baseline visit within two weeks prior to each exposure, and at the following time points for each exposure: immediately after exiting the exposure chamber, and at 24 hours after the exposure.
The IL-6 concentration will be determined in each ELF sample by immunoassay. The change in IL-6 concentrations from baseline to immediately Post-Exposure will be calculated for each participant for each exposure. Values will be compared between FA and O3 to determine the effect of ozone on the production of nasal IL-6.</description>

        <description>Participants will be exposed to either filtered air (FA), then ozone (O3), or O3, then FA. Induced sputum will be collected from participants after inhaled hypertonic saline. Induced sputum will be collected at the screening visit within six weeks prior to the first exposure, and at 24 hours after each exposure.
The % PMN as a percentage of total inflammatory cells (total of monocytes and macrophages, PMN, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells) will be determined in each induced sputum collection by differential counts of cells on cytospin slides. The change in the values from baseline to 24 hours Post-Exposure will be calculated for each participant for each exposure. Values will be compared between FA and O3.</description>

        <title>Interleukin-8 (IL-8) Concentrations in Nasal Epithelial Lining Fluid (ELF): Change 24 Hours Post-Exposure From Baseline</title>
        <description>Participants will be exposed to either filtered air (FA), then ozone (O3), or O3, then FA. Nasal epithelial lining (ELF) will be collected from participants at baseline within two weeks prior to first exposure, and at the following time points for each exposure: immediately after exiting the exposure chamber, and at 24 hours after the exposure.
The IL-8 concentration will be determined in each ELF sample by immunoassay. The change in IL-8 concentrations from baseline to 24 hours Post-Exposure will be calculated for each participant for each exposure. Values will be compared between FA and O3 to determine the effect of ozone on the production of nasal IL-8.</description>

        <title>Left Ventricular Strain (LVS): Change Immediately Post-Exposure From Baseline</title>
        <description>Left ventricular strain will be assessed at baseline prior to exposure (within two weeks), and immediately after the exposure by measuring global longitudinal strain (GLS), an echocardiographic measure of myocardial mechanics. GLS is measured using speckle tracking, a technique by which small myocardial footprints, or speckles, are tracked over the cardiac cycle to enable quantification of left ventricular systolic function. GLS is more sensitive than traditional measures of ventricular function, such as ejection fraction, in detecting clinically inapparent but prognostically important decrements in contractility. The change in global longitudinal strain will be calculated to determine the effect of ozone on left ventricular strain.</description>

        <title>Nasal Epithelial Cell Inflammatory Cytokine Gene Expression: : Change Immediately Post-Exposure From Screening Visit</title>
        <description>RNA isolated from nasal epithelial cell biopsies collected at the screening visit within six weeks prior to the first exposure and immediately after each exposure. RNA will be analyzed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to determine the impact of O3 on inflammatory gene expression. Gene expression has not yet been analyzed as of March 31, 2020 as it has been delayed by shutdown of the university laboratories due to the pandemic, and will be not be performed until after the reopening of the university.</description>

        <title>Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD): Change Immediately Post-Exposure From Baseline</title>
        <description>Participants will undergo assesment of flow-mediated brachial artery dilation by brachial ultrasound at baseline prior to exposure (within two weeks), and immediately after exposure to either FA or O3 to assess the impact of O3 exposure on endothelial function. Flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery (FMD) is a noninvasive index of vascular endothelial function. FMD is measured using high-frequency ultrasound, and is expressed as the percent change in arterial diameter in response to the reactive hyperemia induced by 5 minutes of forearm ischemia. Impaired endothelial function leads to atherosclerosis and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.</description>
