      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase Ib/II study to exploratively evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of BBI608 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal
      cancer (CRC) not responded to or intolerant of standard chemotherapy.The same analysis will
      be performed for the additional cohort to the Phase II part, consisting of patients with
      metastatic CMS 1 or 4, MMS, CRC not responsive to or intolerant of standard chemotherapy.
