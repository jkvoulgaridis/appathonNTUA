  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis can affect organs other than the lungs. Liver disease affects about 30% of
      patients: its main manifestation is the development of portal hypertension (PHT). The
      pathophysiology of this comorbidity is still poorly understood. It was previously considered
      secondary to the formation of biliary cirrhosis but another hypothesis would be that of a
      primitive pathology of venous vessels may cause the gradual emergence of portal hypertension
      without cirrhosis. Evidence indiscutly suggest that cystic fibrosis is associated with a
      specific endothelial dysfunction, especially as the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
      conductance Regulator) protein is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. The
      investigators hypothesize that liver disease related to PHT−associated cystic fibrosis is
      associated with systemic endothelial dysfunction.

      The aim is:

      To demonstrate a systemic endothelial dysfunction in patients with cystic fibrosis when
      associated with PHT.

      To study the correlations between measures of systemic endothelial function and serum markers
      of endothelial dysfunction and between measures of liver stiffness and systemic endothelial
      function.

      Prospective , monocentric study, with four groups of patients:

        -  Patients with cystic fibrosis and PHT

        -  Cystic fibrosis patients without PHT

        -  Patients free from cystic fibrosis with PHT from other causes

        -  Healthy controls. One study visit, no follow-up.

      During the visit the following examinations will be performed:

        -  Collection of a blood sample of 21 mL.

        -  Liver eElastography achieved through hardware FibroScan® -

        -  Measurement of endothelial function with Endopat®

        -  Contrast−enhanced tomography. Abdominal CT scan will not be performed in healthy
           volunteers.

    <measure>Endothelial systemic function measured by EndoPAT®</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the systemic endothelial function between the four study groups, the arterial tone index is measured by EndoPAT®.
The EndoPAT® is the leading medical device for noninvasive endothelial function assessment. It quantifies the endothelium-mediated changes in vascular tone, elicited by a 5-minute occlusion of the brachial artery (using a standard blood pressure cuff). When the cuff is released, the surge of blood flow causes an endothelium-dependent. Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD). The dilatation, manifested as Reactive Hyperemia, is captured by EndoPAT® as an increase in the PAT Signal amplitude. A post-occlusion to pre-occlusion ratio is calculated by the EndoPAT® software, providing the arterial tone index.</description>

    <measure>Serum levels of markers of endothelial dysfunction (tPA, thrombomodulin, Willebrandt factor, PAI1)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Blood sample (21 ml) is collected from each patients to dose the markers of endothelial dysfunction (tPA, thrombomodulin, Willebrandt factor, PAI1).
The objective is to compare for the 4 groups the relations between:
the serum levels of markers of endothelial dysfunction and peripheral endothelial function;
And the serum levels of markers of endothelial dysfunction and the presence of portal hypertension (HTP).</description>

    <measure>Endogline/Syndecan-4 ratio measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Blood sample (21 ml) is collected from each patients to measure the blood levels of endoglin and syndecan.
Endoglin and syndecan-4 are transmembrane glycoproteins present on endothelial cells.
The objective is to compare for the 4 group the relation between :
endoglin/syndecan-4 ratio and peripheral endothelial function;
and, endoglin/syndecan-4 ratio and presence of HTP.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of hepatic elasticity by Fibroscan®</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The objective is to compare for the 4 groups the relations between hepatic elasticity and endothelial systemic function.
The Fibroscan measures the velocity of the sound wave passing through the liver from the device and then converts that measurement into a liver elasticity measurement. The result reveals the health of the liver: more the liver is hard, more his state is pathologic.</description>

    <measure>Hepatic abnormalities observed on injected abdominal CT.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>All hepatic abnormalities observed on injected abdominal CT for groups A, B and C are analyzed.
The objective is to compare the hepatic radiologic abnormalities associated with HTP in cystic fibrosis with hepatic radiologic abnormalities associated with HTP from other causes.</description>
