      Prospective randomized clinical study comparing SIGNUS MOBIS PEEK vs SIGNUS MOBIS II ST in
      patients with Degenerative Disc Disease at one or two contiguous levels from L2-S1
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol includes skeletally mature patients both male and female, 18 to 89 years old,
      with degenerative disc disease (DDD) at one or two contiguous levels from L2-S1. DDD is
      defined as discogenic back pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by patient history
      and radiographic studies. Patients may also have up to a Grade I spondylolisthesis or
      retrolisthesis at the involved level(s). Patient should have completed at least six (6)
      months of non-operative treatment. Patients may have had a previous non-fusion surgery at the
      involved spinal level(s) and will be followed clinically up to two years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has symptomatic degenerative disc disease (DDD) at one or two contiguous
             levels from L2-S1.

          2. The patient has documented conservative (non-operative) treatment for at least 6
             months.

          3. The patient has a VAS back pain of ≥ 60 mm.

          4. The patient has an ODI ≥ 40%.

          5. The patient is at least 18 years of age and skeletally mature.

          6. The general condition of the patient is appropriate for surgery, as evaluated by the
             Investigator.

          7. The patient is willing and able to comply with study requirements.

          8. The patient has agreed to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:
