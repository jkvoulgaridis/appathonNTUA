      This study will evaluate the use of hydrogel electrode pads (rather than tap water baths) to
      deliver iontophoresis treatment using a traditional iontophoresis device. Participants will
      treat one hand with the hydrogel-based iontophoresis device and leave the other hand
      untreated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palmar hyperhidrosis affects 4.3 million Americans and results in substantial quality of life
      impairment. Treatment options for palmar hyperhidrosis include antiperspirants, systemic
      anticholinergic agents, botulinum toxin injections, and iontophoresis. Standard iontophoresis
      involves submerging the hands in tap water through which current is applied to the palms for
      30 minutes per day up to 3 times per week. While effective, treatment adherence rates are
      low.

      This study will evaluate the use of hydrogel electrode pads (rather than tap water baths) to
      deliver iontophoresis treatment using a traditional iontophoresis device. Hydrogel electrode
      pads permit improved mobility and hand functionality during iontophoresis treatment sessions.
