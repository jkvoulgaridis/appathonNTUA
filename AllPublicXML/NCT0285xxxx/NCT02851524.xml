  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls in the elderly population are a major public health problem because of their frequency
      and their consequences, notably in terms of dependence their cost to society. In most cases,
      balance disorders related to an impaired vestibular system are blamed, even though there is
      no formal evidence that this is the case.

      Vestibular tests in routine otoneurological practice are based on the exploration of
      vestibulo-ocular or even vestibulo-cortical reflexes. They are not particularly suitable to
      screen for vestibular disorders in falls.

      A prototype rocking chair has been developed to test psycho-vestibular pathways, defined as
      the pathways via which vestibular afferents are transported to the subject's conscience.
      Thanks to this apparatus, a stimulus of body movement will be generated, but with limited
      tactile, visual and proprioceptive afferents, in such a way that the vestibular system alone
      is able to indicate to subjects their position in space. The subject will be required to
      detect oscillatory movement, and then to distinguish between a vestibular stimulus and a
      pulsed auditory stimulus.

      The study hypothesis is that the movement stimulation generated by our prototype will be
      sufficient to stimulate the vestibular system, which will manifest itself as a conscious
      sensation of movement and by a vestibulo-ocular reflex causing oculomotor manifestations.
