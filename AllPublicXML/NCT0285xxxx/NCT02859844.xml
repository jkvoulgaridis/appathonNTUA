  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with neurological diseases suffer from neurogenic lower urinary tract
      dysfunction (NLUTD), which often severely impairs quality of life, due to urinary urgency
      with or without incontinence and voiding dysfunction. In addition, the upper urinary tract
      may be jeopardized because of high intravesical pressure caused by detrusor overactivity with
      concurrent detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergia and/or low bladder compliance. The treatment of
      NLUTD is a challenge since conventional conservative therapies often fail and more invasive
      treatments such as intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA injections, bladder augmentation and
      urinary diversion have to be considered. Neuromodulation therapies including tibial nerve
      stimulation (TNS) may be alternative non-invasive treatment options. Indeed, TNS is an
      effective and safe treatment for idiopathic overactive bladder proven in randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs), but its value in neurological patients is unclear. In a recent
      systematic review, the investigators found evidence that TNS might become a promising
      treatment option for NLUTD, however, more reliable data from well-designed RCTs are urgently
      needed to reach definitive conclusions. However, the investigators study will be the first
      adequately sampled and powered, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial assessing
      transcutaneous TNS (TTNS) for NLUTD. This trial will provide significant insights into the
      efficacy of TTNS in patients suffering from NLUTD and in the case that this treatment is
      really effective in the neurological population, the investigators findings would completely
      revolutionize the management of NLUTD in daily clinical practice. Moreover, this
      interdisciplinary trial will relevantly influence the neurological and urological approach in
      the management of NLUTD promoting future collaborative projects improving patients' medical
      care and underlying the pioneering role of Switzerland in the rapidly developing and
      ambitious research field of neuro-urology.
