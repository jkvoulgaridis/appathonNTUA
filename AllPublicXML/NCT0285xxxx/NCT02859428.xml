      Background:

      Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) usually progresses slowly. Researchers want to learn more
      about how its symptoms change over time. They want to look for changes in the blood and cells
      of people with the most common forms of HSP that might allow them to better understand the
      disease.

      Objectives:

      To learn more about common forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia and find out how it
      progresses over time.

      Eligibility:

      People age 7 and older with SPG3A, SPG4A, or SPG31

      Design:

      Participants will have 1 two-hour visit each year for up to 5 years.

      At 1 visit, adult participants may have a skin biopsy. An area of skin will be numbed then a
      tool will remove a small piece of skin.

      At all visits, all participants will have a physical exam and blood drawn.

      At all visits, participants will do a few tasks like walking quickly and climbing stairs.

      Participants can give permission for their skin cells, DNA samples, and data to be used in
      other studies. The samples and data will have no identifying information.

    <textblock>
      The Neurogenetics Branch (NGB) within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
      Stroke (NINDS) is conducting a study to evaluate patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia
      types 3A, 4 and 31. The objective of this study is to understand disease progression in these
      closely related forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia using validated rating scales such as
      the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS), and Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire Short
      Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). We also hope to develop biomarkers that could be used in
      future treatment trials from human serum and by utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) to determine central motor conduction times and resting motor thresholds.

      OBJECTIVES

      The primary objective of this protocol is to study the natural history of the most common
      forms of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia. The information obtained from
      validated rating scales (SPRS and SF-36), TMS, and serum biomarkers, will allow for the
      development of treatment trials. In some cases, blood or other biologic samples (including
      skin biopsies) will be obtained for future laboratory studies.

      STUDY POPULATION

      The number of participants to be enrolled will be set to 300.

      DESIGN

      This is an observational study of autosomal dominant forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia
      progression, pathophysiology, and biomarkers.

      OUTCOME MEASURES

      In this study we will track disease progression using the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale
      (SPRS) and SF-36. Also, we will measure levels of plasma lipids, insulin, leptin, and of
      certain micro RNAs to investigate their utility as biomarkers. We will utilize TMS (combined
      with nerve conducting studies) to assess central motor conduction times (CMCT) and resting
      motor thresholds (RMT).
