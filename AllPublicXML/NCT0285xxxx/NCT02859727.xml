  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide long-term CDZ173 treatment, a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, to
      the patients with genetically activated PI3Kδ, i.e., patients with APDS/PASLI who
      participated in the CCDZ173X2201 study or who were treated previously with PI3Kδ inhibitors
      other than CDZ173. The study is open-label designed to establish the long-term safety,
      tolerability, efficay and pharmacokinetics of CDZ173 in the target population.
