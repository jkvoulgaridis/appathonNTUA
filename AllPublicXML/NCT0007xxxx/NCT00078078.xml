    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) to learn more about the
      genetic causes of the various types of this inherited metabolic disorder and the medical
      complications associated with it. People with MMA may have problems with learning and
      development and kidney malfunctioning. They can become seriously ill, sometimes with little
      warning. There is no cure for any MMA, but special diets and vitamin therapies are used for
      treatment.

      Patients between 2 and 70 years of age with MMA may be eligible for this study. Participants
      are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 4-5 days each year for 5-10 years for the
      following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history, physical examination, eye examination

        -  Consultations from dentists and specialists in the nervous system, digestive tract,
           endocrine, and kidney, as needed.

        -  24-hour urine collection to examine for methylmalonic acid, other acids, sugar, and
           proteins for measuring kidney function.

        -  Blood test to assess liver and thyroid function, blood counts and blood chemistries,
           methylmalonic acid levels, and for genetic tests and basic research studies.

        -  Blood test to measure growth hormone production. For this test, a very small amount of
           blood is collected overnight (every 20-30 minutes from 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM) through an
           intravenous catheter (plastic tube placed in a vein). The total amount of blood drawn is
           approximately 1 tablespoon. Patients who have stopped growing or whose weight does not
           permit collection of 1 tablespoon of blood do not undergo this procedure.

        -  Frequent blood pressure measurements, including overnight monitoring

        -  Skin biopsy for cell culture (cells to grow in the laboratory for future testing). For
           this procedure, an area of skin is numbed with an anesthetic such as lidocaine. A 4-mm
           diameter circular area is then removed using a sharp punch and scissors. The wound is
           dressed and usually heals within a week.

        -  Photographs of the face and body (wearing underwear) to help track growth and
           appearance.

        -  Ultrasound of the kidneys

        -  Hand x-ray to determine bone age

        -  Dual energy x-ray absorptionometry (DEXA) scan to assess bone density. For the DEXA
           scan, the patient lies still on a table while the spine and hip are scanned using a
           small amount of radiation.

      Any patient who becomes seriously ill during the evaluation may be cared for at the NIH or
      transferred to another hospital if it is deemed advisable.

    <textblock>
      Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), one of the most common inborn errors of organic acid
      metabolism, is heterogeneous in etiology and clinical manifestations. Affected patients with
      cblA, cblB and mut classes of MMA are medically fragile and can suffer from complications
      such as metabolic stroke or infarction of the basal ganglia, pancreatitis, end stage renal
      failure, growth impairment, osteoporosis, and developmental delay. The frequency of these
      complications and their precipitants remain undefined. Furthermore, current treatment
      protocol outcomes have continued to demonstrate substantial morbidity and mortality in the
      patient population. Increasingly, solid organ transplantation (liver, and/or kidney) has been
      used to treat patients. Disordered transport and intracellular metabolism of vitamin B12
      produces a distinct group of disorders that feature methylmalonic acidemia as well as
      (hyper)homocysteinemia. These conditions are named after the corresponding cellular
      complementation class (cblC, cblD, cblF, cblJ and cblX) and are also heterogenous, clinically
      and biochemically. The genetic disorders underlying cblE and cblG feature an isolated
      impairment of the activity of methionine synthase, a critical enzyme involved in the
      conversion of homocysteine to methionine and these disorders feature

      (hyper)homocysteinemia. Lastly, a group of patients who have increased methylmalonic acid
      and/or homocysteine in the blood caused by urine or by mutation(s)in recently identified
      (ACSF3) and unknown genes.

      In this protocol, we will clinically evaluate patients with methymalonic acidemia and
      cobalamin metabolic defects. Routine inpatient admissions will last 4-5 days and involve
      urine collection, blood drawing, ophthalmological examination, radiological procedures,
      MRI/MRS, skin biopsies in some, and developmental testing. In a subset of patients who have
      or will receive renal, hepato- or hepato-renal transplants or have an unusual variant or
      clinical course and have MMA, a lumbar puncture to examine CSF metabolites will be performed.
      In this small group of patients, CSF metabolite monitoring may be used to adjust therapy.

      The study objectives will be to further delineate the spectrum of phenotypes associated with
      these enzymopathies, query for genotype/enzymatic/phenotype correlations and search for new
      genes in rare families that have evidence for an unknown class of methylmalonic acidemia
      and/or homocysteinemia. The population will consist of patients previously evaluated at NIH,
      physician referrals, and families directed to the study from clinicaltrials.gov as well as
      the Organic Acidemia Association. Most patients will be evaluated only at the NIH Clinical
      Center. However, if the NIH team decides that a patient under the age of 2 years is a
      candidate subject for this research protocol, that patient may enroll at the Children s
      National Medical Center (CNMC) site, pending approval by Dr Chapman, the Principal
      Investigator of the CNMC location. Outcome measures will largely be descriptive and encompass
      correlations between clinical, biochemical and molecular parameters.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients of any gender, ethnicity, and age over 2 years of age with methylmalonic acidemia
        and cobalamin disorder are eligible to enroll in this protocol at the NIH Clinical Center.
        Affected individuals under the age of 2 years may be evaluated at Children s National
        Medical Center (CNMC) as part of an evolving agreement in the Translational Program in
        Pediatrics, if they are deemed eligible for participation by the NIH team and the CNMC
        team. Patients will be diagnosed based on a determination of MMA and homocysteine levels in
        plasma and urine. Most will have their complementation class known or pending. Molecular
        genetic analyses to determine mutations will be expected to have been performed prior to
        acceptance into the study. Some patients who have not yet had this laboratory test will be
        admitted to the protocol based upon metabolic parameters and clinical history. This latter
        category of patients might include individuals with a suspected genetic but unknown type of
        MMA.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The PI/AI may decline to enroll a patient for reasons such as being medically unstable,
        residing in a hospital, sub-optimal metabolic control or for any concerns arising after
        review of the laboratory and clinical data; any patient who requires dialysis once or
        more/week and weighs &lt;40 kg, any patient who is being treated for an intercurrent infection
        with antibiotics or has evidence of an acute infection and has metabolic symptoms, any
        patient who does not have a regular/local metabolic, genetic or endocrine physician and/or
        a family physician, pediatrician, or internist, and any patient who may be metabolically
        unstable but not acutely ill; and any patient or family who may not be able to institute
        recommendations for appropriate testing and care before visiting the NIH. Each family may
        be contacted by the NIH team one week prior to a pending inpatient admission to confirm
        that the patient is metabolically stable and ready to visit the NIH in a state of relative
        health, with an adequate supply of special formulas, medications, supplements, and if
        needed, medical equipment such as feeding pumps and replacement parts for feeding tubes. A
        subset of participants will be enrolled in the tissue collection part of the study only
        (i.e. if they are too sick to travel).

        Pregnant women may be eligible to enroll in the study if they are affected with
        methylmalonic acidemia or a cobalamin disorder or are family members of an affected
        subject. Pregnant women are not excluded because it is important to learn more about the
        effects of this disorders in pregnant participants. This research involves no more than
        minimal risk to the fetus. Affected subjects who are pregnant or become pregnant during
        their participation on the study will not be withdrawn, but will be excluded from some
        procedures until the pregnancy is concluded. Affected subjects who are pregnant may undergo
        procedures as part of their clinical care, including

        blood draws, genetic studies, and consultations, according to the clinical judgement of the
        clinical team. Pregnant participants will be excluded from some procedures such as stable
        isotope, GFR testing, DEXA, X-rays and MRI until the pregnancy is concluded.

        Patients with methylmalonic acidemia or cobalamin disorders of any age, gender and
        ethnicity, undergoing a transplantation surgery at Children s Hospital of Pittsburgh, are
        eligible to participate in the tissue collection arm of the study. Pregnant women will be
        excluded from tissue collection at the Children s Hospital of Pittsburgh.

        For the healthy volunteers, eligibility criteria include individuals that are age 18 and
        over. Exclusion criteria include: women who are pregnant, individuals being treated with
        antibiotics, individuals with kidney or liver disease, individuals on a special diet such
        as a high protein diet or taking protein supplements and individuals with severe
        claustrophobia or other anxiety disorders.
