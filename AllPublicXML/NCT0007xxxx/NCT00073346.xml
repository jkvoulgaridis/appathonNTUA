  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compulsive hoarding is characterized by excessive acquisition of possessions, difficulty
      discarding possessions, and excessive clutter. This condition is resistant to standard
      pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions that have proven effective in treating
      other obsessive compulsive spectrum disorders. This study aimed to determine the
      effectiveness of a specialized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) designed for treating
      hoarding symptoms.

      This study consists of three phases. In Phase 1, pilot data from previous studies were
      examined to develop an intervention suitable for use in a waitlist trial. In Phase 2, pilot
      study information were used to develop and test a treatment manual for compulsive hoarding.
      During this phase, treatment was applied flexibly to allow for variations in treatment
      duration and choice of techniques. During Phase 3, participants were randomly assigned to 26
      weekly sessions of CBT or to a 12-week wait-list control, followed by active treatment for a
      fixed duration of 26 sessions. Therapist adherence and competence were assessed through
      audiotaped therapy sessions.
