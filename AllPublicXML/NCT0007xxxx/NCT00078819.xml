    <textblock>
      On enrollment, participants underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or
      etanercept during the initial double-blind period. Participants could enter an escape group
      and receive open-label etanercept until week 12 if, at or after week 4, their Psoriasis Area
      and Severity Index (PASI) score either increased by more than 50% over baseline and by a
      minimum of 4 points at one visit or increased by more than 25% and by a minimum of 4 points
      at each of two consecutive visits.

      During the open-label treatment period, all patients (including those who entered the escape
      group) received open-label etanercept. Participants who did not achieve PASI 50 at week 24 or
      PASI 75 at week 36 could discontinue the study or add topical standard-of-care therapy
      (low-to-moderate-potency topical corticosteroids) and continue to receive open-label
      etanercept until week 48.

      At week 36, participants with PASI 50 at week 24 or PASI 75 at week 36 were randomly assigned
      to placebo or etanercept for 12 weeks in the withdrawal period. Participants in whom PASI 75
      was lost resumed open-label etanercept through week 48 in the re-treatment period.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a ≥ 75% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Score (PASI 75) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who achieved 75% or greater improvement (decrease) from baseline in PASI score after 12 weeks of treatment. The PASI score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) scored on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.
Participants who entered the escape arm or had missing data at week 12 were considered non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is a static measurement based on induration, erythema, and scaling. The sPGA is assessed on a scale from 0 to 5:
0 = clear (no evidence of plaque elevation, erythema or scaling)
= almost clear (minimal plaque elevation, erythema or scaling)
= mild (mild plaque elevation or scaling, light red coloration)
= moderate (moderate plaque elevation, scaling, light red coloration)
= marked (marked plaque elevation, thick, non-tenacious scale predominates, bright red coloration)
= severe (severe plaque elevation, very thick tenacious scaling, dusky to deep red coloration).
Participants who entered the escape arm or had missing data at week 12 were considered non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Percent Improvement From Baseline in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) was used to assess the impact of psoriasis on subject health-related quality of life. The CDLQI has 10 items assessing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with skin disease each measured on a scale from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Very much). The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating better quality of life. If participants were ≥ 13 years old, the text instrument was completed by the participants themselves. Participants ≥ 8 but &lt; 13 years old used the cartoon version of the instrument and participants ≤ 7 years old used the cartoon version of the instrument completed with help from the parents or caregivers.
Percent improvement from baseline = (Baseline Value - Post-baseline Value) / Baseline Value * 100.
Participants who entered the escape arm or who had missing data at week 12 were considered to have 0% improvement from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who achieved 90% or greater improvement from baseline in PASI score after 12 weeks of treatment. The PASI score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) scored on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events During the Double-blind Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The severity assessment for adverse events and infections was done using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 2.0, where Grade 0 = no toxicity, Grade 1 = mild toxicity, Grade 2 = moderate toxicity, Grade 3 = severe toxicity, Grade 4 = life-threatening toxicity.
Serious adverse events were any events that suggested a significant hazard or side effect, regardless of the investigator's or sponsor's opinion on the relationship to study medication. These included, but were not limited to, events at any dose that were fatal, life threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, were a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or were a congenital abnormality/birth defect. Medical events that jeopardized a participant, required intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes, or resulted in urgent investigation could be considered serious.</description>

          <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) scored on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.</description>

        <description>The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) was used to assess the impact of psoriasis on subject health-related quality of life. The CDLQI has 10 items assessing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with skin disease each measured on a scale from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Very much). The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating better quality of life. If participants were ≥ 13 years old, the text instrument was completed by the participants themselves. Participants ≥ 8 but &lt; 13 years old used the cartoon version of the instrument and participants ≤ 7 years old used the cartoon version of the instrument completed with help from the parents or caregivers.
Percent improvement from baseline = (Baseline Value - Post-baseline Value) / Baseline Value * 100.
Participants who entered the escape arm or who had missing data at week 12 were considered to have 0% improvement from baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a ≥ 90% Improvement in PASI Score (PASI 90) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants who achieved 90% or greater improvement from baseline in PASI score after 12 weeks of treatment. The PASI score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) scored on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.
Participants who entered the escape arm or had missing data at week 12 were considered non-responders.</description>

Serious adverse events were any events that suggested a significant hazard or side effect, regardless of the investigator's or sponsor's opinion on the relationship to study medication. These included, but were not limited to, events at any dose that were fatal, life threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, were a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or were a congenital abnormality/birth defect. Medical events that jeopardized a participant, required intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes, or resulted in urgent investigation could be considered serious.</description>

          <description>Serum concentrations for etanercept were measured by using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.627 ng/mL.</description>
          <population>Participants assigned to etanercept at any time during the study, with available data.
Week 12 excludes participants assigned to placebo who escaped to etanercept. Week 48 includes participants randomized to etanercept at week 36 and remaining on etanercept to week 48. Participants randomized to placebo and retreated with etanercept are excluded.</population>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
