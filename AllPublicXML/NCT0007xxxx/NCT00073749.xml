    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 42 days after last dose of study drug (up to Day 225)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as any new event reported after first dose of study drug up to 42 days after last dose of study drug, or any event that is worse in severity than at any time during the baseline period. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious adverse events (non-SAEs).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher Grades Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Based on Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 42 days after last dose of study drug (up to Day 225)</time_frame>
    <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AE severity was defined to be the maximum toxicity grade of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) experienced by the participants during the study. AE was assessed according to severity; Grade 1 (mild AE), Grade 2 (moderate AE), Grade 3 (severe AE), Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling AE), Grade 5 (death related to AE). Participants with Grade 3 or higher grades TEAEs were reported.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD): Part 1 (Dose Escalation Cohorts)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>MTD was defined as highest dose level for which no more than 1 participant in a dose cohort experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT was defined as any of the following events occurring during the first 21 days (or 28 days for participants treated every 4 weeks) days of study medication and considered at least possibly-related to study medication: any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity except grade 3 alopecia, nausea, or vomiting, any grade 4 febrile neutropenia, any grade 4 thrombocytopenia or any bleeding episode requiring platelet transfusion, any grade 4 absolute neutrophil count (for a duration of greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 7 days), delayed recovery (less than or equal to [&lt;=] grade 1 or baseline) from a toxicity that delays the initiation of the next dose by more than 2 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>DLT was classified as per National Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0 and defined as any of the following events occurring during the first 21 days (or 28 days for participants treated every 4 weeks) days of study medication and considered at least possibly-related to study medication: any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity except grade 3 alopecia, nausea, or vomiting, any grade 4 febrile neutropenia, any grade 4 thrombocytopenia or any bleeding episode requiring platelet transfusion, any grade 4 absolute neutrophil count (for a duration of greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 7 days), delayed recovery (less than or equal to [&lt;=] grade 1 or baseline) from a toxicity that delays the initiation of the next dose by more than 14 days.</description>

    <description>PFS was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. PFS was defined as the time interval from the first dose of study medication until the first date on which relapsed disease, or progression (as per the International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma) or death, was documented, censored at the last tumor evaluation date. This outcome measure was analyzed in participants with follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>The study was conducted in 2 parts. Part 1: Dose escalation cohorts of inotuzumab ozogamicin to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) included 21 days and 28 days dose administration cycles. Part 2: Expanded cohort using the MTD regimen identified in Part 1.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as any new event reported after first dose of study drug up to 42 days after last dose of study drug, or any event that is worse in severity than at any time during the baseline period. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious adverse events (non-SAEs).</description>
