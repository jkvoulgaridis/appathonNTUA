  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of post-operative pain in patients after vaginal surgery provides many
      unforeseen challenges. Although vaginal surgery is considered a minimally invasive approach
      for the repair of pelvic floor prolapse and urinary incontinence, patients may still
      experience varying degrees of discomfort and post-operative pain. Narcotics, however, can
      introduce a host of problems in addition to the potential addictive properties of the
      medication. A vicious cycle ensues as patients seek better pain control at the expense of
      worsening constipation, but without adequate control of pain after surgery, voiding
      dysfunctions are often exaggerated.

      Cyclobenzaprine (FlexerilÂ®) in conjunction with NSAIDs has long been the basis for management
      of acute musculoskeletal injuries, but the practice of prescribing this centrally acting
      muscle relaxant for post-operative patients has also been successful in the management of
      pain.

      An online search of medical databases revealed that there are currently no published
      retrospective or prospective studies determining the efficacy of cyclobenzaprine in post
      surgical patients in conjunction with traditional pain management. The investigators
      hypothesize among healthy patients undergoing elective vaginal surgery for pelvic organ
      prolapse, the short-term use of a muscle relaxant could reduce the spasticity of the pelvic
      floor muscle attributable to surgery and thereby reduce the use of narcotics. Consequently,
      the reduction of narcotics and the control of post-surgical pain may also hasten the return
      of normal urinary and defecatory function.
