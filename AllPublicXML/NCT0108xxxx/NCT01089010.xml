  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover
      study of CK-2017357 in patients with ALS. 36 to 72 patients will be randomized to one of six
      different treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence consists of three dosing periods; in
      each dosing period¸ patients receive a single oral dose of placebo, 250 mg of CK-2017357, or
      500 mg of CK-2017357. All six treatment sequences will enroll approximately the same number
      of patients. A washout period of at least 6 days (to a maximum of 10 days) will be employed
      between the doses for each patient. This study is designed to assess the effect of CK-2017357
      on maximal voluntary muscle strength, on the development of fatigue at maximal and
      sub-maximal voluntary muscle contraction, and on selected pulmonary function parameters. The
      plasma concentration of CK-2017357 will be measured at selected time points after each of two
      single doses of CK-2017357 in men and women. The plasma concentration versus time data
      obtained in this study may be used to develop a population PK model and estimate
      inter-subject variability of PK parameters in this target patient population, in particular
      between male and female study patients.

          1. A diagnosis of familial or sporadic ALS (defined as meeting the possible,
             laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS
             according to the World Federation of Neurology El Escorial criteria) (Brooks, Miller
             et al. 2000)

          2. Males or females 18 years of age or older

          4. Maximum voluntary grip strength in at least one hand between 10 and 40 pounds
             (females) or 10 and 60 pounds (males)

          5. Able to swallow capsules with water

          6. Upright Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) &gt; 40% of predicted for age, height, and sex [See
             Appendix 16.6.1]

          7. Able to perform pulmonary function tests

          8. Pre-study clinical laboratory findings (including troponin I [TnI] and creatine
             phosphokinase [CPK]) within normal range, or, if outside of the normal range, deemed
             not clinically significant by the Investigator

          9. For female patients only: The patient is post-menopausal (≥ 1 year) or sterilized, or
             if she is of childbearing potential, she is not breastfeeding, her pregnancy test is
             negative, she has no intention to become pregnant during the course of the study, and
             she is using contraceptive drugs or devices for the duration of the study and for 10
             weeks after the end of the study.

        For male patients only: Male patients agree for the duration of the study and 10 weeks
        after the end of the study to use a condom during sexual intercourse with female partners
        who are of reproductive potential and to have female partners use an additional effective
        means of contraception (e.g., diaphragm plus spermicide or oral contraceptives) or the male
        patient must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse for 10 weeks after the end of the
        study.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients satisfying any of the following criteria at baseline were excluded from
        enrollment:

          1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 3 times the upper
             limit of normal (ULN)

          2. Life expectancy &lt; 3 months

          3. Participation in any trial in which receipt of investigational study drug occurred
             within 30 days prior to dosing

          4. Any prior treatment with CK-2017357

          5. In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient is not suitable to participate in the
             study
