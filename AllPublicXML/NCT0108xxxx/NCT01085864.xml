    <textblock>
      A need exists for non-invasive testing to aid in clinical decision-making for Computerized
      Tomography (CT) scan detected lung nodules of indeterminate etiology. The investigators
      hypothesize that biomarkers detectable in blood, sputum or urine may be useful for guiding
      clinical decisions in the setting of CT detected lung nodules to determine which nodules are
      malignant and which are benign. The investigators also hypothesize that these biomarkers will
      decrease in concentration to the normal range after successful surgical treatment of
      malignant lung nodules.

    <textblock>
      The Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Lung Nodules Study is a prospective study of a cohort of 500
      individuals with lung nodules of indeterminate etiology that are identified by CT scans.
      Either biopsy or repeat CT scans must be clinically indicated to determine the etiology of
      the nodule. Patients will be asked to allow investigators access to CT scan images and
      spirometry data, and provide blood, sputum, urine, and exhaled breath samples over the course
      of the study. Patients will also be asked to allow investigators to access pathology records
      if a biopsy or surgical excision of the nodule is clinically indicated.

          2. Patients referred to pulmonologists, oncologists, or thoracic surgeons for the
             evaluation of peripheral lung nodules found on CT scan.

          3. Repeat CT scans, biopsy or surgical excision are clinically indicated to determine the

          5. Patients must be fully informed of the investigational nature of the procedure and
             sign an informed consent.

          3. Lung nodules or masses with CT evidence of partial or complete obstruction of a lobar
             bronchus, main stem bronchus or the trachea.
