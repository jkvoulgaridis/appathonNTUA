  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc-PAH) is a serious,
      life-threatening manifestation of systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune disease of the
      connective tissue characterized by scarring (fibrosis) and atrophy of the skin, joints and
      tendons, skeletal muscles, and internal organs, and immunological disturbances. One-year
      survival for patients with SSc-PAH ranges from 50-81%. There is currently no cure for SSc-PAH
      and treatment is limited to vasodilator therapy used in all forms of PAH. In recent studies,
      immunotherapy was shown to be effective in treating SSc-interstitial lung disease, another
      serious, life-threatening manifestation of SSc. In addition, there are compelling
      pre-clinical data and anecdotal clinical reports that suggest modulation of the immune system
      may be an effective strategy for treating SSc-PAH. To test this approach, this trial will
      determine if rituximab, an immunotherapy, has a marked beneficial effect on clinical disease
      progression, with minimal toxicity, in patients with SSc-PAH when compared to placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, randomized trial will
      evaluate the effect of rituximab on disease progression in subjects with SSc-PAH receiving
      concurrent stable-dose standard medical therapy with a prostanoid, endothelin receptor
      antagonist, and/or phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. The study will focus on assessment
      of clinical response and safety measures longitudinally. In addition, the effects of
      treatment with rituximab on the underlying immune mechanisms associated with B-cell
      dysregulation and pathogenic autoantibody response in this disease will be investigated. 1000
      mg of rituximab or placebo will be administered as two IV infusions given two weeks apart.
      Clinical assessments and sample collection will occur at monthly visits through Week 48. If a
      participant has not recovered B cells by Week 48, B cell studies will be conducted quarterly
      until reconstitution is documented or for 2 years after initial treatment.

      This trial will include a sub-study, entitled &quot;Right Ventricular Response to Rituximab in
      Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension - A Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      Sub-study&quot; (RESTORE Sub-study). The objective of the RESTORE sub-study is to evaluate the
      therapeutic effect of rituximab on the right ventricle of patients with SSc-PAH. Changes in
      right ventricular end diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) and stroke volume (SV) determined by
      cardiac MRI will be used as surrogates of right ventricle function and prognosis. Enrollment
      for the RESTORE sub-study will parallel that of main trial. Twenty patients from each
      treatment arm, distributed among all participating sites, will be recruited for this
      sub-study. Each patient will be studied at baseline (i.e. prior to initiation of study drug)
      and after 24 weeks or at time of discontinuation. In addition to the data collection and
      testing specified in the main trial, participants in RESTORE will undergo comprehensive
      cardiac MRI evaluation. All main trial study inclusion and exclusion criteria apply, as well
      as additional exclusion criteria that pertain only to the RESTORE sub-study: 1) known
      hypersensitivity to Gadolinium; 2) inability to tolerate or cooperate with MRI; 3) morbid
      obesity; and 4) presence of metallic objects or pacemakers.

    <description>The SF-36 is a quality of life assessment that that will be performed at Baseline, Week 24 and Week 48. Eight scale scores are derived from responses to the 36 items of the SF-36 questionnaire which are combined to produce the Physical Component Score and the Mental Component Score. The Physical Component Score is based on the Physical Functioning Scale (10 items), the Role-Physical Scale (4 items), the Bodily Pain Scale (2 items), and the General Health Scale (5 items). The Mental Component Score is based upon the Vitality Scale (4 items), the Social Functioning Scale (2 items), the Role-Emotional Scale (3 items) and the Mental Health Scale (5 items). Each component score is transformed into a 0-100 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Participant Quality of Life Using the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>This is a patient self-administered health assessment questionnaire. The SHAQ-DI assesses five scleroderma-specific visual analogue scale (VAS) items to explore the impact of participant's disease. These items were developed to measure the effect of scleroderma on five elements of disease that could have a great impact on a participant's daily activities. Each VAS item is rated separately (0−100 millimeters [mm]), with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The five items are: 1) intestinal disease, 2) breathing problem, 3) Raynaud syndrome, 4) finger ulcers, and 5) overall disease. The measure produces a discrete value that can change through time and in response to medication.</description>
