      The investigators hypothesis are as follows:

      H1a: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform cognitive training (CT) will demonstrate greater
      objective improvements on standard (untrained) neurocognitive measures, with the largest
      gains in verbal memory, learning and sustained attention.

      H1b: Objective cognitive improvements in CT participants will be sustained at three months
      post-intervention, suggesting persistence of neuroplasticity-based cognitive training
      benefits.

      H2a: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform CT will report greater improvements in cognitive
      function.

      H2b: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform CT will demonstrate improved social and
      occupational functioning and quality of life.

      H2c: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform CT will demonstrate greater improvements in
      community reintegration.

      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)-related cognitive dysfunction is well-described and has
      been associated with specific impairments in verbal memory, learning, attention and emotional
      regulation, deficits which have been correlated with abnormalities in specific brain regions.
      Both PTSD and cognitive dysfunction have been associated with impairments in social and
      occupational functioning and may contribute to operational or battlefield errors, soldiers'
      safety and threaten the success of military operations. In addition, following military
      service separation, PTSD-related cognitive impairment adversely impacts quality of life,
      readjustment, and community reintegration. A computerized neuroplasticity-based auditory
      cognitive training program (Plasticity-Based Adaptive Cognitive Remediation, Posit Science,
      San Francisco, CA) has been shown in several randomized controlled trials to improve verbal
      memory, attention, cognitive control, quality of life and daily function in
      community-dwelling elders and individuals with schizophrenia. To our knowledge however, there
      have been no studies of cognitive remediation training in individuals with PTSD. Therefore,
      the overall aim of this proposal was to investigate the efficacy of neuroplasticity-based
      auditory cognitive training in Veterans with PTSD and cognitive dysfunction. The primary
      specific aim of this pilot study was to examine change in objective cognitive function in
      Veterans with PTSD and cognitive dysfunction who participated in an open-label trial of an
      auditory cognitive training program. Our secondary aim was to examine change in self-reported
      cognitive function, social and occupational functioning, quality of life and community
      reintegration in Veterans with PTSD who participate in auditory CT. Finally, we evaluated the
      feasibility and usability of home-based computerized auditory cognitive training in Veterans
      with PTSD and cognitive dysfunction. We enrolled subjects in a program of 3 months of
      auditory cognitive training (CT) followed by 3 months of no contact. We assessed
      participants' change scores on neuropsychological outcome measures from pre- to
      post-treatment using reliable change indicators. We utilized qualitative thematic analysis to
      identify themes from participants about the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the
      treatment. Information derived from this pilot study may be used to inform future cognitive
      training interventions for Veterans.

    <description>We presented change scores (6-month scores minus baseline scores) outcomes of 10 measures of neurocognitive measures (together with ranges): the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-IV) Paired Associates immediate and delayed memory (range: 1-19), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) total score (range: 0-100) and delayed score (range: 0-20), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) Digit Span (range: 0-48), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) Letter Number Sequencing (range: 1-19), Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT) raw score (range: 0-60), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Stroop Inhibition (range: 1-19), and the Brief Visual Memory Test revised (BVMT-R) total T score and Delayed T score (range: 20-80). Higher scores mean better cognitive functioning outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To measure social and occupational functioning, we used the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF) validated to detect intervention-related change in quality of life.
Range of post-treatment domain scores:
WHOQOL physical domain: 7-35; WHOQOL psychological domain: 6-30; WHOQOL social relationships domain: 2-10; WHOQOL environment domain: 8-40.
Higher scores indicate better quality of life outcomes.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  An experienced clinical interviewer with Master's-level training will conduct first-
             and second-level screening to determine study eligibility for enrollment in the
             randomized controlled trial.

          -  The First-Level Eligibility Screen will be conducted by phone and will apply the
             following inclusion criteria in an effort to recruit a homogeneous sample:

               1. Confirmed OEF and/or OIF military service

               2. Male veterans, ages 18 to 40 years with 12 to 16 years of education

               3. History of a prior positive PTSD screen or diagnosis either by SFVAMC study
                  referral or self-report'

               4. Able and willing to travel to SFVAMC

               5. Able and willing to perform daily home-based computer exercises for three months.

          -  The Second Level Eligibility Determination will occur in-person at the SFVAMC of
             potential participants who have met first-level screening eligibility criteria.
             Second-level eligibility screening will require signed informed consent (see below)
             before the second-level screening is conducted. During the second-level eligibility
             screen, consenting participants will be administered:

               1. The Clinician-Administered PTSD screen (CAPS) and the Mini International
                  Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 29 to assess for Diagnostic and Statistical
                  Manual (DSM)-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders

               2. The VA TBI second-level screen [TBI event history and Neurobehavioral Symptom
                  Inventory (NSI) for cognitive symptoms].30

          -  To be eligible for enrollment in the randomized controlled, veterans at second-level
             screening must:

               1. Meet threshold criteria for current full or sub-syndromal PTSD by DSM-IV criteria
                  31

               2. Report â‰¥ 1 moderate or severe cognitive symptom(s) on the NSI that interfere(s)
                  with daily function including moderate to severe poor concentration,
                  forgetfulness, difficulty making decisions and slowed thinking.

          -  Because PTSD is a highly comorbid condition, eligible participants may have other
             comorbid stable neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression or a history of a
             mild traumatic brain injury.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The following exclusion criteria will apply to first-level screening:

               1. Poor English comprehension and fluency

               2. Unstable medical condition, injury or disability, including moderate to severe
                  TBI (by self-report) and hearing impairment

               3. Current (or past 60 day) evidence-based PTSD or cognitive remediation therapy; in
                  contrast, stable supportive therapy for PTSD and/or other mental disorders, such
                  as group therapy or on stable psychoactive medication (&gt; 30 days) will be
                  acceptable.

          -  The following exclusion criteria will apply to second-level screening:

               1. Drug and alcohol dependence and other unstable serious mental illness (e.g.
                  psychosis) (assessed using the MINI)

        <description>To measure social and occupational functioning, we used the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF) validated to detect intervention-related change in quality of life.
Range of post-treatment domain scores:
WHOQOL physical domain: 7-35; WHOQOL psychological domain: 6-30; WHOQOL social relationships domain: 2-10; WHOQOL environment domain: 8-40.
Higher scores indicate better quality of life outcomes.</description>
