  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of this antibody in
      participants with rheumatoid arthritis.

      Part A of the study is an initial dose escalation phase

      Part B of the study is a randomized allocation of the entire dosing group to parallel
      treatment assignments

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 98</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically significant events were defined as serious AEs (SAEs) and other non-serious AEs regardless of causality. A summary of s SAEs and other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration Time Curve at Steady State for One Dosing Interval Time 0 to 168 Hours (AUC0-168 hr,ss) of LY2189102</measure>
    <time_frame>Part A: Day 1 predose and IAI, 2days post infusion, Day 14 and Day 28 predose and IAI, Day 35, 63 (convenient time)</time_frame>
    <description>AUC0-168 hr,ss of individual participants was calculated by equation AUC=Dose/Clearance (CL), where the CL was estimated using a population PK model.
Time frame for Part B: Day 1 predose, immediately after infusion (IAI), Day 14 and 28: predose and IAI, and Day 63 (Convenient time);</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Simple Disease Activity Index Score (SDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 7, 21, 35, 63, and 98</time_frame>
    <description>SDAI is calculated as the sum of 5 components: tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC), Patient Global Assessment (PtGA) of disease activity visual analog scale (VAS) and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA) VAS, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Total Score scale range is 0 (remission) to 86 (high disease activity). A negative change from baseline indicated an improvement. Least Squares (LS) mean calculated using a repeated measures model and adjusted for baseline + treatment + time + treatment * time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28-Joint Count (DAS28)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 7, 21, 35, 63, and 98</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-4 (crp) is a modification of the original DAS based on TJC and SJC based on 28 joint counts, PGA VAS. DAS28-4 (crp) calculated as: 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC)+0.28*sqrt(SJC)+0.36*ln(CRP+1)+0.014*PGA+0.96. Scores ranged from 1.0-9.4, where lower scores indicated less disease activity. A decrease in DAS28-CRP indicated an improvement in participant's condition.
LS mean calculated using a repeated measures model and adjusted for baseline + treatment + time + treatment * time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in C-Reactive Protein (CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 63, and 98</time_frame>
    <description>CRP is a biomarker associated with inflammation and structural damage. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. LS mean calculated using a repeated measures model and adjusted for baseline + treatment + time + treatment * time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 35, 63, and 98</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ was a participant-reported questionnaire that consisted of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty), and 3 (unable to do). The highest score for any question in a category was the score of that category unless special aids or devices or help from another person was required. Answers for at least 6 of the 8 disability domains were required to compute the participant's HAQ score. If the participant had scores for fewer than 6 categories, the HAQ score was considered missing. The HAQ score was calculated as the sum of the category scores divided by the number of categories scored, with a possible scores range from 0 to 3. Negative mean changes from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28-Joint Count (DAS28)</title>
        <description>DAS28-4 (crp) is a modification of the original DAS based on TJC and SJC based on 28 joint counts, PGA VAS. DAS28-4 (crp) calculated as: 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC)+0.28*sqrt(SJC)+0.36*ln(CRP+1)+0.014*PGA+0.96. Scores ranged from 1.0-9.4, where lower scores indicated less disease activity. A decrease in DAS28-CRP indicated an improvement in participant's condition.
LS mean calculated using a repeated measures model and adjusted for baseline + treatment + time + treatment * time.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Score</title>
        <description>HAQ was a participant-reported questionnaire that consisted of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty), and 3 (unable to do). The highest score for any question in a category was the score of that category unless special aids or devices or help from another person was required. Answers for at least 6 of the 8 disability domains were required to compute the participant's HAQ score. If the participant had scores for fewer than 6 categories, the HAQ score was considered missing. The HAQ score was calculated as the sum of the category scores divided by the number of categories scored, with a possible scores range from 0 to 3. Negative mean changes from baseline indicated improvement.</description>
