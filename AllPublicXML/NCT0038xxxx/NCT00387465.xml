  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of azacitidine when given
      together with entinostat and to see how well they work in treating patients with recurrent
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Azacitidine and entinostat may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving azacitidine together
      with entinostat may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety, characterize toxicities, and determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      5-AZA (azacitidine) with a fixed-dose of entinostat in patients with recurrent advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase I) II. To determine the objective response rate of
      5-AZA and entinostat in patients with recurrent NSCLC. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of 5-AZA and entinostat in patients with
      recurrent NSCLC.

      II. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of 5-AZA and entinostat on deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) methylation, histone acetylation, and gene re-expression in patients with recurrent
      NSCLC through analysis of blood, sputum and tissue biopsies.

      III. To explore the effect of 5-AZA and entinostat on progression-free and overall survival
      in patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      IV. To explore the differing response rates and progression-free survivals of two schedules
      of 5-AZA and entinostat in patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of azacitidine followed by an
      open-label, phase II study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-6 and 8-10 and entinostat orally
      (PO) on days 3 and 10. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

          <title>Major Objective Response After Immediate Subsequent Therapy as Measured by Number of Participants With PR, SD, PD After at Least 1 Cycle of Subsequent Chemotherapy</title>
          <description>Number of participants with progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), or partial response (PR), as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0) after at least 1 cycle of subsequent chemotherapy. Per RECIST 1.0, progression is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; PR is defined as &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
          <population>Only participants who received 40mg/m2 azacitidine and at least 1 cycle of subsequent chemotherapy (19 participants) were assessed for this outcome measure. Therefore, data was not collected from the participants in the 30mg/m2 arm from Phase I. However, 2/19 deceased prior to imaging and therefore were not evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>
