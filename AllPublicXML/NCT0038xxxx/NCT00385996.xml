  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if Tarceva® (erlotinib) is effective in shrinking
      tumors. A high resolution CT scan (CT scanner that can view 3 dimensional images of the
      tumor) will be used to measure the tumor before and after treatment with Tarceva®(erlotinib)
      . This type of CT scan will measure the tumor by volume and by standard measurement (length
      and width). Both methods will be compared to find out whether standard measurement or
      measurement by tumor volume is more accurate.

    <textblock>
      Tarceva® (erlotinib) is a drug that blocks a receptor called the Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR) on certain cells including tumor cells. Blocking this receptor has been shown
      to shrink tumors in some patients. Tarceva®(erlotinib) is approved for commercial use by the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) after
      failure of at least one chemotherapy treatment. However, it is not approved for the first
      treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), which is the treatment used in this study.

      Patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer will receive daily Tarceva® (erlotinib)
      at 150 mg/day for 3 weeks followed by surgical resection at week 4. High resolution CT scans
      for tumor response assessment will be obtained at baseline and after 3 weeks of treatment
      with Tarceva® (erlotinib). Post-operative 2-year treatment with Tarceva® (erlotinib) will be
      offered to patients who had at least a 50% (half) decrease in size of their tumor after
      treatment with Tarceva® (erlotinib)and/or patients with tumors that were found to have the
      receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), on their tumor cells at the time of their
      surgery.

      Post-operative chemotherapy will be administered at the discretion of the treating physician
      to patients with stages IB and II. Patients who receive post-operative chemotherapy will
      begin Tarceva (erlotinib)no sooner than 3 weeks from Day 1 of the last chemotherapy cycle and
      no longer than 6 months after surgery. Follow-up for recurrence and survival will continue
      for 2 years.
