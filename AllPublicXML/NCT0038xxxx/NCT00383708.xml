    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of the co-administration of lanreotide
      Autogel 120 mg (administered via deep sub-cutaneous injections every 28 days) and pegvisomant
      (administered at 40 to 120 mg per week via sub-cutaneous injection given once or twice a
      week) on IGF-1 levels over 28 weeks in acromegalic patients. The primary endpoint will be the
      percentage of acromegalic patients with normalised (age and sex adjusted) IGF-1 level at the
      end of the co-treatment period.

    <time_frame>V3 (Week 12; Baseline) up to V11 (Week 44)</time_frame>
    <description>The ACROQoL is a health-related quality of life (QoL) questionnaire for patients with acromegaly consisting of 22 items measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale that assesses frequency of occurrence (always to never) or degree of agreement (completely agree to completely disagree) with the statements. The ACROQoL consists of questions that evaluate physical (8 items) and psychological aspects related to appearance and personal relations (7 items each). Answers are transformed to a percentage value, where 100 is the maximal (best) and 0 the minimum (worse) score depicting self-perceived quality QoL. An increase in ACROQoL score is associated with an improved QoL. The change in ACROQoL global score, physical and psychological dimension scores and appearance and personal relationships sub-dimension scores from Baseline to V11 and to LVA are presented. Relnship = Relationship; Dim = Dimension.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was a multicentre, open, single arm, sequential study where subjects were recruited to 25 study centres across 10 European countries. Subjects were enrolled to the study from 02 October 2006 (first subject enrolled) until 27 October 2008 (last subject completed).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 125 patients were screened. Subjects were assigned to treatment if they met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. 92 subjects received treatment during the run-in period and 57 subjects received treatment during the co-administration period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>All Subjects</title>
          <description>Subjects confirmed as eligible for the study were entered into a run-in period of 16 weeks during which they received one deep subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 28 days. If after completion of the run-in period, subjects met the eligibility criteria for levels of serum IGF-1 (and serum growth hormone [GH] nadir), they were entered into the co-administration period during which they received both lanreotide Autogel and pegvisomant concomitantly for 28 weeks. The lanreotide Autogel dose during the co-administration period was fixed at 120 mg. Pegvisomant was administered once or twice a week via s.c. injection and the dose of could be adapted every 8 weeks based on insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, following a starting dose of 60 mg once a week (dose could vary from 40 to 120 mg per week and maximum permitted dose was 60 mg twice a week).</description>

          <description>Eligible subjects were entered into the co-administration period during which they received both lanreotide Autogel and pegvisomant concomitantly for 28 weeks. The lanreotide Autogel dose during the co-administration period was fixed at 120 mg and was administered by one deep s.c. injection every 28 days. Pegvisomant was administered once or twice a week via s.c. injection. The starting dose was 60 mg once a week dose. Dose adaptation of pegvisomant could then be made every 8 weeks based on IGF-1 levels taken 4 weeks after previous dose adaptation and by the third titration, subjects could receive either 40 mg, 60 mg or 80 mg once a week or 40 mg or 60 mg twice per week.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With Acromegaly With a Normalised (Age and Sex Adjusted) IGF-1 Level at the End of the Co-administration Period</title>
        <description>Serum IGF-1 is a well known and validated marker of acromegaly. IGF-1 assessments were performed at Visit (V) 1, V2, V3, V5, V7, V9 and V11 (or in case of premature study discontinuation, at the early withdrawal visit) and were based on a single serum sample taken in fasting conditions, prior to investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration. Percentage of subjects with a normalised (age and sex adjusted) IGF-1 level at the end of the co-administration period are presented. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used to replace missing IGF-1 values.</description>

        <population>The ITT population was defined as all co-administered subjects (treated with at least one dose of each of the two IMPs within the co-administration period) having at least one baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint.</population>

            <description>Eligible subjects were entered into the co-administration period during which they received both lanreotide Autogel and pegvisomant concomitantly for 28 weeks. The lanreotide Autogel dose during the co-administration period was fixed at 120 mg and was administered by one deep s.c. injection every 28 days. Pegvisomant was administered once or twice a week via s.c. injection. The starting dose was 60 mg once a week dose. Dose adaptation of pegvisomant could then be made every 8 weeks based on IGF-1 levels taken 4 weeks after previous dose adaptation and by the third titration, subjects could receive either 40 mg, 60 mg or 80 mg once a week or 40 mg or 60 mg twice per week.</description>

The lanreotide Autogel dose during the co-administration period was fixed at 120 mg and was administered by one deep s.c. injection every 28 days. Pegvisomant was administered once or twice a week via s.c. injection. The starting dose was 60 mg once a week dose. Dose adaptation of pegvisomant could then be made every 8 weeks based on IGF-1 levels taken 4 weeks after previous dose adaptation and by the third titration, subjects could receive either 40 mg, 60 mg or 80 mg once a week or 40 mg or 60 mg twice per week.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were entered into the co-administration period during which they received both lanreotide Autogel and pegvisomant concomitantly for 28 weeks. The lanreotide Autogel dose during the co-administration period was fixed at 120 mg and was administered by one deep s.c. injection every 28 days. Pegvisomant was administered once or twice a week via s.c. injection. The starting dose was 60 mg once a week dose. Dose adaptation of pegvisomant could then be made every 8 weeks based on IGF-1 levels taken 4 weeks after previous dose adaptation and by the third titration, subjects could receive either 40 mg, 60 mg or 80 mg once a week or 40 mg or 60 mg twice per week.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Acromegaly Quality of Life (ACROQoL) Assessments During the Co-administration Period</title>
        <description>The ACROQoL is a health-related quality of life (QoL) questionnaire for patients with acromegaly consisting of 22 items measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale that assesses frequency of occurrence (always to never) or degree of agreement (completely agree to completely disagree) with the statements. The ACROQoL consists of questions that evaluate physical (8 items) and psychological aspects related to appearance and personal relations (7 items each). Answers are transformed to a percentage value, where 100 is the maximal (best) and 0 the minimum (worse) score depicting self-perceived quality QoL. An increase in ACROQoL score is associated with an improved QoL. The change in ACROQoL global score, physical and psychological dimension scores and appearance and personal relationships sub-dimension scores from Baseline to V11 and to LVA are presented. Relnship = Relationship; Dim = Dimension.</description>
        <time_frame>V3 (Week 12; Baseline) up to V11 (Week 44)</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population was defined as all co-administered subjects (treated with at least one dose of each of the two IMPs within the co-administration period) having at least one baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint. Only evaluable subjects with assessments at each specified visit included in analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Serum GH Levels During the Co-administration Period</title>
        <description>Serum samples were assessed for GH levels at the same timepoints as the IGF-1 sample at V1 and V2 and during the OGTT (non diabetic subjects only) at V3 and V11 (or at the early withdrawal visit in case of premature discontinuation). Five samples were taken over 2 hours in order to assess GH nadir and confirm the subject's eligibility before entering the co-administration period. For diabetic subjects, the OGTT was replaced by a measurement of GH level on a blood sample taken at the same time as IGF-1 at V3 and V11 (or at the early withdrawal visit). The change in mean serum GH levels from Baseline to V11 and to LVA is presented.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were entered into the co-administration period during which they received both lanreotide Autogel and pegvisomant concomitantly for 28 weeks. The lanreotide Autogel dose during the co-administration period was fixed at 120 mg and was administered by one deep s.c. injection every 28 days. Pegvisomant was administered once or twice a week via s.c. injection. The starting dose was 60 mg once a week dose. Dose adaptation of pegvisomant could then be made every 8 weeks based on IGF-1 levels taken 4 weeks after previous dose adaptation and by the third titration, subjects could receive either 40 mg, 60 mg or 80 mg once a week or 40 mg or 60 mg twice per week.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were entered into the co-administration period during which they received both lanreotide Autogel and pegvisomant concomitantly for 28 weeks. The lanreotide Autogel dose during the co-administration period was fixed at 120 mg and was administered by one deep s.c. injection every 28 days. Pegvisomant was administered once or twice a week via s.c. injection. The starting dose was 60 mg once a week dose. Dose adaptation of pegvisomant could then be made every 8 weeks based on IGF-1 levels taken 4 weeks after previous dose adaptation and by the third titration, subjects could receive either 40 mg, 60 mg or 80 mg once a week or 40 mg or 60 mg twice per week.</description>

        <description>Glucose tolerance was only evaluated in non diabetic subjects. Glucose tolerance was assessed based on measurement of fasting blood glucose and insulin levels taken at V2 and OGTT performed at V3 and V11 (or in case of premature study discontinuation, at the early withdrawal visit). A dose of 75 g oral glucose was given to subjects and blood samples then taken at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after oral glucose to measure glucose, insulin and GH levels, and to evaluate the GH nadir level. The OGTT was performed after the assessment of IGF-1 and all safety laboratory tests, but before IMPs administration at V3. Glucose, insulin and GH levels were assessed before OGTT in fasting conditions and at the same time as IGF-1 assessment. The change in mean blood glucose Cmax (as determined from OGTT) from Baseline to V11 and to LVA is presented.</description>

          <description>Glucose tolerance was only evaluated in non diabetic subjects. Glucose tolerance was assessed based on measurement of fasting blood glucose and insulin levels taken at V2 and OGTT performed at V3 and V11 (or in case of premature study discontinuation, at the early withdrawal visit). A dose of 75 g oral glucose was given to subjects and blood samples then taken at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after oral glucose to measure glucose, insulin and GH levels, and to evaluate the GH nadir level. The OGTT was performed after the assessment of IGF-1 and all safety laboratory tests, but before IMPs administration at V3. Glucose, insulin and GH levels were assessed before OGTT in fasting conditions and at the same time as IGF-1 assessment. The change in mean blood glucose Cmax (as determined from OGTT) from Baseline to V11 and to LVA is presented.</description>
          <population>The Safety population was defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of each IMP during the co-administration period (i.e. one dose of lanreotide Autogel 120 mg and one dose of pegvisomant). Assessed in non diabetic subjects only (n = 38). Only evaluable subjects with an assessment at the specified visit were included in the analysis.</population>

            <description>Eligible subjects were entered into the co-administration period during which they received both lanreotide Autogel and pegvisomant concomitantly for 28 weeks. The lanreotide Autogel dose during the co-administration period was fixed at 120 mg and was administered by one deep s.c. injection every 28 days. Pegvisomant was administered once or twice a week via s.c. injection. The starting dose was 60 mg once a week dose. Dose adaptation of pegvisomant could then be made every 8 weeks based on IGF-1 levels taken 4 weeks after previous dose adaptation and by the third titration, subjects could receive either 40 mg, 60 mg or 80 mg once a week or 40 mg or 60 mg twice per week.</description>
