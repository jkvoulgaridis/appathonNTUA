  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the objective response rate (complete and
      partial response) for participants who receive tasisulam after one prior systemic treatment
      for unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive a 2-hour intravenous infusion of study drug (tasisulam) once every
      28 days. Radiological imaging scans will be performed before the first dose of study drug and
      then after every other treatment. Participants will be assessed for clinical progression at
      every visit and for response approximately every 56 days (every other cycle).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Complete Response + Partial Response)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Measured Progressive Disease (up to 60 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants achieved an objective response if they had a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1), CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to &lt;10 mm, the disappearance of all non-target lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. For each participant who is not known to have died or to have had objective progression of disease as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, duration of tumor response was to be censored at the date of the participant's last objective tumor assessment prior to that cut-off date.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Measured Progressive Disease or Death from Any Cause (up to 42 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from baseline until measured PD or death from any cause, whichever is first. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1), PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the 20% relative increase, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). The appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions was also considered progression. Participants without objectively determined PD, who were alive at the end of the follow-up period (or lost to follow-up), were censored on the date of the participant's last complete radiographic tumor assessment; if no baseline or post-baseline radiologic assessment was available, the participant was censored at the date of randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) (Clinical Response Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (up to 60 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants achieved disease control if they had a best overall response of PR, CR or SD. According to RECIST v1.1, CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to &lt;10 mm, the disappearance of all non-target lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal [ULN]); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started. Clinical Response Rate was calculated as the number of participants who were free from progression (CR+PR+SD) for ≥2 cycles/number of participants who received at least 1 dose of tasisulam.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Death from Any Cause (up to 42 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as time from baseline to the date of death from any cause. Participants who were alive at the end of the follow-up period (or lost to follow-up) were censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Overall Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of Response to Date of Measured PD (up to 1 Year)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of response was measured from the date of CR or PR to first date of documented PD or death and was censored at the date of the last assessment for responders who remained alive and did not have documented PD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Stable Disease (SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (up to 1 Year)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study. SD is measured at the start of the study drug until progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever is first. Censoring occurred if a participant did not have a complete baseline disease assessment, initiated on another anti-cancer therapy (censored at the date of the last complete objective progression-free disease assessment before initiation of the new therapy), was not known to have died or had objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With One or More Serious Adverse Event(s) (SAEs) Considered by the Investigator to be Related to Study Drug Administration (Safety: Adverse Events)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Study Completion (up to 60 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Data presented are the number of participants who experienced SAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study drug administration. A summary of SAEs and all other non-serious Adverse Event(s) (AEs), regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Complete Response + Partial Response)</title>
        <description>Participants achieved an objective response if they had a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1), CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to &lt;10 mm, the disappearance of all non-target lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. For each participant who is not known to have died or to have had objective progression of disease as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, duration of tumor response was to be censored at the date of the participant's last objective tumor assessment prior to that cut-off date.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from baseline until measured PD or death from any cause, whichever is first. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1), PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the 20% relative increase, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). The appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions was also considered progression. Participants without objectively determined PD, who were alive at the end of the follow-up period (or lost to follow-up), were censored on the date of the participant's last complete radiographic tumor assessment; if no baseline or post-baseline radiologic assessment was available, the participant was censored at the date of randomization.</description>

          <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
          <description>PFS was defined as the time from baseline until measured PD or death from any cause, whichever is first. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1), PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the 20% relative increase, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). The appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions was also considered progression. Participants without objectively determined PD, who were alive at the end of the follow-up period (or lost to follow-up), were censored on the date of the participant's last complete radiographic tumor assessment; if no baseline or post-baseline radiologic assessment was available, the participant was censored at the date of randomization.</description>

        <description>Participants achieved disease control if they had a best overall response of PR, CR or SD. According to RECIST v1.1, CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to &lt;10 mm, the disappearance of all non-target lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal [ULN]); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started. Clinical Response Rate was calculated as the number of participants who were free from progression (CR+PR+SD) for ≥2 cycles/number of participants who received at least 1 dose of tasisulam.</description>

          <description>Duration of SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study. SD is measured at the start of the study drug until progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever is first. Censoring occurred if a participant did not have a complete baseline disease assessment, initiated on another anti-cancer therapy (censored at the date of the last complete objective progression-free disease assessment before initiation of the new therapy), was not known to have died or had objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for analysis.</description>
          <population>All participants who received at least one dose of study drug. Participants censored: Tasisulam Target Cmax 420 µg/mL = 6, Tasisulam Target Cmax 360 µg/mL = 5, Albumin-Tailored Dose = 5.</population>
