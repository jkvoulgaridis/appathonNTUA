  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a stepped-care intervention makes pain symptoms
      better and reduces activity limitations because of pain. Our two primary hypotheses are that
      in OIF/OEF veterans with chronic pain:

        1. Stepped care is more effective than usual care in reducing pain-related disability

        2. Stepped care is more effective than usual care in reducing psychological distress
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through the Evaluation of Stepped Care for Chronic Pain (ESCAPE) trial we aim to develop and
      test a stepped-care intervention to improve functional and work-related outcomes in Operation
      Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain.
      Stepped-care involves starting with lower intensity, less costly treatments initially (Step
      1) and &quot;stepping up&quot; to more intensive, costly, or complex treatments in patients with
      inadequate response (Step 2). The study design will be a randomized controlled trial. The
      stepped care approach will involve 12 weeks of a pain self-management program in Step 1
      followed by 12 weeks of brief cognitive behavioral therapy in participants with inadequate
      improvement in pain-related disability (Step 2). Patients treated in usual care will be the
      control group. Thus, the primary objective of the ESCAPE trial is to conduct a randomized
      controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of a stepped care intervention vs. usual care
      in OIF/OEF veterans with chronic and disabling musculoskeletal pain and evaluate the impact
      of this intervention on pain-related disability, work function, psychological distress, and
      secondary outcomes.

    <measure>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 24-item pain specific disability questionnaire consisting of 24 questions which are related specifically to physical functions that are likely to be affected by back pain. The questionnaire is scored by adding up the number of items checked by the subject (0-24 range). Greater levels of disability are reflected by higher numbers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (Interference)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 7-item measure that provides scores for pain-related functional impairment. The seven (7) pain interference items are rated on a simple numeric rating scale from 0-10. On the scale 0 represents &quot;no interference&quot; and 10 is &quot;completely interferes&quot;. The pain interference score is achieved by taking the total of all seven (7) scores and dividing it by the number of items (7).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist-17 Civilian Version (PCL-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-17 is a standardized self-report rating scale for PTSD comprising 17 items that correspond to the key symptoms of PTSD. Two versions of the PCL exist: PCL-Military and PCL-Civilian.We used the PCL-Civilian version because it addresses the broadest range of possible events as the traumatic stressor. The PCL-C has demonstrated strong reliability and validity in multiple samples. A total symptom severity score (range = 17-85) can be obtained by summing the scores from each of the 17 items that have response options ranging from 1 &quot;Not at all&quot; to 5 &quot;Extremely&quot;. Higher scores represent more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>GAD-7 Anxiety Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 7-item scale assesses anxiety symptoms on a 0 to 21 scale with higher scores representing more severe anxiety symptoms</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS total score is computed by summing responses to all 13 items. PCS total scores range from 0-52 with higher scores representing more pain catastrophizing.</description>

        <title>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire</title>
        <description>This is a 24-item pain specific disability questionnaire consisting of 24 questions which are related specifically to physical functions that are likely to be affected by back pain. The questionnaire is scored by adding up the number of items checked by the subject (0-24 range). Greater levels of disability are reflected by higher numbers.</description>
        <time_frame>at baseline and 9 months</time_frame>
        <population>We had baseline data available for 241 participants; 120 in the usual care arm and 121 in the stepped care arm. At 9 months, 7 participants withdrew from the study leaving 114 usual care participants available for analysis. In the stepped care arm, 13 participants withdrew leaving 108 available for analysis</population>

Pain self-management program : The pain self-management program is delivered by a nurse care-manager during a 12-week period. Sessions are each 45 minutes long and phone-based. They occur at baseline, week 1, week 3, week 6, week 9, and week 12.
Cognitive behavioral therapy : Cognitive behavioral therapy is delivered by phone by a nurse care-manager 6 times over a 12-week period. Sessions last approximately 45 minutes and occur at weeks 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 of the study.

        <title>Brief Pain Inventory (Interference)</title>
        <description>This is an 7-item measure that provides scores for pain-related functional impairment. The seven (7) pain interference items are rated on a simple numeric rating scale from 0-10. On the scale 0 represents &quot;no interference&quot; and 10 is &quot;completely interferes&quot;. The pain interference score is achieved by taking the total of all seven (7) scores and dividing it by the number of items (7).</description>

        <title>PTSD Checklist-17 Civilian Version (PCL-C)</title>
        <description>The PCL-17 is a standardized self-report rating scale for PTSD comprising 17 items that correspond to the key symptoms of PTSD. Two versions of the PCL exist: PCL-Military and PCL-Civilian.We used the PCL-Civilian version because it addresses the broadest range of possible events as the traumatic stressor. The PCL-C has demonstrated strong reliability and validity in multiple samples. A total symptom severity score (range = 17-85) can be obtained by summing the scores from each of the 17 items that have response options ranging from 1 &quot;Not at all&quot; to 5 &quot;Extremely&quot;. Higher scores represent more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>

Pain self-management program : The pain self-management program is delivered by a nurse care-manager during a 12-week period. Sessions are each 45 minutes long and phone-based. They occur at baseline, week 1, week 3, week 6, week 9, and week 12.
Cognitive behavioral therapy : Cognitive behavioral therapy is delivered by phone by a nurse care-manager 6 times over a 12-week period. Sessions last approximately 45 minutes and occur at weeks 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 of the study.

      <time_frame>The time frame in which adverse event data were collected was from the baseline evaluation to the 9-month assessment. Therefore, the assessment period was for 9 months which was through study completion.</time_frame>
      <desc>There were 7 Serious Adverse Events reported to the IRB according to the VA definition of a serious adverse event. VA requires reporting of any hospital stay longer than 24 hours by any subject enrolled. There were 7. The IRB did not find these to be Serious Adverse Events resulting from the study and these are called &quot;VA Events&quot; officially.</desc>

          <title>Usual Care</title>
          <description>Study subjects randomized to this arm would receive usual care from their provider(s). No study intervention is undertaken on subjects in this arm. Participants in Usual Care would complete the same four outcome assessments (surveys) throughout the course of the study that members of the intervention complete.</description>

          <title>Stepped Care</title>
          <description>Study subjects randomized to this arm would receive stepped care for their pain. Stepped care involves FDA-approved analgesic therapy, a 12-week pain self-management program, and if pain does not improve, a 12-week cognitive behavioral therapy program.
Pain self-management program : The pain self-management program is delivered by a nurse care-manager during a 12-week period. Sessions are each 45 minutes long and phone-based. They occur at baseline, week 1, week 3, week 6, week 9, and week 12.
Cognitive behavioral therapy : Cognitive behavioral therapy is delivered by phone by a nurse care-manager 6 times over a 12-week period. Sessions last approximately 45 minutes and occur at weeks 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 of the study.
