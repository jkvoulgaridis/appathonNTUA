  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis (IC), also called painful bladder syndrome (PBS), or chronic pelvic
      pain syndrome(CPPS) is a common condition with no known cause or cure. Twin studies and
      family accounts have suggested that the condition may be genetic or passed down (inherited)
      from one generation to another.

      In this study, we are collecting genetic material and medical information from families in
      North America in an attempt to identify genetic factors that may cause IC/PBS/CPPS. We are
      enrolling families and individuals with IC/PBS/CPPS and their family members (both family
      members with and without IC like symptoms).

      We are trying to identify a genetic cause of interstitial cystitis (IC)/painful bladder
      syndrome (PBS)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). By enrolling families we aim to fully
      describe the symptoms of IC/PBS/CPPS in adults and children. We will attempt to determine if
      the symptoms of IC/PBS/CPPS match or indicate changes in specific genes. We will use several
      genetic tests; linkage analysis, whole exome sequencing and candidate gene studies. This will
      help us decipher the cause of IC and lead us to be able to find better more effective
      treatments for affected individuals. We are looking for families with IC/PBS/CPPS symptoms to
      give a DNA sample (from saliva), urine samples and answer 2 questionnaires. Travel to Boston
      NOT necessary.
