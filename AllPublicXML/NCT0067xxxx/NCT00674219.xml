  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to obtain preliminary open-label data on the efficacy and
      tolerability of memantine, an anti-glutamatergic medication with a unique pharmacodynamic
      profile, in individuals with OCD and individuals with GAD. Because glutamatergic
      hyperactivity in frontal and frontal-subcortical circuits may play a role in the symptomatic
      expression of OCD, and possibly GAD, agents that reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission
      should provide unique anti-stress and anti-obsessional benefits. Memantine is a specific,
      uncompetitive antagonist at the NMDA receptor that blocks sustained activation of the NMDA
      receptor by high concentrations of glutamate under pathological conditions but rapidly leaves
      the NMDA channel upon transient physiological activation by low concentrations of glutamate.

      Several case reports and an open-label trial have reported efficacy of anti-glutamatergic
      medications for the treatment of OCD. In an open-label trial of riluzole, a glutamate release
      inhibitor, seven of 13 adult patients with OCD improved, and five were categorized as
      treatment responders. Another open trial found riluzole to be effective for four of six
      children with treatment-refractory OCD. N-acetylcysteine, an agent that likely attenuates
      glutamate neurotransmission, was effective as an augmentation in one patient with OCD. Two
      case reports described memantine treatment of OCD. Poyurovsky et al. reported improvement
      with memantine augmentation in one patient with treatment resistant OCD, while Pasquini and
      Biondi noted improvement in one OCD patient with checking compulsions but not in one with
      contamination obsessions. There have been no controlled or open-label trials of memantine in
      OCD reported thus far.

      Few studies have examined the efficacy of anti-glutamatergic agents in GAD. In an open-label
      trial of riluzole treatment in 18 patients with GAD, twelve patients responded and eight
      achieved remission. A double-blind, controlled study found that LY354740, a metabotropic
      glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGlu2/3) agonist, was significantly more effective than placebo for
      GAD. No studies of memantine in GAD have been reported thus far. We hypothesized that
      treatment with memantine would result in significant symptom reduction in both OCD and GAD.

    <description>Participants in the OCD group were rated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), a standard measure of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) severity in pharmacotherapy studies. It is administered by a trained rater. It comprises 10 items assessing OCD symptoms (e.g. time spent, degree of control, severity). Each item is scored on a scale from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe) [total score range = 0-40] over the previous week. The higher the number on the Y-BOCS, the more severe the symptoms.
Participants in the GAD group were rated using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), a standard measure of anxiety severity in pharmacotherapy studies. It is administered by a trained rater. It comprises 14 items assessing anxiety symptoms. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is male or female outpatient between 18-64 years old.

             Compulsive Disorder as determined by the MINI.

             one or more the following methods of contraception during the study: intrauterine
             device (IUD), barrier method in combination with a spermicide, oral/hormonal
             contraception or abstinence. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test prior to receiving study drug.

             currently stable.

          -  No current abuse of alcohol or other substance.

          -  The subject has a total score of 20 or more on the HARS or YBOCS at screening (for GAD

             psychiatric hospitalization.

          -  Seizure disorders.

          -  Significant history of medical disease (i.e. cardiovascular, hepatic (e.g. cirrhosis,

             potential or progressive neurological disorders) which could impair reliable
             participation in the trial or necessitate the use of medication not allowed by this
             protocol.

          -  The subject is pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing. If a subject becomes
             pregnant, she will be discontinued immediately and followed appropriately.

          <description>Participants in the OCD group were rated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), a standard measure of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) severity in pharmacotherapy studies. It is administered by a trained rater. It comprises 10 items assessing OCD symptoms (e.g. time spent, degree of control, severity). Each item is scored on a scale from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe) [total score range = 0-40] over the previous week. The higher the number on the Y-BOCS, the more severe the symptoms.
Participants in the GAD group were rated using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), a standard measure of anxiety severity in pharmacotherapy studies. It is administered by a trained rater. It comprises 14 items assessing anxiety symptoms. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>
