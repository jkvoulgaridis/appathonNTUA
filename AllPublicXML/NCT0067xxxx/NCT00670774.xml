  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A strongly positive crossmatch has long been considered an absolute contraindication to
      kidney transplantation and most patients with anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody
      never were able to receive a kidney transplant. Over the past decade, significant progress
      has been made in overcoming early antibody-mediated renal allograft injury. Our group has
      performed more than 200 such transplants providing the possibility of transplant to
      previously untransplantable patients. Despite our best efforts, transplantation in these
      patients is still complicated by a high rate of acute humoral rejection (AHR).

      Patients included in this study will be those who have demonstrable anti-HLA antibody
      specific for their living donor. It is our hypothesis that blockade of terminal complement
      activation at the time of transplant in combination with our current protocols will reduce
      the incidence of AHR in patients with anti-donor HLA antibody.

      The eculizumab dosing regimen was modified from that used in the treatment of paroxysmal
      nocturnal hemoglobinuria and consisted of 1200 mg immediately prior to transplantation, 600
      mg on postoperative day 1, and 600 mg weekly thereafter for 4 weeks. At week 4, assessment of
      DSA levels was performed. Eculizumab was discontinued in patients whose DSA had significantly
      decreased (B flow crossmatch channel shift&lt;200). In patients with persistently high DSA and
      thus believed to have continued high risk for AMR, eculizumab treatment continued (1200 mg
      week 5, and then every 2 weeks). Another DSA assessment was performed at week 9 and
      eculizumab was discontinued if the B flow crossmatch channel shift was &lt;200.

      The eculizumab group were compared to a historical control group consisting of consecutive
      transplants between 1/1/2005 and 1/10/2017 who met the inclusion criteria. The historical
      control group had been treated with a similar plasma exchange based protocol without
      eculizumab.

    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>AMR can cause acute graft loss or shorten allograft survival. Renal allograft biopsies were obtained percutaneously using ultrasound guidance processed for light microscopy and immunofluorescence for peritubular capillary staining for C4d. All biopsies were reviewed by a pathologist in a blinded fashion. AMR was diagnosed using standard Banff criteria in combination with graft dysfunction (increase in serum creatinine &gt;/=0.3 mg/dL over nadir.)</description>

    <description>Transplant glomerulopathy is a morphologic lesion of renal allografts that is characterized histologically by duplication and/or multilayering of the glomerular basement membrane.

    <description>Patients will be given 1200 mg of eculizumab intravenously over 30 minutes, 1 hour prior to surgery.
Patients will be given 900 mg of eculizumab on Day 1 post-transplant.
Patients will then be given 900 mg of eculizumab weekly through 4 weeks post-transplant
At week 4, patients will be assessed for B cell flow cytometry cross match (FCXM). Patients with B cell FCXM less than 200 will stop eculizumab treatment. Patients with B cell FCXM greater than or equal to 200 will continue eculizumab treatment every 14 days from week 5 through week 9. The dose will be increased to 1200 mg and dosing will now be every 2 weeks instead of weekly. Similar &quot;discontinuation assessments&quot; will be performed at week 9, 26, 39 and 52.
In addition, eculizumab 600 mg will be administered immediately after each plasmapheresis (PP) and immediately after any fresh frozen plasma (FFP) that is given post-transplant during the treatment period</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR) in the First 3 Months After Living Donor Kidney Transplantation</title>
        <description>AMR can cause acute graft loss or shorten allograft survival. Renal allograft biopsies were obtained percutaneously using ultrasound guidance processed for light microscopy and immunofluorescence for peritubular capillary staining for C4d. All biopsies were reviewed by a pathologist in a blinded fashion. AMR was diagnosed using standard Banff criteria in combination with graft dysfunction (increase in serum creatinine &gt;/=0.3 mg/dL over nadir.)</description>
