      RATIONALE: Valproic acid may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether valproic acid is more effective than
      observation in treating patients with prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well valproic acid works in treating
      patients with progressive, non-metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess whether treatment with valproic acid (a type I histone deacetylase inhibitor) can
           alter the kinetics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in patients with
           non-metastatic prostate cancer and biochemical progression.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of PSA response.

        -  Assess the percentage of patients who achieve a complete response.

        -  Assess the percentage of patients who achieve a partial response.

        -  Assess the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (observation): Patients undergo observation according to standard of care.

        -  Arm II (valproic acid): Patients receive oral valproic acid twice daily for up to 1 year
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year.

    <measure>Number of Participants Exhibiting an Increase in Observed or Predicted Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Doubling Time</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants exhibiting an increase in observed or predicted prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time after initiation of the study. Blood was drawn monthly during study period (1 year), serum PSA was measured &amp; PSADT calculated. A doubling time of &gt; 10 month is defined as complete response (3. Secondary Outcome) and this criteria was based on the Pound et al JAMA 1999, Vol 281(No 17) pgs 1591-1697 paper. Any increase in PSADT is defined as partial response (4. Secondary Outcome).</description>

    <measure>Duration of PSA Response as Assessed by PSA Doubling Time (PSADT)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-study, mid-study, end of study (up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>Serum PSA was measured once a month, each month for the one year the subjects were on the protocol. PSA Doubling time is defined as the duration for PSA levels in the blood to increase by 100 percent, and is calculated based on the rate of change in serum PSA values. Prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) was calculated by natural log of 2 (0.693) divided by the slope of the relationship between the log of PSA and time of PSA measurement for each patient (Pound et al JAMA 1999, Vol 281(No 17) pgs 1591-1697), therefore it can be much greater than the 12 months that we followed the patients for. PSADT was calculated for pre enrollment, at the mid point of the study &amp; at the end of study.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>at time of enrollment, mid-study, end of study (up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>Study questionnaire, known as &quot;Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P), were given to participant to complete during study participation. FACT-P is a validated tool to assess self-perceived functionality, psychosocial well-being, and quality of life; and the scoring of the questionnaire was based on the technique published by FACIT (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy). The FACT-P is a 39-item questionnaire, with each item being scored from on a Likert scale of 0-4. The total score ranges from 0-156, with a higher score reflecting a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Duration of PSA Response as Assessed by PSA Doubling Time (PSADT)</title>
        <description>Serum PSA was measured once a month, each month for the one year the subjects were on the protocol. PSA Doubling time is defined as the duration for PSA levels in the blood to increase by 100 percent, and is calculated based on the rate of change in serum PSA values. Prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) was calculated by natural log of 2 (0.693) divided by the slope of the relationship between the log of PSA and time of PSA measurement for each patient (Pound et al JAMA 1999, Vol 281(No 17) pgs 1591-1697), therefore it can be much greater than the 12 months that we followed the patients for. PSADT was calculated for pre enrollment, at the mid point of the study &amp; at the end of study.</description>

        <description>Study questionnaire, known as &quot;Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P), were given to participant to complete during study participation. FACT-P is a validated tool to assess self-perceived functionality, psychosocial well-being, and quality of life; and the scoring of the questionnaire was based on the technique published by FACIT (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy). The FACT-P is a 39-item questionnaire, with each item being scored from on a Likert scale of 0-4. The total score ranges from 0-156, with a higher score reflecting a better outcome.</description>
