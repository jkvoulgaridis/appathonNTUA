  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to study immune memory generated against the yellow fever
      (YFV) vaccine in participants who have previously received the vaccine. Volunteers will not
      receive vaccine shots; only immune responses to previous yellow fever vaccination will be
      studied. The study involves one or multiple blood draws.

      The goal of this study is to characterize immune memory in humans who have previously
      received yellow fever vaccine. The project is designed to study the magnitude and persistence
      of both humoral, and cell-mediated immune memory generated post-vaccination. Since aging has
      an effect on the immune system (eg. decreased thymic output, replacement of hematopoietic
      cells in the bone marrow with adipocytes), the researchers will analyze the young adults
      (aged 18-45 years) and the older vaccinees (55 years or older) in separate groups.

      The specific aims of the study are to:

        -  Determine the phenotypic and functional characterization of memory T cell responses to
           yellow fever vaccination

        -  Determine neutralizing antibody titer after yellow fever vaccination
