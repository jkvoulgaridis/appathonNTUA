  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being undertaken to collect data from Respironics, Inc's BiPAP autoSV3 and
      compare with data from Respironics, Inc's BiPAP S/T device, to confirm that the algorithms in
      the BiPAP autoSV3 device can safely and effectively treat participants experiencing Comp SAS
      no worse than the BiPAP S/T device. This will be determined using a comparative, randomized
      design with the participants blinded to the therapy. Additionally, attempts will be made to
      blind the central scorer(s) with respect to which device is in use.

      Primary Hypothesis and end-point:

      The use of the BiPAP autoSV3 device in participants with Comp SAS will treat those
      participants no worse than when compared to the BiPAP S/T device with respect to:

        -  Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)

      Secondary Hypothesis and end-points:

      The use of the BiPAP autoSV3 device in participants with Comp SAS will treat those
      participants no worse than the BiPAP S/T device, with respect to:

        -  Sleep Variables

        -  REM, NREM and Total Sleep Time (TST) Indices

        -  Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI)

        -  Wake (W), Stages N1,N2,N3 (NREM), and REM (R) sleep (% TST)

        -  Arousal Index [total, AH-related, PLM-related, 'spontaneous']

        -  Nocturnal oxygenation (measured by continuous pulse oximetry during sleep study)

        -  AHI (REM, NREM and TST) using modified hypopnea rule.

        -  AHI (REM, NREM and TST) during epochs for which leak is determined to exist within
           acceptable limits
