(This includes but is not limited to acute myocardial infarction, cardiac perforation/pericardial tamponade, arrhythmia or conduction abnormality,cerebrovascular accident within 30 days of the procedure or cerebrovascular accident suspected of being related to the procedure, death due to complication of the procedure, including bleeding, vascular repair, transfusion reaction, or bypass surgery).
Myocardial Infarction (MI) - Q wave MI: Development of new, pathological Q wave on the ECG.
-Non-Q wave MI: Elevation of CK levels to ≥ two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with elevated CK-MB in the absence of new pathological Q waves.</description>

Acute onset of ischemic symptoms at rest
New ischemic ECG changes
Typical rise&amp;fall in cardiac biomarkers
Nonocclusive &amp;occlusive thrombus

Cardiac death: Any death due to proximate cardiac cause (e.g. MI, low-output failure, fatal arrhythmia), unwitnessed death and death of unknown cause, all procedure related deaths including those related to concomitant treatment.
Vascular death: Death due to non-coronary vascular causes such as cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm, dissecting aneurysm, or other vascular cause.
Non-cardiovascular death: Any death not covered by the above definitions such as death caused by infection, malignancy, sepsis, pulmonary causes, accident, suicide or trauma.
Myocardial Infarction (MI)
Q wave MI Development of new, pathological Q wave on the ECG.

The target lesion is defined as the treated segment from 5 mm proximal to the scaffold and to 5 mm distal to the test scaffold.
Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR) is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass of any segment of the target vessel. The target vessel is defined as the entire major coronary vessel proximal and distal to the target lesion.
Non Target Lesion Revascularization (Non-TLR) is any revascularization in the target vessel for a lesion other than the target lesion.

Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR) is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass of any segment of the target vessel. The target vessel is defined as the entire major coronary vessel proximal and distal to the target lesion.
Non Target Vessel Revascularization (Non-TVR)is any revascularization in a vessel other than the target vessel.</description>
