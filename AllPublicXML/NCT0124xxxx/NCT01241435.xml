    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of liver function on how much of the
      study drug (LY2216684) gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid
      of it. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.

      The duration of participation in this study is approximately 12 days, not including the
      screening visit. This study requires 1 clinic confinement of 5 days/4 nights followed by 1
      out-patient follow-up visit. A screening visit is required within 30 days prior to the start
      of the study. This research study will be an open-label study.

      The study involves a single oral dose of 18 milligrams (mg) LY2216684 given as 2 tablets.
