  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well radiation therapy works in treating
      patients with stage 0-II breast cancer. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high
      dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to
      normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the cosmesis, acute toxicity and late toxicity in patients treated with
      accelerated partial breast irradiation delivered with proton radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the convenience of accelerated partial breast irradiation and quality of life
      during accelerated partial breast irradiation.

      II. To estimate the in-breast tumor control rates in patients treated with accelerated
      partial breast irradiation delivered with proton radiation.

      III. Compare dosimetry to alternate treatment modalities.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 10 weeks of last breast cancer surgery, patients undergo accelerated partial breast
      irradiation (APBI) delivered with proton radiation twice daily (BID) for 5 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year,
      and 18 months, then annually for 10 years.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported cosmesis score on the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS) at 1 year. Cosmesis scores range from 1 (excellent) to 4 (poor), and scores of 3 (fair) or more indicate adverse cosmetic outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Rate of CTCAE Grade 3+ Confluent Moist Desquamation</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 weeks of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of CTCAE grade 3+ confluent moist desquamation estimated within 6 weeks of radiation therapy with a 90% credible interval. If we observe CTCAE grade 3+ confluent moist desquamation in only 20 patients, then our 90% credible interval will be 7% to 13%.</description>

    <measure>Percent of Patients with Local Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of patients with local failure at 10 years estimated with an exact 95% confidence interval. If there is 1 patient with local failure at 10 years, and researchers have follow-up on all patients at 10 years, then the upper limit of the exact 95% confidence interval will be 2.8%. If researchers don't have 10 years of follow-up on all patients researchers will use the product-limit estimator of Kaplan and Meier (1958) to estimate the local failure rate at 10 years.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must consent to be in the study and must have signed an approved consent
             form conforming with federal and institutional guidelines

          -  The patient must have stage 0, I, or II breast cancer; if stage II, the tumor size
             must be 3 cm or less

          -  On histological examination, the tumor must be ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or
             invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast

          -  Surgical treatment of the breast must have been lumpectomy; the margins of the
             resected specimen must be histologically free of tumor (DCIS and invasive); reexcision
             of surgical margins is permitted

          -  Gross disease must be unifocal with pathologic (invasive and/or DCIS) tumor size 3 cm
             or less; (patients with microscopic multifocality are eligible as long as total
             pathologic tumor size is 3 cm or less)

          -  Patients with invasive breast cancer are required to have axillary staging which can
             include sentinel node biopsy alone (if sentinel node is negative), sentinel node
             biopsy followed by axillary dissection or sampling with a minimum total of 6 axillary
             nodes (if sentinel node is positive), or axillary dissection alone (with a minimum of
             6 axillary nodes); axillary staging is not required for patients with DCIS

          -  The target lumpectomy cavity must be clearly delineated and the target lumpectomy
             cavity/whole breast reference volume must be less than or equal to 30% based on the

             irradiation (PBI) is judged to be technically deliverable

          -  Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been
             disease-free for 5 or more years prior to enrollment and are deemed by their physician

             diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years; carcinoma in situ of the cervix,

          -  Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma

          -  Proven multicentric carcinoma (invasive cancer or DCIS) in more than one quadrant or

          -  Synchronous bilateral invasive or non-invasive breast cancer

          -  Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are positive at pathologic
             evaluation; (if surgical margins are rendered free of disease by reexcision, the
