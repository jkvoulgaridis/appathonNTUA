      This clinical trial studies multi-tracer positron emission tomography in patients with solid
      tumors. Diagnostic procedures, such as multi-tracer positron emission tomography, may help
      measure a patient's response to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Provide a reliable and validated cadre of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
      derived biomarkers that yield a better understanding of: 1) early clinical benefit from
      various therapeutic agents in investigational and recently approved therapies; 2) efficacy
      during novel therapeutics in investigational therapeutics and recently approved therapeutics
      at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI); and 3) possible predict prognosis or other long-term
      outcomes.

      II. Reveal a more detailed understanding of: (1) the in vivo biologic mechanisms of various
      therapeutic drugs in investigational therapies and recently approved therapies at HCI (2)
      information on why particular functional imaging profiles are seen in treated patients.

      III. Reveal a more detailed understanding of how the combination of molecular imaging derived
      biomarkers will be potentially useful to physicians for decision making and for explanation
      of efficacy or outcomes for patients with cancer.

      IV. Implement and evaluate a new imaging technology for multi-tracer PET imaging of these
      tracers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo PET scans with fludeoxyglucose (FDG) F 18 (18FDG), fluorine F 18
      fluorothymidine (FLT), and water (H2O) O-15 (15O) tracers at baseline and within 7 days of
      completion of 1 or 2 (if the course is less than 3 weeks) therapeutic agent courses.

    <description>The patients underwent baseline and repeat PET/CT imaging (after one to two cycles of treatment) with [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and [F-18]fluorothymidine (FLT). The percent change in the SUVmax for FDG was calculated and used to determine the response. Partial response (PR) was defined as 35% or greater reduction in SUVmax, Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as 35% or greater increase in SUVmax, and Stable Disease (SD) was defined as all other changes in SUVmax.</description>

    <description>The patients underwent baseline and repeat PET/CT imaging (after one to two cycles of treatment) with [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and [F-18]fluorothymidine (FLT). The percent change in the SUVmax for FLT was calculated and used to determine the response. Partial response (PR) was defined as 35% or greater reduction in SUVmax, Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as 35% or greater increase in SUVmax, and Stable Disease (SD) was defined as all other changes in SUVmax.</description>

    <description>The patients underwent baseline and repeat PET/CT imaging (after one to two cycles of treatment) with [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and [F-18]fluorothymidine (FLT). Percent change in lesion measurements according to standard response criteria for the patient's tumor type were obtained. For brain tumors, Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria were used. Partial Response (PR) was defined as 50% or greater reduction in lesion measurements, Progressive Disease (PD) was 25% or greater increase in measurements, and Stable Disease (SD) was neither PD or PR. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria were used for solid tumors, with PR defined as 30% or greater reduction in measurements, PD was 20% or greater increase in measurements, and SD was all other changes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible adult patients currently meeting inclusion criteria and will be treated with
             an investigational or recently approved therapeutic agent at HCI; the patients must
             have measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)

             completing the investigational or recently approved therapy, however this may not
             always be possible; by signing informed consent, the patients are documenting their
             agreement to have clinical and radiographic endpoints and the results of

The percent change in the SUVmax for FDG was calculated and used to determine the response. Partial response (PR) was defined as 35% or greater reduction in SUVmax, Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as 35% or greater increase in SUVmax, and Stable Disease (SD) was defined as all other changes in SUVmax.</description>

        <description>The patients underwent baseline and repeat PET/CT imaging (after one to two cycles of treatment) with [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and [F-18]fluorothymidine (FLT). Percent change in lesion measurements according to standard response criteria for the patient's tumor type were obtained. For brain tumors, Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria were used. Partial Response (PR) was defined as 50% or greater reduction in lesion measurements, Progressive Disease (PD) was 25% or greater increase in measurements, and Stable Disease (SD) was neither PD or PR. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria were used for solid tumors, with PR defined as 30% or greater reduction in measurements, PD was 20% or greater increase in measurements, and SD was all other changes.</description>
