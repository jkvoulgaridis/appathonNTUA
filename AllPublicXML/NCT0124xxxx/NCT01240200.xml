  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that high blood sugar (glucose) levels are associated with
      diseases caused by diabetes. Controlling the glucose may prevent these complications. As
      people age, their bodies become unable to make enough insulin to control the blood sugars.
      Pills used to treat diabetes may help for a while, but many times this does not last. When
      the blood sugar is too high, insulin is frequently recommended and used to treat diabetes.
      Insulin is often started by adding a long-acting insulin to the medicines a patient already
      takes. In this study, glargine insulin will be taken together with the diabetes pills
      currently being used. Glargine is a long-acting insulin which is given under the skin once a
      day. Glargine is approved for use in the treatment of patients with diabetes by the FDA (Food
      and Drug Administration).

      Currently, insulin delivery is only available as a shot. The purpose of this study is to
      compare how satisfied patients are when using two different types of insulin shots.
      Specifically, this study aims to determine if people over 65 years old are more satisfied
      taking insulin shots by pens or syringes. Everyone who joins in this study will have a chance
      to use the insulin syringes and the insulin pens.

      The ability of patients to give themselves shots can affect how well the sugar is controlled.
      As people age, medical and other problems may develop that affect their ability to do certain
      things. Another aim of this study is to determine if the ability to use an insulin pen and
      insulin syringe is affected by age or some other problem.

      During this study, participants will be treated with insulin given by a syringe for 12 weeks
      and by a pen for 12 weeks. Questionnaires will be given to determine satisfaction with
      treatment throughout the study. The investigators hypothesize that among elderly patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus failing oral agent therapy, treatment with basal insulin via a
      pen device results in higher treatment satisfaction scores and more accurate dosing than
      treatment with basal insulin via conventional vial and syringe methods.

      A total of 56 subjects with type 2 diabetes will be recruited into this study. The site for
      the study is Grady Memorial Hospital clinics in Atlanta, Georgia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: Status (DTSQs) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction was assessed using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: Status (DTSQs). The questionnaire contains eight items scored on a seven-point scale where 0 = very dissatisfied and 6 = very satisfied. The satisfaction score is obtained from summing responses to questions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and the total score can range from 0 to 36. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with diabetes treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: Change (DTSQc) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction after crossover into the second treatment period was assessed using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: Change (DTSQc). The questionnaire contains eight items scored on a seven-point scale where -3 = much less satisfied now and 3 = much more satisfied now. The satisfaction score is obtained from summing responses to questions 1, and 4 through 8 (the remaining two items assess perceived blood sugar levels). The total score can range from -18 to 18. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with the new diabetes treatment, compared to prior treatment, while scores below 0 mean that satisfaction with the new delivery method of insulin in Period 2 is lower than satisfaction with the delivery method in Period 1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measures the average percentage of blood sugar over the past 2 to 3 months. HbA1c levels below 5.7% are considered normal. Persons with values between 5.7% and 6.4% are considered at high risk of developing diabetes while those with values of 6.5% and above are diagnosed with diabetes. HbA1c can reduce with management of diabetes through diet, exercise, and medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fasting Blood Glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Blood sugar levels are influenced by the size and types of food consumed during the last meal and the production and response to insulin. Fasting blood glucose levels of less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) are considered normal. Values between 100 and 125 mg/dL indicate prediabetes and values of 126 mg/dL and higher indicate diabetes. Fasting blood glucose levels can lower depending on food consumed and medications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Dosing Errors</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who had dosing errors during the course of the study (both study periods). Participants were instructed on using each device and practiced preparing and injecting the insulin dose into a pillow to assess accuracy with each method of delivering insulin. Dosing errors were defined as inaccurate preparation or injection by less than or equal to 10% of the intended dose, independent of vision and dexterity function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Hypoglycemic Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The number of hypoglycemic events occurring during the 24-week study period is reported here. For the purposes of this study, hypoglycemia is defined as a capillary and/or laboratory blood glucose value of less than 70 mg/dL.</description>

          <title>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: Status (DTSQs) Score</title>
          <description>Treatment satisfaction was assessed using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: Status (DTSQs). The questionnaire contains eight items scored on a seven-point scale where 0 = very dissatisfied and 6 = very satisfied. The satisfaction score is obtained from summing responses to questions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and the total score can range from 0 to 36. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with diabetes treatment.</description>

        <title>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: Change (DTSQc) Score</title>
        <description>Treatment satisfaction after crossover into the second treatment period was assessed using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: Change (DTSQc). The questionnaire contains eight items scored on a seven-point scale where -3 = much less satisfied now and 3 = much more satisfied now. The satisfaction score is obtained from summing responses to questions 1, and 4 through 8 (the remaining two items assess perceived blood sugar levels). The total score can range from -18 to 18. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with the new diabetes treatment, compared to prior treatment, while scores below 0 mean that satisfaction with the new delivery method of insulin in Period 2 is lower than satisfaction with the delivery method in Period 1.</description>
