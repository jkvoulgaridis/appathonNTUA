  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, open-label, multi-center study, which will provide
      detailed information about the safety and efficacy of Twynsta tablets in Korean hypertensive
      patients requiring combination therapy. This will present a convenient treatment option for
      hypertension in Korean patients.
