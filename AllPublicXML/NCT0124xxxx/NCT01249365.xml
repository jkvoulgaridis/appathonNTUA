    <textblock>
      This extension study is designed to assess the safety of GSK Biological's HPV vaccine
      GSK580299 in female subjects who took part in the primary study NCT00294047 and received the
      control vaccine in countries for which the licensed GSK HPV vaccine is not indicated for the
      subject's age group (26 years and older). This study is thus conducted to enable all women
      who received the control placebo in the primary NCT00294047 study to receive the GSK580299
      vaccine.

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study (from Month 0 to Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include medical occurrences that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity or were a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. Any was defined as the occurrence of any SAE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 SAE = SAE which prevented normal, everyday activities (in adults/adolescents, such an SAE, for example, prevented attendance at work/school and necessitated the administration of corrective therapy). Related SAE = SAE assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Medically Significant Conditions (MSCs) and Potential Immune-mediated Diseases (pIMDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study (from Month 0 to Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Medically significant conditions (MSCs) are defined as:
AEs prompting emergency room or physician visits that were not related to common diseases, or not related to routine visits for physical examination or vaccination; SAEs that were not related to common diseases. Common diseases include: upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, cervicovaginal yeast infections, menstrual cycle abnormalities and injury.
Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) are a subset of medically significant conditions that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology.
Any was defined as the occurrence of any MSC or pIMD regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 MSC or pIMD = a MSC or pIMD which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related MSC or pIMD = a MSC or pIMD assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>

             the protocol

          -  A subject previously enrolled in the study NCT00294047, who received the control
             vaccine, and who cannot receive the GSK580299 vaccine because the subject is above the
             age for which the vaccine is licensed.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study.

Grade 3 SAE = SAE which prevented normal, everyday activities (in adults/adolescents, such an SAE, for example, prevented attendance at work/school and necessitated the administration of corrective therapy).

        <description>Medically significant conditions (MSCs) are defined as:
AEs prompting emergency room or physician visits that were not related to common diseases, or not related to routine visits for physical examination or vaccination; SAEs that were not related to common diseases. Common diseases include: upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, cervicovaginal yeast infections, menstrual cycle abnormalities and injury.
Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) are a subset of medically significant conditions that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology.
Any was defined as the occurrence of any MSC or pIMD regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 MSC or pIMD = a MSC or pIMD which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related MSC or pIMD = a MSC or pIMD assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>
