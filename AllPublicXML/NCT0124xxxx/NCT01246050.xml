      The aim of this study is to serve as a pilot showing the feasibility of a &quot;Hub and Satellite&quot;
      Heart Failure (HF) Provider's Network which will aim to provide improved, evidence-based care
      to Veterans with HF. Primary Care Providers in the VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics
      (CBOCs) will undergo a brief period of intensive training in HF management and then practice
      in a network of primary care providers supported by the Regional HF Center.

      Background:

      Congestive heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem. There is a pressing need to
      improve treatment of HF, but lifesaving therapies remain underused in clinical practice. The
      investigators proposed a novel, potentially cost-effective model of community-based,
      multidisciplinary, collaborative HF care - the &quot;Hub and Satellite&quot; Heart Failure Providers
      Network. Primary care providers trained in HF management would provide improved care to their
      clinic patients with HF in &quot;satellite&quot; clinics, supported by the Regional HF Center &quot;hub&quot;.

      Objectives:

        1. To establish and demonstrate the feasibility of the &quot;Hub and Satellite&quot; Heart Failure
           Providers Network

        2. To obtain data examining clinical effectiveness and barriers

      Methods:

      Volunteer community-based primary care providers underwent 3 days of HF management training
      at the regional HF center (Nashville), consisting of 21 hours of lectures, briefings,
      teaching sessions and case presentations. Multiple choice testing and a survey interview were
      completed at the beginning and end of training. Exclusive access was given to the services of
      a clinical pharmacist to titrate HF medications to clinical guideline-recommended doses.

      Providers received updates on advances in HF management. A confidential feedback report on
      their performance was given to HF providers. Formative evaluation was performed through
      pre-educational and 4 subsequent telephone interviews with HF providers.

      Decision Support System (DSS) data was used to identify patients with systolic HF (ejection
      fraction&lt;40%) cared for by the HF providers; systolic HF patients in the same clinics cared
      for by non-HF trained providers were randomly selected as controls. Data on the care received
      over the one year period of follow-up was collected from DSS data and the computerized
      patient record system (CPRS).

      Status:

      One year of study follow-up has been completed. Primary data analysis is continuing. Work
      done to date has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a &quot;Hub and
      Satellite&quot; HF Providers network, including high provider satisfaction.

    <description>This was a pilot, qualitative study to assess the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a program to train primary care providers in specialty care.
9 Heart Failure Performance Outcome Quality Measures were studied:
Patient weight measured at clinic visit; level of activity assessed; volume status assessed; Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor/Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ACEI/ARB) prescribed; ACEI/ARB at target dose; beta-blocker prescribed; beta-blocker at target dose; evidence-based beta-blocker used; coumadin prescribed in atrial fibrillation.
Healthcare provider performance with each of the Performance Outcome Quality Measures was assessed at each study visit. Superior performance was defined as a higher score for each Measure on the follow-up visit compared to the baseline visit.
The primary outcome of the study was considered to have been reached if 6 of the 9 outcome measures were superior to the baseline visit.</description>

        <title>Number of Superior Heart Failure Performance Outcome Quality Measures</title>
        <description>This was a pilot, qualitative study to assess the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a program to train primary care providers in specialty care.
9 Heart Failure Performance Outcome Quality Measures were studied:
Patient weight measured at clinic visit; level of activity assessed; volume status assessed; Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor/Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ACEI/ARB) prescribed; ACEI/ARB at target dose; beta-blocker prescribed; beta-blocker at target dose; evidence-based beta-blocker used; coumadin prescribed in atrial fibrillation.
Healthcare provider performance with each of the Performance Outcome Quality Measures was assessed at each study visit. Superior performance was defined as a higher score for each Measure on the follow-up visit compared to the baseline visit.
The primary outcome of the study was considered to have been reached if 6 of the 9 outcome measures were superior to the baseline visit.</description>
