  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of 10, 10, 20 milligrams
      per kilogram (mg/kg) ataluren in participants with nmDBMD who had prior exposure to ataluren
      in a PTC sponsored clinical trial or treatment plan.

      The treatment will continue under this protocol until consent withdrawal by participants,
      withdrawal due to worsen condition after initiating ataluren treatment, withdrawal by
      investigator, withdrawal due to participant unable to tolerate ataluren, participant is
      eligible to participate in another ataluren nmDBMD clinical trial program initiated by
      sponsor, study is discontinued by the relevant regulatory authority and/or sponsor, or until
      ataluren becomes commercially available.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of signed and dated informed consent/assent document(s) indicating that the
             participant (and/or his parent/legal guardian) has been informed of all pertinent
             aspects of the trial. Note: If the study candidate is considered a child under local
             regulation, a parent or legal guardian must provide written consent prior to
             initiation of study screening procedures and the study candidate may be required to
             provide written assent. The rules of the responsible Institutional Review
             Board/Independent Ethic Committee (IRB/IEC) regarding whether one or both parents must
             provide consent and the appropriate ages for obtaining consent and assent from the
             participant should be followed.

          -  History of exposure to ataluren in a prior PTC study or treatment plan in nmDBMD and
             effected nmDBMD siblings of those participants (provided those participants have
             completed the placebo-controlled portion of the trial).

          -  In participants who are sexually active, willingness to abstain from sexual
             intercourse or employ a barrier or medical method of contraception during ataluren
             administration and the 6-week follow up period.

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
             study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions Note: Psychological,
             social, familial, or geographical factors that might preclude adequate study
             participation should be considered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exposure to another investigational drug within 1 month prior to start of study
             treatment.

          -  Eligibility for another ataluren clinical trial that is actively enrolling study
             participants.

          -  Positive for Hepatitis B core antibody or Hepatitis C antibody at screening.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of ataluren (Litesse®
             UltraTM [refined polydextrose], polyethylene glycol 3350, Lutrol® micro F127
             [poloxamer 407], mannitol 25C, crospovidone XL10, hydroxyethyl cellulose, vanilla,
             Cab-O-Sil® M5P [colloidal silica], magnesium stearate).

          -  Ongoing intravenous (IV) aminoglycoside or IV vancomycin therapy.

          -  Ongoing uncontrolled medical/surgical condition, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, or
             laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the
             safety of the participant or make it unlikely that follow-up would be completed.
