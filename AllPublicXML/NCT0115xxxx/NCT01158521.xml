      RATIONALE: Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pazopanib hydrochloride before surgery may make the
      tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pazopanib hydrochloride works when given
      before surgery in treating patients with kidney cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of partial nephrectomy in patients with primary renal tumors
      otherwise requiring radical nephrectomy after neoadjuvant pazopanib treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, tumor diameter/volume change, conversion of hilar to non-hilar
      tumors and surgical morbidity of neoadjuvant pazopanib for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily for up to 18 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo either partial or radical
      nephrectomy at least 7 days after completion of pazopanib hydrochloride.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Could Undergo Partial Nephrectomy After Pazopanib Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Partial nephrectomy performed after 8 to 16-weeks of pazopanib prescription. The median interval from treatment start to surgery was 10.6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary end point was the percentage of patients who could undergo partial nephrectomy after pazopanib therapy. A reduction in tumor size, with pazopanib treatment, may permit the use of a partial nephrectomy, as opposed to a radical nephrectomy. This would help preserve additional vascularized parenchyma.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven renal carcinoma with a clear cell component

          -  Need for optimized partial nephrectomy based on one or more of the following criteria
             (all applicable criteria should be recorded and one criterion designated as the
             primary reason):

               -  Functional or anatomic solitary kidney, bilateral tumors, or pre-existing chronic
                  kidney disease (CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by
                  Cockcroft-Gault formula &lt; 60 mL/min) and tumor amenable to partial nephrectomy,
                  but partial nephrectomy would result in estimated GFR &lt; 30 mL/min; this
                  estimation will be based on current estimated GFR, nuclear renal scan to estimate
                  relative renal function (if 2 kidneys), tumor location(s), and amount of normal
                  renal parenchyma that would need to be removed with nephrectomy

               -  Radical nephrectomy is required for tumor excision; however, it would result in
                  estimated GFR &lt; 30 mL/min; this estimation will be based on current estimated
                  GFR, nuclear renal scan to estimate relative renal function (if 2 kidneys), tumor
                  location(s), and amount of normal renal parenchyma that would need to be removed
                  with radical nephrectomy

               -  Greater than 30% likelihood that a partial nephrectomy would be associated with a
                  high risk of significant morbidity (e.g. hemorrhage) due to proximity to the
                  renal hilum (within 3 mm of main renal artery, renal vein or their primary
                  branches) and/or other anatomic factors as determined by the operating surgeon

             2.5 x laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Serum alanine transaminase (ALT; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 x
             laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 2.5 mg/dL

          -  Urine to protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio &lt; 1; if UPC &gt; 1, then a 24-hour urine
             protein must be assessed; subjects must have a 24-hour urine protein value &lt; 1g to be
             eligible

          -  Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) and partial
             thromboplastin time (PTT) =&lt; 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures; subjects must provide written informed consent
             prior to performance of study-specific procedures or assessments, and must be willing
