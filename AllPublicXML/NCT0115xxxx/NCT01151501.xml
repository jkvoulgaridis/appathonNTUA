  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) refers to pathological states in which arterial
      blood oxygenation is severely impaired，and which need invasive positive pressure ventilation
      (IPPV) as respiratory support technique in most cases.However，IPPV carries well-known risks
      of complications such as ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) or ventilator associated
      pneumonia (VAP)，and the incidence of which is increased as the prolongation of IPPV so as to
      lead to higher mortality rate. Consequently，early extubation is extraordinarily necessary.

      More recently, NPPV has shown to shorten the duration of IPPV，reduce the mortality and
      morbidity rates in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Despite this
      evidence, the efficacy of NPPV in patients with AHRF has not been evidenced. However，NPPV has
      been shown to provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation，and reduce inspiratory muscle
      effort，neuromuscular drive，and dyspnea scores. Moreover，to some patints，NPPV is similar with
      IPPV in providing oxygenation.

      The duration of weaning is from the first day a patient met standard criteria for weaning
      readiness to the time of successful extubation (lasting at least 48 h)，which represents
      40-50% of the total duration of IPPV.As a result，duration of IPPV would be shortened if that
      of weaning was shortened.

      The investigators hypothesized that in mechanical ventilated patients with AHRF who met
      standard criteria for weaning readiness and suffer failure of spontaneous breathing trial,
      use of NPPV for early extubation, providing adequate ventilation and oxygenation, would
      shorten the duration of IPPV as the primary end-point variable, thereby reduce the incidence
      of complication and mortality rates. Accordingly, the investigators conducted a
      prospective，randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of this strategy compared with
      the conventional-weaning approach.

    <description>Patients in whom the spontaneous breathing trial fail and in whom exclusion criteria are not present during this period were randomly allocated. Patients who are randomized to NPPV goup will be extubated and non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP Vision, Respironics Inc., Murrysville，Pennsylvania) will be delivered immediately after extubation using spontaneous/timed (S/T) mode. Expiratory positive airways pressure (PEEP) was initially set at 4 cmH2O and gradually increased to 6-8 cmH2O or more；and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was set to achieve pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2) &gt;92% in cooperation with PEEP. On condition that tidal volume is no less than 6ml/kg，continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is permitted to apply，in which the adjusting procedures of CPAP and FiO2 is similar with PEEP and FiO2 in S/T mode. NPPV is terminated When patients can spontaneously breath oxygen provided by a Venturi device at FiO2≤0.35 for more than 24 hours with SpO2＞92%.</description>
