      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention on food habits and
      physical activity in school-age children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A two-year cluster-randomised prospective study with two parallel arms was used to evaluate
      an intervention programme in children in their first year of primary schooling (5-6 years of
      age) in schools in the city of Granollers. The intervention consisted of the promotion of
      healthy eating habits and physical activity by means of the educational methodology
      Investigation, Vision, Action and Change (IVAC). At the beginning and at the end of the study
      (2006 and 2008) the weight and height of each child was measured in situ, while the families
      were given a self-report physical activity questionnaire and the Krece Plus quick test.
