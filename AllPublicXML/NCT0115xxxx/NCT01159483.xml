    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of single,
      escalating doses of PF-04958242 administered orally to healthy adult participants. This study
      will also evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of single doses of PF-04958242 after
      single escalating doses of PF-04958242 administered orally to healthy adult participants.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a product or medical device. A serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

          -  Total body weight &gt;50 kilograms (kg) (110 pounds [lbs]);

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing);

          -  Positive urine drug screen;

          -  Pregnant or nursing females, and females of child bearing potential;

          -  Severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
             that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational
             product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and,
             in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for
             entry into this study.
