  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infection (HCV) and with a BMI greater than 25Kg/m2
      are refractory to medical treatment. Also, HCV replication seems to be affected when modeling
      insulin resistance in replicon cell culture systems.

      PPARg -agonist (Pioglitazone) is effective in controlling liver inflammation in obese
      subjects with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and also improving insulin sensitivity.
      Therefore, we hypothesize that improving insulin resistance and /or inflammation may affect
      HCV replication and viral kinetics. Independently of PPARg pathways, Prednisone may increase
      HCV viral kinetics. .

      This is a randomized, two arm clinical trial. The investigators performing the primary and
      secondary endpoints are blinded to subject identifiers and arm identifiers.

      Subject's screening for HCV Genotype 4 started in Agouza Hospital in July 2010 and ended in
      February, 2011. No recruitment has occurred for HCV Genotype 1.
