      The screening phase is intended for diagnosing and assessing the patient for possible
      inclusion in the study and for providing an adequate washout period. The following study will
      be conducted in two parts. Part I is an open-label study, multiple center and dose escalation
      evaluation in twelve patients. Six subjects each will be evaluated for safety and efficacy
      assessments at 1 or 2 capsules TID dose for 28 days, sequentially. Each of them will be
      assessed twice in the first week after administration of PDC-1421 Capsules and once a week in
      the following treatment.

      Part II is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. 60 subjects
      will be randomly assigned on a 1:1:1 basis to one of the three arms (1 PDC-1421 Capsule plus
      1 placebo TID, 2 PDC-1421 Capsules TID, 2 placebo TID) for 6 weeks and evaluated the safety
      and efficacy every two weeks during the treatment period.
