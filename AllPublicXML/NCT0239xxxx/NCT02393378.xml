  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of namilumab in combination
      with existing methotrexate (MTX) therapy over 24 weeks in participants with moderate to
      severe early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diagnosed within 6 months and inadequately controlled
      by MTX alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being investigated in this study is namilumab for the treatment of moderate to
      severe Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      namilumab in participants diagnosed with RA within 6 months and insufficiently controlled by
      methotrexate (MTX) alone.

      The study will enroll approximately 36 patients, who will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio
      to the following open label treatment groups:

        -  Namilumab 150 mg + MTX + folic acid

        -  Adalimumab 40 mg + MTX + folic acid

      Imaging techniques, including Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI),
      will be used to measure changes in the dominant hand and the wrist.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is a maximum of 42 weeks, including follow-up period. Participants will make 16 visits
      to the site and will be followed up by telephone twice after end of treatment.

      A strategic decision was made to stop the study on 18 December 2015 in order to fully
      understand the data from the psoriasis study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT02129777) and
      wait for the results of the formal proof of concept study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
      (NCT02379091) in participants with rheumatoid arthritis.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Synovitis, Erosion and Bone Marrow Edema (Osteitis) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and Wrist of the dominant hand was performed at the baseline and at week 24. Change from the Baseline was assessed according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Clinical Trials RA-MRI scoring (OMERACT RAMRIS) Standard. RAMRIS score is the sum of its core components: Synovitis Score, Edema Score, and Erosion Score. Synovitis is scored from 0 (normal) to 9 (maximum distension of synovial cavity). Edema is scored 0 (normal) to 69 (maximum articular bone involvement). Erosion is scored from 0 (normal) to 230 (maximum erosion of articular bone). Total RAMRIS score=0 (normal), maximum RAMRIS score=308 (severe structural damage). For Synovial Score, Edema Score, Erosion Score, and RAMRIS score, increasing number = increasing severity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Remission at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Remission is defined as the number of participants who achieved Disease Activity Score 28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) score &lt;2.6. The DAS28-CRP is a composite measure of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and incorporates a tender and swollen joint count, CRP and patient global assessment of disease activity expressed in a gaussian distribution of variables ranging from 0 to 10. A DAS28-CRP score of &lt;3.2 suggests a low level of disease activity, while a score of &gt;5.1 suggests a high level of disease activity. Using the DAS-CRP as a continuous scale allows investigators (and clinicians) to measure a clinically meaningful endpoint following institution of a therapeutic intervention. In RA, clinical remission would therefore be graded as a DAS28 score of ≤2.6 with disease flare accompanying scores of ≥5.1; well-controlled disease is best characterized as fitting in between these two scores.</description>

    <description>The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 is composite index of improvement in RA proposed by the ACR. ACR20 refers to a composite improvement of 20% in swollen joint count, tender joint count, and 3 or more of the following 5 measures: Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Patient Pain VAS, Patient's self-addressed disability (HAQ), Acute-phase reactant (ESR or CRP) The ACR 50 and ACR 70 are similar tools, used to indicate 50% and 70% improvement, respectively.</description>

        <description>A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and Wrist of the dominant hand was performed at the baseline and at week 24. Change from the Baseline was assessed according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Clinical Trials RA-MRI scoring (OMERACT RAMRIS) Standard. RAMRIS score is the sum of its core components: Synovitis Score, Edema Score, and Erosion Score. Synovitis is scored from 0 (normal) to 9 (maximum distension of synovial cavity). Edema is scored 0 (normal) to 69 (maximum articular bone involvement). Erosion is scored from 0 (normal) to 230 (maximum erosion of articular bone). Total RAMRIS score=0 (normal), maximum RAMRIS score=308 (severe structural damage). For Synovial Score, Edema Score, Erosion Score, and RAMRIS score, increasing number = increasing severity.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved Remission at Week 24</title>
        <description>Remission is defined as the number of participants who achieved Disease Activity Score 28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) score &lt;2.6. The DAS28-CRP is a composite measure of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and incorporates a tender and swollen joint count, CRP and patient global assessment of disease activity expressed in a gaussian distribution of variables ranging from 0 to 10. A DAS28-CRP score of &lt;3.2 suggests a low level of disease activity, while a score of &gt;5.1 suggests a high level of disease activity. Using the DAS-CRP as a continuous scale allows investigators (and clinicians) to measure a clinically meaningful endpoint following institution of a therapeutic intervention. In RA, clinical remission would therefore be graded as a DAS28 score of ≤2.6 with disease flare accompanying scores of ≥5.1; well-controlled disease is best characterized as fitting in between these two scores.</description>
