  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the LUMIFI with Crux
      VCF System for deployment of the Crux VCF. The study will compare the method of Crux VCF
      deployment using the LUMIFI with Crux VCF System (IVUS guidance) with the historical results
      of the Crux VCF System (fluoroscopic guidance). The study will include enrollment into a roll
      in phase consisting of 2 study subjects per site prior to enrollment into the primary
      treatment phase for primary analyses. The purpose of the roll in phase is to assure
      compliance with site training on the use of the investigational device and protocol workflow.

    <description>All Subjects, Cohort A and Cohort B were included in the safety analysis. The primary endpoint of effectiveness, defined as technical success included only subjects within Cohort B. Technical success of filter placement is defined as the primary deployment of the filter such that the investigator judges the location to be suitable to provide sufficient mechanical protection against pulmonary embolism.
Due to early stoppage of the study, enrollment of 100 subjects required to test the null hypothesis and evaluate the Primary Endpoint of Technical Success was not achieved. Therefore, a formal analysis of Technical Success was not performed.</description>

             Progression/recurrence of DVT or PE on therapeutic anticoagulation, OR iii. Inability
             to anticoagulate due to high risk of tumor bleeding, OR iv. Patient unable to safely
             comply with anticoagulation, OR v. Patient that needs interruption of therapeutic
             anticoagulation such as at the time of an operation or other procedure.

             b. Patient that is high risk for DVT or PE and cannot be safely anticoagulated such as
             severe multi-trauma patient or patient having procedure with high risk for
             thromboembolism such as bariatric surgery.

             c. Patients with DVT at high risk for PE and free floating iliac or caval thrombosis

          1. Patient has any one of the following conditions:

               1. Thrombus in the iliac veins or the IVC that precludes access to appropriate
                  placement of the Crux Filter

               2. Known inadequate venous anatomy to allow insertion or retrieval of the filter
