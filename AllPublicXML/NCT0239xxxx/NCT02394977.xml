  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study of patients
      undergoing CPR for cardiac arrest in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four academic
      teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran from June 1 to October 31, 2014. Patients were randomized
      to receive CPR with either standard manual compression, or compression with real-time
      audiovisual feedback using the Cardio First Angel™ device.

      The investigators sought to determine if the addition of a CPR feedback device to routine
      manual CPR would impact the quality and consistency of chest compression and patient
      survival. We conducted a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study of patients undergoing
      CPR for cardiac arrest in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four academic teaching
      hospitals. Patients were randomized to receive either standard manual CPR or CPR using the
      Cardio First Angel™ (CFA; INOTECH, Nubberg, Germany) feedback device. Recorded variables
      included return of spontaneous circulation, adherence to CPR guidelines and quality of CPR,
      nurse satisfaction and CPR associated morbidity.

    <description>Patients in the intervention group received CPR in accordance to published guidelines using the CFA device per manufacturer instructions. The Cardio First Angel™ (CFA; INOTECH, Nubberg, Germany) is a lightweight device that consists of three components . Application of400 ± 30 Newtons of force (41 kg or 90 lb of pressure), which correlates toa sternum compression depth of 50-60 mm, is followed by an audible &quot;click&quot; sound to alert the rescuer to cease compression. The &quot;click&quot; sound is also audible upon spring decompression alerting the rescuer to resume compression. The device does not require an electrical power supply.</description>
