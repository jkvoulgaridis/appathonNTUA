  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The multicenter, open label, randomized study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a
      switch to MK-1439A (MK-1439 [doravirine] plus lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate)
      in HIV-1-infected participants virologically suppressed on a protocol-specified
      antiretroviral regimen. The primary hypothesis is that a switch to MK-1439A will be
      non-inferior to continuation of the regimen at Screening for 24 weeks, as assessed by the
      proportion of participants maintaining HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL. The Base
      Study results will be based on the first 48 weeks of this ongoing study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two optional study extensions are planned. Study Extension 1 will evaluate safety of the
      switch to MK-1439A for an additional 2 years beyond the Base Study. Study Extension 2 will
      evaluate safety of the switch to MK-1439A until MK-1439A becomes locally available, or 4
      years beyond Study Extension 1, whichever comes first.
