    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of MK-1075, and to
      determine the ability of MK-1075 to reduce HCV viral load, following administration of a
      single dose in HCV-infected participants.

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, was also an AE. The percentage of participants that experienced an AE was reported for each treatment panel.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose (baseline), 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72, and 120 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>For assessment of antiviral activity of MK-1075 at each study dose, baseline and post-dose HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) (log10) were measured at pre-dose and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72, and 120 hours post-dose. For each participant, baseline measurement was defined as the measurement obtained pre-dose on the first day of dosing. The estimated change from baseline in HCV RNA VL (log10) was calculated for each participant by time point after each single dose, and the maximum change (reduction) in HCV RNA was determined and reported for each treatment arm using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Discontinued Study Due to an AE</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, was also an AE. The percentage of participants that discontinued the study due to an AE was reported for each treatment panel.</description>

        <title>Maximum HCV Viral Load (VL) Change From Baseline Over Time Following Single-Dose MK-1075</title>
        <description>For assessment of antiviral activity of MK-1075 at each study dose, baseline and post-dose HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) (log10) were measured at pre-dose and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72, and 120 hours post-dose. For each participant, baseline measurement was defined as the measurement obtained pre-dose on the first day of dosing. The estimated change from baseline in HCV RNA VL (log10) was calculated for each participant by time point after each single dose, and the maximum change (reduction) in HCV RNA was determined and reported for each treatment arm using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model.</description>
