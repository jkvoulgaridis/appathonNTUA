    <description>Comparison of mean change in overall ETDQ-7 scores from baseline to 6 weeks between randomized arms.
The 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) is a validated patient-reported tool measuring ETD symptoms and severity. The 7 items are: pressure in the ears, pain in the ears, a feeling that your ears are clogged or underwater, ear symptoms when you have a cold of sinusitis, cracking or popping sounds in the ear, ringing in the ears, and a feeling that your hearing is muffled. Each item is rated from 1 (no problem) to 7 (severe problem) and a mean is calculated for the overall score (range from 1-7). Scores of 1-2 indicate no to mild symptoms, 3-5 moderate, and 6-7 severe symptoms.</description>

          <description>The 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) is a validated patient-reported tool measuring ETD symptoms and severity. The 7 items are: pressure in the ears, pain in the ears, a feeling that ears are clogged or underwater, ear symptoms when you have a cold of sinusitis, cracking or popping sounds in the ear, ringing in the ears, and a feeling that your hearing is muffled. Each item is rated from 1 (no problem) to 7 (severe problem) and a mean is calculated for the overall score (range from 1-7). Scores of 1-2 indicate no to mild symptoms, 3-5 moderate, and 6-7 severe symptoms.</description>

        <description>Mean change from baseline to 12 months in the overall ETDQ-7 score. The 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) is a validated patient-reported tool measuring ETD symptoms and severity. The 7 items are: pressure in the ears, pain in the ears, a feeling that your ears are clogged or underwater, ear symptoms when you have a cold of sinusitis, cracking or popping sounds in the ear, ringing in the ears, and a feeling that your hearing is muffled. Each item is rated from 1 (no problem) to 7 (severe problem) and a mean is calculated for the overall score (range from 1-7). Scores of 1-2 indicate no to mild symptoms, 3-5 moderate, and 6-7 severe symptoms.</description>

One randomized balloon dilation participant did not undergo procedure and did not return for the 6-week visit, so this participant is not included in the safety analysis. One other participant did not complete the ETDQ-7 for the primary efficacy endpoint but otherwise completed the rest of the 6-week visit and is therefore included in the safety analysis, resulting in a total XprESS safety population of 30.</description>
