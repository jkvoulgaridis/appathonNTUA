  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center cross-sectional imaging study investigating the use of gallium-68
      citrate PET in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who are planning
      to undergo a metastatic tumor biopsy on protocol NCT02432001 (CC#125519).

      The study population will consist of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer who are undergoing a metastatic tumor biopsy as part of clinical protocol NCT02432001
      (CC#125519), with evidence of resistance to androgen signaling inhibition.

      The study will involve gallium-68 PET scan obtained at single time point, followed by
      radiographically-guided metastatic tumor biopsy within 14 days of PET scan.
