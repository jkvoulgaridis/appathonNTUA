      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of nintedanib when given
      together with capecitabine and to see how well they work in treating patients with colorectal
      cancer that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory) and has spread to other
      places in the body (metastatic). Nintedanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also block the growth of new blood vessels
      necessary for tumor growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nintedanib with capecitabine
      may be a better treatment for colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and examine the dose-limiting toxicities
           of nintedanib when administered with capecitabine within the study population and,
           establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). (Phase I)

        -  II. To assess progression free survival at 18 weeks. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. To assess median progression free survival. (Phase II)

        -  II. To assess median overall survival from the date of enrollment to the time of death
           will be documented. (Phase II)

        -  III. To assess the objective response rate as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria
           in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. (Phase II)

        -  IV. To assess the toxicity of dose regimen using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program
           (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
           (CTCAE version 4.0). (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. Measurement of circulating angiogenic cytokines (CAFs): vascular endothelial growth
           factor (VEGF), soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sVEGFR) 1/2,
           placental growth factor (PlGF), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
           (GMCSF), leptin, interleukin (IL)-1 alpha (a), IL-8, IL-6, fibroblast growth factor
           basic (FGFb), osteopontin and pentraxin-3. (Phase II)

        -  II. Measurement of drug levels and pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling.
           (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nintedanib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) (every 12 hours) on days 1-14 and
      nintedanib PO BID (every 12 hours) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 28 days until
      resolution or satisfactory stabilization of persistent drug-related toxicity, and then every
      6 months thereafter.
