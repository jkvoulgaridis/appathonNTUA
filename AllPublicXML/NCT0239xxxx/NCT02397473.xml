    <measure>Overall Mean Change From Baseline in Number of Weekly Cluster Headache Attacks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 through Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Number of cluster headache attacks was recorded daily by study participants in their ePRO Diary. Overall mean change from baseline is derived from the average of weeks 1 to 3 from mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. Least Square (LS) means were calculated using MMRM model with treatment, sex, pooled investigative site, week, baseline, and treatment by week as fixed effects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 50% or Greater Reduction From Baseline in the Weekly Number of Cluster Headache Attacks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Number of cluster headache attacks was recorded daily by study participants in their ePRO Diary. Percentage of participants with 50% or greater reduction from baseline at week 3 was analyzed using Koch's nonparametric randomization-based analysis of covariance method. This method adjusted for pooled investigative site by including it as a stratification variable. It also adjusted for sex and baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Overall Mean Change From Baseline in Number of Weekly Cluster Headache Attacks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 through Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Number of cluster headache attacks was recorded daily by study participants in their ePRO Diary. Overall mean change from baseline is derived from the average of weeks 1 to 8 from MMRM analysis. Least Square (LS) means were calculated using MMRM model with treatment, sex, pooled investigative site, week, baseline, and treatment by week as fixed effects.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reporting a Score of 1 or 2 on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PGI-I requests participants to mark the box that best describes their cluster headache condition since they started taking the medicine. The options in the displayed boxes are represented on a 7-point scale, with 1 = very much better, 2 = much better, 3 = a little better, 4 = no change, 5 = a little worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. Percentage of participants were derived with a generalized linear mixed model repeated measures method with treatment, sex, baseline cluster headache attack category, month, and treatment by month as fixed effects.</description>

    <description>Treatment emergent (TE) ADA evaluable participant is considered to be TE ADA+ if the subject has at least one post-baseline titer that is a 4-fold or greater increase in titer from baseline measurement. If baseline result is ADA Not Present, then the participant is TE ADA+ if there is at least one post-baseline result of ADA present with titer &gt;= 1: 20.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Suicidal Ideation Assessed by Columbia - Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1 through Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior occurred. Some questions are binary responses (yes/no) and some are on a scale of 1 (low severity) to 5 (high severity). Suicidal ideation: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with any methods without intent to act, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act without specific plan, active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.</description>

        <description>C-SSRS captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior occurred. Some questions are binary responses (yes/no) and some are on a scale of 1 (low severity) to 5 (high severity). Suicidal ideation: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with any methods without intent to act, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act without specific plan, active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Suicidal Behaviors Assessed by Columbia - Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>C-SSRS captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior occurred. Some questions are binary responses (yes/no) and some are on a scale of 1 (low severity) to 5 (high severity). Suicidal behavior: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide.</description>
