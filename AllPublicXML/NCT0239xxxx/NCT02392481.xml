  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to explore if any of the biomarkers assessed are
      sensitively linked to the asthma phenotypes. This would potentially alone or in addition to
      other clinical or biofluid markers indicate if and how asthma endotypes are linked to
      phenotype such as eosinophilic, neutrophilic, or paucigranulocytic phenotypes. Further
      exploratory markers will be analysed for better understanding of physiological levels of
      proteins and markers playing a role in regard to disease characterization in asthma. As a
      basis for further development of a biomarker for asthma, The sponsor plans to conduct this
      exploratory biomarker trial to determine levels and reference ranges of biomarkers
      potentially associated with asthma phenotypes. The trial aims at generating a panel of serum
      biomarkers that can be evaluated in subsequent interventional studies. The longitudinal
      design will be used to ascertain stability and test-retest reliability.
