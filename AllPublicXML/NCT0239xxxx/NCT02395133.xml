      The primary objective of the study was to assess the ability of different Dupilumab dose
      regimens, administered as monotherapy, to maintain the treatment response achieved after 16
      weeks of initial treatment with Dupilumab monotherapy compared to placebo.

    <measure>Difference Between Current Study Baseline and Week 36 in Percent Change in EASI From Parent Study Baseline (NCT02277743 and NCT02277769)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Parent Study), Baseline (Current Study) and Week 36 (Current study)</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. Difference of percent change in EASI between current study baseline and week 36 in from parent study baseline (NCT02277743 and NCT02277769) was reported. Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing before multiple imputation (MI).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Maintaining Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Response Within 1 Point of Baseline at Week 36</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response is an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Participants with IGA score of 0 or 1 at baseline and maintaining within 1 point of baseline were reported as responders. Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing. Participants with missing value at a visit were considered as a non-responder.</description>

    <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Values after first rescue treatment were set to missing and participants with missing peak NRS at Week 35 were considered as non-responders.</description>

        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. EASI-75 responders were the participants who achieved &gt;=75% overall improvement in EASI score at Week 36. Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing. Patients with missing value at week 36 were considered as a non-responder.</description>

Therapeutic response is an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Participants with IGA score of 0 or 1 at baseline and maintaining within 1 point of baseline were reported as responders. Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing. Participants with missing value at a visit were considered as a non-responder.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Weekly Average of Peak Daily Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score Increased by 3 or More Points From Baseline to Week 35</title>
        <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Values after first rescue treatment were set to missing and participants with missing peak NRS at Week 35 were considered as non-responders.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Eczema Area and Severity Index-50 (EASI-50) (&gt;= 50% Reduction in EASI Score) at Week 36</title>
        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. EASI-50 responders were the participants who achieved &gt;= 50% overall improvement in EASI score from baseline to Week 36. Values after first rescue treatment were set to missing and participants with missing EASI-50 scores at Week 36 were considered as non-responders.</description>

Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]).

Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing before MI.</description>

          <title>Difference Between Current Study Baseline and Week 35 in Percent Change in Peak Weekly Pruritus NRS From Parent Study Baseline</title>
          <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing before MI.</description>

        <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered an AE without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on- treatment period (time from the first dose of study drug up to the end of study [Week 36]). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life- threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>
