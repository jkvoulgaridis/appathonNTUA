    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nab-paclitaxel when given
      together with capecitabine and radiation therapy following first treatment with chemotherapy
      (induction therapy) in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that is not spread to tissue
      far away but is not operable due to abutment or encasement of blood vessels nearby (locally
      advanced). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel and capecitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving nab-paclitaxel, capecitabine, and
      radiation therapy together may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of combining nab-paclitaxel (abraxane) with
      capecitabine and radiation (radiation therapy) for consolidating treatment after induction
      chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether combining abraxane with capecitabine and radiation for consolidating
      treatment after induction chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer increases
      overall survival.

      II. To analyze fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy samples for mothers against
      decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) by immunocytochemistry.

      III. To evaluate plasma cytokines levels, circulating tumor cells before, during and after
      therapy.

      IV. To evaluate patient-reported symptoms using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory
      Gastrointestinal Cancer Module (MDASI-GI).

      V. To evaluate response rate in patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nab-paclitaxel.

      Patients receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and
      29 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5 (Monday-Friday). Patients also
      undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) on days 1-5 (Monday-Friday). Treatment continues
      for 5 1/2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks and then every 3
      months.
