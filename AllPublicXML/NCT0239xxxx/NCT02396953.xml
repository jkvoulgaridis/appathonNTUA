    <measure>Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) by Number of Subjects With DLTs.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to Week 25.</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD was defined based on the DLTs observed in each cohort. A DLT was defined as an adverse event (AE) (excluding anorexia and fatigue) or an abnormal laboratory value occurring within the first week (up to Week 2) following lanreotide PRF administration and during the entire study duration, assessed as unrelated to acromegaly, intercurrent illness or concomitant medications and which met any of the pre-established toxicity criteria. If no DLTs were reported then no MTD could be defined.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was an open-label, dose-ascending study to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability of a single dose of lanreotide prolonged release formulation (PRF). 17 centres recruited adult subjects with acromegaly into 3 lanreotide PRF treatment cohorts (180 milligrams [mg], 270 mg and 360 mg).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Screening of subjects took place 28 to 42 days before administration of study treatment (Day −42 to Day −28). Overall, 60 subjects were screened during this run-in period; 32 of whom were screening failures and 28 subjects were enrolled and treated with lanreotide PRF.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>180 mg Lanreotide PRF</title>
          <description>On Day 1, 3 initial subjects in Cohort 1 received 180 mg lanreotide PRF by a single deep subcutaneous injection in the superior, external quadrant of the buttock and a 12-week treatment period then commenced. The dose escalation proceeded with a 3+3+3 scheme. If 0 or 1 out of the 3 dosed subjects had experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), 3 more subjects would have been dosed with the same dose. If more than 3 out of 9 subjects had experienced a DLT, dose escalation would have been stopped and the dose declared the maximum administered dose. If ≤3 DLTs had been observed in the 9 treated subjects and the overall safety was in line with the known lanreotide safety profile, the data review committee (DRC) would have allowed the dose to be escalated to 270 mg (Cohort 2).
At the end of the treatment period subjects continued to be assessed over a 12-week follow up period until end of study (EOS) at Week 25 or early withdrawal (EW).</description>

        <title>Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) by Number of Subjects With DLTs.</title>
        <description>The MTD was defined based on the DLTs observed in each cohort. A DLT was defined as an adverse event (AE) (excluding anorexia and fatigue) or an abnormal laboratory value occurring within the first week (up to Week 2) following lanreotide PRF administration and during the entire study duration, assessed as unrelated to acromegaly, intercurrent illness or concomitant medications and which met any of the pre-established toxicity criteria. If no DLTs were reported then no MTD could be defined.</description>

            <description>On Day 1, 3 initial subjects in Cohort 1 received 180 mg lanreotide PRF by a single deep subcutaneous injection in the superior, external quadrant of the buttock and a 12-week treatment period then commenced. The dose escalation proceeded with a 3+3+3 scheme. If 0 or 1 out of the 3 dosed subjects had experienced a DLT, 3 more subjects would have been dosed with the same dose. If more than 3 out of 9 subjects had experienced a DLT, dose escalation would have stopped, and the dose declared the maximum administered dose. If ≤3 DLTs had been observed in the 9 treated subjects and the overall safety was in line with the known lanreotide safety profile, the DRC would have allowed the dose to be escalated to 270 mg (Cohort 2).
At the end of the treatment period subjects continued to be assessed over a 12-week follow up period until EOS at Week 25 or EW.</description>

Cohort 3 subjects were treated and reviewed on a 2+2+2+3 scheme. An additional subject was also dosed in this cohort as it was considered unethical to exclude an eligible subject.

TEAEs were defined as any AE that occurs during the active phase of the study (between the start of the 3 month treatment period and 3 months after the end of study treatment). The worst intensity of TEAES at each grade are reported for all and for related TEAES. In the event of multiple occurrences of the same AEs being reported by the same subject, the maximum intensity and the most serious causality were reported.</description>

        <title>PK Analysis of Glycofurol Excipients: AUC0-∞ and Area Under the Serum Concentration Time Curve From Time 0 to Last Quantifiable Timepoint (AUC0-t).</title>
        <description>Blood samples for determination of the excipients (N1-glycofurol and N2-glycofurol) serum concentrations were collected at Baseline (pre-dose), at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose and on Days 3 and 5.
Mean serum N1-glycofurol and N2-glycofurol AUC0-∞ and AUC0-t values were determined using non-compartmental analysis. Only AUC0-∞ values fulfilling the accuracy determination rules were analysed.</description>

        <title>PD Analysis: Mean Change From Baseline in Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1).</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the determination of IGF-1 in serum at Baseline (pre-dose), 6 hours post-dose and at Weeks 5, 9 and 13. Samples were also collected during follow-up at Weeks 17, 21 and 25 (or EW). Serum concentrations of IGF-1 were calculated using the Immulite 2000 Platform for all subjects in the safety population. The production of the reagent kits was stopped by the vendor during the study. The old reagent kits were used for Cohorts 1 and 2 until their expiry date and then the kits were switched to a new reagent and used for remaining subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3. Summary data for serum concentrations of IGF-1 were obtained using both methods (old and new reagent) and the mean change from Baseline at each time point is presented.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (pre-dose) up to Week 25.</time_frame>
        <population>The safety population was all subjects who received the single dose of lanreotide PRF and had at least one post baseline safety assessment. Only subjects with data available for analysis are presented.</population>

            <description>On Day 1, 3 initial subjects in Cohort 1 received 180 mg lanreotide PRF by a single deep subcutaneous injection in the superior, external quadrant of the buttock and a 12-week treatment period then commenced. The dose escalation proceeded with a 3+3+3 scheme. If 0 or 1 out of the 3 dosed subjects had experienced a DLT, 3 more subjects would have been dosed with the same dose. If more than 3 out of 9 subjects had experienced a DLT, dose escalation would have stopped, and the dose declared the maximum administered dose. If ≤3 DLTs had been observed in the 9 treated subjects and the overall safety was in line with the known lanreotide safety profile, the DRC would have allowed the dose to be escalated to 270 mg (Cohort 2).
At the end of the treatment period subjects continued to be assessed over a 12-week follow up period until EOS at Week 25 or EW.</description>

        <title>PD Analysis: Mean Change From Baseline in Growth Hormone (GH).</title>
        <description>GH cycle assessments were performed by taking 5 samples in the morning (with a sample taken every 30 minutes for 2 hours) at Baseline (pre-dose), Week 5 and Week 13. Summary data for the mean of the 5 samplings of the GH cycle were generated and the mean change from Baseline at each time point is presented.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (pre-dose) up to Week 13.</time_frame>
        <population>The safety population was all subjects who received the single dose of lanreotide PRF and had at least one post baseline safety assessment. Only subjects with data available for analysis are presented.</population>

            <title>180 mg Lanreotide PRF</title>
            <description>On Day 1, 3 initial subjects in Cohort 1 received 180 mg lanreotide PRF by a single deep subcutaneous injection in the superior, external quadrant of the buttock and a 12-week treatment period then commenced. The dose escalation proceeded with a 3+3+3 scheme. If 0 or 1 out of the 3 dosed subjects had experienced a DLT, 3 more subjects would have been dosed with the same dose. If more than 3 out of 9 subjects had experienced a DLT, dose escalation would have stopped, and the dose declared the maximum administered dose. If ≤3 DLTs had been observed in the 9 treated subjects and the overall safety was in line with the known lanreotide safety profile, the DRC would have allowed the dose to be escalated to 270 mg (Cohort 2).
At the end of the treatment period subjects continued to be assessed over a 12-week follow up period until EOS at Week 25 or EW.</description>

Cohort 2 subjects were treated and reviewed on a 1+2+2+2+2 scheme. If no DLT was experienced, 2 more subjects would have been dosed with the same dose.

Cohort 3 subjects were treated and reviewed on a 2+2+2+3 scheme. An additional subject was also dosed in this cohort as it was considered unethical to exclude an eligible subject.
