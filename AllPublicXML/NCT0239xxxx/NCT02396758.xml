  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine the optimum dose of thrombolytic and duration of the ultrasound
      procedure (together defined as the APT Procedure) as a treatment for acute submassive
      pulmonary embolism (PE). Symptomatic submassive PE are participants with acute (less than or
      equal to [≤]14 days) PE with normal systemic arterial blood pressure (greater than [&gt;] 90
      mmHg) and evidence of RV dysfunction (right ventricular to left ventricular diameter ratio,
      that is; RV/LV ratio greater than or equal to [≥] 0.9). Participants with submassive PE will
      be randomized to one of four APT treatment groups: ultrasound of 2 and 6 hours (hrs) with
      r-tPA 2 milligrams (mg)/hr/catheter and ultrasound 4 and 6 hours with r-tPA, 1
      mg/hr/catheter. On 08 June 2016, randomization into treatment group 4 (APT/6 hours-r-tPA/2
      mg/hr/catheter) was closed following a reported intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and death in a
      study participant in this arm.

      This study is designed to investigate the lowest recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
      (r-tPA) dose-ultrasound treatment time required to achieve the same reductions in thrombus
      burden and associated improvement in physiologic parameters demonstrated in ULTIMA (EKOS 08
      [NCT01166997]) and SEATTLE II (EKOS 09 [NCT01513759]). Results of this study are intended to
      inform the study design for further studies of the Acoustic Pulse Thrombolysis (APT)
      Procedure. Analysis of the first 100 evaluable participants in the United States study
      suggested a degree of equipoise between treatment groups 1, 2 and 3 of the protocol and
      therefore the sample size has been extended and additional sites in the United Kingdom (UK)
      National Health Service included, with a view to adding to the findings of the OPTALYSE study
      from sites in the UK and increasing the number of participants treated by treatment protocol.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Thrombus Burden by Miller Score as Assessed by Pulmonary Arteriogram (PAgram) at Day 0</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 0 (within 4 hours after APT end)</time_frame>
    <description>Miller score is composed of a score for arterial obstruction (objective score) and a score for reduction of peripheral perfusion of lungs (subjective evaluation). Right pulmonary artery (PA) is assigned 9 segmental arteries (3 to the upper, 2 to the middle, and 4 to the lower lobe), and left PA is assigned only 7 segmental arteries (2 to the upper, 2 to the lingula, and 3 to the lower lobe). Presence of segmental emboli, regardless of the degree of obstruction, is scored 1 point. Proximal emboli to the segmental level are scored a value equal to the number of segmental arteries arising distally. Maximal score of obstruction=16. Reduction of peripheral perfusion is scored by dividing each lung into upper, middle, and lower zones and by using a 4-point scale: 0=normal perfusion; 1=moderately reduced perfusion; 2=severely reduced perfusion; 3=no perfusion. Maximal score of reduced perfusion=18. Thus, the maximal Miller score =34. Higher Miller score=more thrombus burden.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Thrombus Burden by Modified Miller Score as Assessed by CTA Scan at Day 0</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 0 (within 4 hours after APT end)</time_frame>
    <description>Modified miller score quantifies thrombus burden on CTA scans. Each segmental pulmonary artery (9 on the right, 7 on the left) that is fully or partly occluded by thrombus is given a score of 1. Any further proximal involves vessels score the number of segmental branches distal to that vessel, thereby giving a modified miller score of 0 (no thrombus) to 16 (thrombus in all segmental arteries or saddle embolism).</description>

    <description>Borg is a 10-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea (difficulty in breathing) and fatigue experienced before and after the 6MW distance test. Scores ranges from 0 (for no shortness of breath, or no fatigue) to 10 (for the greatest shortness of breath ever experienced, or maximum amount of fatigue felt).

    <time_frame>Day 30, Day 365</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS-PF 6b questionnaire is developed by including 2-items from item-improved Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and 4-items from item-improved Physical Function-10 (PF-10) instruments. Both of these instruments assess participant's present abilities. Both &quot;Item-Improved instruments&quot; have 5-response options: HAQ - 1=&quot;without any difficulty,&quot; 2=&quot;with a little difficulty,&quot; 3=&quot;with some difficulty,&quot; 4=&quot;with much difficulty,&quot; 5=&quot;unable to do&quot;; PF-10 - 1=&quot;not at all,&quot; 2=&quot;very little,&quot; 3=&quot;somewhat,&quot; 4=&quot;quite a lot,&quot; 5=&quot;cannot do.&quot; Total score is the average of all scores of component items, which ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (worst disability).</description>

    <measure>Change in Pulmonary Embolism Quality of Life (PEmb-QOL) Score From Day 30 to Day 365</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30, Day 365</time_frame>
    <description>The PEmb-QoL questionnaire contains 6 dimensions that has been created based on the contents of the items, frequency of complaints (Question [Q]1; score range: 1 [every day] to 5 [never]), activities of daily living (ADL) limitations (Q4; score range: 1 [limited a lot] to 3 [not at all]), work-related problems (Q5; response: yes/no), social limitations (Q6; score range: 1 [not at all] to 5 [extremely]), intensity of complaints (Q7 [pain in chest/shoulders]/8 [breathlessness]; score range: 1 [none] to 6 [very serious]) and emotional complaints (Q9; score range: 1 [at all times] to 6 [none of the times]). Total Score for all dimensions are calculated by the sum of the scores for each item of the dimension divided by the number of items. Total score ranges from 1 (better quality of life) to 100 (worst quality of life). Higher scores indicate poorer outcome (decreased quality of life). Questions 1, 4, 5, and 9 are reverse scored. Questions 2 and 3 provide descriptive information.</description>
