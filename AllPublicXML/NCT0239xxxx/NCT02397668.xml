      To demonstrate the proof of principle and initial clinical safety of the Cor TRICUSPID ECM
      Valve (or Cor PEDIATRIC Tricuspid ECM Valve) and increase the efficiency of the device
      development process by identifying appropriate modifications to the implant procedure or the
      device.

      CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. has developed a device for heart valve replacement, the
      CorMatrix® Cor ECM® Tricuspid Valve, which can be implanted to replace dysfunctional
      tricuspid heart valves. This Early Feasibility Study is proposed to obtain initial insights
      into the ability to successfully implant the Tricuspid Valve, the clinical safety of the
      device, and whether the device performs its intended use. The study is a multi-center,
      prospective, single-arm, Early Feasibility Study (EFS) of subjects receiving the Cor
      TRICUSPID ECM Valve or Cor PEDIATRIC Tricuspid ECM Valve. The study will be conducted at up
      to 8 sites.

      Up to 15 subjects will undergo tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) with the CorMatrix ECM Valve
      for the surgical management of tricuspid valve disease. The cohort will include up to 10
      adult patients and up to 5 pediatric patients.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with a regurgitant or absent tricuspid valve requiring surgical treatment
             including those patients having concomitant cardiac procedures

          2. Male or female

          3. Patient/authorized legal guardian understands the nature of the procedure, is willing
             to comply with associated follow-up evaluations, and provides written informed consent
             and the pediatric patient (if applicable) provides written assent (if able) prior to
             procedure

          4. Patient/patient's authorized legal guardian is geographically stable (or willing to
             return for required study follow-up) and understands and is willing to fulfill all of
             the expected requirements of this clinical protocol

          5. Children with congenital disease where the Cor PEDIATRIC Tricuspid ECM Valve would be
             the physiological right-sided valve

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Tricuspid annulus too small (&lt; 10mm) to accommodate the Cor Tricuspid ECM Valve

          2. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 25%

          3. Mean pulmonary pressure &gt; 50mm Hg or pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 6
             Woods Units

          4. Emergency cardiac procedure. An example would be a person requiring resuscitation and
             in cardiogenic shock. An unscheduled or unplanned emergency surgery

             thrombocytopenia (absolute platelet count &lt;30k). Patient can be enrolled regardless of
             these parameters if in the opinion of the Investigating Surgeon the coagulopathy can
             be adequately reversed by transfusions. An example would be the reversal of
             thrombocytopenia by transfusion of platelets

         13. Known cancer (cancer-free &lt;1 year; does not include non-metastatic basal cell
             carcinoma or cervical carcinoma) and/or undergoing treatment including chemotherapy
             and radiotherapy

         14. Hematological disorders (e.g., aplastic anemia) or patients taking bone marrow
             suppressant drugs

         15. Known sensitivity to porcine materials

         16. Contraindication to anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy (aspirin (ASA) and/or Plavix)

         17. Patients who are pregnant (method of assessment Investigator's discretion)

         18. Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
