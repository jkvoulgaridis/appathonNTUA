    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of lower limb-ischemia induced Remote Ischemic
      Conditioning (RIC) in the perioperative period before, during, and after Orthotopic Liver
      Transplantation (OLT). Remote ischemic conditioning will consist of 3 cycles of 5 minutes of
      lower limb ischemia induced via a mid-thigh pneumatic tourniquet, followed by 5 minutes of
      reperfusion. Interventions will take place after anesthesia induction but before surgery, at
      the completion of the procedure, and on the mornings of post-operative days 1-4.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is associated with a very high risk of complications.
      In a recent multi-center study of 450 patients, 79% had at least one complication and 63% had
      severe (Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher) complications. The number and severity of
      complications are associated with death within 30 days, hospital length of stay, graft and
      patient survival. Infections are the most common group of complications, followed by
      pulmonary, renal and liver graft dysfunction. Interventions that decrease these complications
      after OLT are likely to improve clinical outcomes.

      Remote ischemic conditioning is an innate biological phenomenon wherein a brief single or
      repetitive ischemic stimulus in an organ or tissue such as skeletal muscle induce protection
      in remote/distant organs against ischemia and other noxious stimuli. This effect can be
      induced by inflating a pneumatic tourniquet on a leg or arm for a few minutes (usually 5-10)
      and subsequently deflating to allow reperfusion. This process is usually repeated 3-4 times
      to ensure an adequate dose of the conditioning stimulus. The conditioning stimulus could be
      applied before (Preconditioning), concurrent with (Perconditioning), or soon after the index
      noxious/ischemic insult (Postconditioning).

      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility, patient acceptance, and safety of RIC in
      liver recipients. In addition, the investigators will obtain data on posttransplant
      complications. Information obtained from this study will help guide the design of a future
      randomized, controlled trial to test the benefit of RIC in liver recipients.

          <description>Participants will receive RIC during transplant and the initial four post-transplant days. During transplant: first intervention after induction of anesthesia but before commencing surgery and the second at the conclusion of the procedure. After transplant: RIC applied daily during the first four consecutive postoperative days. Pneumatic tourniquet will be used to induce RIC
Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC): Each RIC intervention will comprise three cycles of 5 minutes of inflation followed by 5 minutes of deflation of a pneumatic tourniquet placed in mid-thigh.

          <description>Percentage of patients with Clavien-Dindo &gt;/= grade III b complications (Dindo D, Demartines N, Clavien P, Annals of Surgery 2004).
The Clavien-Dindo Complications grade ranges from Grade I (Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic and radiological interventions Allowed therapeutic regimens are: drugs as antiemetics, antipyretics, analgetics, diuretics and electrolytes and physiotherapy. This grade also includes wound infections opened at the bedside) to Grade V (Death). Grade IIIb would be any intervention requiring general anesthesia.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Two modifications resulted in a smaller number of subjects. Number of cycles, the duration of each cycle and the number of postoperative interventions were not addressed. Lack of randomization led to historical cohort to evaluate some outcomes.</limitations_and_caveats>
