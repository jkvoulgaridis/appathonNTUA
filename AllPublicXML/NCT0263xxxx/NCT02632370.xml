  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In support of the US marketing application for 5-ALA, this single arm trial is being
      conducted to establish the efficacy and safety of Gliolan® (5-ALA) in patients with newly
      diagnosed or recurrent malignant gliomas. The hypothesis of the study is Gliolan® (5-ALA), as
      an adjunct to tumor resection, is safe and that real-time tissue fluorescence correlates with
      malignant histopathology. The primary objective in this single arm study is to define the
      positive predictive value (PPV) of Gliolan®-induced PPIX fluorescence for malignant tumor at
      the time of initial resection and first use of FGS by taking a biopsy of tissue presenting
      with red fluorescence when observed during the course of resection of new or recurrent
      malignant gliomas. The functionality and performance reliability of the blue light excitation
      microscope platforms will be assessed.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine whether Gliolan® (5-ALA)-induced PPIX fluorescence correlates with
           malignant tumor histopathology (in a minimum of 3-5 serial biopsies taken from the red
           fluorescent region of tissue resection).

        -  To determine the patient safety profile of both oral Gliolan® (5-ALA), as well as use of
           the fluorescence operative microscope. These will include use of commonly accepted
           toxicity measures as well as recording surgically-related neurological deficits within
           the six weeks after surgery.

        -  To determine functionality and performance reliability of the blue light excitation
           microscope platforms (Zeiss Pentero, Leica OH4, Leica OH6 and others).

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To correlate PPIX-containing extracellular microvesicles recovered from blood (at
           multiple time points prior to and following tumor resection) with the pre-operative MRI
           tumor volume.

        -  To characterize the presence and longitudinal changes in microvesicle biomarkers
           recovered from blood evaluating EGFRvIII, IDH1/2 wt and mutations and others. These
           microvesicular blood genes will be identified and correlated with the same
           microvesicular genes identified in tissue at the time of surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects included must have an MRI documenting a primary brain tumor for which
             resection is indicated and has been planned. These patients will include those with
             newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant gliomas. Standard criteria for diagnosis will
             include a distinct ring-like pattern of contrast enhancement with thick irregular
             walls on MRI for patients with a presumed newly diagnosed malignant glioma.

          -  Age 18-80.

          -  Karnofsky&gt;60%.

          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

        Leukocytes &gt;3,000/mL Platelets &gt;100,000/mL Total bilirubin below upper limit of normal AST
        (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine below upper limit
        of normal OR Creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels
        above institutional normal.

          -  The effects of 5-aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) on the developing human fetus are
             unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. A pregnancy test will be
             performed for all women of childbearing ability prior to surgery (see Exclusion
             Criteria below). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             Translation will be provided as appropriate by institution.

          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities: Both men and women and members of all ethnic groups
             are eligible for this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with radiographic tumors of, or involving, nonresectable midline, the basal
             ganglia, or brain stem as assessed by MRI.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Patients should refrain from use of other
             potential phototoxic substances (e.g. tetracyclines, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones,
             hypericin extracts) for 72 h.

          -  Personal or family history of porphyria.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. . Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with 5-aminolevulinic
             acid (5-ALA), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA).

          -  Women who are pregnant will be excluded from the trial as aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is
             unknown to be teratogenic or have abortifacient effects Prior history of GI
             perforation, diverticulitis, and/or peptic ulcer disease.
