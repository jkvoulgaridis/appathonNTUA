      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study followed by
      an open-label treatment phase. To evaluate the effect of erenumab (AMG 334) compared to
      placebo on the change from baseline in monthly migraine days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with
      episodic migraine. The study is designed to evaluate if treatment with erenumab once a month
      for 6 months compared with placebo is effective in reducing the mean monthly migraine days.
      Additionally, this study will continue to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erenumab during
      the open label treatment phase where subjects will continue to receive active treatment
      monthly.

    <time_frame>4-week baseline phase and months 4, 5 and 6 of double-blind treatment phase.</time_frame>
    <description>A migraine day was defined as any calendar day in which the participant experienced a qualified migraine headache (onset, continuation or recurrence of the migraine headache). A qualified migraine headache was a migraine with or without aura, lasting for ≥ 30 minutes, and meeting at least one of the following criteria: a) ≥ 2 of the following pain features: unilateral, throbbing, moderate to severe, exacerbated with exercise/physical activity; b) ≥ 1 of the following associated symptoms: nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. Change from baseline was calculated using the mean monthly migraine days from months 4, 5 and 6 of the double-blind treatment phase minus the number of migraine days during the 4-week baseline phase. Least squares (LS) mean was estimated using a generalized linear mixed model which included treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, stratification factor (current, prior only, or no prior/current treatment), and baseline value as covariates.</description>

At least a 50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days was determined if; (mean monthly migraine days over the last three months of the double-blind treatment phase minus baseline monthly migraine days) * 100 / baseline monthly migraine days, was less than or equal to -50%.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Monthly Acute Migraine-Specific Medication Treatment Days at Months 4, 5 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week baseline phase and months 4, 5 and 6 of double-blind treatment phase.</time_frame>
    <description>An acute migraine-specific medication treatment day was defined as any calendar day during which the participant took a migraine-specific medication (ie, triptan or ergotamine-derivatives).
The change from baseline was calculated using the mean monthly acute migraine-specific medication treatment days over the last three months (months 4, 5 and 6) of the double-blind treatment phase minus the baseline monthly acute migraine-specific medication treatment days.
LS mean was estimated using a generalized linear mixed model which included treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, stratification factor (prior/current treatment), and baseline value as covariates.</description>

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication (or other new use) have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.

      <recruitment_details>The study was initiated on 06 January 2016 at 43 centers in Japan and consists of a 24-week double-blind treatment phase followed by a 76-week open-label treatment phase. Results are reported for the analysis of the 24-week double-blind treatment phase.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Adult participants with episodic migraine were randomized 2:1:2:2 to receive placebo, erenumab 28 milligram (mg), erenumab 70 mg, or erenumab 140 mg once monthly (QM). Randomization was stratified by prior/current treatment with migraine prophylactic medication status (current, prior only, or no prior/current treatment).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Monthly Migraine Days at Months 4, 5 and 6</title>
        <description>A migraine day was defined as any calendar day in which the participant experienced a qualified migraine headache (onset, continuation or recurrence of the migraine headache). A qualified migraine headache was a migraine with or without aura, lasting for ≥ 30 minutes, and meeting at least one of the following criteria: a) ≥ 2 of the following pain features: unilateral, throbbing, moderate to severe, exacerbated with exercise/physical activity; b) ≥ 1 of the following associated symptoms: nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. Change from baseline was calculated using the mean monthly migraine days from months 4, 5 and 6 of the double-blind treatment phase minus the number of migraine days during the 4-week baseline phase. Least squares (LS) mean was estimated using a generalized linear mixed model which included treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, stratification factor (current, prior only, or no prior/current treatment), and baseline value as covariates.</description>

        <description>An acute migraine-specific medication treatment day was defined as any calendar day during which the participant took a migraine-specific medication (ie, triptan or ergotamine-derivatives).
The change from baseline was calculated using the mean monthly acute migraine-specific medication treatment days over the last three months (months 4, 5 and 6) of the double-blind treatment phase minus the baseline monthly acute migraine-specific medication treatment days.
LS mean was estimated using a generalized linear mixed model which included treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, stratification factor (prior/current treatment), and baseline value as covariates.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study has an open-label treatment phase that is ongoing. Final study results will be updated after the trial is completed.</limitations_and_caveats>
