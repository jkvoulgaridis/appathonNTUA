      This is a Phase 1, open-label, three-period sequential dosing study being conducted primarily
      to determine the pharmacokinetics of Triferic iron administered intravenously to healthy
      adults.. Participation will be up to 5 weeks total duration including Screening, Baseline,
      Treatment Period, and Follow-up. Following Screening, subjects will be admitted to the clinic
      on Day -1, prior to Baseline (Day 1). During the Treatment Period, subjects will receive two
      doses of Triferic. Each subject will receive a single 6-mg dose of Triferic administered IV
      over 3 hours (hr) on one day (Day 2), and a single 35-µg/kg dose of Triferic administered IV
      push the following day (Day 3). On Day 4, subjects will be discharged from the clinic and
      will return approximately one week later for their final Follow-up visit.

          <description>After enrollment, all subjects underwent blood sampling for pharmacokinetic (PK) purposes over 16 hours on Day 1 to establish a baseline. On Day 2, subjects received a single 6 mg dose of Triferic administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours, with blood sampling for PK purposes over 16 hours. On Day 3, subject received Triferic 35 micrograms/kg as an intravenous push (administered in 30 - 60 seconds), with blood sampling for PK purposes over 16 hours.
