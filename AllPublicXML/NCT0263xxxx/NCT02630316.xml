  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized (1:1 inhaled treprostinil: placebo), double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled treprostinil in
      subjects with pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with interstitial lung
      disease (ILD) including combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE). The study will
      include about 314 patients at approximately 120 clinical trial centers. The treatment phase
      of the study will last approximately 16 weeks. Patients who complete all required assessments
      will also be eligible to enter an open-label, extension study (RIN-PH-202).

      Study RIN-PH-201 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, 16 week,
      parallel group study designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of inhaled treprostinil
      in subjects with PH-ILD. Subjects initiated inhaled treprostinil or placebo at a dose of 3
      breaths (18 mcg) 4 times daily (QID) (during waking hours). Study drug doses were maximized
      throughout the study. Dose escalations (additional 1 breath QID) could occur up to every 3
      days with a target dosing regimen of 9 breaths (54 mcg) QID and a maximum dose of 12 breaths
      (72 mcg) QID, as clinically tolerated. Subjects were assessed during Screening and Baseline
      to determine eligibility for the study. Once eligible, 5 Treatment Phase visits to the clinic
      were required at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 15, and Week 16 (final study visit). An Early
      Termination (ET) Visit was conducted for subjects who discontinued prior to Week 16; all
      assessments planned for the final Week 16 Visit were conducted during the ET Visit, if
      applicable. Subjects were contacted at least weekly by telephone or email to assess tolerance
      to study drug, AEs, and changes to concomitant medications. Efficacy assessments consisted of
      6MWD, plasma NT-proBNP concentration, and time to clinical worsening. Exploratory endpoints
      included change in SGRQ, change in DSP, time to exacerbation of underlying lung disease, and
      PFTs. Safety assessments consisted of the development of AEs, vital signs, clinical
      laboratory parameters, ECG parameters, hospitalizations due to cardiopulmonary indications,
      exacerbations of underlying lung disease, and oxygenation. Subjects who remained on study
      drug, completed all assessments during the 16-week Treatment Phase, and met all eligibility
      criteria were eligible for the open-label extension study (RIN-PH-202). Additionally,
      subjects who withdrew from study drug prior to Week 16 due to clinical worsening and returned
      to the clinic for scheduled visits (excluding the Week 15 Visit) were eligible for RIN
      PH-202.

    <measure>Change in 6-minute Walk Distance (6MWD) Measured at Peak Exposure from Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The intent of the 6MWD test is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out activities of daily living. Change in 6MWD from Baseline to Week 16, correlates with the current clinical standard for assessing patient functional status in the treatment of PH and is considered an objective measure of patient functional status. Subjects will be instructed to walk down a corridor at a comfortable speed as far as they can manage for six minutes. Distance &lt;500 meters suggests considerable exercise limitation; Distance 500-800 meters suggests moderate limitation; Distance &gt;800 meters (with no rests) suggests mild or no limitation. Peak exposure 6MWD will occur by conducting 6-minute walk test (6MWT) within 10 to 60 minutes after the most recent dose of study drug dose.</description>

    <measure>Change in Plasma Concentration of N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) from Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) serum concentration is a useful biomarker associated with changes in right heart morphology and function. NT-proBNP serum concentration will be assessed to compare the severity of heart failure at Baseline and Week 16. Blood for NT-proBNP assessment must be drawn prior to conducting the 6-minute walk test (6MWT).</description>

               1. PCWP &gt; 15 mmHg

               2. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%.

             Note: Subjects with abnormal left ventricular function attributable entirely to
             impaired left ventricular filling due to the effects of right ventricular overload
