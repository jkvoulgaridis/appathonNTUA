  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to test the safety of a cancer drug called larotrectinib in children.
      The cancer must have a change in a particular gene (NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3). Larotrectinib
      blocks the actions of these NTRK genes in cancer cells and can therefore be used to treat
      cancer.

      The first study part (Phase 1) is done to determine what dose level of larotrectinib is safe
      for children, how the drug is absorbed and changed by their bodies and how well the cancer
      responds to the drug. The main purpose of the second study part (Phase 2) is to investigate
      how well and how long different cancer types respond to the treatment with larotrectininb.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to determine the safety and efficacy of oral larotrectinib in
      pediatric patients with advanced solid or primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

      The secondary objectives comprise e.g. the determination of the pharmacokinetic properties,
      the maximum tolerated dose/ recommended dose and the tumor-type specific efficacy of
      larotrectinib. In addition, pain status and health-related quality of life of the pediatric
      patients will be assessed.

                  systemic curative therapy exists; OR Infants from birth and older with a
