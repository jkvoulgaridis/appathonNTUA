      This phase II trial studies how well nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine therapy or
      sargramostim works in treating patients with breast cancer. Vaccines made from peptide or
      antigen and/or a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build
      an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express breast cancer. It is not yet
      known whether nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine or sargramostim is more effective in treating
      patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate for nelipepimut-S-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL; cluster of
      differentiation [CD]8+ T cell) response in patients receiving NeuVax (nelipepimut-S plus
      GM-CSF [sargramostim]) compared to patients receiving GM-CSF alone (control).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity profile and frequency of adverse events in women with ductal carcinoma in situ
      (DCIS) of the breast receiving nelipepimut-S vaccine as compared to women receiving GM-CSF
      alone.

      II. Presence of DCIS at resection. III. Difference in HER2 expression in the biopsy and the
      surgical specimen excised post-vaccination.

      IV. Histologic responses:

      IVa. Degree of lymphocyte infiltration determined on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained
      slides and immune infiltration as determined by multiplex immunofluorescence staining for
      markers including but not limited to CD3, CD4 and CD8.

      IVb. Immune infiltrates in normal tissue maximally distant from the tumor (in mastectomy
      samples).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine intradermally (ID) on days 0 and 14
      and then undergo surgery on day 28.

      ARM II: Patients receive sargramostim ID on days 0 and 14 and then undergo surgery on day 28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months.

    <measure>Change in the number of nelipepimut-S-cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), detected using a dextramer assay</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-vaccination to up to 1 month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Change of nelipepimut-S-specific CTL at the 1 month (+/- 7 days) after completion of the vaccination series timepoint from baseline will be estimated for each group using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, whichever appropriate, will be used to compare the change between the two groups. Nelipepimut-S-specific CTL will also be measured repeatedly through 6 months after the last vaccination. Repeated measures analysis including mixed effects model will be performed to analyze the effect of treatment on nelipepimut-S-specific CTL change over time.</description>

    <measure>Toxicity profile according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version (v) 4.03</measure>

    <description>Compared between the two groups. Adverse events by grade and relationship will be summarized by tabulation for each group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At resection</time_frame>
    <description>The histologic data will be presented in tabular form to examine whether the vaccine treatment is associated with the absence of DCIS, induction of necrosis, reduction in histologic grade, or a reduction in the size of DCIS. These data will be descriptive only. The data will be obtained from the standard surgical pathology report generated as part of the patient's clinical care. Formal comparisons of these parameters would likely require a larger sample size to see a statistically significant difference in presence of DCIS, induction of necrosis, or reduction in size of DCIS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in HER2 expression</measure>
    <time_frame>In the biopsy and the surgical specimen excised post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>HER2 scoring will be determined according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists clinical guidelines. Positive cases are those with circumferential membrane staining that is complete, intense, and within &gt; 10% of tumor cells (score 3+). Negative cases are defined as those with no observable staining, or membrane staining that is incomplete and is faint/barely perceptible and within less than or equal to 10% of tumor cells (score 0) or incomplete membrane staining that is faint/barely perceptible and within &gt; 10% of tumor cells (score 1+). Equivocal or indeterminate cases are those with circumferential membrane staining that is incomplete and or weak/moderate and within &gt; 10% of tumor cells or complete and circumferential membrane staining that is intense and within less than or equal to 10% of tumor cells (score 2+). Pre-vaccination and post-vaccination specimens will be compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of lymphocyte infiltration</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of the vaccination series timepoint</time_frame>
    <description>Will define intra-tumoral tumor infiltration lymphocyte (TIL) as those within the basement membrane. Stromal TIL will be defined as those in the periductal/lobular stroma including the intralobular stromal infiltrate. Cells in the interlobular stromal inflammatory infiltrate will be excluded. All mononuclear cells will be scored but polymorphonuclear leukocytes will be excluded. Intra-tumoral and stromal TILs will be scored as a continuous variable and the percentage of in the surgical specimen will be compared to that in the pre-vaccination diagnostic biopsy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immune cell analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of the vaccination series timepoint</time_frame>
    <description>Will utilize tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF), a novel, highly multiplexed imaging modality that allows for the imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections at subcellular resolution across 20-60 distinct antigen channels. 4-6 Antibody panels that will be used include but may not be limited to an already optimized immune panel.</description>

    <measure>Immune infiltrates in normal tissue maximally distant from the tumor (in mastectomy samples)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of the vaccination series timepoint</time_frame>
    <description>In the mastectomy samples only will perform core needle biopsies of the normal tissue, maximally distant from the tumor (ex vivo after the mastectomy if performed) and store for future studies of immune infiltrates.</description>
