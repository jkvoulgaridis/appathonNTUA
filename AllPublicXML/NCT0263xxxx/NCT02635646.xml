      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of a family and interdisciplinary approach
      on individual and family insulin resistance and insulin secretion in patients with
      prediabetes.

      This a randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of the following
      treatments:

        1. Family and interdisciplinary approach that includes nutritional, physical activity and
           psychological counseling + metformin 850mg twice at day for 12 months

        2. Individual approach that includes nutritional and physical activity counseling +
           metformin 850mg twice at day for 12 months

      To improve individual and family insulin resistance and insulin secretion in patients with
      prediabetes.

      Patients will have a follow-up visit every month in the Metabolic Research Laboratory at the
      University of Guanajuato, Mexico, and will have a fasting measurement of lipids, glucose and
      insulin every 3 months, as well as 2h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at basal, 6 and 12
      months.

    <description>Whole body insulin sensitivity as determined by the Matsuda Index was calculated using the following formula: 10,000 divided by the square root of (FPI* FPG) * (xGPC* xIPC) Where FPI is fasting plasma insulin expressed as uU/ml, FPG is fasting plasma glucose expressed as mg/dL, xGPC is mean plasma glucose concentration after the load and xIPC is the mean insulin concentration after the load. Values calculated on samples taken at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes of a 2 hour OGTT. Values typically range from 0 to 12 units with higher scores indicating better insulin sensitivity (better result). A value of 2.5 or less is indicative of low insulin sensitivity (worst result).</description>
