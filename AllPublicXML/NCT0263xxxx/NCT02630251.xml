  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, GSK2820151, is a Bromodomain (BRD) and Extra-Terminal (BET) inhibitor arising
      from a distinct structural class. GSK2820151 potently inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in
      vivo in animal models. This first time in human (FTIH), open-label, dose escalation study is
      to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical
      activity of GSK2820151 in subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. The objective is
      to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GSK2820151 in
      subjects 18 years or older with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. Eligible subjects with
      advanced or recurrent solid tumors will be enrolled in the dosing cohorts until MTD is
      established. All subjects will receive study drug. Subjects may continue treatment in the
      study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The
      duration of study will depend on recruitment rates and the timing of subjects' duration on
      study (withdrawal rates due to toxicity or progression). It is anticipated that approximately
      30 to 50 subjects will be enrolled.

      GSK has decided to discontinue further development of GSK2820151 due to challenges in
      recruitment.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    In 2017, GSK2820151 was terminated due to development of another BET Inhibitor (GSK525762) with
    a better understanding of the risk benefit profile.

    <description>An accelerated dose escalation phase will be utilized in order to minimize sub-optimal drug exposures, followed by a conventional 3+3 dose escalation phase to achieve MTD. Initially, one subject per dose cohort will be recruited (accelerated dose escalation phase) until the first instance of a &gt;=Grade 2 drug related toxicity or dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Further cohorts will be recruited in blocks of three subjects (3+3 dose escalation phase). Projected dose levels are 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg. Additional subjects may be enrolled at previously cleared dose levels in order to obtain further data for PK and/or PD analysis. Once MTD is determined, additional subjects (18 subjects total at MTD) may be enrolled to collect additional safety data.</description>

             mitomycin C within 42 days prior to the first dose of GSK2820151. Prior therapy with
             monoclonal antibodies is permitted so long as 14 days have elapsed since therapy and
             all therapy-related toxicity has resolved to Grade 1 or less. Note that an
             investigational drug is defined as a drug without an approved oncologic indication.

             2) Any radiotherapy within 14 days or major surgery within 28 days prior to the first

             prostate cancer should remain on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists
             or antagonists. Subjects with prostate cancer may also remain on low-dose prednisone

             4) In addition, any therapy-related toxicity must have resolved to Grade 1 or less,
             with the exception of alopecia (acceptable at any Grade) and peripheral neuropathy

             coagulation parameters must be normalized prior to the first dose of GSK2820151. Low
             dose (prophylactic) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is permitted. In addition, INR
             must be monitored in accordance with local institutional practices.

          -  Current use of a prohibited medication or planned use of any forbidden medications
             during treatment with GSK2820151.

          -  Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g., unstable or uncompensated
             respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiac disease, or clinically significant bleeding

             psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with subject's safety,
             obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures, in the opinion of
             the Investigator.

          -  Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord
             compression. NOTE: Subjects previously treated for these conditions that have had
             stable central nervous system (CNS) disease (verified with consecutive imaging
             studies) for &gt;1 months, are asymptomatic and off corticosteroids, or are on stable
             dose of corticosteroids for at least 1 month prior to study Day 1 are permitted.
             Stability of brain metastases must be confirmed with imaging. Subject treated with
             gamma knife therapy can be enrolled 2 weeks post-procedure as long as there are no
             post-procedure complications/stable. In addition, subjects treated or currently taking
             enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant (EIAC) are allowed on study.

          -  Cardiac abnormalities as evidenced by any of the following: History of or current
             &quot;untreated&quot; clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, Clinically significant

             Association (NYHA), History of acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina and
             myocardial infarction), coronary angioplasty, or stenting within the past 3 months.

             (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel) will not be permitted to enroll.

          -  Any of the following electrocardiogram (ECG) findings: Baseline QTcF &gt;=450 millisecond
             (msec). NOTE: Any clinically significant ECG assessments should be reviewed by the
             site cardiologist prior to study entry.

          -  Any of the following liver findings: ALT &gt;2.5xULN, ALT &gt; 5xULN with liver
             metastases/tumor infiltration, Bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%), Current active
             liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic
             gallstones, liver metastases or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per
             investigator assessment). NOTE: Stable chronic liver disease should generally be

             esophageal or gastric varices, persistent jaundice or cirrhosis

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. History
             of known HIV infection. NOTE: Subjects with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior
             resolved disease can be enrolled only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C
             ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is obtained.

          -  Any serious known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction(s) to GSK2820151 or
             idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to the investigational drug.
