  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese pregnant women (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) are more likely than their normal-weight counterparts
      to require induction of labor because of increased rates of obstetric complications including
      pregnancy related hypertensive disorders, diabetes, and prolonged gestations. Several studies
      have shown that obese women experience increased labor duration and oxytocin needs when
      compared to normal-weight women. This in turn results in increased rates for unplanned
      cesarean delivery (CD) as a result of failed induction of labor (IOL), arrest disorders and
      non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, that is dose-dependent with increasing class of
      obesity. The investigators hypothesize that obese pregnant women and unfavorable cervix
      (Bishop score ≤ 6), IOL ≥ 24 weeks gestation using the Foley balloon plus vaginal misoprostol
      will result in reduced cesarean delivery rates when compared to vaginal misoprostol alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nulliparous pregnant women at ≥ 32 weeks' gestation admitted to labor and delivery for IOL
      and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be approached by the research staff.
      Group 1 will be composed of women allocated to the Foley balloon plus misoprostol. These
      women will receive vaginal misoprostol per standard protocol at 25 micrograms every 4 hours.
      In addition, a 26 Fr-Foley balloon catheter will be inserted by routine clinical standards.
      The Foley will be inserted through the internal cervical os, filled with 60 mL of normal
      saline, and then pulled snugly against the internal os. The catheter of the Foley will be
      taped to the patient's inner thigh under gentle traction. If the Foley is unable to be
      placed, the patient will be reexamined in 1 hour and placement will be reattempted if
      Bishop's score is still 6 or less by the healthcare provider. When the Foley balloon had
      fallen out or had to be removed because 12 hours have passed since insertion as per protocol,
      further management of labor will be left at the discretion of the labor team.

      Group 2 will be composed of women allocated to vaginal misoprostol-only. These women will
      receive 25 micrograms of misoprostol per vagina every 4 hours. Once the cervix becomes
      favorable (Bishop score &gt; 6), misoprostol administration will be discontinued. Similarly,
      further management will be left at the discretion of the labor team.

      In both groups, if IV oxytocin is indicated, it will be withheld until 4 hours after the last
      dose of misoprostol to prevent uterine hyperstimulation. Other aspects of labor management
      will be similar for both groups, including continuous electronic fetal monitoring with
      external Doppler device or fetal scalp electrode. Uterine contraction assessment will be
      performed with either an external tocodynamometer or an intrauterine pressure catheter.

          <title>Bishop score</title>
          <description>Bishop score, also known as cervix score, is a pre-labor scoring system to assist in predicting whether induction of labor will be required. Score ranges from 0 to 13. A score of 5 or less suggests that labor is unlikely to start without induction. A score of 9 or more indicates that labor will most likely commence spontaneously. Scores between 5 and 9 require additional consideration and professional judgement for clinical management.</description>

            <description>These women will receive vaginal misoprostol per standard protocol at 25 micrograms every 4 hours. In addition, a 26 Fr-Foley balloon catheter will be inserted by routine clinical standards. The Foley will be inserted through the internal cervical os, filled with 60 mL of normal saline, and then pulled snugly against the internal os. The catheter of the Foley will be taped to the patient’s inner thigh under gentle traction. If the Foley is unable to be placed, the patient will be reexamined in 1 hour and placement will be reattempted if Bishop’s score is still 6 or less by the healthcare provider. When the Foley balloon had fallen out or had to be removed because 12 hours have passed since insertion as per protocol, further management of labor will be left at the discretion of the labor team.

In addition, a 26 Fr-Foley balloon catheter will be inserted by routine clinical standards.

The catheter of the Foley will be taped to the patient’s inner thigh under gentle traction.

When the Foley balloon had fallen out or had to be removed because 12 hours have passed since insertion as per protocol, further management of labor will be left at the discretion of the labor team.
