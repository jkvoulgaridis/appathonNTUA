  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research study is being carried out in two parts, Phase 1 and Phase 2. The
      primary purpose of the Phase 1 portion of the study is to observe the safety of the
      combination of rociletinib and MPDL3280A in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.

      The primary purpose of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to evaluate the safety and
      anti-tumor effects of the combination of rociletinib and MPDL3280A, at the best doses for the
      combination determined in Phase 1, in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of rociletinib administered in combination with MPDL3280A.

      Phase 1: This will be the dose finding phase of the study. Patients will be enrolled to
      available Dosing Cohort. Patients who have progressed after prior first- or second-generation
      EGFR TKI, regardless of T790M mutation status, will be enrolled.

      Phase 2: Patients will be enrolled into 2 groups. Group A will enroll eligible first-line
      patients who are EGFR TKI treatment-naïve and chemotherapy-naïve. Group B will enroll
      eligible patients who have progressed after prior first- or second-generation EGFR TKI,
      regardless of T790M mutation status.

    <description>To determine the efficacy of the combination of rociletinib and MPDL3280A based on overall response rate per RECIST v1.1 in the following groups of patients:
Group A: Patients with EGFRm advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have not previously received an EGFR TKI or chemotherapy.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate Per Modified RECIST v1.1, Incorporating Immune-related Criteria, in Phase 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 6-9 weeks, up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Conventional response criteria may not be adequate to characterize the antitumor activity of immunotherapeutic agents like MPDL3280A, which can produce delayed responses that may be preceded by initial apparent radiological progression, including the appearance of new lesions. Therefore, modified response criteria have been developed that account for the possible appearance of new lesions and allow radiological progression to be confirmed at a subsequent assessment. In this protocol, patients will be permitted to continue study treatment even after modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for progressive disease are met if the benefit-risk ratio is judged to be favorable.
These modified criteria are derived from RECIST version 1.1 (v1.1) conventions and immune related response criteria (irRC).</description>

    <description>Tumor tissue, plasma, and blood specimens will be used for pharmacodynamic assessment of rociletinib and/or MPDL3280A activity, to evaluate the concordance of mutant EGFR detection between tissue and plasma, and to explore biomarkers that may be predictive of response or resistance to rociletinib and/or MPDL3280A. Biomarkers and changes in biomarker status will be investigated for associations with rociletinib and/or MPDL3280A exposure, safety, and clinical activity.

        <title>Objective Response Rate Per Modified RECIST v1.1, Incorporating Immune-related Criteria, in Phase 2</title>
        <description>Conventional response criteria may not be adequate to characterize the antitumor activity of immunotherapeutic agents like MPDL3280A, which can produce delayed responses that may be preceded by initial apparent radiological progression, including the appearance of new lesions. Therefore, modified response criteria have been developed that account for the possible appearance of new lesions and allow radiological progression to be confirmed at a subsequent assessment. In this protocol, patients will be permitted to continue study treatment even after modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for progressive disease are met if the benefit-risk ratio is judged to be favorable.
These modified criteria are derived from RECIST version 1.1 (v1.1) conventions and immune related response criteria (irRC).</description>
