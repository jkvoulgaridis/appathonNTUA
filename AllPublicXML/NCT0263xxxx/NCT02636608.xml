    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status. The 5 items in the EQ-5D-5L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 5 levels of severity (1: indicating no problem, 2: indicating slight problems, 3: indicating moderate problems, 4: indicating severe problems, 5: indicating extreme problems), and a separate visual analog scale (VAS).
The VAS assesses overall health on a scale from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable). The higher the score the better the health status.</description>

Responses to the 5 dimension scores were combined and converted into a single preference-weighted health utility index score by applying country-specific weights.The range for EQ-5D-5L index score is 0 to 1 where '0' is defined as a health state equivalent to being dead and '1' is full health.The higher the score the better the health status.</description>

    <description>The WPAI Hepatitis C V2.0 is an HCV specific questionnaire used to measure work absenteeism, work presenteeism, and daily activity impairment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Activation Measure 13 (PAM-13)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of treatment (week 12 or 24 depending on the treatment regimen)</time_frame>
    <description>PAM-13 is a measure used to assess the patient knowledge, skill, and confidence for self-management, consisting of 13 questions. Each of the 13 items can be answered with one of four possible response options, which are &quot;disagree strongly&quot; (1), &quot;disagree&quot; (2), &quot;agree&quot; (3), &quot;agree strongly&quot; (4). Scores were summed to calculate the overall raw score, then transformed to a scale with a theoretical range 0 to 100, based on calibration tables, with higher PAM scores indicating that the participant is likely to participate more actively in health care processes and takes more responsibility for his or her health.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status. The 5 items in the EQ-5D-5L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 5 levels of severity (1: indicating no problem, 2: indicating slight problems, 3: indicating moderate problems, 4: indicating severe problems, 5: indicating extreme problems), and a separate visual analog scale (VAS).
The VAS assesses overall health on a scale from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable). The higher the score the better the health status.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Index Score</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status. The 5 items in the EQ-5D-5L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 5 levels of severity (1: indicating no problem, 2: indicating slight problems, 3: indicating moderate problems, 4: indicating severe problems, 5: indicating extreme problems), and a separate visual analog scale (VAS).
Responses to the 5 dimension scores were combined and converted into a single preference-weighted health utility index score by applying country-specific weights.The range for EQ-5D-5L index score is 0 to 1 where '0' is defined as a health state equivalent to being dead and '1' is full health.The higher the score the better the health status.</description>

        <description>The WPAI Hepatitis C V2.0 is an HCV specific questionnaire used to measure work absenteeism, work presenteeism, and daily activity impairment. Respondents were asked about time missed from work and time while at work during which productivity was impaired in the past seven days. Results of WPAI are expressed as a percentage of impairment from 0 to 100, with higher percentages indicating greater impairment and less productivity.
Absenteeism indicates the percentage of work time missed due to health problems.</description>

        <description>The WPAI Hepatitis C V2.0 is an HCV specific questionnaire used to measure work absenteeism, work presenteeism, and daily activity impairment. Respondents were asked about time missed from work and time while at work during which productivity was impaired in the past seven days. Results of WPAI are expressed as a percentage of impairment from 0 to 100, with higher percentages indicating greater impairment and less productivity.
Total work productivity impairment (TWP) indicates the percentage of overall work impairment due to health problems.</description>

        <description>PAM-13 is a measure used to assess the patient knowledge, skill, and confidence for self-management, consisting of 13 questions. Each of the 13 items can be answered with one of four possible response options, which are &quot;disagree strongly&quot; (1), &quot;disagree&quot; (2), &quot;agree&quot; (3), &quot;agree strongly&quot; (4). Scores were summed to calculate the overall raw score, then transformed to a scale with a theoretical range 0 to 100, based on calibration tables, with higher PAM scores indicating that the participant is likely to participate more actively in health care processes and takes more responsibility for his or her health.</description>
