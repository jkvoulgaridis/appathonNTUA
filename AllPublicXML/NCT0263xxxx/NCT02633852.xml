    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, single arm study. The study group will be composed of both type 1
      or 2 diabetes mellitus patients with center involving DME. Patients with partial or
      incomplete response to first-line Bevacizumab (Avastin) treatment of at least 4 monthly
      intravitreal injections and no longer than 12 months of treatment (maximum 12 injections )
      the last 3 injections must be up to 4-6 weeks . Only one eye of each patients can be
      recruited to the study (fellow eye will receive standard of care treatment).

      The study eye will receive intravitreal injection of aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml at enrolment (day
      0). The next follow up visit will be 4 weeks later. At any visit, if sub- or intra-retinal
      (or both) fluid is present or if central macular sub-field thickness according to SD-OCT of
      larger than 300 micron (Heidelberg Spectralis OCT or equivalent), the patient will receive
      intravitreal injection of aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml and treatment interval will remain 4 weeks.
      In case that there will not be resolution or improvement (define as decrease in central
      macular sub-field thickness of 10% or more from the previous visit or gain of one ETDRS line
      or more), the intravitreal injection of aflibercept will be discontinued after 6 monthly
      injections and the patient will be followed every 4 weeks. If there will be worsening of 10%
      or more in macular thickness and/or loss of one EDTRS line or more of acuity following
      treatment discontinuation then injections will be resumed. In cases when there will be no
      sub- or intra-retinal fluid on OCT 4 weeks after an injections, a treat and extend regimen
      (TER) will be applied.

      At any time point there is an option for rescue treatment if there will be worsening of more
      than 10% or increase of 50 micron in macular thickness and loss of one EDTRS line (5 letters)
      or more of acuity, or per the decision of the investigator.

      Patients will receive injection of aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml, and the follow up interval will be
      extended by2 weeks. Maximal treatment interval will be 12 weeks . At any point where sub- or
      intra-retinal (or both) fluid will appear after the TER regimen was initiated, the interval
      between visits and treatments will be reduced back to previous interval which obtained a
      fluid free macula. The follow up period will be 52 weeks.

      After 6 months, focal laser phothocoagulation can be added if needed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Ophthalmic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Incomplete response to previous intravitreal treatment, defined as remaining of sub or
             intraretinal (or both) fluid involving the fovea per OCT after at least 6 monthly
             intravitreal injections and no more than 18 months of treatment (maximum 18
             intravitreal injections). The last 3 injections must be up to 4-6 weeks apart. The
             interval from last treatment to day 0 treatment of the study should be up to 6 months.
             If there will be 10% or more of improvement in central macular sub-field thickness
             according to SD-OCT, in screening compared with examination 4-6 weeks following last
             bevacizumab injection patient cannot be recruited to the study. Patients that will
             have an increase in central thickness of more than 50 microns following 3 intravitreal
             injections will be allowed to participate in the study without the required need of 6
             intravitreal injections.

          2. Central macular sub-field thickness according to SD-OCT of at least 300 micron
             (Heidelberg Spectralis OCT or equivalent).

          3. Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye 20/200 and better, .

          4. Clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilatation to allow fundus imaging.

          5. Intraocular pressure (IOP) of 21 mmHg or less.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Ophthalmic Exclusion Criteria

          1. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual
             acuity loss would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,
             pigmentabnormalities, dense sub-foveal hard exudates).

          2. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,
             neovascular glaucoma, etc.).

          3. History of pan-retinal photocoagulation or focal laser treatment within three months
             prior to enrollment or anticipated need for pan-retinal photocoagulation in the six
             months following enrollment.

          4. History of intraocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior three months or anticipated within
             the next six months following enrollment.

        General Exclusion Criteria

          1. Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant.

          2. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular
             disease, and glycemic control).

          3. Any treatment with an investigational agent in the 60 days prior to trial entry for
             any condition.

          4. Known serious allergies to the fluorescein dye used in angiography (mild allergy
             amenable to treatment is allowable), or to the components of the aflibercept
             formulation.

          5. For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become
             pregnant within the next 24 months.Women who are potential study participants should
             be questioned about the potential for pregnancy. Investigator judgment is used to
             determine when a pregnancy test is needed.

          6. Stroke or Myocardial infraction within 6 months of trial entry. -
