  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

      This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to
      determine the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) versus placebo in participants
      with anemia due to the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) very low,
      low, or intermediate MDS with ring sideroblasts who require red blood cell (RBC)
      transfusions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is considered to be one of the most prevalent cytopenias in patients who have
      myelodysplastic syndromes, an umbrella term used to describe disorders relating to the
      ineffective production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets. Ranging in
      severity from mild (asymptomatic) to severe, anemia can result in patients requiring regular
      red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which can lead to further complications from iron
      overload. The goal of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of luspatercept versus
      placebo in anemic patients who are categorized as International Prognostic Scoring
      System-Revised (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate risk Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
      have ring sideroblasts present, and require constant RBC transfusions. The design of the
      study will allow a period of initial randomization of patients into either the luspatercept
      or placebo arm, followed by a double-blind treatment period, and then an MDS disease
      assessment visit. For those patients that are determined to be experiencing clinical benefit
      as judged from the study Investigator by this disease assessment visit, they will be
      permitted to enter the double-blind Extension Phase of the study. Once patients are
      discontinued from study treatment, they will enter a post treatment follow-up period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF).

          2. Documented diagnosis of MDS according to World Health Organization (WHO)/French
             American British (FAB) classification that meets IPSS R classification of very low,
             low, or intermediate risk disease, and:

        Ring sideroblast ≥ 15% of erythroid precursors in bone marrow or ≥ 5% (but &lt; 15%) if SF3B1
        mutation is present.

          -  &lt; 5% blasts in bone marrow

          -  Peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 13,000/µL 3. Requires red blood cell
             RBC transfusions 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0, 1, or 2 5.
             Subjects who are refractory/intolerant/ineligible to prior erythropoietin-stimulating
             agents (ESA) treatment, defined as:

          -  Refractory to prior - erythropoietin stimulating agents treatment: documentation of
             non-response or response that is no longer maintained to prior ESA-containing regimen,
             either as single agent or combination (eg, with granulocyte colony stimulating factor
             (G-CSF); ESA regimen must have been either recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu EPO)
             ≥ 40,000 IU/wk for at least 8 doses or equivalent OR darbepoetin alpha ≥ 500 μg Q3W
             for at least 4 doses or equivalent

          -  Intolerant to prior ESA treatment: documentation of discontinuation of prior
             ESA-containing regimen, either as single agent or combination (eg, with G-CSF), at any
             time after introduction due to intolerance or an adverse event

          -  ESA ineligible: low chance of response to ESA base on endogenous serum erythropoietin
             level &gt; 200 U/L for subjects not previously treated with ESAs

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Prior therapy with disease modifying agents for underlying MDS disease.

          2. Previously treated with either luspatercept (ACE-536) or sotatercept (ACE-011)

          3. MDS associated with del 5q cytogenetic abnormality

          4. Secondary MDS, ie, MDS that is known to have arisen as the result of chemical injury
             or treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation for other diseases.

          5. Known clinically significant anemia due to iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiencies,
             or autoimmune or hereditary hemolytic anemia, or gastrointestinal bleeding

             - iron deficiency to be determined by serum ferritin less than or equal to 15 ug/L and
             additional testing if clinically indicated (eg, calculated transferrin saturation
             [iron/total iron binding capacity less than or equal to 20%] or bone marrow aspirate
             stain for iron).

          6. Prior allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant

          7. Known history of diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

          8. Use of any of the following within 5 weeks prior to randomization:

               -  anticancer cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent or treatment

               -  corticosteroid, except for subjects on a stable or decreasing dose for ≥ 1 week
                  prior to randomization for medical conditions other than MDS

               -  iron-chelating agents, except for subjects on a stable or decreasing dose for at
                  least 8 weeks prior to randomization

               -  other RBC hematopoietic growth factors (eg, Interleukin-3)

               -  investigational drug or device, or approved therapy for investigational use. If
                  the half-life of the previous investigational product is known, use within 5
                  times the half-life prior to randomization or within 5 weeks, whichever is longer
                  is excluded.

          9. Prior history of malignancies, other than MDS, unless the subject has been free of the
             disease (including completion of any active or adjuvant treatment for prior
             malignancy) for ≥ 5 years. However, subjects with the following history/concurrent
             conditions are allowed:

               -  Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

               -  Carcinoma in situ of the cervix

               -  Carcinoma in situ of the breast

               -  Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (T1a or T1b using the tumor,
                  nodes, metastasis [TNM] clinical staging system)

         10. Major surgery within 8 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects must have completely
             recovered from any previous surgery prior to randomization

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This is an ongoing double-blind randomized, Phase 3 trial. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to luspatercept or placebo treatment and data are reported up to the data cut off date of 01 July 2019. Participants were enrolled at 65 sites in 11 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized based on red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden at baseline (≥ 6 RBC units/8 weeks versus &lt; 6 RBC units/8 weeks [based on the mean of the 2 consecutive 8-week periods immediately prior to randomization]) and the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) at baseline.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Luspatercept</title>
          <description>Participants received luspatercept by subcutaneous (SC) injection at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle for the first 24 weeks. Following confirmation of clinical benefit and absence of disease progression per International Working Group on Morphology of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (IWG-MDS) criteria for altered natural history of MDS at Week 25, participants continued to receive luspatercept by SC injection on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle in the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period until the participant experienced unacceptable toxicities, disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS, withdrew consent, or met any other discontinuation criteria.</description>

          <description>ECOG performance status is used to describe a patient’s level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themselves, daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.). The scale ranges from 0 to 5:
0 = Fully active, no restrictions;
1 = Restricted activity but ambulatory, able to carry out work of a light nature;
2 = Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out work activities;
3 = Limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours;
4 = Completely disabled, no self-care, confined to bed or chair;
5 = Dead</description>

          <title>International Prognostic Scoring System Revised (IPSS-R) Classification Risk Category</title>
          <description>The Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) IPSS score assesses the severity of MDS based on 3 prognostic factors each assigned a score: the percentage of bone marrow blasts, chromosome changes in the marrow cells (karyotype) and the presence of one or more low blood cell counts (cytopenias). The IPSS score is the sum of the bone marrow blast + karyotype + cytopenia score and ranges from 0 (low risk) to 3.5 (high risk). Prognosis is categorized as Low risk (score = 0), Intermediate-1 (score 0.5 to 1.0), Intermediate-2 (score 1.5 to 2.0) or High risk (score ≥ 2.5).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Score</title>
        <description>The EORTC questionnaire was a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 questions, 24 of which form 9 multi-item scales representing various aspects of HRQOL: 1 global scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Emotional, Cognitive and Social), and 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea). The remaining 6 items are intended to be mono-item scales describing relevant cancer-oriented symptoms (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning was scored between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating better physcial functioning. Negative change from baseline values indicate deterioration in physical functioning and positive values indicate improvement.</description>

        <population>The Health Related QoL evaluable population included all participants in the ITT population who completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 assessment at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment visit.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Emotional Functioning Score</title>
        <description>The EORTC questionnaire was a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 questions, 24 of which form 9 multi-item scales representing various aspects of HRQOL: 1 global scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Emotional, Cognitive and Social), and 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea). The remaining 6 items are intended to be mono-item scales describing relevant cancer-oriented symptoms (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Emotional Functioning was scored between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating better emotional functioning. Negative change from baseline values indicate deterioration in emotional functioning and positive values indicate improvement.</description>

        <population>The Health Related QoL evaluable population included all participants in the ITT population who completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 assessment at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment visit.</population>

Following confirmation of clinical benefit and absence of disease progression per International Working Group on Morphology of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (IWG-MDS) criteria for altered natural history of MDS at Week 25, participants continued to receive luspatercept by SC injection on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle in the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period until the participant experienced unacceptable toxicities, disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS, withdrew consent, or met any other discontinuation criteria.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Fatigue Score</title>
        <description>The EORTC questionnaire was a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 questions, 24 of which form 9 multi-item scales representing various aspects of HRQOL: 1 global scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Emotional, Cognitive and Social), and 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea). The remaining 6 items are intended to be mono-item scales describing relevant cancer-oriented symptoms (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). The EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale is scored between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating a higher level of symptoms. Negative change from Baseline values indicate reduction in fatigue (i.e. improvement in symptom) and positive values indicate increases in fatigue (i.e. worsening of symptom).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</title>
        <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as AEs and included AEs that started on or after the day of the first dose and on or before 42 days after the last dose of IP. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any:
Death;
Life-threatening event;
Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
Congenital anomaly or birth defect;
Any other important medical event
The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event. The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 4.0) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death.</description>

          <description>Participants received identically matching placebo (equivalent to experimental arm) by SC injection on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle for the first 24 weeks. Following confirmation of clinical benefit and absence of disease progression per IWG-MDS criteria for altered natural history of MDS,participants continued to receive placebo by SC injection on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle in the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period until the participant experienced unacceptable toxicities, disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS, withdrew consent, or met any other discontinuation criteria.</description>
