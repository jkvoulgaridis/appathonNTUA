  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated blood cholesterol, and particularly LDL cholesterol, is a risk factor for heart
      disease. Tocotrienols are naturally-occurring compounds in foods that may have beneficial
      effects on blood cholesterol. Tocotrienols are members of the vitamin E family, and are found
      in barley, oats, rye, coconut oil and rice bran oil, but the richest source of tocotrienols
      is palm oil. Certain of these tocotrienols have been shown to be effective in lowering LDL
      (or 'bad') cholesterol, with no adverse effects on the HDL (or 'good') cholesterol. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a palm-oil derived tocotrienol
      supplement on blood cholesterol, and particularly LDL cholesterol, in individuals who are
      taking statins, and have either elevated or normal cholesterol levels. Study subjects will
      consume a palm-oil derived supplement of tocotrienol for 3 months to determine its effects on
      LDL cholesterol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both tocotrienols and tocopherols, whose derivatives are in eight different isoforms, are
      closely related structurally. Tocopherols are generally present in common vegetable oils
      (i.e. soy, canola). However, tocotrienols are concentrated in cereal grains (ie. oat, barley,
      and rye, rice bran), with the highest level found in crude palm oil. The development of new
      cholesterol-lowering agents has been given more and more attention by pharmaceutical
      companies due to the strong relationship between cholesterol and atherosclerosis.
      Tocotrienols, especially δ- and γ-tocotrienols, were shown to be effective nutritional agents
      to treat high cholesterol in recent research programs. In particular, γ-tocotrienol appears
      to inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase at a posttranscriptional level and
      there is some evidence that tocopherols antagonize this effect. Therefore, the current study
      is designed to demonstrate that treatment with a tocotrienol-enriched fraction of palm oil
      for a three month period will lead to a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol with no
      effect on HDL cholesterol in patients whose cholesterol level is not adequately controlled in
      spite of statins. This objective will be achieved utilizing a simple three arm randomized
      placebo-controlled trial in a total of 99 subjects After acclimation to a step I AHA diet and
      no supplemental vitamin E in the diet, subjects will be given either a placebo capsule or a
      tocotrienol (120mg or 240mg) capsule in addition to their statin medications
