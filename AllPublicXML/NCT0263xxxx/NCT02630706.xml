  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of ertugliflozin to
      metformin monotherapy in Asian participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitis (T2DM) who have
      inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy. The primary hypothesis is that the mean
      reduction from baseline in HbA1C for 15 mg and 5 mg ertugliflozin (tested sequentially) is
      greater than for placebo.

      This study includes a 1-week screening period, an 8-week (or greater) antihyperglycemic agent
      (AHA) wash-off and/or metformin dose stable period (as necessary), a 2-week single-blind
      placebo run-in period, a 26-week double-blind treatment period, and a post-treatment
      telephone contact 14 days after the last dose of study drug.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in A1C (%) at Week 26 (Excluding Rescue Approach)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>A1C is blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time. Percentage A1C is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin x 100. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 26 A1C minus the Week 0 A1C (which is estimated on average for each treatment group using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model, which allows for participants with missing data to be included in the analysis). Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>

    <description>Blood glucose was measured on a fasting basis.

        <title>Change From Baseline in A1C (%) at Week 26 (Excluding Rescue Approach)</title>
        <description>A1C is blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time. Percentage A1C is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin x 100. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 26 A1C minus the Week 0 A1C (which is estimated on average for each treatment group using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model, which allows for participants with missing data to be included in the analysis). Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of investigational product and who had at least one assessment of the respective endpoint at baseline or post baseline up to Week 26.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in A1C (%) at Week 26 (Excluding Rescue Approach)</title>
          <description>A1C is blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time. Percentage A1C is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin x 100. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 26 A1C minus the Week 0 A1C (which is estimated on average for each treatment group using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model, which allows for participants with missing data to be included in the analysis). Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>

Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride and dosed according to Investigator judgment.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Body Weight at Week 26 (Excluding Rescue Approach)</title>
        <description>The change in body weight from baseline reflects the Week 26 body weight minus the Week 0 body weight (which is estimated on average for each treatment group using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model, which allows for participants with missing data to be included in the analysis). Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>

        <population>The analysis population included all randomized participants and who received at least one dose of investigational product and who had at least one assessment of the respective endpoint at baseline or post-baseline up to Week 26.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure at Week 26 (Excluding Rescue Approach)</title>
        <description>This change from baseline reflects the Week 26 sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) minus the Week 0 sitting DBP (which is estimated on average for each treatment group using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model, which allows for participants with missing data to be included in the analysis). Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>

        <description>A1C is blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time and is reported as a percentage (%). Percentage A1C is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin x 100. Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>
