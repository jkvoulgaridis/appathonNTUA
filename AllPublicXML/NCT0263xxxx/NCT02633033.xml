    <textblock>
      Acthar Gel was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1952.

      It has been used to treat many different illnesses, including multiple sclerosis.

      This study will observe how treatment with Acthar affected the daily lives of patients who
      suffer with relapsing/remitting MS.

      It will collect information on symptoms, recovery, treatment patterns and safety outcomes.

      Acthar Gel (repository corticotropin injection) contains a non-bovine analogue of
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for intramuscular or subcutaneous use.

      It was initially approved by the FDA in 1952 and is used for multiple indications.

      This registry will evaluate the use of Acthar Gel for the treatment of MS exacerbations in
      the United States.

    <description>Participants rate 20 physical symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) on a scale from 1=not at all to 5=extremely. The highest possible score is 100. Higher scores mean physical symptoms of MS have a higher impact on day-to-day life.

    <measure>Score on the Expanded Disability Status Scale/Functional System Score (EDSS/FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treating clinicians trained in completing the EDSS/FSS (neurologist or other healthcare professional such as a nurse practitioner or physician assistant) complete the EDSS/FSS to evaluate patient neurologic impairment.
The EDSS is based on the standard neurological examination and is used by the clinician in conjunction with the Functional System Score (FSS) to produce a disability score. The FSS is a companion scale that is part of the EDSS
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a well validated 10 point ordinal clinical rating scale with scores ranging from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS) in 0.5 point increments. The highest possible score is 100. A higher score means more neurological disability.
For patients having a relapse during the study period, the schedule of assessments restarts at the time of relapse(s).

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (CGI-I)</measure>

    <description>Treating clinicians complete the CGI-I. It is a scale that compares the overall condition of the patient to baseline. Scores range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). The highest possible score is 7. Lower scores mean improvement.
For patients having a relapse during the study period, the schedule of assessments restarts at the time of relapse(s).
