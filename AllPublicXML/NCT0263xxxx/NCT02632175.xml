    <measure>Proportion of subjects who achieve clinical response as measured by Partial Mayo Score (PMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 288</time_frame>

    <measure>Proportion of subjects who achieve Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) remission</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessing impact on children who have inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) using IMPACT III questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 288</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 35 item, self-administered questionnaire, with total score ranging from 35 (poor) to 175 (best). The questions are about the quality of the child's life with inflammatory bowel disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessing activity impairment using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Ulcerative Colitis (WPAI: UC)</measure>

    <measure>Proportion of subjects who achieve remission/response based on Full Mayo score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 288</time_frame>
    <description>Full Mayo score will be based on subjects with available Full Mayo score data. Full Mayo score is a composite of 4 subscores. Each subscore is a number from 0 (lowest) to 3 (highest) with a total score of 0-12. Clinical remission per Full Mayo Score is defined as a Full Mayo Score less than or equal to 2 and no individual subscore greater than 1. Clinical response per Full Mayo Score defined as a decrease in Full Mayo Score greater than or equal to 3 points and greater than or equal to 3 points 30% from Baseline.</description>
