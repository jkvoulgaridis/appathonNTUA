  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this project is to use transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for
      the novel indication of treating neuromuscular activation in individuals with knee
      osteoarthritis (OA) that exhibit neuromuscular activation deficits. The overall goal is to
      improve outcomes associated traditional therapeutic exercise (TE) by developing an enhanced
      rehabilitation strategy, which augments TE with TENS (TENS+TE), for the purpose of treating
      underlying neuromuscular activation deficits. The investigators seek to use TENS to excite
      neural pathways that immediately increase neuromuscular activation as well as cause sustained
      improvements in neuromuscular activation and greater strength gains in knee OA patients
      compared to traditional TE. The investigators will evaluate the effect of TENS+TE on muscle
      strength, neuromuscular activation, gait biomechanics, physical function, physical activity,
      self-efficacy of physical activity, self-reported quality of life, disability and pain. The
      central hypothesis is that an enhanced TENS+TE intervention will lead to better clinical
      outcomes, increased physical activity, and improved general health. The rationale for
      conducting a small clinical trial, which demonstrates the feasibility and establishes the
      preliminary effects of an enhanced rehabilitation strategy, is ultimately to inform the
      development of a future larger clinical trial to establish the efficacy of an enhanced
      rehabilitation strategy for knee OA. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific
      aims: 1) to collect and report data on the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of using TENS+TE compared to sham TENS+TE and to TE only for treating
      patients with knee OA in a clinical setting, and 2) to determine preliminary effects of a
      4-week TENS+TE intervention compared to sham TENS+TE, and TE only on muscle strength,
      neuromuscular activation, gait biomechanics, physical function, physical activity,
      self-efficacy of physical activity, self reported quality of life, disability, and pain in
      knee OA patients. Posttests will be at 4 and 8-weeks following baseline.

    <measure>Mean in Self-reported Disability Score as Measured by the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Index Between Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>8-weeks from Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Index is reliable and valid measure of self reported disability. The physical function consists of 17 items and asks about the magnitude of difficulty when ascending and descending stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on and taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in and out of the bath, sitting, getting on and off the toilet, completing heavy household duties, and completing light household duties. Each item is presented in a 5 point Likert-type format and uses the following descriptors for possible answer choices none, mild moderate, severe, and extreme. Each descriptor corresponds to an ordinal scale of 0-4. The scores are summed for the items in each subscale, with total possible ranges as 0-68. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate greater amounts of functional limitations.</description>

    <measure>Mean Voluntary Quadriceps Activation as Measured by the Central Activation Ratio Expressed as a Percent of Full Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>8-weeks from Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators assessed voluntary quadriceps central activation ratio as a representative variable of lower extremity neuromuscular activation using the supra imposition technique. Quadriceps central activation ratio has been demonstrated to be significantly decreased in knee osteoarthritis (OA) compared to healthy, matched controls, and the investigators have reported acceptable measurement reliability (ICC2,k = 0.85)</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to the TENS+Therapeutic Exercise (TE) group will receive a Select System TENS unit (EMPI, Inc., St. Paul, MN), and 8 hours of TENS per day (150 pulses per second, 150 msec phase duration at a patient-perceived strong sensory intensity). Ten sessions of TE will be provided under the supervision of a licensed Physical Therapist. Each TE Session will last 45 minutes and include open and closed chain lower extremity muscle strengthening exercises.

        <title>Mean in Self-reported Disability Score as Measured by the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Index Between Groups</title>
        <description>The Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Index is reliable and valid measure of self reported disability. The physical function consists of 17 items and asks about the magnitude of difficulty when ascending and descending stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on and taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in and out of the bath, sitting, getting on and off the toilet, completing heavy household duties, and completing light household duties. Each item is presented in a 5 point Likert-type format and uses the following descriptors for possible answer choices none, mild moderate, severe, and extreme. Each descriptor corresponds to an ordinal scale of 0-4. The scores are summed for the items in each subscale, with total possible ranges as 0-68. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate greater amounts of functional limitations.</description>

          <title>Mean Internal Knee Extension Moment During Walking Gait Measured in Nm/ Body Weight*m</title>
          <description>The peak internal knee extension moment was calculated using using inverse dynamics calculations in the first 50% of the stance phase of gait and normalized to the Body Weight* height (m) of the individual during self selected gait speed.</description>
          <population>Difference in baseline individuals and number of participants are due to a proportion of patients lost to follow up and measurable outcomes were unable to be analyzed due to error in positioning of knee joint center marker.</population>

For blinding purposes, patients will be told that they should feel a brief stimulation (~20 seconds) that will become “sub-sensory” in nature.
