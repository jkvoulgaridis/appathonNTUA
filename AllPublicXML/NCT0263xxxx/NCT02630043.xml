  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an investigational drug (Tolcapone) alone
      and in combination with oxaliplatin, for relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma. Tolcapone is
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults, but is an investigational
      drug in this study because it has not been approved in pediatrics for this indication.
      Oxaliplatin, although a drug approved by the FDA for other cancers, is investigational for
      treatment of neuroblastoma in this study. This study will look at the safety and tolerability
      of tolcapone in combination with oxaliplatin as well as the tumors response to this study
      drug.

               -  Subjects must have adequate liver function as defined by:

                    -  AST and ALT ≤ upper limit of normal

                    -  Serum bilirubin must be ≤ 2.0 mg/dl

               -  Subjects must have adequate Bone Marrow function defined as:

          -  BSA (m2) of &lt;0.5

          -  Prior Therapy- Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all
             prior anti- cancer chemotherapy and be within the following timelines:

               -  Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Must not have received within 2 weeks of
                  enrollment onto this study (6 weeks if prior nitrosourea).

               -  Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 5 days since the completion of therapy

                  with a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond
                  7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during
                  which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be
                  discussed with the Study Chair.

             the last 14 days are excluded from participation.

          -  Subjects with CNS lesions are excluded

          -  Subjects with a history of depression, anxiety, or psychotic disorders (due to
             tolcapone adverse event profile).

          -  Subjects that are pregnant or breastfeeding an infant.

          -  Subjects that cannot swallow tablets.

          -  Infection: Subjects who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible until the
             infection is judged to be well controlled in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
