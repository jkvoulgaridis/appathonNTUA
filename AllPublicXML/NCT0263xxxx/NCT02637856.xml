    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in participants with RRMS who
      have had a suboptimal response to an adequate course of DMT. Participants will receive
      ocrelizumab as an initial dose of two 300-milligrams (mg) intravenous (IV) infusions (600 mg
      total) separated by 14 days followed by one 600-mg IV infusion for a maximum of 4 doses (up
      to 96 weeks). Anticipated time on study treatment is 96 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who complete their Week 72 ocrelizumab infusion and do not experience any
      serious infusion related reaction (IRR) throughout the main study will be eligible to enroll
      in an optional, open-label, non-randomized substudy to MN30035 and receive one additional
      shorter infusion of ocrelizumab at the Week 96 visit. This substudy will enroll approximately
      100 patients from MN30035 main study.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

          -  Treated with an adequate course of treatment with no more than three prior DMT
             regimens of greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 6 months, and the discontinuation of the
             most recent adequately used DMT was due to suboptimal response

          -  Suboptimal response while the participant was on his/her last adequately used DMT for
             &gt;/=6 months (defined by having one of the following qualifying events despite being on

             relapses, one or more T1 Gd-enhanced lesions, or two or more new or enlarging T2
             lesions on MRI); these qualifying events must have occurred while on the last
             adequately used DMT. In participants receiving stable doses of the same approved DMT
             for more than a year, the event must have occurred within the last 12 months of
             treatment with this DMT from the date of screening

          -  Treatment with alemtuzumab (Lemtrada®)

          -  Previous treatment with systemic cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate

          -  Previous treatment with natalizumab within 12 months prior to screening unless failure
             was due to confirmed, persistent anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Participants previously
             treated with natalizumab will be eligible for this study only if duration of treatment
             with natalizumab was less than (&lt;) 1 year and natalizumab was not used in the 12
             months prior to screening. Anti-John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibody status (positive
             or negative) and titer (both assessed within the year of screening) must be documented
             prior to enrollment

          -  Treatment with dalfampridine (Ampyra®) unless on stable dose for &gt;/=30 days prior to

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted in North America at 90 study sites in the U.S. and Canada.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) were enrolled, who had had a suboptimal response to an adequate course of a disease-modifying treatment (DMT). An adequate course of prior DMT was defined as the same DMT administered for at least 6 months.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

          <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
