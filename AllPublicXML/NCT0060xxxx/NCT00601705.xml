    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and
      cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill
      tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy
      after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy, surgery,
      and radiation therapy works in treating patients with locoregionally advanced cancer of the
      esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or stomach.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the feasibility and tolerability of induction chemotherapy comprising
           epirubicin hydrochloride, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil (EOF), followed by surgical
           resection and postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising fluorouracil and
           cisplatin in patients with locoregionally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus,
           gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cardia.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the rate of complete and partial response to three courses of EOF induction
           chemotherapy.

        -  To compare the recurrence-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen vs historical controls at this institution.

        -  To compare patterns of failure in patients treated with this regimen vs historical
           controls at this institution.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction chemotherapy: Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride IV over 3-15 minutes
           and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-21.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Surgery: Four weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy, patients with
           locoregionally confined disease (T0-4, N0-1, M0-1a) undergo transthoracic
           esophagogastrectomy or total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy, depending
           on the location and extent of the tumor at the time of surgery.

        -  Postoperative chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 6-10 weeks after surgery, patients undergo
           radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 6 weeks. Patients also receive fluorouracil
           IV continuously and cisplatin IV continuously over 96 hours in weeks 1 and 4 of
           radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 3 years.

Epirubicin and oxaliplatin were given on day 1, while 5FU was intravenously infused for 21-days. Surgery was conducted 4 to 5-weeks after chemotherapy. Six to ten-weeks after surgery chemoradiotherapy was initiated. With radiotherapy, patients received two cycles of cisplatin and 5FU during the first and fourth weeks after surgery; they were administered intravenously over 96-hours. Specifically, cisplatin and 5FU total dose was 80-mg/m^2 (20-mg/m^2/d) and 4000 mg/m^2 (1000-mg/m^2/d), respectively.</description>

Epirubicin and oxaliplatin were given on day 1, while 5FU was intravenously infused for 21-days. Surgery was conducted 4 to 5-weeks after chemotherapy. Six to ten-weeks after surgery chemoradiotherapy was initiated. With radiotherapy, patients received two cycles of cisplatin and 5FU during the first and fourth weeks after surgery; they were administered intravenously over 96-hours. Specifically, cisplatin and 5FU total dose was 80-mg/m^2 (20-mg/m^2/d) and 4000 mg/m^2 (1000-mg/m^2/d), respectively.</description>
