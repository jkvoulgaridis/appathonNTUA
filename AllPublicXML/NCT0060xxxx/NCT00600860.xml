      Study Objectives:

      To collect and describe demographics, disease-management, and treatment outcomes of
      Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) patients who are newly diagnosed and classified according to
      the WHO criteria.

      To perform observational studies concerning relevant scientific research questions in MDS
      using clinical data and biological samples, and to present relevant research outcomes in the
      fields of diagnosis and prognostication, health related quality of life issues, health
      economics, and risk stratification for newly developed classes of drugs.

      To disseminate results of the studies to all stakeholders involved.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methodology:

      Data on patients with MDS will be collected prospectively at diagnosis and at 6-months
      intervals after diagnosis. The data will be gathered by seventeen (or more) countries that
      are represented within the LeukemiaNet MDS Working Party and will be combined in one central
      European Database. Data analyses will be conducted by the Data Management Centre at the
      University of York in various sub studies, after every 500 patients included in the European
      Registry and at the end of the follow-up period.

      Number of Patients &amp; Centres Over 140 hematology centres in seventeen (or more) different
      countries (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy,
      The Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) will participate as referral
      centres in this Registry. The recruitment target is a minimum of 3000 cases lower-risk MDS
      and 1000 higher-risk cases.

      Population:

      The study population will consist of newly diagnosed patients with all subtypes of MDS
      classified according to the WHO criteria, including therapy-related MDS and MDS-F, AML with
      20-30 percent marrow blasts (former RAEB-t), and CMML and other forms of mixed MDS/MPD.

      Study Duration:

      The enrolment time is scheduled to continue until at least June 2020 but extension of the
      recruitment period is possible. Patients will be followed until withdrawal (for any reason)
      or termination of the EUMDS Registry.
