      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nifurtimox in combination with
      cyclophosphamide and topotecan are effective in the treatment of relapsed or refractory
      neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma.

      This study is being done to test the effect of a drug, nifurtimox, against neuroblastoma and
      medulloblastoma in children. Nifurtimox is a drug that has been used in South America for
      many years to treat a parasitic disease known as Chagas Disease. It is not approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration for routine use in neuroblastoma or medulloblastoma in the
      United States, but limited early observations suggest that nifurtimox may have anti tumor
      activity for neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma.

      From the preliminary trials of nifurtimox we have determined a safely tolerated dose of
      nifurtimox to use in neuroblastoma patients (30mg/kg/day). The dose determined in the Phase I
      study to be safe, will be the dose used for this study. From clinical experience in South
      America, we know that children can tolerate nifurtimox when given by mouth, and it appears to
      have no long-term side effects when used to treat Chagas Disease. Based on our laboratory and
      animal studies, we believe that drug levels similar to those used to treat Chagas Disease may
      shrink/kill neuroblastoma cells, especially when combined with other chemotherapy drugs. We
      do not know whether nifurtimox will shrink/kill tumor cells effectively in children.
      Therefore, the major goal of the study is to learn if nifurtimox in combination with other
      chemotherapy drugs is effective in shrinking/killing neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma cells.

             of neuroblastoma or medulloblastoma.
