  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine microbes (e.g., bacteria, fungi, viruses) that live on human skin and
      how microbes contribute to health and disease. It will analyze healthy human skin and how the
      these microorganisms might change in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), a skin condition
      also known as eczema.

      Healthy volunteers, as well as patients with moderate to severe eczema (AD), between 2 and 40
      years of age may be eligible for this study.

      We also wish to enroll children and adults aged 2-40 who have been diagnosed with inherited
      immune disorders known as HIES (hyperimmunoglobulin-E syndrome), WAS (Wiskott-Aldrich
      syndrome), or DOCK8 immunodeficiency because they frequently have skin problems similar to
      AD.

      Eligible participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical family and medication history

        -  Skin examination

        -  Blood tests (research blood as well as serum IgE, and complete blood count)

        -  Skin samples to analyze microbes. Samples are obtained by the following methods:
           swabbing the skin with a cotton swab; scraping (scratching) the skin gently with a blade
           to remove only the outermost skin layers; and, only in adults, biopsy (surgical removal)
           of a small skin sample less than 1/4-inch (5 mm) in diameter.

        -  Nose swabs to analyze microbes.

        -  Patients with eczema may have photographs of their skin taken to help monitor the skin
           rashes.

      Participants may be contacted periodically for follow-up studies. Patients with atopic
      dermatitis may have additional skin samples collected to examine changes in the skin bacteria
      over time and during all of the stages of eczema. In addition, patients who have a flare of
      their eczema are asked to undergo a skin sample collection as soon as possible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Skin microbiota (bacteria, fungi, viruses, phage, archae) play a significant role in
           common dermatological conditions, such as atopic dermatitis/AD (eczema).

        -  Since culture-dependent methods are often biased assessments of microbial diversity,
           genomic methods can expand our understanding of the human microbiome and skin diseases.

        -  Chronic dermatitis is typical among rare primary immunodeficiencies: Wiskott-Aldrich
           syndrome; hyper-IgE syndrome; and combined immunodeficiency associated with DOCK8
           mutation syndrome. The skin disease in these monogenic disorders resembles AD, is
           associated with microbial infections, and may provide additional insight into
           microbial-host disease interactions.
