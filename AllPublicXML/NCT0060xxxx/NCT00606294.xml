    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate low oxygen areas called hypoxia within tumors.
      These low oxygen areas are thought to be the reason why tumors are more resistant to
      chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

      An imaging technique using a hypoxia tracer called fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) can detect low
      oxygen areas within a tumor. This imaging technique, called a PET scan, uses positively
      charged particles to detect slight changes in the body's biochemistry and metabolism. FMISO
      PET scans have been performed in patients with head and neck cancer and have shown the
      ability to detect low oxygen areas within tumors.

    <description>Cohort 1 (closed to accrual) Cohort 1 (closed to accrual) There will be no change or intervention in a patient's treatment regime using chemoradiation where both the primary and the neck nodes receive 70Gy. This is currently one accepted standard of care. In a subcohort of patients in Cohort 1 with tumors that are positive for HPV who exhibited no evidence of hypoxia on their baseline 18F-FMISO PET/ CT scan or whose tumors have early resolution of hypoxia on their repeat early response 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan will undergo an alternative treatment where the primary tumor site receives 70Gy while the neck nodes receive 60Gy followed by a planned FDG PET/CT scan and observation.</description>

    <description>Experimental: Cohort 2 (closed to accrual) Cohort 2 HPV+ tumors that demonstrate no evidence of hypoxia on an 18F-FMISO PET scan will receive 30Gy to the surgical bed and neck lymph nodes concurrent with standard chemotherapy followed by a 3-4 month post-treatment neck dissection. In patients who exhibit a complete response with this method of treatment, no further treatment is necessary. For patients within this select group who still have pathologic nodal disease, further standard chemoradiation will be given. All other patients in this cohort (i.e. those who are not in the select HPV+ tumor group outlined above) will receive standard of care treatment following their surgery.</description>

            <description>Cohort 2 (closed to accrual) Cohort 2 HPV+ tumors that demonstrate no evidence of hypoxia on an 18F-FMISO PET scan will receive 30Gy to the surgical bed and neck lymph nodes concurrent with standard chemotherapy followed by a 3-4 month post-treatment neck dissection. In patients who exhibit a complete response with this method of treatment, no further treatment is necessary. For patients within this select group who still have pathologic nodal disease, further standard chemoradiation will be given. All other patients in this cohort (i.e. those who are not in the select HPV+ tumor group outlined above) will receive standard of care treatment following their surgery.</description>

          <description>Cohort 1 (closed to accrual) Cohort 1 (closed to accrual) There will be no change or intervention in a patient's treatment regime using chemoradiation where both the primary and the neck nodes receive 70Gy. This is currently one accepted standard of care. In a subcohort of patients in Cohort 1 with tumors that are positive for HPV who exhibited no evidence of hypoxia on their baseline 18F-FMISO PET/ CT scan or whose tumors have early resolution of hypoxia on their repeat early response 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan will undergo an alternative treatment where the primary tumor site receives 70Gy while the neck nodes receive 60Gy followed by a planned FDG PET/CT scan and observation.</description>
