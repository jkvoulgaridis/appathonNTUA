      First-line treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, HER2-negative breast
      cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arm A:

      Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.), days 1 and 15, every 4 weeks

      Paclitaxel 90 mg/m2, days 1, 8 and 15, every 4 weeks

      Arm B:

      Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg i.v., day 1, every 3 weeks

      Capecitabine 1000 mg/m² twice-daily, days 1-14, every 3 weeks

      In both arms treatment will be given until first disease progression (PD), unacceptable
      toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent.

      For patients who stop chemotherapy for any reason before PD (e.g. toxicity) the other
      treatment should be given as monotherapy until PD.

    <description>Overall survival (OS) defined as time from randomization to date of death from any cause. Patients without recorded death were censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive. OS was analyzed at two looks, one interim look and the final analysis. Due to group sequential testing, the overall significance level alpha = 0.025 was spent on both looks according to Lan-DeMets spending method with O'Brien-Fleming-type boundaries. Alpha spent at Interim after 47% of information was 0.0010. Alpha spent at final analysis after 99% of information was 0.0250.</description>

Alpha spent at Interim after 47% of information was 0.0010. Alpha spent at final analysis after 99% of information was 0.0250.</description>
