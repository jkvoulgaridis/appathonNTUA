  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term lung disease that is often caused
      by cigarette smoking. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether certain genetic
      factors predispose some smokers to develop COPD more than others.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a disease in which the lung airways are damaged and partly obstructed, making it
      difficult to breathe. Millions of people in the United States have COPD, and it is the third
      leading cause of death in the United States. Symptoms include coughing, excess mucus
      production, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. Emphysema and long-term
      bronchitis are the two most common manifestations of the disease. The most common risk factor
      for developing COPD is cigarette smoking; however, only 15% to 20% of smokers develop COPD in
      their lifetimes. It is not known why some smokers develop COPD and some do not, but certain
      genetic factors, combined with exposure to cigarette smoke, may increase the likelihood of
      developing COPD. This study will analyze DNA from current and former cigarette smokers to
      identify genetic factors and markers that may indicate a predisposition to developing COPD.

      This study will enroll African-American and white cigarette smokers and former cigarette
      smokers both with and without COPD. Participants will attend one study visit during which
      they will complete questionnaires about lung symptoms, breathing difficulties, medical and
      family history, and quality of life. They will also undergo blood collection, a physical
      exam, lung function testing, and a walking test to measure endurance. Participants will
      undergo a high resolution computed tomography (CT) chest scan and a medical record review.
      Study researchers will contact participants up to four times a year for 5 years to collect
      follow-up medical information. A five year follow-up visit including a similar study protocol
      as the baseline visit will be performed on all available subjects.
