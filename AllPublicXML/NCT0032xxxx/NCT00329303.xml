    <description>The PASI is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0=no disease, the maximum score is 72=maximal disease. The difference was calculated by 'PASI score at re-treatment Week 12' minus 'PASI score at First Treatment Week 12'.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

        <title>Difference in Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI) Scores Between Week 12 of the First Treatment in Study C87040 [NCT00245765] and Week 12 of Re-treatment in This Study</title>
        <description>The PASI is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0=no disease, the maximum score is 72=maximal disease. The difference was calculated by 'PASI score at re-treatment Week 12' minus 'PASI score at First Treatment Week 12'.</description>

          <title>Difference in Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI) Scores Between Week 12 of the First Treatment in Study C87040 [NCT00245765] and Week 12 of Re-treatment in This Study</title>
          <description>The PASI is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0=no disease, the maximum score is 72=maximal disease. The difference was calculated by 'PASI score at re-treatment Week 12' minus 'PASI score at First Treatment Week 12'.</description>

        <title>BSA (Body Surface Area) Affected by Psoriasis at Week 10 of Re-treatment Period in This Study</title>
        <description>Two methods were used for the evaluation of BSA:
The area of one side of a subject's flat closed hand was used to represent 1 % to the total body surface area (BSA) to estimate the extent of skin involvement in subjects with psoriasis
The rule of nines method assumed that the total BSA comprises head (9 %), anterior trunk (upper, 9 %; lower, 9 %), posterior trunk (upper, 9 %; lower, 9 %), each leg (anterior, 9 %; posterior, 9 %), each arm (9 %) and genitalia (1 %)</description>

        <title>Change in BSA (Body Surface Area) Score From First Treatment Baseline in C87040 to Week 6 of Re-treatment Period in This Study</title>
        <description>Two methods were used for the evaluation of BSA:
The area of one side of a subject's flat closed hand was used to represent 1 % to the total body surface area (BSA) to estimate the extent of skin involvement in subjects with psoriasis
The rule of nines method assumed that the total BSA comprises head (9 %), anterior trunk (upper, 9 %; lower, 9 %), posterior trunk (upper, 9 %; lower, 9 %), each leg (anterior, 9 %; posterior, 9 %), each arm (9 %) and genitalia (1 %) A positive value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the positive value, the higher the change.</description>

        <title>Change in BSA (Body Surface Area) Score From Re-treatment Baseline in This Study to Week 4 of Re-treatment Period in This Study</title>
        <description>Two methods were used for the evaluation of BSA:
The area of one side of a subject's flat closed hand was used to represent 1 % to the total body surface area (BSA) to estimate the extent of skin involvement in subjects with psoriasis
The rule of nines method assumed that the total BSA comprises head (9 %), anterior trunk (upper, 9 %; lower, 9 %), posterior trunk (upper, 9 %; lower, 9 %), each leg (anterior, 9 %; posterior, 9 %), each arm (9 %) and genitalia (1 %) A positive value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the positive value, the higher the change.</description>

The rule of nines method assumed that the total BSA comprises head (9 %), anterior trunk (upper, 9 %; lower, 9 %), posterior trunk (upper, 9 %; lower, 9 %), each leg (anterior, 9 %; posterior, 9 %), each arm (9 %) and genitalia (1 %) A positive value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the positive value, the higher the change.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>
