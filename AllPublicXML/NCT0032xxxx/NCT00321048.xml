  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac perfusion changes have been seen after whole breast / chest wall irradiation for
      breast cancer. The Active Breathing Coordinator (ABC) device theoretically decreases
      radiation exposure to the heart during radiation for breast cancer. In this trial cardiac
      perfusion changes or lack thereof will be quantified in women treated with radiation for
      breast cancer while using the ABC device. The control group of the study will consist of
      patients randomized to radiation therapy without the ABC device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 left sided breast cancer patients will be randomized to receive breast/chest wall
      irradiation with or without ABC. Patients will receive radiation therapy at a dose of 180-200
      cGy per fraction for 23-27 fractions to a total dose of 4600 - 4860 cGy. Additional radiation
      to the lumpectomy bed or mastectomy scar is at the discretion of the treating physician. The
      total dose to the tumor bed or mastectomy scar cannot exceed 6600cGy. Treatments will be
      given Monday through Friday.

      After the completion of radiation therapy, patients will be seen on the following schedule:

      A follow up examination will take place every 3-6 months for the first two years, then every
      4-6 months for years for the next 3 years. After 5 years follow-up evaluations will occur
      annually. A SPECT scan will be obtained at 6 months post therapy.

      Patients must be 18 and older and must have histologically confirmed (by routine H&amp;E
      staining) invasive adenocarcinoma or Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the left breast.

      Patients must have also undergone a segmental mastectomy (SM) or Mastectomy.

      Patients must not have received prior radiation therapy to the breast at any time for any
      reason.

      Patients must not be pregnant due to the potential for fetal harm as a result of this
      treatment regimen.

    <description>Efficacy of the ABC device in protecting the heart from radiation (XRT) damage in patients with L breast cancer is determined by the change in cardiac perfusion (mean apical perfusion score) as measured by SPECT between baseline and 6 month follow up. A score of 1 represents an equivocal or mild reduction in perfusion, 2 represents moderately reduced perfusion, 3 represents severely reduced perfusion, and 4 indicates absent perfusion.</description>

          <title>Active Breathing Coordination</title>
          <description>Patients will receive radiation therapy at a dose of 180-200 cGy per fraction for 23-27 fractions to a total dose of 4600 – 4860 cGy. Additional radiation to the lumpectomy bed or mastectomy scar is at the discretion of the treating physician. The total dose to the tumor bed or mastectomy scar cannot exceed 6600cGy. Treatments will be given Monday through Friday.
Patients in this group were treated with Active Breathing Coordinator:
A SPECT scan will be obtained at baseline and at 6 months follow to determine changes in cardiac perfusion</description>
