  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immediate objective of this proposal is to assess the effectiveness of a multi-faceted
      intervention to improve patient-provider communication about colorectal cancer screening in
      improving patient adherence with colorectal cancer screening recommendations. This
      intervention consists of: (1) guiding the communication process through patient activation to
      initiate a colorectal cancer screening discussion; (2) optimizing communication content
      through the use of a prompt sheet; and (3) cueing the provider to assess patient perception
      of the communication. The long-term objective of our research program is to maximize
      colorectal cancer screening rates throughout the VA through widespread adoption of clinically
      feasible approaches to enhance patient-provider communication.

    <textblock>
      In the United States, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the second
      leading cause of cancer mortality with over 56,000 deaths in 2004). Early detection through
      screening decreases the mortality associated with the disease. However, adherence with
      current screening recommendations is low. A survey of the general population indicates that
      only 53.1% of Americans, age 50 years and older for whom colorectal cancer screening is
      recommended, are up-to-date with this preventive service. While colorectal cancer screening
      rates with the VA Healthcare System (VHA) are better than in the general population (75% in
      Fiscal Year (FY) 2005), they are lower than performance rates for other types of cancer
      screening (e.g., mammography) in VHA. Further, numerous VA medical centers report colorectal
      cancer screening rates below the level considered satisfactory.

    <description>A survey collected data on patient demographic characteristics, family history of colorectal cancer or polyp, and provider recommendation for colorectal cancer screening, if any. In addition, we asked patients whether colorectal cancer screening was discussed at the visit. If the response was yes, we then asked patients how satisfied they were with the PCP communication during the visit in general using a 5-point Likert scale to a number of items describing the communication. A medical record review was conducted to collect data on provider ordering and patient completion of the following colorectal cancer screening tests during the study period (i.e., 6 months from the time of the clinical encounter): fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy.</description>

               -  colonoscopy within the past 10 years

               -  barium enema within the past 5 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are deemed clinically not appropriate for colorectal cancer screening due

          <description>Intervention arm- Prompting by prevention nurses and a communication sheet provided
A prevention nurse addressed the process of communication by activating the patient to initiate and conduct a discussion on colorectal cancer screening at the clinical encounter with their PCP. The prevention nurse also provided a talking guide to the patient which was a double-sided single sheet that contained specific communication content pertinent to colorectal cancer screening that should be addressed with the PCP during the clinical encounter and included specific information on fecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy. The patient and PCP could determine the depth at which the communication occurred depending on factors such as time and competing clinical demands. Included in this talking guide were items designed to assist the PCP in assessing the patient's perception of the communication that occurred during the clinical encounter.</description>

          <title>Charlson Comorbidity Index</title>
          <description>The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a measure of comorbid burden. The index is a weighted sum of the presence of up to 22 comorbid conditions, which are each provided a weight of 1, 2, 3, or 6 as originally derived based on the contribution of each comorbid condition to one-year mortality. A score of 0, indicates the absence of the measured comorbidities, and higher scores indicate a higher level of comorbid burden, with a higher predicted risk of death.</description>

        <title>Completion of Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests</title>
        <description>A survey collected data on patient demographic characteristics, family history of colorectal cancer or polyp, and provider recommendation for colorectal cancer screening, if any. In addition, we asked patients whether colorectal cancer screening was discussed at the visit. If the response was yes, we then asked patients how satisfied they were with the PCP communication during the visit in general using a 5-point Likert scale to a number of items describing the communication. A medical record review was conducted to collect data on provider ordering and patient completion of the following colorectal cancer screening tests during the study period (i.e., 6 months from the time of the clinical encounter): fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy.</description>

The prevention nurse also provided a talking guide to the patient which was a double-sided single sheet that contained specific communication content pertinent to colorectal cancer screening that should be addressed with the PCP during the clinical encounter and included specific information on fecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy. The patient and PCP could determine the depth at which the communication occurred depending on factors such as time and competing clinical demands.

          <title>Intervention</title>
          <description>Intervention arm- Prompting by prevention nurses and a communication sheet provided
A prevention nurse addressed the process of communication by activating the patient to initiate and conduct a discussion on colorectal cancer screening at the clinical encounter with their PCP. The prevention nurse also provided a talking guide to the patient which was a double-sided single sheet that contained specific communication content pertinent to colorectal cancer screening that should be addressed with the PCP during the clinical encounter and included specific information on fecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy. The patient and PCP could determine the depth at which the communication occurred depending on factors such as time and competing clinical demands. Included in this talking guide were items designed to assist the PCP in assessing the patient's perception of the communication that occurred during the clinical encounter.</description>
