  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and objects： Amyloid plaques and tau protein are the landmarks of
      neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other hand, it is reported that
      cerebral ischemia may induce amyloid plaques and tau protein accumulation. However, it was
      difficult to in vivo disentangle the complex and dynamic interactions between AD
      pathophysiology and cerebral vascular injury during the post-stroke cognitive impairment
      development in the past. With the advent of novel radiotracers specific to cerebral amyloid
      plaques and tau protein, we aim to conduct a prospective multimodal neuroimaging cohort study
      to investigate the contribution of vascular injury, amyloid plaque and tau protein to
      cognitive impairment.

      Subjects and methods： The prospective project plans to recruit patients with vascular
      cognitive impairment (VCI) (Group A, n=200), Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) (Group B, n = 200), and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) (Group C, n =30). In addition,
      another 60 healthy people will be recruited as the control group (Group D, n=60). [18F]AV45
      and [18F]MNI-958(PMPBB3) PET will be done for imaging cerebral amyloid plaque and tau protein
      distribution, brain MRI for obtaining structural and functional information, and
      neuropsychological tests for cognitive performance. Cognitive evaluation will be repeated 18
      months after recruitment. In addition, APOE genotyping and carotid ultrasound will be
      performed as well.

      By obtaining the neuroimaging information, such as severity of white matter change and
      infarction, cortical and hippocampal atrophy, and SUVRs of [18F]AV-45 and
      [18F]MNI-958(PMPBB3) PET, the study will be able to investigate the composite influence of
      cerebrovascular disease and neurodegenerative pathology on the trajectory of cognitive
      impairment. Group comparisons will be performed using the Chi-square test, independent t
      test, Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA test, and multiple linear regression, where appropriate.

      Anticipation： In this project, we will able to explore the distribution patterns of amyloid
      plaque and tau protein among dementia patients with different etiologies, and also evaluate
      their influence on cognition.

    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) change score between baseline and 18-month follow-up will be calculated for primary endpoint determination. Two-sample independent t-test will be performed to compare the CDR-SB change score between patients positive and negative for tau protein accumulation. Patients will be stratified into tau-positive and tau-negative groups, and the presentations of their cognitive state will be recorded at the 18-month follow-up visit.</description>
