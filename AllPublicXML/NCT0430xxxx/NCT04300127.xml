      Objective • The principal objective of this pilot study will be to evaluate whether 8 weeks
      of treatment of pioglitazone will improve symptoms as measured by the Gastrointestinal
      Symptom Index Daily Diary (GCSI-DD) in patients with Idiopathic Gastroparesis

      Secondary objectives of this study include:

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on other symptoms associated with gastroparesis
           using the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Symptom Severity Index (PAGI-SYM)
           and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS),

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on gastric emptying as measured by the 13C-
           Spirulina breath test,

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on satiety as measured by a liquid caloric test

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on depression and anxiety using the Beck
           Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Scores,

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on Quality of Life using the PAGI-QoL and Short
           Form (SF)-36 questionnaire,

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on markers of inflammation (CRP and ESR) and
           serum cytokine levels

        -  To determine the nature and incidence of adverse effects from a 12-week course of
           pioglitazone.

      Treatment group

      • Pioglitazone (30 mg po qd)

      Population • Age 18 years or older at registration with nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms
      suggestive of patients with chronic nausea and vomiting of presumed gastric origin, with
      symptomatic gastroparesis.

      Study duration

        -  Up to 4 weeks of screening prior to pioglitazone treatment

        -  8 weeks of treatment starting at initial dose of pioglitazone

        -  4 weeks of washout period

        -  Length of recruitment: 16 months

      Sample size justification

        -  Total of 10 patients

        -  Primary comparison: Baseline PAGI-SYM score versus 4, 8, and 12 weeks.

      Number of clinical centers

      • Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.

    <measure>Change in Severity of gastrointestinal symptoms as assessed by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of Pioglitazone on nausea, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and upper abdominal pain as per changes in patient scoring in The American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (ANMS GCSI-DD) which has been designed to assess symptoms associated with gastroparesis. Symptoms are rated as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), very severe (4) scale of the worst severity of the symptom over the last 24 hours.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life as assessed by the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Quality of Life scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of Pioglitazone on quality of life assessed by the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Quality of Life (PAGI-QoL). The PAGI-QOL instrument consists of 30 items, each with response options based on a 6-point scale and with a recall period of the previous 2 weeks. The items are grouped into 5 dimensions: Daily Activities, Clothing, Diet and Food Habits, Relationship and Psychological Well-being and Distress. A score per dimension as well as a total score can be calculated. The PAGI-QOL scores range from 0 (lowest QoL) to 5 (highest QoL).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Functional status as assessed by the SF-36v2 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of Pioglitazone on quality of life assessed by the SF-36v2 Health Survey. The SF-36v2 is a 36-item, self-report measure designed to assess quality of life in patients. This measure also provides two summary scores (physical and mental health) and eight scale scores. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain and general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability, i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in C- reactive protein level in blood</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before treatment and after 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of Pioglitazone on Inflammatory markers as per changes in the values of C reactive protein (CRP) in blood. Normal CRP levels are below 3.0 mg/L.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before treatment and after 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of Pioglitazone on Inflammatory markers as per changes Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) in blood. Results are reported as the millimeters of clear fluid (plasma) that are present at the top portion of the tube after one hour. The normal range is 0 to 22 mm/hr for men and 0 to 29 mm/hr for women.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mood as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of Pioglitazone on mood as per changes in the score of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). The BDI-II is a commonly used, reliable 21-item self-report measure designed to assess for depression. Individuals are asked to respond to each question based on a two-week time period. The BDI-II is widely used as an indicator of the severity of depression, but not as a diagnostic tool. BDI-II items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on the severity of each item. The maximum total score is 63.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mood as assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of Pioglitazone on mood as per changes in the score of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The STAI is a 40-item self-report measure designed to assess anxiety. This measure provides two subscale scores (State and Trait). STAI is one of the first tests to assess both state and trait anxiety separately. Each type of anxiety has its own scale of 20 different questions that are scored. Scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores correlating with greater anxiety.</description>

The BDI-II is a commonly used, reliable 21-item self-report measure designed to assess for depression. Individuals are asked to respond to each question based on a two-week time period. The BDI-II is widely used as an indicator of the severity of depression, but not as a diagnostic tool.
