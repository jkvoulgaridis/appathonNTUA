  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is the most common form of diabetes among children and youth,
      and it is increasing around the world, particularly among children under 5 years. This is
      worrisome given the chronic nature of the disease and its strong association with an
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence suggests that markers of CVD are
      already present in children with T1D, making prevention a clinical and public health priority
      in this high-risk population. Despite this, a good understanding of what factors predispose
      children with T1D to CVD is still lacking. Our study aims to better understand in this
      population what individual and familial characteristics increase the risk for heart disease,
      how to best measure it early on and what are the potential mechanisms underlying the
      heightened risk for heart disease in youth with T1D. Specifically, we aim to: 1) better
      understand how physical activity and sedentary behavior are associated with early markers of
      CVD in children with T1D; 2) better understand how inflammation and insulin resistance are
      associated with early markers of CVD in children with T1D; 3) determine if insulin resistance
      explains the association between lifestyle habits and early markers of CVD in this
      population. To achieve these objectives, we will evaluate the presence of cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) markers, including established (dyslipidemia, hypertension) and novel (cardiac
      structure, endothelial function, myocardial oxygenation) markers in 100 adolescents with type
      1 diabetes (T1D) and 100 healthy controls, and compare associations of lifestyle habits
      (physical activity, diet, sedentariness, sleep) with CVD markers across both groups. Our
      study provides an exceptional opportunity to increase our knowledge on what factors
      predispose children with T1D to cardiovascular disease. Understanding the interplay between
      T1D, lifestyle habits and metabolic markers and CVD is critical to developing effective
      prevention strategies for these vulnerable children.
