  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a pragmatic clinical trial to test the effect of patient navigation on lung
      cancer screening (LCS) low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) completion among Boston Health
      Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) patients at increased risk for lung cancer. Patient
      navigation is a strategy for guiding individuals through complex health systems, and we
      hypothesize that this may be a promising approach for helping homeless-experienced people
      overcome their unique barriers to obtaining LCS.

      We will aim to recruit 300 people to participate in this research study; 100 will be randomly
      assigned to arm 1 (usual care) and 200 will be randomly assigned to arm 2 (patient
      navigation). Randomization of participants will be stratified by smoking status, housing
      status, clinical site, and whether they have previously discussed LCS with their primary care
      provider (PCP) to ensure balance between study groups on these variables. People assigned to
      the usual care arm will be referred back to their PCP for further management. People assigned
      to the patient navigation arm will be given the chance to work with a LCS navigator. The
      navigator will assist participants and their PCPs with all aspects of the LCS process in
      addition to offering brief tobacco counseling for current smokers.

      The primary aim of the trial is to determine—among homeless-experienced people who are
      eligible for LCS—the effect of patient navigation on 1) LCS LDCT completion at 6 months
      post-enrollment and 2) LCS LDCT completion at 6 months with diagnostic follow-up of abnormal
      results within 1 month of the recommended time frame. Study outcomes will be assessed by
      examining participant health records.

      Following the intervention, qualitative interviews will be conducted with 40 participants and
      10 BHCHP PCPs to better understand how the LCS process unfolds in the setting of
      homelessness, the ways in which the navigator facilitated this process, and opportunities for
      improving the navigation intervention for future use.

    <description>Participants must achieve the primary outcome and, if the result is abnormal (Lung-RADS category 3 or 4), also obtain the next recommended follow-up test within 1 month of the advised timeframe based on the Lung-RADS framework. Radiology records will be obtained for participants who underwent LDCT for LCS to document the findings of the study, determine the Lung-RADS category associated with those findings, and ascertain the recommended diagnostic follow-up plan.</description>

    <description>The navigator's principal role is to guide participants through the lung cancer screening (LCS) process. The navigator will work within the existing BHCHP clinical structure and collaborate with participants' PCPs to facilitate LCS low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) referral, completion, and timely follow-up by addressing participants' barriers to LCS completion and enhancing participants' self-efficacy. The navigator's secondary role is to offer brief tobacco counseling for participants who currently smoke.</description>
