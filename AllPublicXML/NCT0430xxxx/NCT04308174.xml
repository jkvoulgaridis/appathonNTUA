    <textblock>
      Considering that the poor prognosis of resected biliary tract cancer and negative impact on
      the survival outcomes of R1/R2 resection, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve R0 resection
      rates and the survival outcomes of patients with resectable biliary tract cancer. The
      addition of durvalumab to gemcitabine/cisplatin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve the
      R0 resection rates compared to gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with localized biliary tract
      cancer. In this phase 2 trial, a total of 45 patients with localized biliary tract cancer
      will be 2:1 randomized to durvalumab plus gemcitabine/cisplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin.
