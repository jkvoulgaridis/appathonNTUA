  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to conduct a single-arm pilot test of online yoga classes for young adult
      cancer survivors (YACS). Study hypotheses are that LYNC will be feasible (enrollment of &gt; 50%
      of eligible) and acceptable (75% attendance at all sessions). In addition, analyses of
      preliminary efficacy outcomes will examine whether participants report potential improvements
      in psychosocial and physical wellbeing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit YACS (n=30) for an 8-week course (75-minute yoga classes delivered
      once per week) delivered online via videoconferencing software such as Zoom or Bluejeans.
      During yoga classes, all participants will be able to see one another, to simulate the group
      experience of being in an in-person class. Participants will complete patient-reported
      outcomes of physical and psychosocial wellbeing at baseline (prior to class 1) and
      post-intervention (after class 8), as well as post-intervention measures of
      feasibility/acceptability (e.g., ease of accessing online classes, satisfaction with yoga
      classes, helpfulness of online yoga, barriers/dislikes associated with online yoga). All
      surveys will be administered via REDCap. In addition, the investigators will compute rates of
      retention (% of consenting subjects who complete post-intervention assessment) and adherence
      (# of yoga classes attended).

    <description>Health behaviors are measured with a 10-item scale adapted from investigators' prior research. Items allow for calculation of body mass index (based on self-reported height and weight), determination of the amount of physical activity per week, and indicators of diet quality. Items are based on American Cancer Society and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for health behaviors in cancer survivors.</description>
