  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common debilitating disorder that affects many
      individuals exposed to aversive events. The severity of PTSD symptoms is positively
      correlated with amygdala activation. More severe PTSD symptoms following exposure to
      stressful events, are associated with amygdala hyper-responsivity prior to exposure. A
      possible intervention for PTSD is Neurofeedback (NF) - a treatment method based on learned
      self-modulation of neural activity in response to feedback of neural signal. Previous work in
      the investigator's lab established a NF training procedure that utilizes the temporal
      abilities of EEG with the spatial advantages of fMRI. Further work based on this method using
      the amygdala BOLD signal (EEG-finger-print, EFP) has demonstrated a potential for improving
      the ability to self-regulate amygdala activity and to improve emotional regulation in a
      healthy population. The current study aims to investigate the potential of this method as a
      therapeutic intervention for PTSD among men with a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA).

      Pretreatment phase- All participants will undergo clinician evaluation and self-report
      measures in TASMC. In addition, they will receive a WatchPAT (wearable technology) for
      tracking sleep for 2 nights.

      Participants will receive 10 sessions of NF-EFP once a week for ten weeks. NF-EFP sessions:
      For the duration of each NF-EFP session the participant will be seated comfortably in front
      of a computer screen. A staff member will explain the goal of the meeting to the participant,
      present the equipment to be used and describe the course of the meeting. The EEG-NF practice
      will consist of four-minute segments repeated for up to 30 minutes. During each practice
      segment the participant will be asked to modify visual media that provides feedback on the
      degree of successful brain training. The duration of one session is approximately 45 minutes.

      Post treatment phase -All participants will undergo clinician evaluation and self-report
      measures in TASMC. In addition, they will receive a WatchPAT (wearable technology) for
      tracking sleep for 2 nights.

    <description>WatchPAT (wearable technology) will track REM latency and sleep latency . These will be compared and corrected using MANOVA as an outcome analysis. To assess sleep globally, we will aggregated: increased sleep latency , reduced sleep efficiency (the ratio of the total time spent asleep compared to the total amount of time spent in bed) and lack of proper deep sleep (quantified using &quot;deep sleep percent&quot; and &quot;REM sleep percent&quot;, i.e. the ratio of the total time spent in deep/REM sleep out of the total sleep time) into one reported value. For full explanation and calculation of index see Goldway, et al. (2019).</description>

    <measure>Self-report questionnaires- PCL (PTSD checklist )</measure>
    <time_frame>The Self-report questionnaires will be administrated: pre-treatment (baseline), post-treatment (up to two weeks post-treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure (20 items) of PTSD symptoms reflecting the diagnostic criteria of DSM 4+5. The self-report rating scale is 0-4 for each symptom, Rating scale descriptors are: &quot;Not at all,&quot; &quot;A little bit,&quot; Moderately,&quot; &quot;Quite a bit,&quot; and &quot;Extremely.&quot; A total symptom severity score (range - 0-80) is obtained by summing the scores for each of the items, higher values represent more severe PTSD. Symptom cluster severity scores is obtained by summing the scores for the items within a given cluster, i.e. for DSM 5: cluster B (items 1-5), cluster C (items 6-7), cluster D (items 8-14), and cluster E (items 15-20).</description>

    <description>20 items self-administered composing the alexithymia scale. The TAS-20 has 3 sub-scales: Difficulty Describing Feelings subscale is used to measure difficulty describing emotions. Difficulty Identifying Feeling subscale is used to measure difficulty identifying emotions. Externally-Oriented Thinking subscale is used to measure the tendency of individuals to focus their attention externally. Items are rated using a 5-point Likert scale whereby 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. The total alexithymia score is the sum of responses to all 20 items, while the score for each subscale factor is the sum of the responses to that subscale. Higher scores represent higher alexithymia rate.</description>
