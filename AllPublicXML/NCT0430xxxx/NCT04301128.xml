    <textblock>
      This study was carried out to develop mobile application on the android platform for the
      subcutaneous anti-TNF drug adherence of ankylosing spondylitis patients and to evaluate the
      effect of this application on drug compliance.

      The universe of this experimental designed posttest control group research is consisted of
      patients prescribed subcutaneous anti-TNF drug due to ankylosing spondylitis in Eskişehir
      Osmangazi University Health, Application and Research Hospital Rheumatology Polyclinic
      between 15 December 2017 - 30 June 2019. The patients who constituted the sample of the study
      were assigned by lot to mobile application and the education booklet groups. The mobile
      application that includes follow-up and information related to disease information, anti-TNF
      drug application and management was transferred to mobile phones of patients in mobile
      application group via bluetooth technology and installed. The patients in the education
      booklet group were given an education booklet on disease information, antiTNF drug
      administration and management. In the study, patients were evaluated once before anti-TNF
      drug treatment and every 6 weeks during 6 months (4 times) after treatment. The data of the
      study were collected by means of an individual identification form, BASDAI, BASFI, ASQoL,
      Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and Subcutaneous Anti-TNF Treatment Adherence
      Questionnaire. Data obtained from data collection forms will be analysed using IBM statistics
      25.0 package programme.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects the axial spine,
      causing progressive limitation on the spine and leading to a decrease in quality of life.
      Anti TNF drugs are frequently used in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and teaching
      activities in improving patient compliance and patient compliance are very important in the
      success of this treatment. This study was carried out to develop mobile application on the
      android platform for the subcutaneous anti-TNF drug adherence of ankylosing spondylitis
      patients and to evaluate the effect of this application on drug compliance.

    <description>Patients' drug adherence was assesed every 6 weeks during 6 months (4 times) after anti-TNF treatment.
The scale, which measures drug compliance and consists of 4 questions, is answered as yes / no.If all the questions were answered &quot;no&quot;, drug compliance was considered high, if one or two questions were answered &quot;yes&quot;, drug compliance was moderate, and if three or four questions were answered &quot;yes&quot;, drug compliance was considered low.</description>

    <description>Patients in the experimental group were able to install and set up mobile application on android phones via Bluetooth and were informed about the sick android application. Patients were reminded and guided by subcutaneous anti-TNF drug treatments from mobile application. Both groups of patients were then assessed using face-to-face interviews for 6 months, 6 weeks after using the Sub Cutan Anti-Tnf-α Therapy Questionnaire, BASDAI, ASQoL, BASFI and Morisky Drug compliance scales.</description>

    <description>An anti-TNF drug administration training booklet were given to patients in the control group and were required to take advantage of the booklet on subcutaneous anti-TNF drug production. Both groups of patients were then assessed using face-to-face interviews for 6 months, 6 weeks after using the Sub Cutan Anti-Tnf-α Therapy Questionnaire, BASDAI, ASQoL, BASFI and Morisky Drug compliance scales. At the end of the study (twenty forth week) was applied to all patients.</description>
