    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe the pain-relieving effect obtained with the current post-surgery
      pain control methods used in breast surgery by measuring the painful sensation and the
      consumption of opioids in the first 24 post-surgery hours. It also aims to describe the
      appearance of any complications such as post-surgery nausea and vomiting. Current anesthesia
      involves the combined use of intravenous painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs such as
      acetaminophen, ketorolac, tramadol or morphine (the latter via PCA system =
      patient-controlled analgesia) or for local administration at the surgical site level ( local
      anesthetics). It is also proposed to describe the intensity and interference of pain in daily
      activities

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the second most common in the world and the most frequent in the female
      population. In Italy, around 48,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2013. Every year patients
      undergoing surgical procedures in the region of the breast and armpit, like other surgical
      areas, report a significant incidence of acute postoperative pain which in 25-60% of cases
      can progress to chronic pain and therefore it needs a timely and effective control.

      Breast surgery is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting
      (PONV) whose etiology is multifactorial and includes factors such as age, type of
      intervention, positive history of PONV and, primarily, the amount of morphine used to ensure
      postoperative analgesia, the type of anesthesia and the intensity of postoperative pain.

      The conventional anesthesiological approach to breast surgery involves the use of general
      anesthesia and postoperative analgesic therapy based on opiates and fans. Some techniques of
      locoregional anesthesia such as paravertebral block, thoracic peridural analgesia and
      intercostal block, associated with sedoanalgesia or general anesthesia, have joined the
      standard anesthesiological conduct helping to improve pain control, response to surgical
      stress, post-operative respiratory function, the incidence of thromboembolic events and it
      seems they can also contribute to reducing the incidence of distant metastases. In addition,
      making possible a reduced use of opiates further decrease the incidence of PONV. As part of
      this multimodal approach to anesthesia and analgesia for breast surgery, PECS Block I and II
      and the Serratus Plane Block (SPB) have recently been introduced into clinical practice.

Analgesia will be evaluated every 6 hours and for the first 24 post-operative hours (at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 hours from the end of the surgical intervention) through the NRS (Numerical Rating Scale).
The Numerical Rating Scale is a pain sensation rating scale at points where the patient chooses a value ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain). From 1 to 3 it is considered mild pain, from 4-7 moderate, from 8-10 severe.</description>

    <measure>Description of the change of the intensity of pain on daily activities reported by patients undergoing breast surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The painful sensation is assessed by six questions on the quality of pain experienced in the previous 24 hours; for each question, an answer corresponding to a numerical value from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum) according to the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is requested and recorded. In addition, the percentage of relief provided by analgesic drugs, possibly taken, is investigated by administering a question and recording a percentage value, from 0% (minimum) to 100% (maximum), referring to the percentage sensation of pain relief. A second question is requested related to the type of drug possibly taken. At the end of the questionnaire, an overall score is calculated regarding the questions on the intensity of pain (0-40, 0-10 points for each answer to questions 3 to 6). A score of 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain) is referred to the percentage of relief given by the analgesics corresponding to the value given in percentage / 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Description of the change of the interference of pain on daily activities reported by patients undergoing breast surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The interference of pain includes the evaluation of 7 fields referring to which patients can express for each field, according to a numerical scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum), how much pain interferes. The numerical scale from 0-10 allows to record a response that varies between 0 = no interference in the activity, and 10 = completely interferes with the activity. This scale has been validated according to psychometric criteria. At the end of the questionnaire, an overall score is calculated regarding the questions on the intensity of pain (0-40, 0-10 points for each answer to questions 3 to 6). A score from 0-10 refers to the percentage of relief given by the analgesics corresponding to the value given as a percentage / 10. An overall score is calculated from 0 (no interference) to 70 (maximum interference), from 0 to 10 for each of the seven fields.</description>

    <description>The incidence on daily pain activities will be assessed 3 months after surgery through the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI ) scale in the Italian validated version. The Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire evaluates the multidimensional experience of pain through two domains: the intensity of pain and the interference of pain (see the following outcome) in daily activities.An overall final score is calculated from 0 (minimum) to 120 (maximum) corresponding to the multidimensional experience of pain, obtained from outcomes 5 and 6</description>
