      The study is a prospective, single arm phase I/II study. The primary aim of this study is to
      evaluate the feasibility of 111In-PSMA I&amp;T radio guided surgery in patients diagnosed with
      prostate cancer who are highly suspected of having one or more pelvic lymph node metastases
      based on pre-operative imaging.

      Patients with prostate cancer who have a high risk of lymph node metastases based on PSMA
      PET/CT and scheduled for robot-assisted PLND (with or without prostatectomy) will be
      recruited. Eligible patients will receive an additional ferumoxtran-10 enhanced MRI to
      complement pre-operative imaging. Twenty-four hours before surgery, patients will receive the
      radiolabelled PSMA tracer. Pelvic Lymph node dissections are carried out according to
      standard of care procedures. During surgery, the surgeon will be provided with a gamma-probe
      to detect PSMA expressing lymph nodes in vivo. Dissected samples will be systematically
      assessed on tracer accumulation using the gamma-probe ex vivo. After surgery, the samples
      will be scanned in the small animal SPECT/CT and 7T-MRI. After scanning, samples will be
      presented to pathologists for pathological analysis according to standard of care including
      staining for PSMA expression. At 3 months after surgery, patients will undergo a PSMA-PET/CT.
      Up until one year after surgery patients will be followed according to standard of
      care-guidelines by 3-monthly serum-PSA measurements.

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of 111In-PSMA-I&amp;T radio guided surgery in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer who are highly suspected of having one or more pelvic lymph node metastasis/metastases based on pre-operative imaging. Feasibility will be defined as the ability to intra-operatively detect the lymph nodes (using a gamma probe) which were pre-operatively identified on PSMA-PET/CT</description>
