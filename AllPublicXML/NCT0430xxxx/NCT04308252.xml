    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine stool microbiome composition and biomarkers that
      are differentially abundant and those that are associated with response to treatment (eg,
      anticonvulsant drugs).

    <textblock>
      Recent research suggests that the intestinal microbiota plays a central role in human health,
      and may play a role in a variety of central nervous system disorders, including seizure
      susceptibility. The microbiota has been shown to be associated with changes in factors
      relevant to neurotransmission, including neurotransmitter signaling, synaptic protein
      expression, long-term potentiation, and myelination. In addition to the microbiota's
      potential role in general neurotransmission, research suggests that the gut microbiome may
      differ between patients with pharmaco resistant and pharmaco-sensitive epilepsies. In support
      of this idea, ketogenic diet has been used as an alternative treatment for those with
      pharmaco-resistant epilepsy and there are indications of possible direct interactions of
      anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) with the intestinal microbiota.

             months prior to the Screening Visit (or within 5 half lives of the investigational
             product, whichever is longer) or is currently participating in a study of an
             investigational product.
