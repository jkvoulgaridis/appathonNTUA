  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-centre, non-randomised study to evaluate the
      absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of an oral solution of
      [14C]-ibrexafungerp following administration in healthy male subjects.

      Each subject will receive a single dose of [14C]-ibrexafungerp and will be followed for up to
      20 days. During this period total radioactivity will be measured in blood, urine and faeces.

      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-centre, non-randomised study to evaluate the
      absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of an oral solution of
      [14C]-ibrexafungerp following administration in healthy male subjects.

      Each subject will receive a single dose of [14C]-ibrexafungerp and will be followed for up to
      20 days. During this period total radioactivity will be measured in blood, urine and faeces.

      All subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures for the study at the screening
      visit. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on the evening prior to dosing (Day
      -1). A single oral dose containing [14C]-ibrexafungerp oral solution will be administered to
      subjects. Individual subjects will be released from the clinical unit following study-related
      procedures on Days 8 to 20 according to their % of radioactivity collected in relation to the
      dose administered.
