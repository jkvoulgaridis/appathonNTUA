  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept pilot study to investigate the efficacy of mepolizumab in the
      treatment of eosinophilic fasciitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study designed to generate preliminary data in evaluating the efficacy
      of mepolizumab (Nucala) in the treatment of EF using mean change in the Rodnan Skin score
      (mRSS) before and after treatment. The study is powered at 90% to detect a 4 point change in
      the mRSS at a 5% significant level with a minimum target accrual of 6 patients.
