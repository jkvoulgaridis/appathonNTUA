    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the intracellular pharmacokinetics and platelet effects of abacavir
      (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and emtricitabine (FTC) in persons
      living with HIV that are receiving these medications as part of standard HIV care.

      Participants remaining on ABC/3TC- or TAF/FTC-containing therapy will be on study for 4
      weeks, and will have two visits: a screening visit and one short PK visit consisting of a
      single blood draw at week 4.

      Participants switching from their ABC/3TC-containing therapy will be on study for 3 weeks,
      and will have nine visits: a screening visit and 8 short PK visits consisting of a single
      blood draw at Day 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 18, and 21.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abacavir (ABC) and lamivudine (3TC) are recommended antiretroviral medications used in the
      treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Both medications are nucleos(t)ide
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), which get converted to their active, phosphorylated
      forms following entry into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). However, NRTIs can
      also get phosphorylated in other blood cell types. There is limited knowledge regarding the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of abacavir and lamivudine anabolites in red blood cells (RBCs),
      neutrophils, and platelets. Abacavir has also been linked with prothrombotic activity and an
      increased risk of cardiovascular events in. These findings have not been replicated with
      other NRTI medications, such as tenofovir and emtricitabine. This study will characterize the
      PK of these NRTI medications in different cell types of persons living with HIV (PLWH) on
      these therapies, endogenous nucleotide levels in platelets, and assess platelet activity.
