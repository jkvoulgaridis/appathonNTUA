  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a study that was approved nine years ago (EK-22/2009) we could show (i) that spinal
      manipulative therapy (SMT) is a very effective and safe treatment for acute and chronic
      lumbar disc herniation (LDH); (ii) that SMT is as effective and less expensive than lumbar
      nerve root injections and (iii) that the recurrence rate up to one year was very low in acute
      and in chronic LDH patients. However, the long-term outcome of this conservatively treated
      LDH patients is unknown. Thus, the objective of this amendment is to investigate the
      proportion of long-term recurrences in these patients who were treated with SMT for their LDH
      and to compare these results with already existing data from other treatments, e.g. surgery.
      This is important information to know whether this conservative method is a sustainable
      approach for treating LDH.

      All 148 patients with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed disc herniation who were recruited
      for the study EK 22-2009 will be re-contacted to assess the course of their back problem
      during the past approx. nine years using a questionnaire.
