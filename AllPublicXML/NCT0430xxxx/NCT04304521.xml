  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodynamic and fluid optimization during perioperative period can reduce postoperative
      morbidity. The assessment of preload and determination of whether the patient is fluid
      responsive is still challenging. Static preload indices such as central venous pressure are
      not accurate to assess fluid responsiveness contrary to dynamic preload indices such as pulse
      pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume (SV) variation. However, such indices suffer from
      several limitations and should be used under strict conditions. Alternative dynamic methods
      such as lung recruitment maneuvers (LRM) have been developed LRM can be used to reopen or
      prevent collapsed lung under mechanical ventilation so as to decrease respiratory
      complications. LRM induces a transient increase in intra-thoracic pressure and decreases in
      venous return, leading to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic area and stroke
      volume. Several studies have shown that the PEEP-induced decrease in stroke volume is related
      to pre-existing preload responsiveness. Few studies have also shown that LRM can represent a
      functional test to predict fluid responsiveness. However, monitoring stroke volume during LRM
      to assess fluid responsiveness is costly, and cardiac output devices may not be reliable. In
      this context, central venous pressure (CVP) or systemic arterial parameters monitoring are
      easily accessible and inexpensive during major surgery.

      The aims of the current study were

        1. to assess the ability of a LRM with a stepwise increase of PEEP to predict fluid
           responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients,

        2. to identify the best criteria for fluid responsiveness prediction between variations of
           systolic aortic pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic aortic pressure
           (DAP), pulse pressure (PP) and central venous pressure (CVP),

        3. to compare the ability of these criteria with pulse pressure variation (PPV) to predict
           fluid responsiveness
