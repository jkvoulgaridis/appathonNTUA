  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study designed to estimate the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of SYHA1801, a BRD4
      inhibitor in patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be performed in two parts. Part 1 will enroll patients with advanced solid
      tumors. Patients will receive SYHA1801 orally on Days 1 and 4-31 in the first cycle.
      Enrollment will follow a dose-escalation schedule until grade 3 drug-related adverse events
      are observed, at this point the i3+3 enrollment design will be used. Dose increments will be
      guided by data generated from previous levels. The dose and possibly the schedule will be
      adjusted to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). If a patient wishes to continuously
      receive study treatment on completion of Cycle 1, the patient can continue study treatment in
      28-day Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles.

      Part 2 will enroll patients with specific solid tumor which might potentially respond to BRD4
      inhibitor. Patients will receive SYHA1801 at a dose and schedule established in Part 1.
