  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training improves walking capacity and regional perfusion in patients with
      Intermittent Claudication (IC). Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) and Endothelial
      Microparticles (EMPs) could play an important role in this process, promoting the healing of
      the diseased endothelium.

      The investigators are going to measure EPCs and EMPs in a group of patients with IC and in a
      control group of healthy individuals before a treadmill test and 2, 24, and 48 hours after
      the test. Subsequently, a group of IC patients will be randomly assigned to perform a 12-week
      home-based exercise training program.

      The investigators expect a significant increase of EMPs and EPCs after acute and chronic
      physical activity. We expect also a correlation between the increase of EMPs and EPCs and the
      improvement in walking capacity. Aim of the study is to demonstrate that acutely performed
      aerobic exercise could be able to promote the mobilization of EMPs and EPCs in patients with
      IC and that endothelial progenitor cells mobilization could play a pivotal role in exercise
      induced improvement of walking performance and endothelial function in subjects with IC.

    <description>Five training sessions weekly for 12 weeks are scheduled. Each session lasts 60 minutes divided into 45 minutes of aerobic workout and 15 minutes of circuit training. The aerobic workout consists of walking on a flat floor or on a slight uphill (maximum slope 3%): patients should walk until submaximal walking capacity (80% of their MWT) and rest as they would experience pain at the lower limbs; afterwards, they should start to walk again, once the pain was improved. Resistance training consists of calisthenics exercises focused on trunk and lower limbs muscles (bicycle, flutter kicks, squats, lunges, calf raises, wall sits and power press) with at least 3 repetitions for each exercise, interspersed by 30 seconds recovery. Duration of repetitions increases every 3 weeks.</description>
