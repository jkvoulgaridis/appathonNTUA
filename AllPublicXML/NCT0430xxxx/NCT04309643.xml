                  and follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels (&gt; 40 IU/L) consistent with
                  postmenopausal status

               2. Sexual partner is sterile, or of the same sex

               3. Double-barrier method (any combination of physical and chemical methods)

               4. Non-hormone releasing intrauterine device in females

          -  Continuous non smoker who has not used nicotine containing products for at least 3
             months prior to the first dosing and throughout the study

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 32.0 kg/m2

          -  Medically healthy with no clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, or ECGs

          -  Understands the study procedures in the informed consent form, and be willing and able
             to comply with the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive pregnancy test

          -  History or presence of clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition or
             disease

          -  History of any illness that might confound the results of the study or pose an
             additional risk to the subject by their participation in the study

          -  History or presence of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 2 years prior to the
             first dosing

          -  A positive tuberculosis test at screening or history of incompletely treated or
             untreated tuberculosis

          -  Positive results at screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)

          -  Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to dosing
