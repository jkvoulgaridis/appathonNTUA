  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disease obesity continues to be a major health issue in the US with over one third of the
      population having a mass index &gt;30 kg/m2. Obesity is associated with serious cardiometabolic
      complications including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and myocardial infarction. Rates
      of successful obesity treatment with weight loss and weight maintenance remain low. Several
      endoscopic bariatric therapies have been approved for use in the United States, including
      three intragastric balloon systems (2 fluid-filled and one gas-filled), which have lower
      risks than bariatric surgery and do not alter gastrointestinal anatomy. Weight loss with all
      intragastric balloons is higher than lifestyle therapy or weight loss medications, but less
      than bariatric surgery. Unlike weight loss medications where weight loss from the medication
      is regained within 6-8 months after therapy ends, weight loss maintenance with intragastric
      balloons remains high with 66-88.5% of the weight loss maintained 6 months after device
      removal. Data suggests that space occupying devices with a volume of 400 ml or more in the
      stomach increase feelings of fullness and result in weight loss, but this does not explain
      the prolonged effect of weight loss maintenance after balloon removal. Although few studies
      have investigated the mechanism of action of fluid-filled balloons on weight loss, these data
      suggest that gastric emptying as well as space occupation contribute to weight loss. However,
      no studies have investigated the mechanisms of action of gas filled intragastric balloons on
      weight loss.

      Understanding the mechanisms responsible for weight loss with the gas filled intragastric
      balloon system and any weight loss independent effects on blood glucose control would lay the
      groundwork for studies evaluating predictors of response to improve patient selection as well
      as studies understanding the mechanisms behind weight loss maintenance and developing
      strategies to prolong weight loss maintenance. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study is
      to determine the effects 10% total body weight loss (%TBWL) in patients with obesity treated
      with the intragastric balloon (GF- IGB) system compared to patients with obesity treated with
      a meal replacement program (MRP) on 1) gastric emptying, 2) hormonal adaptation to weight
      loss and 3) hunger.

    <description>Obalon balloons are gas-filled balloons used for weight loss by taking up more space in the stomach. There are three separate balloons that are placed. They are inflated once the capsules containing the balloons are swallowed. The second balloon is swallowed two weeks after the first balloon, and the third balloon is swallowed four to eight weeks after the second balloon. All three balloons are removed six months after the first balloon is placed.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Meal Replacements are used for weight loss in order to achieve a very low-calorie diet that is nutritionally balanced. Four to five meal replacements are consumed per day. If only four meal replacements are consumed per day, three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit are consumed as well. This program lasts for about five months or twenty weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>GF-IGB: Obalon Balloon</intervention_name>
    <description>The Obalon balloon, contained in a capsule and attached to a thin catheter, is swallowed by the patient in a standing position. Once the two-step verification of balloon passage into the stomach by both fluoroscopy and pressure reading, the balloon is inflated to a volume of 250 ml with a nitrogen-mix gas and the catheter is removed. The process is repeated at week 2 for the second balloon and between weeks 4-8 for the third balloon based on patient preference. All patients are given an individualized calorie prescription by a registered dietitian for a goal of up to 2 pounds of weight loss per week. The balloons are removed endoscopically 6 months after placement of the first balloon. Patients also attend monthly virtual individual diet coaching and monthly virtual group behavior coaching sessions both delivered by a registered dietitian for twelve months focused on long-term behavior change, 6 months while the balloons are in place and six months after the balloons are removed.</description>

    <description>Patients are given an individualized calorie prescription by a registered dietitian for a goal of 2 pounds weight loss per week. Patients are seen in a group-based program once a week focused on long-term behavior change and use meal replacements for a nutritionally balanced very low-calorie diet for 20 weeks. 4-5 meal replacements are consumed per day. If only 4 meal replacements are consumed, individuals eat 3 servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruit per day as well.</description>
