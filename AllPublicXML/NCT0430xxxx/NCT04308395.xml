  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must have completed PellePharm Study Pelle-926-201 or Pelle-926-301.

          2. Study Pelle-926-301 subjects must have completed the End of Treatment Visit in Study
             301, prior to the Screening Visit in this study. They must also complete all Study 301
             related procedures prior to the Baseline Visit of this study.

          3. The subject must be willing to abstain from application of a non-study topical
             medication (prescription or over the counter) to facial skin for the duration of the
             trial except as prescribed by the Investigator. Moisturizers and emollients are
             allowed. Subjects will be encouraged to use their preferred sunscreen with a sunscreen
             protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 daily on all exposed skin sites.

          4. Female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test. For Study 301 subjects a negative
             serum pregnancy test result from Study 301 is acceptable if the test was done within 7
             days of the Screening Visit of this study.

          5. If the subject is a woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP), she must be willing to
             use birth control methods which may be considered highly effective. Hormonal
             contraception must be supplemented with a barrier method (preferably condom). Birth
             control must start prior to Baseline, continue through the duration of the study, and
             for 30 days after last application of investigational product (IP).

          6. If the subject is a male with a female sex partner who is a WOCBP, the subject must be
             willing to use condoms, even after a vasectomy, starting prior to Baseline, through
             the duration of the study, and for at least 3 months after the last application of IP.

          7. The subject is willing for all facial BCCs to be evaluated and follow treatment
             recommendations made only by the Investigator.

          8. The subject is willing to forego treatment of facial BCCs with anything other than the
             study IP except when the Investigator believes that delay of treatment of a BCC
             potentially might compromise the health of the subject. In such instances, the only
             other allowed form of treatment is surgical.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has used topical treatment to the face or systemic therapies that might
             interfere with the evaluation of the study IP.

          2. The subject has current, recent (within five half lives of the experimental drug or if
             half life not known, within the past 6 months prior to the Screening Visit), or
             planned (while enrolled in this study) participation in an experimental drug study
             (excluding Study 301).

          3. The subject is a WOCBP who is unwilling or unable to comply with pregnancy prevention
             measures.

          4. The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.
