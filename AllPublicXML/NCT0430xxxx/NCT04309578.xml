        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with inoperable, locally-advanced or recurrent and/or metastatic gastric
             adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who are not eligible for
             curative therapy and are histologically diagnosed.

          2. Diseases measurable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST1.1) using imaging technique (CT or MRI).

          3. Tissue HER2-negative tumors (primary or metastatic tumors) defined as IHC2+ and FISH-
             or IHC 0 or 1+ according to gastric cancer assessment system for HER2 (see Annex
             12.5).

          4. ECOG Performance status 0, 1 or 2 (see Annex 12.1).

          5. Survival for at least 3 months should be possible.

          6. Appropriate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic functions. General inclusion criteria

          7. Males or females aged 19 years.

          8. Patients should sign the informed consent form (ICF).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who previously received chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic diseases
             (adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy, completed at least 6 months prior to enrollment in
             this clinical study, is permitted, but platinum-based adjuvant/neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy is not permitted).

          2. Patients with a lack of physical integration of the upper gastrointestinal tract or
             with a malabsorption syndrome (e.g., patients who underwent partial or total gastric
             resection can participate in this clinical study, but patients equipped with a
             jejunostomy tube cannot participate).

          3. Patients with active (serious or uncontrolled) gastrointestinal bleeding.

          4. Patients with relevant toxicities remaining following previous curative therapy
             (except for alopecia). For example, neurotoxicity ≥ grade 2 based on NCI-CTCAE version
             5.0.

          5. Patients with a history of other malignant diseases based on the date of complete
             recovery within 5 years prior to the initiation of treatment in this clinical study
             (except for in-situ cervical cancer and basal cell carcinoma).

             Hematologic, blood chemistry, and organ functions

          6. Neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 × 109/L, or platelet count &lt; 100 × 109/L.

          7. Serum bilirubin&gt; 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); or AST or ALT &gt; 2.5 × ULN (or &gt; 5
             × ULN hepatic metastasis patients); or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 × ULN (or &gt; 5 × ULN
             hepatic metastasis patients, or &gt; 10 × ULN hepatic metastasis-free bone metastasis
             patients); or, albumin &lt; 2.5 g/dL.

          8. Creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min. However, creatinine clearance is first calculated
             using the Cockroft-Gault formula, and if the value is &lt; 60ml/min, a 24hr urine
             collection test is carried out. Subject enrollment is possible only when creatinine
             clearance is ≥ 60mL/min.

             pressure &gt; 100 mmHg); clinically significant heart valve disorders; and high-risk
             uncontrolled arrhythmia.

         10. Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% (measured with echocardiogram
             or MUGA).

         11. Patients with dyspnoea at rest due to advanced tumors or other diseases, or who need
             an adjuvant oxygen therapy.

         12. Patients who are treated with long-term or high-dose corticosteroids (steroid
             inhalation or short-term use of oral steroids for vomiting inhibition and appetite

             exclusion criteria

         17. Females who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.

         18. Fertile males and females who are unwilling to use effective contraceptive methods.

             treatment with the study drug (palliative radiation curative therapy that is partially
             carried out for bone metastasis. Washout period of 2 weeks is also permitted in
             patients recovered from all acute toxicities.).
