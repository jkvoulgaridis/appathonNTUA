      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and
      c-Kit kinase.It is a randomized, controlled, multicenter phase II clinical trial conducted in
      China, and plan to recruit 80 patients who were primarily diagnosed with unresectable or
      metastatic biliary tract cancer who have not received previous systemic treatment.To evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib Hydrochloride in Combination With PD1 With Gemcitabine
      Plus(+)Cisplatin Compared With Gemcitabine +Cisplatin as First-line Chemotherapy for
      Unresectable or Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancer.
