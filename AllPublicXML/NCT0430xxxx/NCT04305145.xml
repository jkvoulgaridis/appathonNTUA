  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the effectiveness and safety of infliximab therapy compared
      with steroids in the treatment of ipilimumab-induced colitis in patients with III/IV
      melanoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, signal-detection trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      the drugs Infliximab, Methylprednisolone and prednisone to manage the side of effect of
      colitis from the standard of care drug ipilimumab

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Infliximab

        -  Methylprednisolone

        -  Prednisone

      Participants will receive ipilimumab and any other cancer treatments per standard of care for
      stage III/IV melanoma at the discretion of treating oncologist.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants are expected to be on study treatment for up to 7 weeks and followed every to 6
      months as agreed.

      It is expected that about 42 people will take part in this research study.

      The FDA has approved infliximab, methylprednisolone, and prednisone as treatment options for
      colitis.

      Patients will also receive ipilimumab as part of the standard of care for stage III/IV
      melanoma.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ipilimumab as a treatment option for
      III/IV melanoma.
