  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study are to investigate whether heart rate variability (HRV) parameters
      derived from nonlinear time series analysis at five different time points have prognostic
      utility for assessing the risk of postimmunisation AOP in very preterm/very low birth weight
      infants immunised in the hospital.
