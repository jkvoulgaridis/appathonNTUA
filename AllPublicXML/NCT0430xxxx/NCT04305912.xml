  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate and compare the performance of verofilcon A to
      somofilcon A when worn on a daily disposable modality over a period of approximately one week
      each.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -

        A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:

          1. Is at least 17 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer;

          2. Has read and signed an information consent letter;

          3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;

          4. Habitually wears soft contact lenses in daily wear, for minimum of 6-months;

          5. Is correctable to a visual acuity of 20/40 or better (in each eye) with the study
             lenses;

          6. Has an astigmatism of â‰¤ 1.00 D in subjective refraction;

          7. Can be fit with study contact lenses with a power between -2.00 and -5.00 DS;

          8. Demonstrates an acceptable fit with the study lenses;

          9. Habitually wears single vision soft contact lenses for at least 8 hours per day, 5
             days a week, and is willing to wear contact lenses for at least 12 hours a day in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -

        A person may be excluded from the study if he/she:

          1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;

          2. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;

          3. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study
             outcome variable;

          4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator
             may affect a study outcome variable;

          5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study;

          6. Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment because the
             associated hormonal changes cause changes in the tear layer which impact contact lens
             comfort. Verbal confirmation at the screening visit is sufficient;

          7. Is aphakic;

          8. Has undergone refractive error surgery;

          9. Is an employee of the Centre for Ocular Research &amp; Education;

         10. Has participated in the BOXER (i.e. EX-MKTG-107, phases 1 or 2) or MIKI (EX-MKTG-114)
             Study;

         11. Has participated in any clinical trials within a week prior to the study.
