  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proper synthesis of thyroid hormones is dependent on adequate iodine supply. The mean
      daily iodine intake recommended by World Health Organization is 150 mg. Iodinated contrast
      medium (ICM) typically contains 13 500 mg of free iodine and 15-60 g of bound iodine, an
      amount well above acceptable upper level. In a situation of excess iodine, thyroid
      discontinues the release of hormones (Wolff-Chaikoff effect), which is usually transient,
      although can persist causing hypothyroidism. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (IIH), known as
      the Jod-Basedow phenomenon is infrequent, but elderly patients and individuals with
      autonomously functioning nodular goiters are at higher risk of developing this dysfunction.
      According to recent studies the risk of ICM-induced hyperthyroidism appears to be low. The
      prevalence has not been well assessed and varies from 1 % to 10 %. Currently, there are no
      specific guidelines concerning the prophylactic therapy of IIH. American Thyroid Association
      (ATA) does not recommend routine administration of antithyroid drugs before iodinated
      contrast medium for all patients, however, advises to consider prophylaxis in patients at
      high risk of developing IIH or with cardiovascular comorbidities. ATA recommends avoidance of
      additional iodine and administration of b-blockers alone or with antithyroid drugs as a
      treatment of IIH, depending on the severity of hyperthyroidism.

      This study was performed to evaluate the influence of ICM on thyroid status and advantages of
      prophylactic therapy during ICM exposure in patients with euthyroid goiter and cardiovascular
      comorbidities. The association between the incidence of IIH and thyroid volume was also
      assessed.

      Patients were divided into two subsets on the basis of received prophylactic therapy. Group
      with prophylaxis (13 patients) received thiamazole alone (7 patients) or with sodium
      perchlorate (6 patients). The prophylaxis was administered one day prior to iodinated
      contrast medium (ICM) and for at least 14 days after ICM for thiamazole (20-40 mg/daily) and
      10 days after ICM for sodium perchlorate (900 mg/daily). Group without prophylaxis (23
      patients) received no prophylactic treatment. Laboratory tests were performed before and
      after ICM injection in all patients from both evaluated groups. Each individual had TSH and
      creatinine level measured at baseline. The investigators analyzed clinical data such as age,
      sex, mean volume of contrast media, goiter size and patients' comorbidities. Levels of TSH,
      FT3 and FT4 were evaluated retrospectively at different points in time after ICM.
      Ultrasonography was performed in each patient to assess thyroid morphology. The investigators
      performed a comparison between both groups in regard to duration of overt hyperthyroidism and
      thiamazole treatment. Thyroid volume was compared between patients who developed
      hyperthyroidism after ICM injection and remained euthyroid after ICM injection. Patients
      diagnosed with overt hyperthyroidism were treated with thiamazole.

    <description>Evaluation of TSH, FT3 and FT4 levels at different points in time after iodinated contrast medium injection. Normal thyroid function was defined as TSH levels between 0.27 and 4.20 mIU/L. The reference range for fT4 and fT3 was 0.93-1.7 ng/dl and 2.0-4.4 pg/ml, respectively.</description>

    <description>Analysis of association between thyroid volume and changes in thyroid status after iodinated contrast medium injection. Normal thyroid function was defined as TSH levels between 0.27 and 4.20 mIU/L. The reference range for fT4 and fT3 was 0.93-1.7 ng/dl and 2.0-4.4 pg/ml, respectively. Subclinical hyperthyroidism was diagnosed on the basis of suppressed TSH and normal fT4 and fT3 values. Overt hyperthyroidism was defined as TSH level below lower limit and elevated fT4 and/or fT3 concentrations. Ultrasonography was performed in each patient to assess thyroid volume [ml]. Enlargement of the gland was defined as a volume exceeding 18 ml in females and 25 ml in males.</description>
