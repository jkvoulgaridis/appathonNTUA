  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy
      of testosterone replacement on cancer-related fatigue in older men with incurable cancer who
      report fatigue and have low testosterone levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group trial to determine the efficacy of 6 months of physiological testosterone replacement
      therapy in improving cancer related fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and body composition and
      muscle function in men 60 years and older with active lung or colorectal cancers, who report
      fatigue and have testosterone deficiency.There will be 5 study visits: 1) Screening, 2)
      Baseline, 3) 2-Week Dose Adjustment Visit, 4) Three-month visit (Week 12), and 5) Six-month
      visit. Testosterone or placebo gels will be applied by eligible trial participants at home;
      participants will be trained on gel application procedures by research personnel.

    <time_frame>6 monthas</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome is change in fatigue score. Fatigue will be assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy fatigue scale (FACIT-Fatigue)- The FACIT-Fatigue has been widely used in studies related to cancer-related fatigue and is able to detect clinically meaningful differences in fatigue scores in response to treatment. Population norms for the FACIT are also available, facilitating the interpretation of fatigue levels in patient populations. This instrument has been well-validated, is responsive to treatment and more sensitive to change in fatigue than other instruments. Score range: 0-52, the higher the score the better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mood and Well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mood and well-being will be assessed by Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), which includes 10 questions each for Positive Affect and Negative Affect. Many behavioral scientists consider affectivity as the cleanest window on an individual's wellbeing. The most sensitive indicator of impaired wellbeing has been shown to be affective dysregulation, which is reflected in affectivity balance. The latter incorporates negative affects (e.g., anxiety, depression) as well as positive affects (e.g., joy).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men with active lung or colorectal cancers who have received or are receiving chemo-
             and/or radiation therapy

          -  Age: 60 years and older

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  Serum testosterone, measured by mass spectrometry (gold standard method), of &lt;348
             ng/dl and/or free testosterone &lt;70 pg/ml. The lower limits of the normal range for
             total testosterone in healthy men is 348 ng/dL and the lower limits of free
             testosterone is &lt;70 pg/ml in the Framingham Heart Study sample. As sex hormone binding
             globulin levels may be elevated in some men with cancer (resulting in elevation in
             total testosterone level), some of these symptomatic men may still be hypogonadal
             despite having total testosterone above this cut-off limit, but their free
             testosterone levels may still be below the lower limit of normal. Thus, men with free
             testosterone &lt;70 pg/mL will be included.

          -  Fatigue. Fatigue was selected as it is a highly prevalent symptom in cancer patients.
             Fatigue will be defined as a score on FACIT-Fatigue subscale of &lt;40, which best
             divides cancer patients from the general population with accuracy.

          -  Ability and willingness to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men with current or prior history of hormone-dependent cancers (breast, prostate)

          -  Men with brain metastases from any type of cancer

          -  Use of anabolic agents (testosterone, DHEA, growth hormone) within the past 6 months

          -  Current use of systemic glucocorticoids (unless part of the chemotherapy regimen)

          -  Appetite stimulating agents (e.g. megestrol acetate) within the past 1 month

          -  Hematocrit &gt;48%, serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL; ALT 3x upper limit of normal

          -  PSA &gt;4 ng/ml; nodule or induration on digital rectal exam

          -  International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)&gt;19

          -  Severe untreated sleep apnea

          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure

          -  Myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, revascularization surgery, stroke or
             thromboembolism (of any etiology) within 6 months

          -  Known history of thrombophilia due to a genetic mutation (e.g. Factor V Leiden)

          -  Previous stroke with residual cognitive or functional deficits

          -  Inability to provide informed consent; MMSE score &lt;24

          -  Poorly controlled diabetes as defined by hemoglobin A1c &gt;8.5%

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2

          -  Untreated unipolar depression (treated depression is allowed)

          -  Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia
