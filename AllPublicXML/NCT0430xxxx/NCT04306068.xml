  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balance is essential for successful dance performance. The effort of salsa dancers is given
      by the levels of stability, produced by the muscular activation of lower limbs.

      The objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention of plyometric
      exercises in the improvement of balance in salsa dancers from 18 to 25 years.

      Randomized clinical study. 40 dancers will be randomized to the two study groups:
      experimental (application of plyometric exercise protocol) and control (without
      intervention). The treatment will last 5 weeks, with 2 weekly sessions of 25 minutes each.
      The dependent variables will be: equilibrium (measured with star excursion balance). The
      sample distribution will be calculated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnof test. The changes after
      each evaluation will be calculated with the t-student test. With an ANOVA of repeated
      measures, the intra and intersubject effect will be observed. The effect size will be
      obtained with Cohen's formula.

      It is expected to see improvement in the stability of the ankle and the level of balance in
      the dancers.

    <description>The Star excursion balance test will be used. Before performing the test, the movements will be explained. The test will be calculated in 3 directions with three tapes 140cm long and with a goniometer the subsequent sections of 135º from the previous section will be calculated, and 45º between the subsequent sections.
Participants will start standing with both feet with the midpoint on the intersection mark in the center of the grid. They will be instructed to keep their hands on their hips, their heads facing forward at all times and keeping their feet flat on the floor trying to reach as far as possible in all three directions. The range will be measured by marking the tape with a pen and then measured with a measurement quote.</description>

    <description>Each session will last 20 minutes, with 2 sessions a week, over a period of 5 weeks. The intervention will last 20 minutes, which consists of a 4-station circuit.
Exercise 1: jump on the rope, with your feet together at a moderate pace. Exercise 2: In standing with hands on the hip and hip flexion (one foot in front). Knee flexion and dorsal ankle flexion, with straight trunk. Alternate legs.
Exercise 3: box jump (jump on the box with both feet at the same time). Exercise 4: depth jumps from box to antoher box (jump on the box with both feet at the same time and when falling, immediately jump to the other box).
1 minute with 30 seconds between sets.</description>
