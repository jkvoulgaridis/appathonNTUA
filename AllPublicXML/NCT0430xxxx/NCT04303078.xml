  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the underlying mechanisms that contribute to high
      energy costs for people with cerebral palsy (CP) as they walk.

      The investigators will characterize the cost landscape of children with CP, quantifying the
      magnitude of cost (net nondimensional oxygen consumption) associated with walking and common
      sub-tasks of walking, such as supporting the body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with CP use large amounts of energy to walk and move, leading to fatigue and
      limiting participation. For people with CP the energetic cost of walking is on average over
      two times higher than typically-developing (TD) peers. This means that for people with CP,
      walking is as tiring as jogging or climbing stairs. An energetic cost of this magnitude
      restricts activities of daily living (ADL) and causes exhaustion.

      While the investigators and many others have sought to reduce these energetic costs through
      surgical interventions, rehabilitation, orthotics, or other assistive devices, these
      strategies have failed to result in meaningful reductions in energy. To design strategies
      that successfully reduce walking costs, the investigators must first understand the
      underlying mechanisms contributing to elevated cost in people with CP. This basic-science
      research will provide the foundation to create evidence-based strategies to decrease energy
      costs, minimize fatigue, and increase quality of life for people with CP and other neurologic
      injuries.
