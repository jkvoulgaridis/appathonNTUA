  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an observational study of predictors of complications and difficulty of trans-venous
      lead extraction procedure. This procedure is done for patient who had a previous cardiac
      pacemaker or defibrillator implantation which had a dysfunction or infection so needed to be
      extracted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantations has increased over
      recent years (1) with approximately 1.2-1.4 million CIEDs are being implanted annually
      worldwide.(2) Consequently this has been associated with increasing rates of infection and
      lead malfunctions, affecting approximately 1-2% of all CIED cases.(3)

      Recently, it is estimated that between 10 000 and 15 000 leads are extracted worldwide each
      year.(4) Over the past few decades, transvenous lead extraction (TLE) has evolved as the
      preferred method for leads removal being less invasive compared to surgical removal by open
      heart surgery which is now reserved for cases with high risk procedures or a very large
      vegetation.

      Most frequent indications for TLE are infection (accounting for 52.8%) and lead dysfunction
      (accounting for 38.1%) of all cases of TLE. (5)

      There have been different approaches (superior and inferior approaches) and techniques for
      TLE. Current techniques employ mechanical and/or laser equipment with variable success rates.
      The locking stylet has been the principal tool in these techniques, while the telescoping
      (powered or non-powered) mechanical or laser sheaths serve as the most important ancillary
      tools.

      Despite being a safe procedure with minor complications ranging from 0.06 to 6.2%, but
      serious complications may still arise in 0.2-1.8 % of cases in even the most experienced
      hands with mortality rates in several large registries amounting 0.2 - 1.2 %.(6) Although
      many studies have tried to identify risk factors for complications including patient/lead
      profile and centre/operator experience, major studies still have conflicting results.

      Recently, the hybrid approach, with mini-thoracotomy or thoracoscopy, has been introduced and
      supposed to be associated with increased safety in challenging TLE procedures. (7, 8)
