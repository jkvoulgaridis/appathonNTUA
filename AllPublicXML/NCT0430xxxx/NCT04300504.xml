  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite greater bone strength, a large proportion of older women with high body weight
      present to clinic with fractures. There is growing interest in the ability of muscle
      strength, performance and size to predict fracture risk. However, evidence suggests that poor
      muscle strength or performance is more predictive of falls and fracture risk than muscle size
      alone. Moreover, it has been shown that the combination of obesity and low muscle strength is
      associated with the highest risk of falls.

      MicroRNAs can act as messengers at the cellular level to promote or block processes for
      muscle growth and repair, amongst other things. There is evidence that ageing changes
      microRNA levels in the muscle and that these changes may result in reduced muscle quality and
      quantity. However, it is not known whether being obese can change microRNA levels in muscle
      and how this relates to physical performance.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of obesity on microRNA levels in muscle
      and muscle quality and quantity in the legs of older women.

      This is an observational, cross-sectional study. The researchers will recruit 4 groups of
      older women: normal weight, normal weight with dynapenia, obese and obese with dynapenia. The
      researchers will measure the quantity and fat content of muscle in the legs using magnetic
      resonance imaging. Muscle strength, fatigue and balance will be measured using gait (walking)
      analysis, balance tests, and a machine designed to measure leg strength and fatigue. As a
      sub-study, the investigators will take biopsies of a muscle in the thigh, vastus lateralis,
      to measure the microRNA levels of muscle.

      The researchers will measure and compare microRNA levels between groups. The researchers will
      use databases and computer programmes to look at all of the microRNAs which are different
      between groups and see how they affect the muscle. The researchers will compare muscle
      strength, size and fatigue between groups. The researchers will explore relationships of
      muscle quantity and quality measures with microRNA changes in the muscle. This approach will
      allow the researchers to understand how obesity affects the microRNA profile of muscle and
      whether this translates into impairment of function and mobility
