      Primary Outcome Measure:

        1. Withdrawal symptoms Change from baseline withdrawal symptoms (hospital admission) at the
           end of detoxification treatment (21 days) assessed by Cocaine Selective Severity
           Assessment (CSSA, minimum and maximum scores: 0 - 112). After treatment, the
           oxytocin-treated group is expected to have significantly lower withdrawal scores (better
           outcome) than the other groups (30%).

        2. Anxiety symptoms Change from baseline anxiety symptoms (hospital admission) at the end
           of detoxification treatment (21 days) assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes
           Measurement Information System Short Form scale (PROMIS, minimum and maximum raw scores:
           8 - 40). After treatment, the oxytocin-treated group is expected to show lower anxiety
           scores (better outcome) compared to the other groups (30%).

        3. Depression symptoms Change from baseline depressive symptoms (hospital admission) at the
           end of detoxification treatment (21 days) assessed by the Quick Inventory of Depressive
           Symptomatology Self-Report scale (QIDS-SR, minimum and maximum scores: 0 - 27). After
           treatment, the oxytocin-treated group is expected to show lower depressive scores
           (better outcome) compared to the other groups (30%).

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        1. Neuroleptic Dose Change Dose change of neuroleptic medications used during
           hospitalization for agitation or irritability (expected 25% lower).

        2. Adherence of outpatient treatment Rate of adherence of outpatient treatment six months
           after discharge (expected to be 20% higher) assessed by reviewing the medical records of
           each patient within the outpatient program. If patient would be enrolled in the
           outpatient program after six months from detoxification she will be considered adhered
           to the program (higher rates means better outcome).

    <masking_description>On the eve of the eighth day of hospitalization, a person in charge of the research team performed a randomization of the participants exchanged in blocks, according to the methods of Schulz and collaborators (SCHULZ; GRIMES, 2002). The responsible person did not have contact with the participants. The blocks were made up of 12 participants each, and the ratio was maintained at 4: 4: 4, in order to reduce the chances of the groups getting mixed amounts. The members of the research team responsible for data collection, the technical team of the inpatient unit and the participants did not know to what condition each patient had been allocated.
These procedures guaranteed the randomization and double blinding of the study.</masking_description>
