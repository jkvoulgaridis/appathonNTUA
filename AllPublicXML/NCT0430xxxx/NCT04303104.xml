  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TB remains the foremost infectious disease killer globally. A startling statistic is that two
      out of every five TB cases globally (40%) remain undiagnosed and untreated. These 'missed' or
      undiagnosed cases are disproportionately concentrated in large peri-urban 'slums' and
      informal settlements of large cities in Africa and Asia (they are frequently minimally
      symptomatic but remain infectious).

      The lack of a sensitive low cost same-day test represented a major challenge to active
      community-based case finding (ACF) compared to the current model where patients 'self-seek'
      care (passive case finding). More recently, sensitive TB DNA-detection tests called Gene
      Xpert (Xpert) have become available. This is a nucleic acid amplification test-based
      technology which can rule-in a diagnosis of TB in two thirds of smear negative pulmonary TB
      cases. GeneXpert® has now been rolled out in many African countries and is the frontline TB
      test in primary care clinics in South Africa. We recently showed that GeneXpert®
      significantly reduced the time to treatment initiation in the setting of passive case finding
      (elaborated in next section). We further showed that GeneXpert® can be performed by a
      minimally trained healthcare worker. However, historically technical and logistical demands
      meant that the GeneXpert® MTB-RIF assay was not ideally suited to use at point of care and in
      South Africa it is still centrally located.

      Small portable battery-operated versions of these tests are now available (EDGE, GeneXpert
      two-module mobile platform). We conducted a large study in South Africa and Zimbabwe
      (published in 2016) that showed that using the old non-portable version of Xpert on a
      mini-truck equipped with a generator was feasible and highly effective for ACF. In a
      subsequent study funded by the American government (XACT II), we showed that using the
      portable version of Xpert on the back of a small low-cost scalable panel van (in effect a
      mobile mini-clinic) was feasible and had a very high pick-up rate of TB in peri-urban
      communities (~10% of those undergoing targeted screening). In this study, we will test the
      hypothesis that community-based active case finding (ACF) using Gene Xpert Edge (in a low
      cost scalable mini-mobile clinic) performed at point-of-care (POC) is feasible and more
      effective (lower proportion of TB cases failing to initiate treatment especially if they are
      'super-spreaders' i.e. highly infectious) than Xpert performed in a centralised laboratory.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study (XACT III) we will use the same approach (as for XACT II), but we need
      to be sure that such a strategy is scalable and feasible in different settings where the
      challenges and conditions vary. More importantly, we need to methodologically optimize the
      ACF model. Thus, we need to determine where Xpert (the diagnostic test) should be optimally
      placed from a physical location point-of-view, i.e. do we really need to install it on the
      mobile mini clinic, or, can it be located in centralized laboratories (as it is now) with
      samples being sent to these laboratories? This is a very important question: we know that
      sending collected sputum samples to centralized laboratories will be much easier as it uses
      existing infrastructure, however, the downside is between 20 and 40% of patients fail to come
      back to collect their results (pre-treatment loss to follow-up; PTLF). Using the diagnostic
      in the mobile mini van (at point-of-care; POC) dramatically reduces this PTLF enabling quick
      diagnosis and interrupting transmission. To definitively settle the question, we need a study
      using the two different strategies to find out which strategy is most cost-effective yet can
      rapidly pick up the most cases and minimize transmission.

      There are two other important sub-questions that the study will answer. Chest X-rays, which
      can identify people at high risk of having TB, can now be automatically read by a computer
      algorithm (called computer-assisted diagnosis of TB; CAD-TB). It will be very important to
      know whether mass screening using CAD-TB can triage individuals i.e. narrow the net so that
      we target the ACF only to those at high risk of having TB. This could save even more money
      yet be just as effective.

      Secondly, a fundamental unanswered question is why individuals with minimal or no symptoms
      can be highly infectious (transmit disease)? We need to study this phenomenon in greater
      detail using cough aerosol readouts, chest X-rays, and looking at the TB strains. In addition
      we would like to screen contacts of individuals with confirmed tuberculosis This might
      provide medical science with the information it needs to design diagnostic or therapeutic
      interventions to address this important problem.

      However, the key priority now is to show that the XACT approach is feasible in different
      settings and to clarify how the molecular diagnostics should be optimally located. Answering
      these questions will allow the initiation of ACF programmes in many countries and will
      contribute critical data to policy makers so that guidelines on ACF can be disseminated and
      implemented.

             at any time in the past.

          4. HIV-negative adults (older than 18 years) with 1 or more of the following:• cough ≥ 2
             weeks• loss of weight• Fever• night sweats• generalized fatigue• haemoptysis• chest
             pain.

          5. Any HIV+ve adult (older than 18 years).

          6. Agrees to the collection and storage of blood, urine, sputum specimens for use for
             future research. (The participant may decline collection of specimens for human

             suspected TB.

          3. Patients already diagnosed with active TB.

          4. Patients unable to commit to a two month follow up or who do not wish to be followed
             up.

        Inclusion criteria for Household contacts (HHC)
