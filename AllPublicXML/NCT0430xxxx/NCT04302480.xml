    <textblock>
      The brief intervention comprises a 4-page worksheet used in the classroom (main intervention)
      and subsequent weekly e-messages through WhatsApp (booster intervention). The worksheets for
      both groups will be printed in colour, and mainly contain pictures and simple texts. Students
      will be asked to provide smartphone numbers of themselves and their parents for receiving the
      booster interventions. After sending 4-6 e-messages in 4 weeks, students will complete a
      1-month follow-up assessment.
