  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an entry-into-human study and will assess the effects of RO7284755 as a single agent
      and in combination with atezolizumab in adult participants with solid tumors considered
      responsive to checkpoint inhibition blockade. The maximum duration in the study for each
      participant will be up to 28 months.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of three parts: dose-escalation of RO7284755 as a single agent (Part 1),
      dose-escalation of RO7284755 in combination with atezolizumab (Part 2), and extension of
      RO7284755 as a single agent and/or in combination with atezolizumab (Part 3).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events in Part 1 and Part 2</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until end of Part 1 and Part 2 (up to approximately 1.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as AEs. All AE events will be graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization up to day 14 (Part 1) or day 28 (Part 2)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as a clinically significant AE (classified according to the NCI CTCAE version 5) or significant laboratory abnormality that occur during the DLT assessment periods, during Part 1 and Part 2 only, and is considered by the Investigator to be related to RO7284755 or to the combination of RO7284755 and atezolizumab. In Part 2, expected toxicities that are, in the opinion of the Investigator, entirely attributable to atezolizumab, will not be considered DLTs.</description>

    <measure>Investigator Assessed Objective Response Rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in Part 3</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of extension phase until disease progression, drug discontinuation, withdrawal or death (up to approximately 26 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with investigator-assessed objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels (as applicable to non-target lesions).</description>

    <time_frame>From start of extension phase until disease progression, drug discontinuation, withdrawal or death (up to approximately 26 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The disease control rate was defined as proportion of participants being either responder or in 'stable disease' (SD). To classify a response as SD, measurements will have to be classified as stable (according to RECIST v1.1) at least once at a minimum of 4 weeks after study entry.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response in Part 3</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of extension phase until disease progression, drug discontinuation, withdrawal or death (up to approximately 26 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response will be calculated for 'responder' participants (i.e. best [confirmed] overall response of CR or PR) and will be defined as the time from first occurrence of a documented response until the time of documented disease progression or death (death within 30 days from last study treatment) from any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
