  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Virtual Reality (VR) technology may help to provide a way for stroke survivors to
      exercise in their own time at home, with remote clinical support. Before we introduce this
      technology we need to test that it will work alongside current health services for stroke
      survivors. Aims: To find out if using the MAGIC-GLASS solution alongside current healthcare
      care is usable and acceptable to stroke survivors and helps to increase rehabilitation time.
      Design: Measures before and after stroke survivors use the MAGIC-GLASS solution.

      Setting: Stroke survivors will use the MAGIC-GLASS solution in their own home. Population:
      adults (≥18 years) who have had a stroke at least two weeks before they enter into the study.

      Interventions: Our VR technology is called MAGIC-GLASS, and in order to use the solution the
      user puts on a headset which is connected to a computer. They can then see a VR environment
      in which they will be able to see virtual hands that respond to the movements of their own
      hands. It will also be possible to see a mirror image of their hands moving. The system will
      record how much they use the system and improvement in their movement. Regular contact will
      be made with a clinician who will be able to use the system to see (from their clinic) how
      the stroke survivor is doing and talk to them. Outcomes: We want to find out how the stroke
      survivors' movement changes over time and what they think of using the system. We will also
      ask clinical staff what they thought of using the system as part of healthcare provision to
      stroke survivors. Finally we want to find out how much it will cost to use the system.

    <description>MAGIC-GLASS is a VR-based home system for stroke rehabilitation, developed by Ulster University (UK) in collaboration with Tech4Care srl (Italy) and miThings AB (Sweden) in the context of the EU-funded Project Magic (grant agreement No 687228). It includes a number of mini-games grounded on rehabilitation paradigms such as mirror therapy [29] and can adapt to the capability of a person. In addition, the games will include an automatic coaching system for giving feedback both on rehabilitation results (e.g. achievement of exercise goals) and performance (during the exercise itself, the system will give real time advice on the execution of the exercise).</description>
