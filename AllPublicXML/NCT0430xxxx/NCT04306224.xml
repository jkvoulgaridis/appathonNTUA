  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first-in-human, Phase I, open-label, multiple-ascending dose study to investigate
      the safety, tolerability, PK, PharmDyn, and clinical activity of IMC-002 in subjects with
      metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors and relapsed or refractory lymphomas.

      Male or female subjects 18 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors
      and relapsed or refractory lymphomas will be included in the study if they meet all the
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

      After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility during the
      Screening period (Day -28 to Day -1).

      The study will consist of 2 parts:

      Part 1: Dose Escalation Part 2: Expansion Cohorts
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1: Dose Escalation Dose escalation will follow the traditional 3+3 design. Cohorts of 3
      subjects will be given escalating doses of IMC-002 once every 2 weeks as an IV infusion over
      60 minutes. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) will be assessed during the 28-day DLT evaluation
      period. The decision to escalate to the next dose level will be based on safety assessments
      after all subjects of a cohort have reached Day 28 (DLT evaluation period).

      Part 2: Expansion Cohort The study may be amended in the future to include expansion cohorts
      in selected tumor types to further evaluate extended safety of IMC-002 at recommended Phase 2
      dose in that tumor type. Sample size in the Dose Expansion part will be determined when the
      study is amended to include the expansion cohorts.

    <intervention_model_description>Dose escalation will follow the traditional 3+3 design. Cohorts of 3 subjects will be given escalating doses of IMC-002 once every 2 weeks.
If none of the first 3 subjects in a dose cohort experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), another 3 subjects will be treated at the next higher planned dose level.
If 1 of the first 3 subjects experiences a DLT, 3 more subjects will be treated at the same dose level.
If no additional DLT is observed another 3 subjects will be treated at the next higher planned dose level. The dose escalation will be continued until 2 or more of the first 3 subjects, or 2 or more of the 6 subjects in a cohort experience a DLT. If the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, the Sponsor based on discussions with the safety monitoring committee may choose to further evaluate a lower previously administered dose or an intermediate dose level between the MTD and the preceding dose level.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Signed informed consent form (ICF)

          2. Adult (18 years or older)

          3. Histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors and
             relapsed or refractory lymphomas, for which no standard therapy known to prolong
             survival exists or have relapsed/refractory/PD following the last line of treatment

          4. Solid tumors must be measurable with at least 1 unidimensional measurable lesion by
             Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Lymphomas must
             have at least 1 measurable lesion according to the Lugano criteria with the Lymphoma
             Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC) modification

          5. Availability of tumor archival material or fresh biopsies for measurement of CD47

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at Screening
             and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months

          7. Adequate hematologic function, hepatic function, and renal function:

          2. Prior treatment with a CD47 or SIRPα targeting agent

          3. Concurrent anticancer treatments within 28 days before Day 1/first study treatment
             administration

          4. Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 6 weeks prior to Screening or

             metastases unless treated

          7. Comorbidities/medical history of any significant diseases that in the judgment of the
             Investigator would make the subject inappropriate for this study
