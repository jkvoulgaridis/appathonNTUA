  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice.
      Previous studies have shown that rate control strategy in AF is non-inferior to rhythm
      control strategy, in terms of stroke and mortality risk. In addition, rate control strategy
      is associated with lower risk of hospitalization and non-cardiovascular mortality. Therefore,
      rate control is an essential strategy to improve quality of life, decrease morbidity and
      prevent tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in AF patients. The recommended rate control
      agents include beta-blocker, nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), digoxin and
      amiodarone. However, in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patient, the medication
      of rate control were beta-blocker than digoxin. But several clinical observation study show
      excess mortality in AF patients. Ivabradine, a If inhibitor, it is well-established that a
      pacemaker current, If current, is functionally expressed in the sinus node . Previous studies
      have shown that Ivabradine, If inhibitor, significantly reduces sinus rate and improves
      prognosis in patients with systolic heart failure. Interestingly, several investigators found
      that hyperpolarization- activated cyclic nucleotidylated channel 4 current (HCN4), the main
      isoform of the channel responsible for If current, is also functionally expressed in the
      Atrioventricular node(AV node). Recent data have shown that inhibition of If current slows AV
      node conduction in animals and humans. Thus, we want to compare the effect of Ivabradine on
      ventricular rate with digoxin in this study.

    <description>To compare 1-10 Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale change between Randomization visit (Visit1/Week0) and treatment completion (Visit 5/Week 16). Total Treatment phase is 16 weeks. The number 1-10 Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale will be obtained pre and post 6 minutes walk test. The value of 1-10 Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale pre 6 minutes walking test will be compared between Randomization visit (Visit1/Week0) and treatment completion (Visit 5/Week 16), and the same type of comparison will be performed for 1-10 Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale values post 6 minute walk test. Rating score is as below: 0=Rest, 1=really easy, 2=easy, 3=moderate, 4=sort of hard, 5=hard, 6= between 5 and 7, 7=really hard, 8=between 7 and 9, 9=really really hard, 10=Maximal: just like my hardest race. Decrease in score value compared between Randomization visit (Visit1/Week0) and treatment completion (Visit 5/Week 16) represents better outcome.</description>
