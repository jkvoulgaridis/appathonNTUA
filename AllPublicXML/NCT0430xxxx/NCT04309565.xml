  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The overall objective of this study is to assess whether the Transitions Clinic
      Network (TCN) program, which provides enhanced primary care and opioid use disorder (OUD)
      treatment for people recently released from incarceration, improves measures in the opioid
      treatment cascade compared to referral to standard primary care.

      Participants: 800 individuals currently receiving medications for OUD released from six local
      jails (Bridgeport, CT; Bronx, NY; Caguas, PR; Durham, NC; Minneapolis, MN; Rochester, NY)

      Procedures (methods): This is a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation trial will
      randomize 800 people to one of two treatment conditions: TNC and referral to opioid treatment
      program (OTP) or standard care and referral to OTP. People will complete the recruitment
      process while in jail (screening, consent, baseline assessments, and randomization). Post
      incarceration participants will meet with research assistants for a structured interview and
      urine toxicology screening at 1, 6, and 12 months, and a phone interview at months 3 and 9.
      120 people will be selected to participate in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to access
      both the acceptability and appropriateness of the TCN intervention and the multi-level
      facilitators and barriers of OUD treatment engagement in the first 30 days following release
      from incarceration.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement in opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days following jail release</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study outcome will be engagement in OUD treatment within 30 days of jail release, defined as treatment consistent with the American Society of Addiction Medicine's levels of care (1-4), which allows for a range of treatments and clinical settings consistent with patient's needs and preference (e.g., office-based providers of buprenorphine or naltrexone, OTPs, or intensive outpatient, inpatient, or residential treatments). Patients do not need to be receiving methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone formulations (MOUD) to be considered engaged in OUD treatment. Consistent with our prior research, this will be measured based on a Yes/No question about engagement in OUD treatment from the Treatment Services Review (TSR). These responses will be used to calculate a count of participants engaged in OUD treatment. As appropriate, this information will be confirmed in the electronic health record or with the addiction treatment facilities after obtaining a signed release.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention in OUD treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following jail release</time_frame>
    <description>Retention in community OUD treatment will defined in accordance with the American Society of Addiction Medicine's levels of care (1-4), which allows for a range of treatments and clinical settings consistent with patient's needs and preference (e.g., office-based providers of buprenorphine or naltrexone, OTPs, or intensive outpatient, inpatient, or residential treatments). Patients do not need to be receiving MOUD to be considered retained in OUD treatment. Consistent with our prior research, this will be measured based on a Yes/No question about engagement in OUD treatment from the Treatment Services Review (TSR). These responses will be used to calculate a count of participants engaged in OUD treatment. As appropriate, this information will be confirmed in the electronic health record or with the addiction treatment facilities after obtaining a signed release. Re-incarceration (and resumption of MOUD in jail) will not count as retained in community OUD treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention on medication for OUD (MOUD)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following initial jail release</time_frame>
    <description>Retention on MOUD will be defined as receipt of any of the 3 FDA approved medications for OUD (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) within 7 days of the index date (release from jail/interview date) regardless of what MOUD participants were on at baseline prior to release (for those on naltrexone, it is required that their dose extend to no more than 7 days before the index date). This measure will be collected by using self report and as appropriate, will confirm self-report in the electronic health record or with the addiction treatment facilities after obtaining a signed release.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent days of illicit opioid use (relapse)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following initial jail release</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will measure percent days of illicit opioid use in a month. Investigators have defined relapse as 10/28 days of illicit opioid use, recognizing that episodic use (lapse) is inherent to the diagnosis of substance use disorder, yet allows time for patients to seek and receive treatment for their substance use. Investigators will measure this using TimeLine FollowBack asking the participant how many days in the past 28 days have they used illicit opioids. A urine toxicology that is positive for illicit opioids on testing will count as three days of using illicit opioids. Using the data from the TimeLine FollowBack and urine toxicology results, percent of days of illicit opioid use will be calculated for each participant at each time point.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention in primary care</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following jail release</time_frame>
    <description>Retention in primary care which is defined as 2 or more visits to primary care in twelve months. Participants will be asked to self-report the number of visits and this data will be used to count the number of participants retained in primary care.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overdose</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following initial jail release</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked about overdose events using self-report, when applicable, be supplemented by data from the electronic health record which will indicate visits to the emergency department and hospitalizations for overdose. In at least four TCN program sites, investigators will have access to administrative payer data (Medicaid) where investigators will be able to examine time to overdose as a secondary outcome. This data will be used to calculate a count of participants experiencing an overdose event</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Overdose</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following initial jail release</time_frame>
    <description>In at least four of the six TCN program sites, investigators will have access to administrative payer data (Medicaid) where investigators will be able to examine time to overdose as a secondary outcome. This data will be used to calculate time to overdose for each participant for each overdose event.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Death</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following initial jail release</time_frame>
    <description>Participant death will be collected using the electronic health record. In at least four of the six TCN program sites, investigators will have access to vital statistics data where survival analyses will be conducting with mortality as a secondary outcome.</description>

    <description>Transitions Clinic Network (TCN)- participants in this arm will be referred to a TCN program for primary care and community Opioid Treatment Program (OTP).
