  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pigmentary disorders such as melasma, lichen planus pigmentosus and vitiligo can
      significantly affect patients' quality of life. Treatment responses are usually slow and
      typically have limited efficacy. In recent years, low level laser therapy has been an
      emerging treatment modality for androgenetic alopecia, acne, wound healing and
      photorejuvenation. This is a prospective, double-blind, split-body, randomized controlled
      trial assessing the efficacy of low level laser therapy with red light for pigmentary
      disorders such as, melasma, lichen planus pigmentosus and vitiligo.

      This will be a participant and evaluator blinded trial with random allocation of one side of
      the face or affected area to treatment and the contralateral side as control. Random
      allocation of the treatment side will be performed using randomization software. Participants
      will be treated twice a week for 12 weeks with low irradiation 650 nm +/- 5 nm red light and
      followed up 4 weeks after completion of treatment. A trained blinded evaluator will assess
      clinical outcomes on week 4, week 8, week 12 and at follow up at week 16, using validated
      scores.
