      The primary objective is to provide the investigational product, IC14, at the dose of 8 mg/kg
      intravenously every 2 weeks for 12 weeks to 6 participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS). No clinical hypotheses are being tested. An extension for 6 additional doses every 2
      weeks will be allowed if the drug is safe and well tolerated.A second extension for 14 doses
      every 2 weeks will be allowed if the drug is safe and well tolerated.

    <textblock>
      Manipulation of immune-driven inflammatory responses may have therapeutic utility in
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and recent data suggest that ALS may respond to
      peripheral intervention by expanding Tregs in mice and humans. The approach with IC14 builds
      on this hypothesis by targeting CD14 as a master regulator of the immune response of
      peripheral cell populations, which in turn determines the activation status and phenotype of
      peripheral T cells that enter the central nervous system (CNS) and drive further microglia
      activation .Binding and blocking membrane CD14 (mCD14) on peripheral immune cell populations
      with IC14 may thus be a relevant therapeutic target in ALS.

      IC14 has been safe, well tolerated and had no serious adverse events related to study drug.

      This is a protocol for 12 weeks of the investigational medication IC14 for 6 participants. An
      extension for 6 additional doses every 2 weeks will be done if the drug is safe and well
      tolerated. Up to 20 subjects may be screened in order to identify eligible subjects that meet
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      At the screening visit, the Principal Investigator will review the study procedures and
      consent form with the participant. After obtaining informed consent, the participant will
      receive IC14 8 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks (Â± 7 days) for 6 doses (12 weeks). An
      extension for 6 additional doses every 2 weeks will be allowed if the drug is safe and well
      tolerated. A second extension for 14 additional doses every 2 weeks will be allowed if the
      drug is safe and well tolerated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent prior to initiation of any program-specific procedures.

          2. Familial or sporadic ALS defined as clinically possible, probable, or definite by
             Awaji-Shima Consensus Recommendations or other standard guidance.

          3. Adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function as defined by the patient's physician.

          4. Females of childbearing potential should be using and committed to continue using one
             of the following acceptable birth control methods:

               1. Sexual abstinence (inactivity) for 1 month prior to screening through study
                  completion; or

               2. Intrauterine device (IUD) in place for at least 3 months prior to study through
                  study completion; or

               3. Stable hormonal contraception for at least 3 months prior to study through study
                  completion; or

               4. Surgical sterilization (vasectomy) of male partner at least 6 months prior to
                  study.

          5. To be considered of non-childbearing potential, females should be surgically
             sterilized (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy at least
             2 months prior to study) or be post-menopausal and at least 3 years since last menses.

          6. Males with female partners of childbearing potential must use contraception through
             study completion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Dependence on invasive mechanical ventilation, defined as being unable to lay supine
             without it, unable to sleep without it, or continuous daytime use; presence of
             tracheostomy at screening;

          2. Known active current or history of recurrent bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial
             or other opportunistic infections; or major episode of infection requiring
             hospitalization or treatment with IV antibiotics within 4 weeks of baseline.

          3. Immunized with live-attenuated vaccines within 30 days before dosing. Participants
             must agree to forego live-attenuated vaccines throughout the program, including 12
             weeks after the last dose of IC14.

                  5 years, or breast cancer diagnosed within the previous 5 years (except skin
                  cancers other than melanoma).
