  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence to support individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) have altered
      gait biomechanics which may lead to re-injury and poor patient outcomes. Currently, there are
      no interventions specifically targeting these abnormal gait biomechanics. Evidence supports
      the use of an external focus of attention feedback to promote motor learning and retention.
      The overall purpose of randomized clinical trial is to determine the effects of a 2-week (8
      session) gait retraining protocol using an auditory external feedback instrument can (1)
      alter biomechanics during functional tasks (walking, step-down, lunge, lateral hops, and
      balance) (2) improve ankle cartilage measures and (3) improve patient-reported outcome
      measures.
