  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with characteristic deficits
      in social functioning and presence of stereotypic behavior. Several research studies have
      examined potential deficits in cognitive skills, such as working memory, in this condition. A
      meta-analysis of the studies aimed at evaluating working memory (WM) in autistic population
      suggested deficits in visual and verbal aspects of WM. Working memory training has also been
      studied in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD). The study includes development of mobile-based games for training WM and
      other cognitive skills in patients and the evaluation of such training in reducing symptoms
      of ASD. These games may also be useful for other neurodevelopmental disorders.
