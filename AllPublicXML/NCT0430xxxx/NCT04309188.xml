  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced sports performance, in our current world, is being pushed at the professional level
      and down to school-age children as well. Money is being spent on lessons and equipment to
      enhance performance. One new method to enhance performance is stroboscopic vision goggles.
      The glasses lenses flicker removing visual information for a brief moment. The claim is that
      they train connections between the eyes, brain, and body. We want to see if this product
      truly does enhance visual performance during a softball season for high school girls.

    <textblock>
      In today's sports world, every strategy to perform at the highest level is needed. Current
      literature is demonstrating enhanced sports performance using stroboscopic vision
      training.1,2,5 The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to measure the effect of
      a stroboscopic visual training in a high school softball season in comparison to controls.
      Athletes in the control group will go through normal practice drills for hitting and
      fielding. The stroboscopic training (experimental group) will use the strobe glasses during
      hitting and fielding drills two times a week in practice. The brand of strobe glasses is
      Senaptec Strobe. Athletes in both the experimental and control groups will have their vision
      assessed at the beginning of the season and end by The West Texas Vision Center. Measurements
      for vision will include developmental eye movement, vergence ranges, Randot stereopsis test,
      accommodative ranges, acuity, and stereo scores. On-field performance measurements will be
      collected for batting statistics including on-base percentage, batting average, slugging
      percentage, and hard-hit ball percentage in both the experimental and control groups. The
      current year batting statistics will be compared with the prior year statistics if enough
      at-bats occurred. In addition, to the vision and on-field hitting performance proprioception
      balance using the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) will be measured at the beginning of
      the season and end for both groups. Our data will provide quantified information for coaches,
      athletes, and health care providers concerning the benefits of the strobe glasses warrant
      buying to enhance sports performance. Additionally, we wish to determine whether visual-motor
      and proprioception balance changes occur after the training.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vergence ranges measured how many prism diopters the subject can turn their eyes in (base out) and how far they can relax them out (base in). This score is also a good measure of how much peripheral fusion a person has.</description>

    <measure>Developmental eye movement</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Developmental eye movement will measure how fast the subject can track numbers vertically and horizontally.</description>

    <measure>Randot stereopsis test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Randot stereopsis test will measures how many ARC seconds of stereo the subject has. This test measures the subject's magno and parvocellular stereo tracking their peripheral or central fusion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accommodative ranges</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Accommodative ranges will measure how many times the subject can clear an image looking through a plus and minus accommodation flipper in thirty seconds.</description>

    <measure>Batting statistics</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Batting statistics including on-base percentage, batting average, slugging percentage, hard-hit ball percentage will be provided by the coach at the end of the season for the current year and prior year. Subjects will need a minimum of 20 at-bats in a season for collection of these statistics.</description>

The glasses look like sunglasses but have liquid crystal technology that causes a flicker from clear to opaque. The glasses flickering will be controlled on the side of the glasses by the researcher. When the athlete can complete a skill proficiently by catching or hitting during training the level of flickering will be increased to challenge the visual system more.</description>
