  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections are an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Infections vary
      greatly in severity and can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. The rapid
      assessment of a patient to determine whether they have an infection and whether to treat with
      antibiotics is essential.

      Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW) is a (CE marked) new biomarker that has recently been
      studied in the emergency department (ED). This novel biomarker, which is currently available
      as a part of the panel of results from full blood count, holds the promise of reducing
      unnecessary antibiotic use and improving the outcome of patient's infections.

      Sepsis (blood poisoning) is a life-threatening condition that affects millions of people
      worldwide. The chance of dying from sepsis increases if there is a delay in treatment with
      the right antibiotics, but also using antibiotics incorrectly might lead to antibiotic
      resistance, which is dangerous for patients in the long term, as treatments might no longer
      work for them.

      An antibiotic is a substance produced naturally by microorganisms or synthetically by
      chemists in a laboratory. Antibiotics are capable of inhibiting the growth of or killing
      bacteria but are not effective against the viruses that cause many illnesses. The
      inappropriate use of antibiotics for these types of non-bacterial infections as well as the
      more frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has caused the emergence of newer strains of
      bacteria that are resistant to many antibiotics.

      Rapid diagnostics are essential to accurately identify cases of sepsis that require
      antibiotic therapy; particularly since clinical criteria alone is often insufficient to avoid
      misclassifying patients with sepsis who require antibiotics. However, the high costs of
      current laboratory markers, along with the variable level of evidence supporting their use in
      sepsis and respiratory infections means that these are not in routine use.

      This study proposes to make use of data collected routinely at St. George's University
      Hospital to evaluate the accuracy of MDW as a marker for sepsis in adult patients admitted to
      the ED, as well as to explore its usefulness in supporting clinical decisions related to the
      discontinuation of antibiotic treatment in hospitalised adult patients. This observational
      study will not involve changes in patient management as all the data would be analysed
      retrospectively.

      This is an observational, cross-sectional (single-gate) study comparing the results of the
      index test (MDW) against different reference standards (operational definitions). One of
      these references identifies a situation when IV antibiotics need to start (i.e. sepsis
      diagnosis) and the other, a situation when they need to be discontinued (i.e. clinical
      improvement).

      One reference standard will be Sepsis 3 definition and will be operationalised in ED using
      qSOFA ≥ 2. This is used in ED as a bedside score to identify patients with suspected sepsis.

      As part of the exploratory objectives for this ED dataset, sepsis will be operationalised
      using other common scores (SOFA, NEWS2, REDS, and Simplified-MISSED scores), and also against
      the reference standard for confirming septicaemia (blood culture results).

      The second reference standard will be expert clinical criteria. Antimicrobial stewardship
      groups and care team review antibiotic treatments for all inpatients at regular intervals.
      Decisions on whether discontinuation (due to clinical improvement) is indicated is ultimately
      based on clinical criteria.

      As part of the exploratory objectives for the dataset of in-patients, sepsis will be
      operationalised using the results of blood cultures. Also, different subpopulations will be
      described on the basis of MDW levels:

        -  Hospitalised patients admitted through ED but not in the sepsis pathway.

        -  Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI), surgical operations, and IV antibiotic treatment
           modification due to lack of clinical improvement and/or antibiotic resistance.

        -  Non-bacterial causes of septic syndrome (i.e. surgical tissue injury, myocardial
           infraction, pancreatitis, pulmonary-thromboembolism, influenza, RSV, autoimmune and
           neoplastic processes).
