  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for developing reliable and convenient technologies for telemonitoring of
      physiological signals such as respiration, cardiac function, and activity level in children
      and especially for those with heart disease. Changing symptomatology causes heart failure
      patients to seek medical attention in order to be assessed and potentially have medication
      adjusted or additional testing being undertaken. These frequent clinical encounters affect
      the quality of life of these children and their parents, as well as being costly for the
      health care system. A textile based technology for telemonitoring application that is
      comfortable and accurate in its data collection can help to provide real time information on
      physiologic parameters. The primary research objective is to determine the feasibility and
      validity of a textile-enabled sensor system in measuring physiologic variables, or
      &quot;biological signals&quot;, related to cardiopulmonary function in children. The study will include
      10 patients with heart failure, and 10 healthy controls.

    <description>Supine position: Participant lays on a bed on their back for 5 minutes
Sitting position: Participant sits on a chair for 5 minutes
Standing position: Participant stands for 5 minutes.
Exercise measurement: treadmill exercise test - the protocol entails increases of 0.5 mph every minute with zero change in the incline. Starting point would 1.5 mph. The test will be interrupted if the target heart rate of 190 beats per minute is reached or if symptoms and/or arrhythmias and ST depression would be observed. Patient will be monitor during recovery for 5 minutes.
Cool-down: Participants cool-down for 5 minutes</description>

             cardiomyopathy).

             OR

          2. Patients aged between 10 and 18 years with diagnosed congenital heart disease or
             cardiomyopathies referred to pediatric cardiology ambulatory clinic at SickKids.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. In-hospital patients.

          2. Patients too ill to participate or perform any activity.

          3. Patients with Fontan/single ventricle physiology circulation.

          4. Children who are less than 6 months post op from a cardiac surgery as they will have
             concerns from an activity and wound care standpoint.
