  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Manual treatment involves techniques based on the principles of moving the joint faces and
      separating the joint gap, and soft tissues mobilization techniques. The use of manual therapy
      in hemophilia is gradually increasing although it previously described as a contraindication.
      The utility and use of strengthening exercises in hemophilia has been going on for a long
      time. In this study, the effect of manual therapy and strengthening exercises joint was
      investigated in hemophilic arthropathy of the elbow.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of strengthening exercises and manual
      therapy on bleeding frequency, pain, range of motion, muscle strength, arm circumference,
      joint health, functionality and quality of life in the physiotherapy and rehabilitation of
      hemophilic arthropathy of the elbow. Seventeen adolescent and young adult hemophilic
      individuals aged 12-30 years with elbow arthropathy were included in the study. The
      individuals were divided into the two groups via simple randomisation as Manuel Therapy and
      Exercise Group (MTEG) and Home Exercise Group (HEG). The individuals in HEG were given
      strengthening exercises as a home program. Those in the MTEG were applied manual therapy by
      the physiotherapist and were given supervised strengthening exercises. All treatments were
      performed 3 times a week for 5 weeks totally 15 sessions. Frequency of bleeding was evaluated
      with number of bleeding in the last 5 weeks. Numerical Pain Scale was used for activity and
      resting pain. Range of motion and muscle strength were measured with universal goniometer and
      digital dynamometer, respectively. The Quick-DASH questionnaire and Oxford Elbow Score were
      used for the functionality of the upper extremity and quality of life, respectively. The
      joint health status was evaluated with Hemophilia Joint Health Score-Elbow Point and Hospital
      for Special Surgery-Elbow Scoring System. Evaluations were made by the same physiotherapist
      before and after treatment.
