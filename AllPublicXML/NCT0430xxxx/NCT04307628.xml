  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers will investigate blood and fecal responses in qualified study participants
      after eating walnuts for 4 weeks compared to not eating walnuts for 4 weeks. The two dietary
      interventions will be separated by a 4 week washout period. The order of diets will be
      random; study participants will complete both interventions. Dietary modifications will be
      part of the study protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers hypothesize that walnut consumption will induce changes in fecal metagenome,
      identifiable walnut-derived bioactives (urolithins) and other microbial-derived products
      (short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids). The researchers hypothesize that walnut
      consumption will result in improvements to blood lipid profiles, including decreased total
      and LDL-cholesterol; increased HDL-related cholesterol efflux capacity and antioxidant
      protection; and decreased inflammatory biomarkers relative to control diet. The researchers
      hypothesize changes in cardiometabolic health biomarkers will be correlated with food
      bioactive metabolites and/or fecal metagenome. Pathway analysis will identify metabolic
      pathways differentially regulated by walnut-derived bioactives and walnut-responsive
      microbial genes.
