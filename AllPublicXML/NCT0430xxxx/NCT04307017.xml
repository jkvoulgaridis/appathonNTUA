  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 15 individuals living with chronic SCI will be recruited for this study. Each
      participant will complete an initial clinical assessment before starting a 10-week training
      program. The training program will consist of three 45-minute Whole-Body Electrical Muscle
      Stimulation (WBEMS)-augmented exercise training sessions for 10 weeks. At each training
      session, all adverse events (pain, redness, injury, etc.) will be recorded along with
      participants' comments concerning comfort (i.e. Objective 1). The investigators hypothesize
      that the use of a WBEMS will result in no serious adverse effect during and following the
      training sessions and that it will take less than 10 minutes to don and doff the suit.

      At the fifth session, after participants have had the opportunity to become familiar with the
      WBEMS intervention, the immediate effects of the intervention on physiological responses will
      be assessed (i.e. Objective 2). It is hypothesized that during a single training session
      consisting of WBEMS and exercise, physiological responses and energy expenditure (EE) will be
      significantly improved in participants with SCI compared to a training session consisting
      solely of exercises without WBEMS.

      At the end of the training program, participants will complete the final clinical assessment
      to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of the WBEMS-augmented exercise intervention (i.e.
      Objective 3). Three months after the end of the training program, the participants will be
      asked to complete a semi-structured interview and questionnaire to evaluate the perceived
      benefits of the training program (i.e. Objective 3).It is also hypothesized that participants
      will perceive benefits of the 10-week training program such as decreased spasticity,
      increased energy and improved mood.

          1. have a motor complete SCI (i.e., American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale
             grade A or B which means complete motor paralysis below the level of injury) at the
             neurological level T7 or below (i.e., to avoid triggering autonomic dysreflexia). The
             participants will have complete motor function of their arms but not of their legs;
