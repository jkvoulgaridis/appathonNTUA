  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen (SCCA) contributes to the pathogenesis of psoriasis by
      inhibiting cell apoptosis, exacerbating epidermal hyperplasia and skin inflammation. Three
      studies have shown a correlation between blood levels of SCCA and the severity of psoriasis.

      Clinical scores of psoriasis severity are used in consultation to guide treatment of the
      disease (initiation of systemic therapy, dose escalation) but they suffer from several
      pitfalls: lack of inter- and intra-observer reproducibility, consumption of medical time.

      A readily available, inexpensive (24 euros) blood marker could be an interesting alternative
      to these clinical scores.

      Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen (SCCA) contributes to the pathogenesis of psoriasis by
      inhibiting cell apoptosis, exacerbating epidermal hyperplasia and skin inflammation. Three
      studies have shown a correlation between blood levels of SCCA and the severity of psoriasis.

      Clinical scores of psoriasis severity are used in consultation to guide treatment of the
      disease (initiation of systemic therapy, dose escalation). The PASI (Psoriasis Assessment
      Severity Index, minimum score 0, maximum 72) is the most widely used. It suffers from several
      pitfalls: lack of inter- and intra-observer reproducibility, consumption of medical time.
      This PASI score was &quot;unavoidable&quot; in the international clinical studies used to obtain
      marketing authorisation for medicines. The PGA (Physician global assessment) is simpler and
      less time-consuming, ranging from 0 to 4, but is not very discriminating. More recently, a
      &quot;Simplified Psoriasis Index&quot; (proSPI) health professional score has been developed, which
      correlates well with PASI for the severity component of psoriasis and with quality of life
      for the psychological component of the disease. It is less time-consuming to establish than
      PASI, but suffers like all clinical scores from a problem of inter- and intra-observer
      reproducibility.

      A readily available, inexpensive (24 euros) blood marker could be an interesting alternative
      to these clinical scores.
