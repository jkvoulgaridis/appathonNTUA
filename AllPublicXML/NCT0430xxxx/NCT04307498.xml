    <textblock>
      The open-label clinical study explores potential modifiable predictors of treatment outcomes
      in a sample of 55 military service members and veterans with clinically significant PTSD
      symptoms who receive Intensive Outpatient Prolonged Exposure (IOP-PE).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive Outpatient Prolonged Exposure (IOP-PE) is a three-week, intensive, individualized
      program that combines massed Prolonged Exposure with military-relevant treatment
      augmentations to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Peterson et al., 2018). Recent
      findings indicate that IOP-PE significantly decreased combat-related PTSD in post-9/11
      service members and veterans (Peterson et al., 2019). However, IOP-PE is costly and requires
      a considerable commitment from the patient. Being able to prospectively identify which
      patients benefit most from IOP-PE will help treatment providers and patients make
      well-informed decisions about clinical care. The primary aim of this prospective, exploratory
      clinical study is to investigate potential predictors of treatment outcome following 15
      sessions of IOP-PE delivered over 3-weeks in a sample of 55 military service members and
      veterans (i.e., individuals who have retired or separated from the US Armed forces, active
      duty personnel, reservists, and National Guardsmen/women) with significant PTSD symptoms. A
      follow-up assessment will be conducted one-month following the completion of treatment.

      Predictor variables will include the following:

      Aim 1: The PTSD Beliefs Inventory, the Dispositional Resilience and Disability Inventory, and
      the Credibility/ Expectancy Questionnaire.

      Aim 2: The Disability-Recovery Implicit Association Test.

      Aim 3: The Treatment Motivation Questionnaire and Service Connection Status

      Aim 4: The Insomnia Severity Index, the Dimension of Anger Reactions-5, Patient Health
      Questionnaire-9, the Quick Drinking Screen, and the Pain Intensity, Enjoyment, and General
      Activity (PEG) Scale.

The CAPS-5 is structured interview that assesses the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 (DSM-5) criteria for PTSD (Weathers et al., 2013). Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Extreme/incapacitating) and combines information about frequency and intensity for each of the 20 symptoms. Total Score (Range 0-80 with higher scores representing more PTSD symptoms)</description>

    <description>Prolonged Exposure for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PE for PTSD; Foa, Hembree, &amp; Rothbaum, 2007) is an empirically supported behavioral therapy that utilizes exposure-based interventions to target the psychological mechanisms (i.e., avoidance; maladaptive cognitive changes) thought to maintain trauma-related symptoms. IOP-PE includes 15 days of PE treatment delivered over three consecutive weeks. The standard outpatient PE protocol has modified with seven treatment augmentations to meet the unique needs of post-9/11 veterans.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Active duty military service members or veterans (18 years or older) who were impacted
             by Hurricane Harvey.

          2. Significant PTSD symptoms as measured by a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist
             (PCL-5) score of 34 or higher.

          3. Able to speak and read English (due to standardization of outcome measures)

          4. Able to participate in a three-week intensive outpatient program

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current manic episode or psychotic symptoms requiring immediate stabilization or
             hospitalization (as determined by the bipolar and psychosis modules of the Mini
             International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and clinical judgment)

          2. Current and severe alcohol use warranting immediate intervention based on clinical
             judgment.

          3. Evidence of a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (as determined by the
             inability to comprehend the baseline screening questionnaires)

          4. Current suicidal ideation severe enough to warrant immediate attention (as determined
             by the Depressive Symptoms Index - Suicidality Subscale and the Self-Injurious
             Thoughts and Behaviors Interview short form) and corroborated by a clinical risk
             assessment by a credentialed provider.

          5. Other psychiatric disorders severe enough to warrant designation as the primary
             disorder as determined by clinician judgment
