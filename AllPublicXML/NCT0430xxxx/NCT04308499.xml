  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is very common, especially in HIV population (up to 73%), and contributes to the
      development of other conditions such as depression, dementia, inflammation, obesity, and
      heart diseases. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is known to improve
      insomnia. However, it has never been tested in HIV-positive patients. The investigators aim
      to examine the Internet version of this therapy in HIV-positive patients because the
      availability of CBT-I is very limited while the cost is high. The investigators will test
      this internet version, also called digital CBT-I (dCBTI), against sleep hygiene education
      (SHE), a commonly prescribed set of instructions in clinical practice, in 60 HIV-positive
      patients with insomnia invited from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) Los Angeles
      site. The investigators aim to test if dCBTI or SHE improves insomnia in this patient group.
      This trial involves a behavioral treatment that can be done from home with minimal side
      effects and includes neither medications nor invasive interventions. Lastly, this trial will
      provide important pilot data for a larger trial testing long-term effects of insomnia
      treatment in HIV-positive patients.
