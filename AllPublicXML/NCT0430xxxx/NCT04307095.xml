    <textblock>
      Inadvertent postanesthetic hypothermia is unintentional drop in core body temperature &lt;36C
      (96.8F) immediately following an operation, caused by multiple factors, and had lead to
      negative outcomes. In our institute, a study in 2011 reported an incidence of postoperative
      hypothermia in PACU of 45.4% (95% CI 39.61%- 51.23%). After that, various interventions aimed
      to prevent perioperative hypothermia were implemented. This study is initiated to determine
      the incidence of postoperative hypothermia and associated factors of postoperative
      hypothermia in adult patients underwent surgery at Siriraj hospital.

    <textblock>
      Inadvertent postanesthetic hypothermia is unintentional drop in core body temperature &lt;36C
      (96.8F) immediately following an operation, which is a common problem in post anesthesia care
      unit (PACU). It has been implicated in negative outcomes in surgical patients, including
      prolonged effects of intraoperative anesthetic medication, increased insulin resistance,
      postoperative morbidity, delayed surgical wound healing; and prolonged stay in the recovery
      room and hospital1-7.

      In the operating room (OR), patients have to expose to a low ambient temperature with little
      or no clothing, evaporation from the surgical area, an irrigated fluid in surgical area; and
      an administration of intravenous fluids. Moreover, many anesthetic agents have an influence
      on the autonomic thermoregulatory mechanism which causes vasodilatation. All these factors
      promote patients' unintentional loss of heat and cause hypothermia.

      Even of a lot of efforts to keep patients warm intraoperatively and minimize hypothermia
      including optimizing ambient OR temperature and using of various warming devices, the
      incidences of postoperative hypothermia in PACU are still high with the reported magnitude
      ranges from 50%- 90%7. In Siriraj hospital, a study in 2011 reported an incidence of
      postoperative hypothermia in PACU of 45.4% (95% CI 39.61%- 51.23%)8. After that, various
      interventions aimed to prevent perioperative hypothermia were implemented such as maintaining
      the ambient room temperature of an OR; warming intravenous fluids, blood products, and
      irrigants; heated, humidified anesthetic gases; and using warming blankets, forced-air
      warming, layering drapes and head wraps. This study is initiated to determine the incidence
      of postoperative hypothermia and associated factors of postoperative hypothermia in adult
      patients underwent surgery at Siriraj hospital.
