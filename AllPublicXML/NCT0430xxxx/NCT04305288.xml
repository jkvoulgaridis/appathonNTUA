    <description>From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year. The progression is defined consistent with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria for solid tumors.</description>

    <measure>Disease Control Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Control Rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete or partial response to treatment or stable disease, consistent with RECIST version 1.1 criteria for solid tumors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>percentage of patients with Clinical Benefit Response</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Composite measure based on patient-reported pain (per Faces pain scale revised), patient-reported pain medication, Karnofsky performance status(KPS), and weight. Clinical benefit is indicated by either:(a) improvement in pain (less pain intensity with stable or decreased pain medication; or less pain medication with stable or decreased pain intensity with stable or improved KPS; or (b) improvement in KPS with stable or improved pain.With stable for KPS and pain, clinical benefit may be indicated with an observation of positive weight change.
Clinical benefit response (CBR) was classified weekly and a patient was considered a clinical benefit responder if clinical benefit was observed and maintained over a 4 week period.</description>
