    <measure>Rate of cumulative ongoing pregnancy (a pregnancy diagnosed by ultrasonic visualisation of one or more gestational sacs with fetal heart beat) after 3 treatment cycles with inositol versus clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction.</measure>

    <description>Recently, a meta-analysis on the use of inositol in PCOS was published. This study showed that inositol leads to a more regular menstrual cycle and recovery of ovarian function. Less data are present on pregnancy rates. No RCT was found on the comparison between inositol and the golden standard first line treatment of ovulation induction, namely clomiphene citrate. Another advantage of inositol is that it doesn't have side effects compared to metformin and that there is no elevated risk on multiple pregnancies, which is the case with clomiphene citrate.</description>
