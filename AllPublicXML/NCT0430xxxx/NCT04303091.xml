  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although physical activity (PA) is commonly used to manage symptoms and enhance quality of
      life (QOL) in cancer survivors, relatively little is known regarding the benefits in advanced
      multiple myeloma (MM). The primary aims of the Physical Activity in Advanced Cancer Treatment
      (PAACT) intervention were to examine (1) program feasibility and (2) potential impact on
      patient outcomes. It is hypothesized that an exercise intervention will be feasible and
      potentially impactful.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the introduction of novel and more effective treatments has seen improved survival in
      multiple myeloma (MM), the aggressive nature of the disease and these corresponding agents
      can have a debilitating impact on quality of life (QOL). Exercise can help manage symptoms
      and enhance QOL in cancer survivors, however relatively little is known regarding the
      feasibility or benefits of exercise in MM. The purpose of this study was to examine the
      feasibility of a group- and home-based exercise intervention for individuals with advanced
      MM. In this single arm study, advanced MM patients (DS stage II-III) participated in a
      12-week aerobic and resistance training intervention, with the option of palliative care
      consultation. Participants attended once weekly supervised group exercise classes and
      received individually tailored home exercise booklets. Validated measures of physical
      functioning and patient-reported outcomes, including QOL, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and
      self-compassion were obtained at baseline and 12-weeks (post-intervention). Optional
      semi-structured interviews were conducted halfway (week 6) and at the end of the intervention
      (week 12)

    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In the Chair Sit and Reach Flexibility test, lower body flexibility is assessed by having the participant sit on the edge of a seat. The participant extends the leg being tested in front of the hip, with the heel on the floor and the ankle dorsiflexed approximately 90 degrees. The participant flexes the untested leg so that the sole of the foot is flat on the floor about 6 to 12 inches to the side of the body's midline. With the extended leg as straight as possible and the hands on top of each other (palms down), the participant slowly bends forward at the hip joint, keeping the spine as straight as possible and the head in normal alignment (not tucked) with the spine. The participant reaches down the extended leg, trying to touch the toes, and holds this position for 2 sec. A ruler is ran parallel to the participant's lower leg. Two practice trials are allowed followed by two test trials.The best measurement is taken.</description>

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Multiple Myeloma (FACT-MM) questionnaire is comprised of the 27-item FACT-General (FACT-G) scale, which provides information on physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being domains in conjunction with 14 MM-specific supplementary questions. The combined subscales of physical, functional, and MM specific domains contribute to the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score (range of 0-112). The questionnaire is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, and components can be combined to create a total score, with increases in scores representing improved quality of life.</description>
