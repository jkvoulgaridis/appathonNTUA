  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many years, composite resin restorations have been considered an acceptable treatment
      choice for anterior applications. Recent advances in composite resin mechanical properties
      and improved adhesive systems have broadened the application of these materials to include
      the restoration of posterior teeth. However, it is still generally accepted that posterior
      composite resin restorations have limitations and that there is no ideal material available.
      A volumetric shrinkage occurs when a composite resin material is cured. The shrinkage is the
      result of conversion of monomer molecules into a more dense polymer network, which leads to
      bulk contraction. A new nanohybrid composite activated by sonic energy has been recently
      introduced as a single-step, bulk-fill restorative material. This system utilizes the
      patented sonic-activation technology enabling a rapid flow of composite into the cavity for
      effortless placement and superior adaptation in one single layer, thereby, emphasizes its
      practical and efficient technique for placing posterior composites. The hand piece, designed
      by KaVo (Germany), delivers sonic energy at varying intensities, which is adjusted on the
      shank from low to high (1 to 5) to control rate of composite extrusion.
