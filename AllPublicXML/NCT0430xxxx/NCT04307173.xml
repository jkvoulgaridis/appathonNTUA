        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy volunteers (also referred to as participants) who can read and understand, and
             are willing to sign the informed consent form

             study-related procedures

          3. Male or female healthy volunteers aged ≥18 and ≤65 years at Screening

          4. Body mass index (BMI) of ≥18.0 kg/m2 to ≤32 kg/m2 (both inclusive) at Screening

          5. Normal hemodynamic parameters: systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥90 mmHg and ≤140 mmHg;
             diastolic BP ≥50 mmHg and ≤90 mmHg; heart rate (HR) ≥40 bpm and ≤100 bpm at Screening
             and Day -1. Measurements may be repeated up to 3 times at the discretion of the
             investigator.

             Please note: participants with out of range values, which are not clinically
             significant as per the principal investigator's (PI) discretion, will be allowed. The
             PI may delegate this responsibility to a suitably qualified and trained study team
             member.

          6. The participant is, in the opinion of the PI (or delegate), generally healthy based on
             assessment of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and the results
             of the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, serology, and other relevant
             laboratory tests

          7. Baseline laboratory test values within reference ranges based on the blood and urine
             samples taken at Screening and on Day -1. Out of normal ranges values may be accepted
             by the PI, if not clinically significant

          8. Have regular bowel movements (e.g., once daily)

          9. Male participants must agree to practise true abstinence; be surgically sterilised
             (performed at least 6 months prior); or agree to use of a condom if sexually active
             with a female partner of childbearing potential, from Screening through 90 days after
             the final dose of the investigational product (IP).

         10. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to practise true abstinence or agree to
             use effective contraception from Screening through 90 days after the final dose of the
             IP.

             Effective contraception includes:

               1. Oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;) for at least 1 month prior to Day 1, plus use of
                  a condom

               2. Depot or injectable birth control or implantable contraception (e.g., Implanon)
                  plus use of a condom

               3. Intrauterine device plus use of a condom

               4. Vasectomised male partner (performed at least 6 months prior) who has been
                  documented to no longer produce sperm

         11. Women of non-child-bearing potential:

               1. Must have documented evidence of surgical sterilization at least 6 months prior
                  to Screening visit e.g., tubal ligation, hysterectomy.

               2. Must be post-menopausal for at least 12 months prior to Screening, as documented
                  by measurement of follicle stimulating hormone level (≥40 mIU/mL).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female participants who are pregnant or lactating

          2. The participant's corrected QT interval (QTcF) (Fridericia's correction) is &gt;450 msec
             (males), and &gt;470 msec (females) at Screening or on Day -1. An out-of-range or
             abnormal ECG will be repeated at PI's discretion. In total, 3 ECGs should be recorded
             consecutively at Screening and on Day -1, and the PI (or delegate) must evaluate the
             triplicate ECG. If the participant's QTcF is &gt;450 msec (males) or &gt;470 msec (females)
             on at least 2 ECGs or have structural cardiac abnormalities, the participant must be
             excluded

          3. The participant has taken prescription (including antibiotics) or non-prescription
             medication, herbal remedies, vitamins or minerals, any probiotic drinks and yeast
             supplements (e.g. Mutaflor®, Bioflor®) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study
             product unless in the opinion of the PI the medication will not compromise participant
             safety or interfere with study procedures or data validity. Participant may be
             rescreened after a washout period of 14 days. Please note use of oral contraceptives
             and paracetamol up to 2 g/day and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for
             symptomatic relief of minor symptoms are allowed

          4. Participant has functional GI disorders

          5. Participant is a current smoker or has used nicotine containing products within 6
             months prior to Screening visit

          6. The participant has a substance abuse-related disorder or has a history of drug,
             alcohol and/or substance abuse deemed significant by the PI

          7. The participant has taken any IP within 30 days prior to the first dose of study
             product or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer

          8. The participant has a history of significant hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis involving
             any drug (including ampicillin, clindamycin or imipenem), any constituent of the IP,
             food or other precipitating agent (e.g. bee sting). Please note participants with
             clinically stable mild allergic conditions such as hay fever and mild eczema may be
             enrolled at the discretion of the PI

          9. Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HbsAg), or hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV)at Screening visit.

         10. Positive screen for drugs of abuse and cotinine at Screening or on Day -1. Positive
             screen for alcohol on Day -1.

         11. The participant is, in the opinion of the PI, unlikely to comply with the clinical
             study protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason.
