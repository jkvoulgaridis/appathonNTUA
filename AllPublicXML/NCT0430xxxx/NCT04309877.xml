  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is very common and poses a huge disease burden. About 20% of the US population
      suffers from depression at least once in their lifetime. Inflammations that are hidden inside
      our body as a result of aging, obesity, chronic diseases, or certain treatments (e.g.,
      interferon for hepatitis C) appear to cause depressive symptoms and even clinical depression.
      Individuals with such inflammations are more likely to suffer from depression and are less
      likely to respond to currently available antidepressant medications. This study will test
      theophylline, a medication currently used for asthma treatment, as a new way to mitigate
      depressive symptoms in response to such inflammations. This study begins with a 90-minute
      screening session to determine whether participants are eligible to join the main study.
      Those who meet the eligibility criteria will then join the main study, which will consist of
      taking theophylline or methylcellulose (i.e., oral placebo) for 2 weeks at home and an 8-hour
      session at the UCLA Medical Center. Approximately 20 healthy adults will be recruited for
      participation in the study. During the course of the study, participants will take
      theophylline or methylcellulose for 2 weeks at home and then will be injected either
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline (i.e., intravenous placebo) at the UCLA Medical Center.
      LPS is a bacterial substance that can initiate chemical reactions that are similar to those
      seen in individuals with mild sickness symptoms, such as a slight increase in body
      temperature, muscle aches, or tiredness. It is a safe way of investigating the body's
      response to inflammation and how these changes may alter cognitive, emotional, or neural
      function. It has been given thousands of times to healthy volunteers - both younger and older
      adults - without any serious side effects.
