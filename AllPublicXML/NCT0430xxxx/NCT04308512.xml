  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia, a chronic disease of aging, is characterized by progressive cognitive decline that
      interferes with independent functioning. The medical, psychological, social and functional
      sequelae of dementia cause great stress to patients, their caregivers, and their family. The
      investigator proposes to examine effectivness of a home-based care coordination and
      management device, called Care4AD to help caregivers effectively coordinate, manage, and
      improve dementia care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigator will assess the effectiveness of a care coordination device (a
      supportive care device) called, Care4AD for reducing burden and stress of caregivers,
      enhancing patient adherence to scheduled tasks, and increasing Individuals with dementia
      activity (IWD). The investigator will conduct a 6-month prospective randomized control trial
      (RCT) of 100 persons with mild to moderately severe dementia to examine changes in
      caregiver's burden and stress and IWD's physical activity and adherence to scheduled ADLs.
      Feedback (e.g., reminders about completed/incomplete tasks) will be activated in the
      intervention group (IG) and de-activated in the control group (CG). The investigator will
      also use an ADL log and bi-weekly phone interview with a caregiver as gold standards to
      validate the detection of adherence to scheduled ADLs of interest. Furthermore, the
      acceptability, perception of benefit, and ease of use of Care4AD will be further assessed
      using technology acceptance model (TAM). We hypothesize that at 6 months, those in the IG
      compared to the CG will have less caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) (primary
      outcome), greater IWD adherence to scheduled ADLs (primary outcome), and higher IWD physical
      function and activity (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes will include caregiver coping
      (Brief Cope), self-efficacy (Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy), and preparedness
      (Preparedness for Caregiving Scale), and quality of life of IWD (Quality of Life in
      Alzheimer's disease scale)

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers burden and stress will be quantified using a 12-item short version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), which is a validated survey for dementia caregivers. The ZBI questions caregivers experiences in terms of emotional, physical, and social strains or difficulties that result from their role as a caregiver. Items include topics such as feeling one health has suffered, feeling that care affects relationship with family and friends, and how burdened one feels.</description>

    <measure>Cumulative patient adherence to scheduled tasks over 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Bi-weekly during the 6 month study</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to scheduled tasks will be assessed by Care4AD platform, bi-weekly interview with a caregiver and an ADL log. Adherence is defined by the percentage of compliance to execute pre-defined scheduled activity of daily living tasks (e.g., drinking water, taking medication, attending clinical appointments, etc).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive performance will be assessed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Scores on the MoCA range from zero to 30, with a score of 26 and higher generally considered normal.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Depression at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use a 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) for screening depressive symptoms. Scores of 0-4 are considered normal, depending on age, education, and complaints; 5-8 indicate mild depression; 9-11 indicate moderate depression; and 12-15 indicate severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in baseline Quality of life at 6 months: Global PROMIS-10</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using a validated questionnaire, called Global PROMIS-10.
The adult PROMIS Global Health measure produces two scores: Physical Health and Mental Health. The &quot;7+2&quot; scales include the same global health score plus one fatigue and one pain interference item which are scored independently.</description>
