  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the efficacy and safety compared to placebo and the safety
      compared to ustekinumab of brodalumab in adolescents with moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis. The study will also investigate if brodalumab affects development of
      vaccination-induced immune responses.

      The study will run over 62-64 weeks (including screening, treatment, and safety follow-up)
      for each participant, but with the primary endpoint measured at Week 12.

    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response, assessed at Week 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Having at least 75% improvement in PASI score from baseline. The PASI is the most widely used tool in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of psoriasis. The assessment is done based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation and not in relation to the condition at a previous visit. The severity of 3 psoriasis disease characteristics (redness, thickness, and scaliness) on each of the 4 body regions, head/neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities, will be assessed according to a severity scale. The extent of psoriasis within each of the 4 body regions will also be assessed. This gives a composite score ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating a more severe and/or more extensive condition.</description>

    <measure>Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1, assessed at Week 12.</measure>
