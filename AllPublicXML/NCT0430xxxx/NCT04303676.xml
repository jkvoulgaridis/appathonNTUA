  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Primary care practices
      need to implement new research findings that help identify and treat alcohol use disorder.
      This project will compare two methods of supporting small and medium size primary care
      practices in Colorado to improve their alcohol screening and treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use causes an estimated 88,000 deaths yearly and is the third leading cause of
      mortality in the U.S. Unhealthy alcohol use, a spectrum from risky drinking to alcohol use
      disorder (AUD), impacts 27% of adults, with high cost to the health care system.
      Evidence-based guidelines exist for identification and treatment of unhealthy alcohol use,
      and evidence supports the effectiveness of medication-assisted therapy (MAT). Primary care is
      recognized as an ideal context for the implementation of screening and treatment processes.
      Despite the evidence, significant gaps exist in uptake into practice.

      Practice facilitation has emerged as a key method for assisting practices in implementing
      organizational changes and improvements. However, in-person practice facilitation is
      time-intensive and costly, and virtual facilitation has not been as effective as in-person.
      E-learning modules can provide a structure for quality improvement in a clinical area. A
      pilot using e-learning combined with virtual practice facilitation was very successful from
      the perspectives of both practice facilitators and practices. We believe that virtual
      practice facilitation using e-learning modules to focus the content and process has great
      potential as a less costly and equally effective method compared to in-person facilitation.

      In this &quot;Facilitating Alcohol Screening and Treatment (FAST) Colorado&quot; proposal, we will
      perform a cluster randomized trial to examine the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
      Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) and relative value of two approaches to supporting
      primary care practices to implement PCOR findings to improve their identification and
      treatment management of unhealthy alcohol use among adults, including screening, brief
      intervention, medication assisted therapy, and referral to treatment. This trial will
      investigate the superiority from an effectiveness perspective of: a) a virtual practice
      facilitation intervention, with a practice facilitator working with practices in virtual
      one-on-one or group sessions utilizing alcohol use e-learning modules to guide and focus the
      process and content, compared to b) a virtual practice facilitation intervention, with a
      practice facilitator working with practices in virtual one-on-one or group sessions without
      utilizing alcohol use e-learning modules. We will identify key practice characteristics and
      other contextual factors that impact the response of practices to the two practice
      interventions. We will compare the adaptability, trialability, and scalability of the two
      interventions in order to plan dissemination of the findings to key local, regional, and
      national stakeholders, including sharing ongoing lessons learned and resources with other
      programs supporting practice transformation.

        Inclusion Criteria: Individual patients are not directly enrolled in this study.

        Practice inclusion criteria are: 1) family medicine or general internal medicine practices,
        generally with no more than 10 clinicians; 2) practices must be either independent or, if
        part of a larger organization, demonstrate that they do not receive significant QI support
        from the larger organization; and 3) practices must demonstrate commitment to participate
        fully in the intervention and evaluation, as carefully described and agreed to in a signed
        practice agreement. Practices with integrated behavioral health services will be included
        if the practice application indicates an overall level of implementation of SBIRT
        (screening brief intervention referral and treatment) and MAT (medication assisted
        treatment) that leaves room for improvement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Practices that report they have fully implemented SBIRT (screening brief intervention
        referral and treatment) and MAT (medication assisted treatment) for AUD (alcohol use
        disorder) will be excluded. Clinicians and staff who do not speak or read English
