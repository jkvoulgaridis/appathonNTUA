  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of an outreach strategy to increase colorectal cancer
      (CRC) screening in African Americans. The investigators will recruit 250 African Americans
      ages 45-64 years who are not up-to-date with CRC screening or have never been screened, with
      the goal to evaluate screening knowledge, behavior, and intervention effects on CRC screening
      outcomes. Participants will be randomly assigned to the TUNE-UP intervention or a control
      group. The TUNE-UP intervention arm will utilize a community health advisor (CHA) to
      encourage return of stool blood testing kits through cell phone outreach. The control group
      will receive educational materials about CRC screening plus a resource list but no CHA
      counseling support or cellphone / text contact. The primary study outcome is receipt of CRC
      screening (colonoscopy or FIT) following the intervention. The secondary outcomes will
      include CRC screening knowledge, self-efficacy (confidence to receive CRC screening),
      intention to screen, and follow-up in the case of an abnormal test result. The research
      objective is to test the CHA intervention effectiveness for promoting stool blood testing as
      a preferred screening test in an under-screened African American population.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Colorectal Cancer Screening</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The colorectal cancer screening measure asks about completion of colonoscopy and blood stool tests. These tests are described prior to questions about completion of each test. The first question asks when was the most recent stool blood test (&gt; 1 year but &lt; 2 years ago; &gt; 2 years but not more than 5 years ago; or &gt; 5 years). The second question asks when was the most recent colonoscopy (a year ago or less; &gt; 1 year but &lt; 5 years ago; &gt; 5 years but not more than 10 years ago; or &gt; 10 years). Colorectal cancer screening receipt will be determined based on self-report and chart review to determine screening rates for each screening modality. Those answering a &quot;a year ago or less&quot; for the most recent stool blood test and &quot;less than 10 years ago&quot; for most recent colonoscopy are considered up to date.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Colorectal Cancer Screening Knowledge Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked four True/False questions about colon cancer: if their chance of getting colon cancer is higher if they have a family history, if it can be cured if caught early, if colon cancer is associated with pain or other symptoms, and if a warning sign of colon cancer is having a rash. They are also asked six additional True/False questions later in the survey to test knowledge about colorectal cancer screening. The range of the scale is 0-10. Each answer is scored as correct or incorrect. A score of 7 to 10 is considered &quot;high&quot;. A score of 4 to 6 is considered &quot;average&quot;. A score of 0 to 3 is considered &quot;low.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Colorectal Cancer Screening Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A validated 4-item measure of colorectal cancer screening self-efficacy (alpha = 0.82) asks participants to respond using a Likert scale about colorectal cancer screening test difficulty, finding time, ease of completing the test, and scheduling the test. Total scale scores range from 1 to 4. A score of 3 to 4 is considered &quot;low self-efficacy&quot; and a score of 1 to 2 is considered &quot;high self-efficacy.&quot;</description>

    <description>Intervention arm participants will receive one 45-minute face-to-face meeting followed by two CHA phone calls in one-week intervals over a period of three weeks beginning within one month following baseline survey completion. These CRC educational activities delivered by the CHAs will include the use of NCI CRC resources and materials, including an S2S PowerPoint presentation, and CRC educational brochures. The intervention will follow a conversation guide/standard script for intervention fidelity. CHAs will take notes following each interaction to document the call length, deviations from the script, and tone of the call. Participants will receive an additional text message reminder once a week for an additional three weeks - with instructions for participants to text &quot;yes&quot; to confirm they received the message - for a total of six weeks of intervention delivery. The personalized text messages will have positive tones and include short messages about the benefits of CRC screening.</description>
