  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers will receive a weight-based opioid (remifentanil) infusion for 10 minutes. In the
      first run, serial pupillary measurements (pupillary unrest, pupil diameter) will be taken at
      baseline, and at 2.5-minute intervals during the infusion and a 25-minute recovery period
      afterwards. After a washout period, the experiment will be repeated in each subject (second
      run). The two runs differ only by presence versus absence of verbal interaction.

    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers aged 20-55 will receive a weight-based opioid (remifentanil) infusion for
      10 minutes. Vital signs including SpO2, transcutaneous CO2, and respiratory rate will be
      continuously measured.

      In the first run, serial pupillary measurements (pupillary unrest, pupil diameter) will be
      taken at baseline, and at 2.5-minute intervals during the infusion and a 25-minute recovery
      period afterwards. After a washout period, the experiment will be repeated in each subject
      (second run). The two runs differ only by presence of ongoing verbal interaction versus
      complete avoidance of verbal interaction.

      Incidence of respiratory depression will be compared in the two protocols with or without
      verbal interaction. Correlation between pupil diameter and pupillary unrest with estimated
      opioid concentrations will be determined by regression. Difference between pupil measurement
      versus opioid concentration regressions will be compared by chi2.
