  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is currently one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. In recent
      years, with the popularity of high-resolution CT, more and more early-stage lung cancers have
      been found. Anatomic pneumonectomy is gradually popular because it can completely remove lung
      nodules and preserve lung function to the greatest extent. During the surgery, the precise
      and rapid determination of intersegmental border is one of the key technologies. Improved
      inflation-deflation method is currently the most widely used method in clinical practice.
      Previous studies demonstrated that increasing the concentration of nitrous oxide in mixtures
      of N2O/O2 will lead to a faster rate of collapse. The rapid diffusion properties of N2O would
      be expected to speed lung collapse and so facilitate surgery. This study was designed to
      explore three types of inspired gas mixture used during two-lung anesthesia had an effect on
      the intersegmental border appearance time during pneumonectomy and its feasibility and
      safety: 75% N2O (O2: N2O = 1: 3), 50% N2O (O2: N2O = 1: 1), 100% oxygen.

      The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of
      Nanjing Medical University. This randomized parallel group trial enrolled lung cancer
      patients scheduled to receive thoracoscopic anatomic segmentectomy at The First Affiliated
      Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. The allocation sequence was generated using a
      computer program by a staff member not otherwise involved in the trial. Electrocardiogram
      (ECG), pulse oximetry (SpO2), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR),
      and end-expiratory carbon dioxide (PetCO2) were monitored routinely after admission. A
      superficial vein in the forearm was opened, and sodium lactate Ringer's solution was infused
      intravenously. Parallel radial arterial catheterization was performed to monitor invasive
      arterial blood pressure. All patients received pure oxygen ventilation for at least three
      minutes during the induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia induction was achieved with midazolam
      0.1-0.4mg / kg, etomidate 0.2-0.4mg / kg, cisatracurium 0.15-0.2mg / kg, fentanyl 4-6ug / kg,
      dexamethasone10mg, double-lumen tracheal tube intubation under the laryngoscope, and
      adjustment of the position of the double-lumen tube under fiber bronchoscope, Give double
      lung ventilation with pure oxygen. After turning over to lateral position, adjust the
      position of the double lumen under the fiber bronchoscope again, clamp the non-ventilated end
      of the double lumen tracheal tube and connect the distal end with the atmosphere to perform
      single lung ventilation. Mechanical ventilation was performed with pure oxygen on the side.
      Anesthesia was maintained with continuous infusion of propofol 120-200μg/kg−1min−1 ,
      cisatracurium 1-2μg/kg−1min−1 ,remifentanil 0.25-4μg/kg−1min−1 and
      dexmedetomidine0.2-0.7μg/kg−1h−1 as deemed necessary. Tidal volume was 6-8 mL/kg ideal
      bodyweight (male: height -100, and female: height - 105) without positive end expiratory
      pressure,and the breathing rate was set to 10-18 beats / min,PetCO2 is maintained at
      30-40mmHg). After the surgeon has finely dissected the target artery, vein, and bronchi,
      accurately judged and processed it, the sputum suction operation was performed on the healthy
      and surgical lungs, and the patient with the end-of-breath carbon dioxide sampling tube on
      the monitor was terminated to a portable nitrous oxide concentration detector
      (TD600-SH-N2O)to measure the test gas concentration (express in vol%), by adjusting the
      adjustable pressure limit valve ( APL) of the anesthesia machine to 0 in advance to exhaust
      the residual gas in the airbag, change the anesthesia machine to manual control mode, adjust
      the oxygen flow rate and N2O flow rate of the ventilator (group A is 100% O2, group B is 75%
      N2O (set N2O: O2 = 3: 1 ), Group C is 50% N2O (set N2O: O2 = 1: 1)), adjust the APL valve to
      20cmHg, so that the storage gas bag is filled with test gas, adjust the APL valve to 0 again,
      exhaust the residual gas, adjust the APL valve to 20, make the N2O concentration detector
      reach the predetermined gas concentration, and test the gas through the dual-lumen tracheal
      tube to positive pressure ventilation with high frequency and low tidal volume to expand the
      lungs, the pressure is limited to 20cmHg, after the lungs is completely expanded, performing
      pure oxygen mechanical single lung ventilation, waiting for clear presentation of the plane
      between segments .(The starting point of intraoperative expansion and collapse observation is
      the time when the lung tissue is completely expanded after blocking the relevant structure of
      the target segment; the end point is when a clear demarcation is formed between the target
      segment and the immediately-reserved lung segment, and this boundary does not follow
      significant changes over time).

    <description>During one-lung ventilation with an open chest, the nonventilated lung collapses initially due to elastic recoil, which quickly brings the lung down to its closing capacity. Remaining gas in the lung is then removed by absorption into the pulmonary capillary blood. The rapid diffusion properties of N2O（Blood gas distribution coefficient is 0.47）would be expected to speed lung collapse and so facilitate surgery. The previous study suggested that increasing the concentration of N2O in mixtures of N2O/O2 will lead to a faster rate of collapse. When using nitrous oxide in oxygen during lung ventilation, ongoing oxygen uptake by blood shunting will serve to increase the partial pressure of nitrous oxide in parts of the lung that are still expanded. This will soon result in a partial pressure gradient for nitrous oxide uptake also, with a consequent faster rate of lung collapse than would occur in a patient being ventilated with 100% oxygen.</description>
