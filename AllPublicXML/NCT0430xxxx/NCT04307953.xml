  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study, designed as a European multicentre 6-month double blind random-ized
      controlled trial (RCT) of AZD0530 versus matched placebo, followed by a 12 month trial
      comparing open-label extended AZD0530 treatment with historical control data.

      Study population: Male and female adult patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of
      FOP who meet the inclusion (active disease) and exclusion criteria will be eligible for
      participation in this study. The total number of enrolled patients will be 20.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to receive either AZD0530 100mg once daily or
      matched placebo, taken orally for the first 6 months, immediately followed by an open-label
      extension in which all patients will receive AZD0530 100mg once daily oral dose for a further
      12 months.

      Endpoints: Endpoints include objective change in heterotopic bone volume measured by low-dose
      whole-body computer tomography (CT) , [18F] NaF Positron Emission Tomography (PET) activity
      and patient reported outcome measures.
