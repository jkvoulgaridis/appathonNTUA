      This study is a two-way, non-interventional long-term dynamic follow-up clinical
      observational cohort study. In the Second Division of Liver Diseases, Beijing Ditan Hospital,
      Capital Medical University, chronic hepatitis C patients who were treated with interferon
      combined with ribavirin (PR) antiviral therapy (PR treatment for 6 months or more) and / or
      direct acting antivirals (DAAs ), and the baseline, antiviral treatment and discontinuation
      follow-up data of patients before antiviral treatment were collected, and follow-up
      observations of patients were carried out for every 3-6 months. The clinical data such as
      clinical biochemistry, HCV RNA and serological indicators (anti-HCV), AFP, and liver imaging
      (liver ultrasound) were collected during the study period. The virological response and
      clinical outcomes of chronic hepatitis C antiviral therapy were observed for at least 144
      weeks. The incidence of liver cancer and decompensated liver cirrhosis after discontinuation
      of the drug was the main evaluation index. The aim is to explore long-term virological
      response and clinical outcomes, and elucidate its influencing factors.

      This study is a two-way, non-interventional long-term dynamic follow-up clinical
      observational cohort study. Enrolled in the Second Division of Liver Diseases, Beijing Ditan
      Hospital, Capital Medical University, via interferon combined with ribavirin (PR) antiviral
      therapy (PR treatment for 6 months or more) and / or direct acting antivirals (DAAs ) For
      patients with chronic hepatitis C treated, collect baseline, antiviral treatment and
      discontinuation follow-up data of patients before antiviral treatment, and follow-up
      observations of patients enrolled every 3-6 months. Collect clinical data such as clinical
      biochemistry, HCV RNA and serological indicators (anti-HCV), AFP, and liver imaging (liver
      ultrasound) during the study period. The virological response and clinical outcomes of
      chronic hepatitis C antiviral therapy were observed for at least 144 weeks. The incidence of
      liver cancer and decompensated liver cirrhosis after discontinuation of the drug was the main
      evaluation index. The aim is to explore long-term virological response and clinical outcomes,
      and elucidate its influencing factors.
