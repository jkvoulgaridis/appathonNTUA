  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the accuracy of hepatic steatosis estimation by thermo-acoustic
      ultrasound with estimation by MRI-PDFF (Proton Density Fat Fraction) . It will also evaluate
      the sensitivity of this device in the diagnosis of fatty liver.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with either known or presumed diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease who
      meets eligibility criteria will be included in the study. They will have imaging done to
      estimate hepatic steatosis by two modalities (MRI - PDFF and thermo-acoustic ultrasound). The
      estimation obtained by thermo-acoustic ultrasound will be compared with MRI results for
      accuracy of estimation by the thermo-acoustic ultrasound device. The study will also evaluate
      the sensitivity of the thermo-acoustic ultrasound device if it can diagnose the presence of
      hepatic steatosis when hepatic fat content is 15% or less by volume.
