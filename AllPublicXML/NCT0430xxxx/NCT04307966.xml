  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates an intervention, The CIrCLE of Life Initiative, which was developed to
      address HIV and obesity prevention. We evaluated whether the combined HIV and obesity
      intervention increased knowledge, enhanced skills, and/or promoted healthy behaviour among
      pre-adolescent students (9-12 years old) and their parents.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CIrCLE of Life Initiative had both a school and home component, each comprising a
      learning curriculum, environmental support, and activity-based constituents that aimed to
      increase student knowledge and skills, and to engage parents. Trained educators delivered
      lessons about HIV and obesity to all Grade 6 students at 5 government-run schools. The
      classroom curriculum for students required delivery of a five-hour face-to-face intervention
      delivered weekly through 10 30-minute lessons. Students were asked to communicate their
      learnings to their parents at home. Parents were requested to read through the lesson in a
      workbook and to sign acknowledgement that they had read the content. The workbook contained
      shared student-parent homework activities that took approximately 30 minutes per week.

    <description>537 pre-adolescent grade 6 learners and their parent (n=537) were invited to participate. Trained educators delivered lessons about HIV and obesity to all Grade 6 students at 5 government-run schools. The classroom curriculum for students required delivery of a five-hour face-to-face intervention delivered weekly through 10 30-minute lessons. Students were asked to communicate their learnings to their parents at home. Parents were requested to read through the lesson in a workbook and to sign acknowledgement that they had read the content. The workbook contained shared student-parent homework activities that took approximately 30 minutes per week. Data was only collected from Learners (n=425) and parents (n= 427)who had consented to the study. A pretest was conducted. The intervention was then implemented. A posttest was conducted afterwards. Both parents and learners answered self-reported questionnaires.</description>
