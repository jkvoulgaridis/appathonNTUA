  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorders leading to
      dementia. Currently, there has been no effective pharmacologic therapy for this disease.
      Electroencephalogram-based neurofeedback is considered as a potentially treatment strategy.
      In this project, the investigators aim to investigate the effectiveness of neurofeedback
      therapy on cognition for individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Participants
      will receive electroencephalogram-based neurofeedback therapy once a day for successive five
      days. Then, the investigators will evaluate the changes of memory function between baseline
      and post-therapy visits.

      Currently, there has been no effective therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      Electroencephalogram-based neurofeedback is now considered as a potentially intervention and
      may positively affect cognitive function for patients with AD. However, there are few
      existing studies involving the role of neurofeedback on cognition for subjective cognitive
      decline (SCD).

      Fifty participants with SCD will be recruited in this clinical trial. At baseline,
      neuropsychological tests are conducted. Participants will receive electroencephalogram-based
      neurofeedback therapy once a day for successive five days. After that, the investigators will
      evaluate the changes of memory measures, which is the primary outcome.

    <description>After intervention for five days, the investigators will compare baseline and post-therapy memory changes based on Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) scale, in order to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of neurofeedback. The scale of AVLT focuses on the memory domain, especially AVLT-long delayed memory, with cut- off points as 5 (50-59 years old), 4 (60-69 years old), 3 (70-79 years old) and AVLT-recognition, with cut-off points as 20 (50-59 years old), 19 (60-69 years old), 18 (70-79 years old). Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
