      -  calculate the total requirement for anaesthetic agents to maintain satisfactory
           operating conditions

        -  calculate total anesthetic time

        -  assess intraoperative changes in hemodynamics

        -  assess intraoperative blood loss

        -  evaluate surgeon and patient satisfaction

        -  recognize whether this was related with changes in postoperative analgesia .

        -  Also occurrence of postoperative nausea was recorded and compared with general
           anaesthesia combined with intravenous opioid for (EXT-DCR) surgery.

    <masking_description>In the Group G, Local infiltration of 10 ml normal saline at site of skin incision after marking and analgesia was provided by 40 µg/kg nalbuphine loaded in 10 ml syringe IV before skin incision and subsequent injections of 10-20 µg/kg nalbuphine as necessary. The last supplemental bolus of nalbuphine was given at least 30 min before the end of the operation In the Group L, Local infiltration of 10 ml mixture of 20 mg/ml lidocaine and 10 µg/ml epinephrine (instead of saline used in Group G) and normal saline in 10 ml syringe was given IV (instead of nalbuphine used in Group G).</masking_description>

    <description>all patients were assigned randomly to receive either general anesthesia with intravenous opioids and local infiltration of saline (Group G) or general anesthesia with intravenous saline and local infiltration of a mixture of lidocaine/epinephrine (Group L).
In both groups, general anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/kg propofol and tracheal intubation was facilitated by 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium. All patients underwent mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane, and muscle relaxation was provided by an injection of cisatracurium 0.02 mg/kg every 20 minutes.</description>
