  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective, multi-center, Registry study to evaluate the long-term
      safety and effectiveness of the Spiration Valve System (SVS) for the treatment of severe
      emphysema in a post-market setting.

    <textblock>
      This post-market study is a single-arm, prospective, multi-center Registry. It is designed to
      assess 36-month safety and effectiveness of this FDA approved product in a post-approval
      setting, and to support the continued assessment of Spiration Valve System therapy for the
      treatment of severe emphysema in the United States.

      Subjects who are eligible and consent to be in this study, will be monitored for outcome data
      from baseline through 3 years post-first implant.

    <description>Spiration Valves are one-way endobronchial valves indicated for adult patients with shortness of breath and hyperinflation associated with severe emphysema in regions of the lung that have evidence of low collateral ventilation. The Spiration Valve is loaded in the deployment catheter, then passed through the channel of a flexible bronchoscope and deployed at the intended target location. The SVS device is designed to relieve the symptoms of shortness of breath and hyperinflation associated with severe emphysema without surgery.</description>
