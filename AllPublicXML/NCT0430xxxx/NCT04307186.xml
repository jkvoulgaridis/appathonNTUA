  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in this study want to find the appropriate dose of drug BAY1747846 for adults
      undergoing MRI for known or highly suspected brain and/or spinal cord conditions so that the
      image quality is similar to that of drug gadobutrol for adults undergoing MRI. MRI stands for
      Magnetic resonance imaging which produces body pictures created by using magnetic energy
      rather than x-ray energy.

      Both BAY1747846 and gadobutrol are medicinal products known as gadolinium-based contrast
      agents (GBCA) which are used in MRI examinations to provide contrast enhancement and improve
      imaging performance. Gadobutrol (brand name: Gadavist, Gadovist) has been approved worldwide
      for the diagnosis of various disorders in adult and pediatric patients. BAY1747846 is a new
      GBCA under development with the goal to provide similar imaging performances in MRI.
      Participants in this study will receive both BAY1747846 and gadobutrol with a period of 3 -
      14 days in between. A MRI examination will be performed after each injection. Participant
      will stay in this study for 2 - 4 weeks depending on the scheduling of the visits.
