  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are testing new experimental drug combinations such as the combination of vorinostat,
      vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide in the hopes of finding a drug that may be
      effective against tumors that have come back or that have not responded to standard therapy.

      The goals of this study are:

        -  To find the highest safe dose of vorinostat that can be given together with vincristine,
           irinotecan, and temozolomide without causing severe side effects;

        -  To learn what kind of side effects this four drug combination can cause;

        -  To learn about the effects of vorinostat and the combination of vorinostat, vincristine,
           irinotecan, and temozolomide on specific molecules in tumor cells;

        -  To determine whether the combination of vorinosat, vincristine, irinotecan, and
           temozolomide is a beneficial treatment for your tumor.

      This first cycle will be used to determine whether the patient can tolerate the
      chemotherapeutic backbone without developing a DLT. The baseline disease evaluation will be
      obtained following hematologic recovery from the first cycle of chemotherapy, after which
      combination therapy with vorinostat will be given in subsequent cycles (2-12) w/
      modifications if needed. Vorinostat dose escalation in subsequent patient cohorts will occur
      based on DLT to determine a MTD.

    <description>A minimum of 3 evaluable patients will be entered at each dose level. If no significant dose limiting toxicity is discovered, a maximum of 3 dose levels will be evaluated. The minimum patient enrollment will be 3 patients. Many of the patients enrolled on this trial are expected to be heavily pretreated. All patients will be given a VIT only &quot;window&quot; to evaluate adequate bone marrow reserve to tolerate protocol therapy. We expect that at most 20% of patients will not be able to tolerate VIT or VIT with dose reduced temozolomide. A maximum of 24 patients enrolled on study is anticipated. Once the MTD has been defined, up to 6 additional patients may be enrolled to acquire additional safety data regarding this combination of agents.</description>

    <description>This is a phase I study of the combination of four drugs: vorinostat, vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide. This is called a Phase I study because the goal is to find the highest dose of vorinostat that we can give safely when it is used together with the chemotherapy drugs vincristine, irinotecan and temozolomide. We are using vorinostat because it seems to work against cancer in test tubes and animals. It may be most effective when it is given with chemotherapy. The combination of these three agents together has never been administered to children. Vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide are approved and used for the treatment of other types of cancer in adults and children. Vorinostat is approved and used to treat cancer in adults. The combination of these four drugs together is experimental. We do not know if this combination of medicines will work in people. There is a lot that we do not yet know about this combination of medicines.</description>
