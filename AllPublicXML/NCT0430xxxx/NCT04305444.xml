  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeted drug therapies have greatly improved outcomes for patients with relapsed or
      refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However,
      single drug therapies have limitations, therefore, the current study is evaluating a novel
      oral combination of targeted drugs as a way of overcoming these limitations. This study will
      determine the efficacy of the triple combination therapy, DTRM-555, in patients with R/R CLL
      or R/R non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in three parts: Phase Ia, Phase Ib and Phase II,
      disease-specific expansion cohorts. Phase Ia explored escalating doses of a monotherapy of a
      novel Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor, DTRMWXHS-12. Phase Ib explored two
      combination therapies, DTRM-505 (DTRMWXHS-12 and everolimus) and DTRM-555 (DTRMWXHS-12,
      everolimus and pomalidomide).

      The current Phase II study will further examine the investigational triple combination
      treatment, DTRM-555 for efficacy and safety. The study is being conducted in five
      disease-specific cohorts: Activated B-Cell (ABC) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Germinal
      Center B-Cell (GCB) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Richter's Transformation, transformed
      Follicular Lymphoma, and relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

      The Primary Objective of the Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of the triple
      combination therapy, DTRM-555, in the five disease-specific cohorts. The Secondary Objectives
      are (1) to determine the safety of DTRM-555 in the cohorts and (2) to obtain the
      pharmacokinetics of DTRM-555 (i.e., DTRMWXHS-12, everolimus and pomalidomide).
