  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests that hyperinsulinemia (i.e., elevated insulin levels) is the primary
      causative factor in obesity. Insulin promotes fat storage and prevents fat breakdown,
      suggesting that weight loss would be optimized if insulin levels are managed and kept low.
      Understanding how different foods impact insulin levels could therefore aid in personalized
      weight loss (or weight maintenance) advice. It has been shown that salivary insulin can track
      plasma insulin following different meals and can delineate between lean and obese people.
      Thus, it was suggested that salivary insulin could be a potential surrogate for plasma
      insulin. The purpose of this study is to measure fasting saliva insulin, and salivary insulin
      responses to a standardized meal tolerance test in individuals with different body mass index
      (BMI).
