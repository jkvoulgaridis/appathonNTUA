      This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, two cohorts, Simon's two-stage design,
      phase II clinical trial in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer brain metastases
      patients. Subjects will be divided into two cohorts by hormone receptor status and HER2
      status. HER2+/HR- subjects will enter Cohort A to receive pyrotinib plus temozolomide;
      HER2-/HR- subjects will enter Cohort B to receive bevacizumab, SHR1316 combined with
      cisplatin/carboplatin. Subjects in both cohorts will be treated until disease progression,
      toxicity is intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, and investigators determine that
      medication must be discontinued. Drug efficacy and safety data will be collected.
