  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is set up to assess the feasibility and safety of the clinical procedure using
      AneuFix in a prophylactic setting at the time of EVAR endograft implantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational device is called ANEUFIX, which is a product treating the endoleak by
      blockage of backflowing blood vessels, i.e. by filling the endoleak void and nidus of feeding
      artery and exit of existing draining arteries.

      ANEUFIX is a polymer that cures rapidly (7 min at 37Â°C) after injection into the AAA-sac
      close to the nidus.

    <intervention_model_description>The current study is a follow-up study on the previous feasibility study where ACP-T5 was used. After increasing the % tantalum in ANEUFIX to make the product more detectable under X-ray, the current study is a pilot study that (1) evaluates the technical feasibility of the prophylactic use of AneuFix during EVAR implentation and (2) assesses the rate of endoleaks after EVAR in 5 patients.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

               -  Open IMA AND

               -  2 patent lumbars &gt;2mm AND a cross-sectional area at the location of the IMA
