  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB2450 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which
      prevents PD-L1 from binding to PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on T cell surface, restores T cell
      activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors.

             7.Understood and Signed an informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Has used against PD-1, PD-L1 and other related immunotherapeutic drugs. 2.Has
             mutations in (epidermal growth factor receptor)EGFR, (anaplastic lymphoma kinase)ALK,
