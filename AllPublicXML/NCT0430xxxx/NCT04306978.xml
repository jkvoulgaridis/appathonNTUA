  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study results will be used to check the hypothesis that CareLink Express remote
      monitoring system increases the detection rate of asymptomatic AF and allows to change timely
      the treatment strategy in patients at high risk of thromboembolic events, e.g.
      anticoagulation therapy onset, electrical cardioversion or/and PVI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is expected to enroll 200 consecutive patients without previously diagnosed AF, who have
      indications for implantation of dual chamber cardiac pacemakers according to the current
      guidelines. All the patients will be randomly assigned into 2 groups. Patients in the RM
      group will undergo the implantation of Ensura DR MRI SureScan pacing system, whereas patients
      in the control group will receive ADAPTA DR pacing system without RM using. The impact of the
      Care Link Express service on prevention of thromboembolism will be evaluated. The rate of
      in-hospital visits for 1 patient per year and compliance with scheduled CareLink
      transmissions (ratio of the number of the performed transmissions to the planned ones) will
      be assessed in all patients in the remote monitoring group. Moreover, we are going to
      estimate the interaction between the follow-up center and other healthcare facilities
      equipped with the CareLink Express service, which will facilitate faster treatment decision.

Patients in the RM group should visit the main follow-up clinic 12 weeks after discharge, and then the device data will be remotely transmitted to the CareLink Express Network at least once in 3 months. Research personnel will contact patients by telephone once in 6 months. If participants indicate they have experienced a study outcome event (corresponding to the study endpoints), the event will be recorded. If remote transmission or telephone call data require to make clinical decision an in-hospital visit will be induced.</description>
