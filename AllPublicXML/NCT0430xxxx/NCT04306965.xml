      Open label phase 2 investigational study of efficacy and safety of apremilast 30 mg BID in
      chronic atopic dermatitis when added to the FDA approved treatment dupilumab for atopic
      dermatitis that is not providing adequate clinical responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if apremilast as a combined treatment for atopic
      dermatitis will provide increased efficacy outcomes in subjects who are currently using the
      FDA approved therapy of dupilumab but have responded only partially or inadequately to this
      therapy. Our hypothesis is that adding apremilast will allow patients to go from an
      inadequate response to dupilumab to an adequate response defined as an Investigator Global
      Assessment (IGA) of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated informed consent indicating the subject has been informed of all
             aspects of the study

          2. Subject is willing and able to comply with treatment plan, study drug administration,
             and study protocol requirements

          3. Subject has a documented clinical diagnosis of chronic atopic dermatitis for at least
             6 months prior to screening visit and is a candidate for systemic therapy

          4. Subjects must fulfill criteria outlined in the following clinical categories:

               -  Subjects must be currently using and experiencing an inadequate response to
                  dupilumab which is FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic
                  dermatitis. An inadequate response is defined as an IGA of 2 or more.

               -  At the time of screening, subject must have a partial or inadequate response to
                  their current treatment regimen. A partial or inadequate response at screening is
                  defined as having both of the following:

               -  Not having achieved an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0 (clear) or 1
                  (almost clear).

               -  Subjects must be on dupilumab for at least 12 weeks and willing to continue on
                  dupilumab on a stable dose (40 mg weekly or every other week) while also
                  receiving the study drug

          5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at
             Screening and Baseline. While on investigational product and for at least 28 days
             after taking the last dose of investigational product, FCBP who engage in activity in
             which conception is possible must use one of the approved contraceptive options

          6. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in
             which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or
             non-latex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example,
             polyurethane]) while on study medication and for at least 28 days after the last dose
             of study medication

          7. If receiving concomitant medications for any reason, must be on a stable regimen and
             willing to stay on a stable regimen. This includes emollients, which should stay
             stable throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Prior hypersensitivity reaction or exposure to apremilast 2. Untreated or unstable
        depression or suicidality, including prior history of suicide attempt at any time in the
        subject's lifetime prior to Baseline Visit or major psychiatric illness requiring
        hospitalization within 3 years prior to Baseline Visit. Depression and suicidality will be
        assessed through standard-of-care questioning 3. Other than atopic dermatitis, any
        clinically significant (as determined by the Investigator) cardiac, endocrinologic,
        pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric, hepatic, renal, hematologic, immunologic disease, or
        other major disease that is currently uncontrolled 4. Any condition, which places the
        subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the
        ability to interpret data from the study 6. Pregnant or lactating females 7. Concomitant
        therapy with CYP450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine,
        phenytoin), which may cause loss of efficacy of apremilast.

        8. Prolonged sun exposure or use of tanning booths, which may confound the ability to
        interpret data from the study.

        9. Active substance abuse or a history of substance abuse within 6 months prior to
        Screening. Subjects will be asked about any history of substance use using standard of care
        questioning.

        10. Malignancy or history of malignancy, except for:

          -  treated [i.e., cured] basal cell or squamous cell in situ skin carcinomas;

          -  treated [i.e., cured] cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma in situ of
             cervix with no evidence of recurrence within the previous 5 years.

             11. Use of dupilimab in combination with any other systemic immunosuppressant
             medication within 4 weeks prior to randomization or 5 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
             half lives, whichever is longer.

             12. Use of any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to randomization, or 5
             pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic half lives, if known (whichever is longer)
