    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to characterize adverse events (AEs) occurring within one day
      of TEGSEDI administration to adult patients with hATTR-PN overall and in individual patients
      with respect to time course of AE onset, vital sign changes, preventive measures, treatment
      required, risk factors, and subsequent adverse outcomes.
