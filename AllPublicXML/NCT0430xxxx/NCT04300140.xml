  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 study of AVB-S6-500 designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      AVB-S6-500 in combination with cabozantinib in subjects with advanced clear cell renal cell
      carcinoma (ccRCC) that have received front-line treatment. The phase 1b portion of the study
      is open label and patients will receive AVB-S6-500+Cabozantinib in 3+3 dose escalation. The
      Phase 2 portion of the study is randomized, open-label study to compare efficacy and
      tolerability of AVB-S6-500+cabozantinib versus cabozantinib alone
