  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies on single-use ancillaries are still few; medico-economic benefits have to be
      assessed regarding their design and use.

      A foreseeable increase in the number of surgeries in the future, tends to change the
      techniques and consequently to question the medico-economic context. Single-use ancillaries
      attempt to provide solutions to today's imperatives and could be relevant from a global
      medico-economic point of view.

      For the moment, the conventional ancillaries for TKA are reused after sterilization.

      The objective of the study is to improve the fluidity of the intervention process with cost
      control.

  <detailed_description>

      After validation of the inclusion criteria, the surgeon will perform the randomization (1:1):
      single-use ancillary group or conventional ancillary group. Only the medical team and the
      block staff will be informed about the ancillary group, not the patient.

      The use of the single-use ancillary does not induce any modification of the surgical
      technique for fitting a TKA. The surgical approach is unchanged and is specific to the
      surgeon. The appearance and use of the single-use ancillary are similar to the conventional
      ancillary except for the materials used for their design. Please note that a preliminary
      training at the beginning of the study will be carried out with the different investigators
      so that they can handle the different medical devices.

      In total, 48 participants will be randomized. The medico-economics assessments will be
      performed for 20 patients (10 per group) by micro-costing to evaluate the preoperative,
      intraoperative and post-operative costs : reconditioning time, sterilization and transport
      time, preparation time and duration of intervention. The qualitative score of subjective
      assessment of the operator's perception of the ancillary measured during the intervention.
      The participants will evaluate their QOL by completing a questionnaire 3 month and 12 month
      postoperative. The safety parameters will also be collected.

    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Mean production cost of the surgical intervention in each arm is calculated thanks to 2 steps : 1) Quantification of health resources consumed during the surgical intervention (transport, cleaning, reconditionning sterilization of ancillaries, time spent by medical staff, nurses and materials used. (These data will be collected on a paper sheet and reported in a eCRF for 20 patients (10 per group)) ; 2) Valuation of health resources consumed with hospital cost accounting, mean wages, and purchase prices of materials.</description>
