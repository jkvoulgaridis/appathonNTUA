  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will find the maximum tolerated dose of CYNK-001 which contain NK cells derived
      from human placental CD34+ cells and culture-expanded. CYNK-001 cells will be given post
      Autologous Stem Cell Transplant. The safety of this treatment will be evaluated, and
      researchers want to learn if NK cells will help in treating Multiple Myeloma.

          6. Ability to be off immunosuppressive drugs for at least 3 days prior to the CYNK-001
             cell infusion. Steroids at the equivalent of no more than 5 mg prednisone per day are
             permissible.

          7. Subjects must have autologous peripheral blood stem cell graft available in storage
             for additional transplant in the event of engraftment failure.

          8. Female of childbearing potential (FCBP) must not be pregnant and agree to not becoming
             pregnant for at least 28 days following the CYNK-001. FCBP must agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception during the treatment period.

             FCBP is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal
             (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at
             least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24
             consecutive months).

          9. Male subjects must agree to use a condom during sexual contact for at least 28 days
             following the CYNK-001, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

        Subject Exclusion Criteria

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has plasma cell leukemia.

          2. Subject has non-secretory myeloma.

          3. Subject has previously undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          4. Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric
             illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          5. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities which
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study.

          6. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

          7. Subject has a known sensitivity or allergy to lenalidomide which will limit the
             subject from receiving the mandatory lenalidomide maintenance as part of the study
             plan.

          8. Subject has aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or
             alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) within 7 days prior to
             melphalan administration. Transient abnormalities should be discussed with the medical
             monitor.

          9. Subject may not have transfusion of blood products (ie, packed red blood cells, whole
             blood etc) within 24 hours of CYNK-001 infusions.

         10. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening
             calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. (Levey,
             2006)

         11. Subject has a bilirubin level &gt; 2 mg/dL (unless subject has known Gilbert's disease)
             at screening.

         12. Subject has had prior treatment with biologic antineoplastic agents less than 7 days
             before CYNK-001 infusion and at least 5 half-lives since (excludes melphalan).
             (Exception will be granted for monoclonal antibodies that are known to have long
             half-lives, in which case a minimum of 2 weeks from last dose will be required). For
             agents that have known AEs occurring beyond these specified days after administration,
             this period must be extended beyond the time during which acute AEs are known to
             occur. Treating physicians are encouraged to discuss cases with the Medical Monitor.

         14. Subject has new or progressive pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusion large enough
             to be detected by chest x-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan within 2 weeks of
             CYNK-001 infusion.

         15. Subject has active autoimmune disease other than controlled connective tissue disorder
             or those who are not on active therapy.

         16. Subject who is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive is excluded due to
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with myeloablative chemotherapy.

         17. Subject has history of malignancy, other than MM, unless the subject has been free of
             disease for &gt; 3 years from the date of signing the ICF. Exceptions include the
             following noninvasive malignancies:

               1. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin

               2. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin CYNK-001

               3. Carcinoma in situ of the cervix

               4. Carcinoma in situ of the breast

               5. Incidental histological finding of prostate cancer (TNM stage of T1a or T1b)

         18. Subject has a history of severe asthma and is presently on chronic medications or has
             a history of other symptomatic pulmonary disease.

         19. Untreated chronic infection or treatment of any infection with systemic antibiotics
             within 2 weeks prior to melphalan.

         20. Subject has any other organ dysfunction (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
             Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 Grade 3 or greater) that will interfere with the
             administration of the therapy according to this protocol.

         21. Subject has a resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt; 35% obtained by
             echocardiography or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA).

         22. Subject was treated with an investigational product no less than 28 days before
             CYNK-001 infusion. Subject must no longer be a participant in the previous
             interventional study at the time of the CYNK-001 infusion. (Subjects who are under
             survival follow-up or observation associated with a study are permitted, and if
             treatment information is collected for this period, &quot;Investigational Study&quot; must be
             used for capturing the study treatment.)
