  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study to find out if the drug trametinib in combination with
      ruxolitinib is safe, tolerable and has beneficial effects in people who has certain type of
      cancers including the type that you have. Patients with RAS mutant colorectal cancer and
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma are invited to participate in this study. This is the first time
      that both trametinib and ruxolitinib are studied in combination. Trametinib is marketed in
      several countries with the brand name Mekinist® for the treatment of melanoma (a type of skin
      cancer). Trametinib has been studied extensively in cancer and has been tested in many
      patients. Ruxolitinib is an oral inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine kinases and is approved
      for treatment of adult polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib has been studied
      extensively in many patients.
