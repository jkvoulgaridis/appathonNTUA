  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to compare the brain distribution of GABA(A) receptors and GABA levels
      in young adult males with Fragile X Syndrome compared to idiopathic intellectual
      developmental disorder. The radiopharmaceutical [18F]flumazenil has been used to study
      GABA(A) receptor distribution in other genetic syndromes with autistic features; however,
      despite overwhelming evidence supporting the importance of the GABAergic system in FXS, no
      clinical investigation of this system in human FXS has been reported in the literature.
      Therefore, this study will provide the first in vivo comprehensive examination of the
      GABAergic system in FXS using hybrid positron emission tomography/ magnetic resonance imaging
      (PET/MRI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
      Converging evidence suggests that GABAergic dysfunction occurs in FXS. The investigators wish
      to examine brain distribution of GABA (A) receptors in young adult males with FXS using
      hybrid PET/MRI with [18F]flumazenil. This project will study the distribution of GABA(A)
      receptors in 15 young male adults with FXS (18-30 years old) compared to 15 age-matched male
      subjects with idiopathic intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) as controls. Simultaneous
      PET/MRI acquisition is an optimal technique to study in vivo GABAergic dysfunction and GABAa
      receptor distribution.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 hours per scan on a single study day</time_frame>
    <description>Binding potential provides an estimate of the GABA (A) receptor distribution and affinity of [18F]flumazenil-PET to the GABA receptors. Binding potential will be measured in patients with fragile X syndrome and control group comprising individuals with idiopathic intellectual developmental disorder.
Using imaging data obtained from PET that was corrected for attenuation and partial volume effects by MRI, nuclear medicine physicians will draw regions of interest (ROI's) around the areas of the brain listed below to estimate the F18 FMZ non-displaceable binding potential (BPnd) of F18 FMZ to GABA (A) receptors in FXS.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 2 hours per scan on a single study day</time_frame>
    <description>Binding potential measurements will be compared between participants with fragile X syndrome and control group with idiopathic intellectual developmental disorder(IDD) using the PET radiotracer [18F]flumazenil-PET.
Binding Potential (BPnd) is estimated as the distribution volume ratio (DVR) -1.
DVR's of tracers are used in PET receptor studies where the radiopharmaceutical can be specifically bound to receptors; nonspecifically bound to other macromolecular components, or free in tissue (FT). DVR is calculated using a Logan Plot, which uses the dynamic PET images obtained during imaging and compartment modeling to graphically analyze by linear regression pharmacokinetic data for radiopharmaceuticals that undergo 'reversible' uptake.
PET scans of FXS patients will be compared to the PET scans of control group.</description>
