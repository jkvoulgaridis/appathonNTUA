  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP0598 Otic
      Solution. This study will also evaluate the efficacy of ASP0598 otic solution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.

      Participants will be enrolled in the dose escalation phase of the study. Dose escalation will
      consist of up to 4 cohorts with different dose levels. After randomization on Day 1,
      participants will receive ASP0598 Otic Solution or placebo administration into the affected
      ear. Participants will return to the site on days 2, 3, 8, 15, 29, and 57 [end of study
      (EOS)].

      The dose expansion phase will be based on the safety and efficacy results from an interim
      analysis. The interim analysis will be conducted after completion of last cohort in dose
      escalation phase. If dose expansion phase is opened, 2 or 3 treatment groups will be
      selected. If 3 groups are selected, participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ration of high
      dose ASP0598 Otic Solution, low dose ASP0598 Otic Solution, and Placebo. If 2 groups are
      selected, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ration of high dose ASP0598 Otic Solution
      and Placebo.

      Participants will be randomized on Day 1 and will receive ASP0598 otic solution or placebo
      administration into the affected ear. Participants in the dose expansion will return to the
      site on days 8, 15, 29, 57, and 85 at end of study (EOS).

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an IP, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product (IP) whether or not considered related to the IP. A TEAE is defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the study drug through end of study visit. A drug-related TEAE is defined as any TEAE with a causal relationship assessed as &quot;yes&quot; by the investigator.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in bone conduction hearing at 1 kHz by pure tone audiometry (PTA) in dose escalation phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) is a behavioral test and generally the 1st quantitative hearing test done to assess the nature and degree of hearing loss in adults and in children. This measure involves the peripheral and central auditory systems. Pure tone air conduction and bone conduction tests determine whether or not there is any hearing loss; what type of hearing loss it is (conductive, sensorineural or mixed hearing loss); the frequencies that are affected (configuration); magnitude of hearing loss (intensity) and whether hearing loss is unilateral or bilateral. The result is plotted on an audiogram, which is a graph displaying intensity as a function of frequency.</description>
