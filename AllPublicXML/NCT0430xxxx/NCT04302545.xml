      The healthy pregnant women with previous operative deliveries admitted for elective C-section
      will be counselled and conditioned informed consent will be taken to be included in either
      study group if dense pelvic adhesions will be found during their operation. Adhesiolysis will
      be performed using bladder retro-fill with 300cc saline in the cystoinflation group, and
      without retro-fill in control.Both groups will be observed for bladder injury
      rate,bloodloss,operativetime,urinary tract infection,micturition problems and fistula
      formation.

      Investigators will conduct this study to find the effectiveness of cystoinflation to prevent
      bladder injury in women with adhesions of previous C-sections. This prospective analytic
      longitudinal study will be conducted in Lady Willingdon Hospital, a tertiary care teaching
      hospital affiliated with King Edward Medical University Pakistan, from August 2017 to July
      2019, after approval by the institutional review board of King Edward Medical University,
      Pakistan. The subjects will be randomly allocated to cystoinflation and control groups. The
      healthy pregnant women with previous operative deliveries admitted for elective C-section
      will be counselled and conditioned informed consent will be taken to be included in either
      study group if dense pelvic adhesions will be found during their operation. Adhesiolysis will
      be performed using bladder retro-fill with 300cc saline in the cystoinflation group, and
      without retro-fill in control. We will assess primary outcome by observing bladder injury
      rate, blood loss and operative time. The secondary outcome will be assessed by Urinary tract
      infection, micturition problems and fistula formation during 3month follow up period. The
      cystoinflation will be considered effective if the proportion of bladder injury in the study
      group will be less than 50% of the control group.
