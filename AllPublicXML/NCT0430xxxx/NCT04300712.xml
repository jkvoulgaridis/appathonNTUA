  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local partnerships between schools (preschool and elementary) and mental health public
      services are implemented in seven sites in France. They aim to improve recognition of
      difficulties related to mental health problems and to provide interventions to 3 to 8
      years-old pupils in need. Our hypothesis that these local partnerships and interventions
      enhance the role of school in supporting good mental health and wellbeing of all children and
      the trajectories of children with mental health service needs. Theses also facilitate
      community support. One of them, early-interventions involve caregivers. Our objective is to
      enhance knowledge of the unmet mental healthcare need at school and to explore for whom, in
      which local context and how partnerships and early intervention work.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Teachers are legitimately concerned about children that encounter mental health problems.
      Mental healthcare might be indicated. Because of internal and external barriers of treatment,
      they could remain inaccessible for many children in need. School staff should not try to
      diagnose conditions. However, collaborative interventions delivered by school and mental
      healthcare staffs in association with other stakeholders as parents and associations should
      ensure clear systems and processes in place for identifying possible mental health problems
      and support children and their parents. Local partnership and early interventions will be
      elaborated within focus groups bringing together all stakeholders and will be experimented in
      7 French sites (preschool, primary school and local public health service) thereafter. These
      complex interventions will be evaluated through mixed-methods including qualitative case
      studies and a pragmatic trial. This feasibility study will produce a set of findings that
      will permit to argue conceptual framework of partnership and early intervention, to provide
      guidelines to implement these in France considering children needs, local context, all
      stakeholders acceptance and public health efficacy.

    <description>Interventions will be proposed to children identified in a worrisome situation. The Strengths and Difficulties. Questionnaire will be used by teachers to score these situations. The recognition process of mental health problem and need continue with responses. Responses are supporting a graduated response process in school and facilitating external support when needed (mental health services, community supports). Early intervention is one of all responses, which involve caregivers. Responses to worrisome situations aim to improve schooling conditions, to acknowledge mental health problems or condition and the health services need for children. To evaluate the intervention, the impact supplement of SDQ and the follow-up questions will be used by the teachers and the parents of children who benefit of the intervention. The interventions will be experimented during year 2020-21. Children might benefit of them from several weeks to one year, according to their need.</description>
