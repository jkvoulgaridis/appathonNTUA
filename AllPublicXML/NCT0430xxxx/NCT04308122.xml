  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of cervical orthosis after instrumented posterior cervical spinal surgery is still widely
      practiced even though modern fusion techniques likely do not require additional stabilization
      from an external orthosis. This is a single, centre randomized, non-blinded equivalence
      trial. Patients undergoing multi-level posterior cervical fusion will be randomized to
      cervical orthosis (CO group) or no orthosis (NO group). Immediately following surgery
      patients in the CO group will be fitted with a Philadelphia collar prior to being transferred
      to the recovery room. On the patient ward a physiotherapist will fit the patient with a
      Cervimax/Aspen/Miami J collar which will be worn at all times for 6 weeks according the
      standard of care. The NO group will have no specific precautions applied to their neck range
      of motion. Outcomes will be assessed prior to surgery, on the second day after surgery, and
      at 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks after surgery. The primary outcome will be neck pain score on the
      numerical rating scale (ranging from 0-10 with higher scores indicating more severe pain)
      during the first 4 weeks after surgery with an equivalence margin of 2.0 points. Secondary
      outcomes will be neck disability, general health, treatment satisfaction, pain medication
      use, adverse events, neck range of motion, time meeting discharge status, and compliance in
      wearing the collar.

    <description>NDI is a self-administered questionnaire with 10 questions. Each question is scored from 0 to 5 for a maximum score of 50 and the score converted to a percentage score. The scale ranges from 0 to 100 with a higher score denoting worse disability.</description>

    <description>is a generic, multidimensional self-report health questionnaireQuestions are categorized into scales for general health, physical functioning, social functioning, role limitation-physical, role limitation-emotional, mental health, energy/fatigue, pain, comparative health. These are summarized into the SF12-physical component summary score (PCS) and mental component summary score (MCS). Scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores impling better functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment satisfaction (% of patients satisfied)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study duration to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction will be assessed by the following question: &quot;Are you satisfied with the results of your spine surgery?&quot; using a 5-category scale as follows: 1) extremely satisfied, 2) somewhat satisfied, 3) Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4) somewhat dissatisfied, 5) extremely dissatisfied.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to meet discharge status (days)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 2</time_frame>
    <description>measured as the number of days it takes to meet all discharge criteria including:
Ambulating safely and independently as assessed by the physiotherapist
Pain controlled with oral analgesics
Minimal wound drainage following drain removal
For the CO group only: proficient donning and doffing the CO as assessed by physiotherapy/occupation therapy</description>

    <measure>Pain medication usage</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study duration to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The total dosage of opioids and NSAID for the hospital length of stay will be calculated. The type of medication used (over the counter, NSAID, muscle relaxant, narcotics, anti-depressant, neuroeleptic and other) will be indicated as not taken, as needed, and daily at week 2, 4, 6, and 12 after surgery.</description>

    <measure>Compliance with wearing the collar (collar group only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study duration to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked they used the collar as prescribed. If not, they will be asked if they wore the collar at all, and if yes for how many hours per day. Compliance will be defined as prescribed, irregular or aborted. Patients will be compliant if they wear the collar for&gt; 20 hours per day.</description>
