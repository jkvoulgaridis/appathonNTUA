  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an open label, one-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      olaparib and pembrolizumab in patients with cholangiocarcinoma who have progressed on or
      cannot tolerate gemcitabine-based therapy.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the ORR of patients with advanced
      cholangiocarcinoma receiving a combination of pembrolizumab and olaparib. It is hypothesized
      that the addition of olaparib will improve the response rate of second line systemic therapy
      from 17.5% to 35% in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.

      The study is designed to enroll 33 subjects (for 85% power) with advanced stage
      cholangiocarcinoma to test the hypothesis that the combination of olaparib and pembrolizumab
      will increase the ORR in comparison with the ORR from second line systemic chemotherapy
      (historical control) in this patient population. As the primary study endpoint, which is also
      being used to determine the sample size of the study, the investigators propose that the
      combination of olaparib and pembrolizumab will increase the ORR to 35% from 17.5% (achieved
      with systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy including mFOLFOX—historical control). To allow a 10%
      patient drop off rate, the investigators expect to enroll a total of 36 subjects into this
      study. In addition, as secondary study endpoints the investigators expect to see an increase
      in the PFS and OS of patients receiving combination therapy compared to cytotoxic
      chemotherapy.

      In this study, the investigators propose the collection of three biopsies—one at baseline
      prior to the start of treatment, one at the beginning of week 4, three weeks after the
      administration of combination olaparib and pembrolizumab, and one at the time of cancer
      progression—for the elucidation of exploratory study endpoints. Patients will have a CT or
      MRI scan at the beginning of treatment and then every 6 weeks thereafter for the first six
      months of study treatment administration, then every 9 weeks for up to 12 months after the
      start of treatment, followed by every 12 weeks up to 24 months on study. All patients will
      continue to receive olaparib and pembrolizumab combination treatment as tolerated unless
      unacceptable toxicities or cancer progression occur, at which time therapy will cease. In the
      absence of any problems, the planned study duration is 20-36 months.

             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          7. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at

             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

          8. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the

             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

         10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         11. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

         12. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         13. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the site investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         16. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         17. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy

             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

         18. Has known active Hepatitis B without HBV treatment (HBV infection with ongoing HBV
             treatment is allowed); chronic Hepatitis C infection is allowed. Any patient receiving
             treatment for HCV should wait at least 14 days after completion of HCV treatment
             before beginning study treatment. No patient should receive HCV treatment while
             receiving study treatment. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is
             required unless mandated by local health authority.

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.
