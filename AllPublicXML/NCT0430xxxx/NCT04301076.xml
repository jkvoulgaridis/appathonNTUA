      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together
      with usual combination chemotherapy (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate [Oncovin],
      cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride [hydroxydaunorubicin hydrochloride], or
      &quot;EPOCH&quot;) in treating adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. Lenalidomide may help shrink or slow the
      growth of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide,
      vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as prednisone lower the body's immune
      response and are used with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. Giving
      lenalidomide and the usual combination chemotherapy may work better in treating adult T-cell
      leukemia-lymphoma compared to the usual combination chemotherapy alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safest and most tolerable dose and schedule of lenalidomide to combine
      with etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate (Oncovin), cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin
      hydrochloride (hydroxydaunorubicin hydrochloride) (EPOCH) chemotherapy in adult T-cell
      leukemia-lymphoma (ATL/ATLL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine if lenalidomide and EPOCH
      activity results in significant improvement in remission rates and duration of remissions as
      compared to historical controls.

      III. To determine if lenalidomide and EPOCH activity correlates with T-cell receptor (TCR)
      pathway gene mutational spectrum.

      IV. To determine effects of lenalidomide and EPOCH on human T-cell leukemia virus type 1
      (HTLV-1) proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) loads.

      V. To determine effects of lenalidomide and EPOCH on HTLV-1 clonality.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 of
      21 day cycles or days 1-21 or 1-28 of 28 day cycles. Patients also receive doxorubicin
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-4, vincristine sulfate IV
      continuously on days 1-4, etoposide IV continuously on days 1-4, prednisone PO on days 1-5,
      and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-4 hours on day 5. Treatment repeats every 21 or 28 days for up
      to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable
      disease (SD) may receive up to 2 additional cycles of lenalidomide, doxorubicin
      hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide at the
      discretion of the investigator and/or up to an additional 2 years of lenalidomide in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.

             Patients will be enrolled based on reports from local or referral labs (e.g., Mayo
             Clinic or LabCorp). Confirmation will be performed by Ratner Lab at Washington
             University, retrospectively, but this is not a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
             Amendments (CLIA) assay and is not reimbursed by insurance

             of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10-14 days prior to, and again within 24 hours of
             starting lenalidomide, and must either commit to continued abstinence from
             heterosexual intercourse or begin two acceptable methods of birth control, one highly
             effective method and one additional effective method at the same time, at least 28
             days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy
             testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even
             if they have had a successful vasectomy. All patients must be counselled at a minimum
             of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risk of fetal exposure. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner are
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
             FCBP must use adequate contraception for at least 28 days after discontinuation from
             study. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate
             contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for at
             least 28 days after discontinuation from study

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be
             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that have received prior IMiDs for treatment of ATLL

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to prior anti-cancer
             therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) within 14 days prior to enrollment,
             with the exception of alopecia

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents or have received them
             within 14 days prior to enrollment

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to lenalidomide or other agents used in study. Anaphylactic reactions
             including death have been reported with cyclophosphamide. Possible cross-sensitivity
             with other alkylating agents can occur

          -  Patients unable to take aspirin or prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparin
             or direct oral anticoagulants will not be eligible for maintenance treatment with
             lenalidomide, but may enroll and receive induction therapy with lenalidomide plus
             EPOCH

          -  Patients with urinary outflow obstruction (contraindication for cyclophosphamide)

          -  Patients with any form of demyelinating disease should not be given vincristine
             sulfate injection

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide is an IMiD agent with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with lenalidomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with lenalidomide. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used
             in this study
