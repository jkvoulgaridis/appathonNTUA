  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Jewish Population is at an increased risk for genetic diseases, especially autosomal
      recessive, thus, screening should be done to determine carrier status of several genetic
      diseases. In the Mexican Jewish Community, which is a very diverse community (regarding
      geographical origins), data of carrier status is unknown. The study aims to determine carrier
      prevalence for over 300 diseases using commercially available panels.

      Background: Preconceptional screening of genetic diseases is currently a underused and very
      useful tool, especially in populations that are at risk to be carriers of genetic diseases,
      such as the Jewish people, with carrier rates as high as 1:4 for any autosomal recessive
      disease. The Mexican Jewish Community is one of these populations at-risk, and there is no
      modern genetic research of the carrier rates in this community.

      Goals: This research project in the Mexican Jewish Community aims to determine the prevalence
      of carriers in the community in order to properly generate in the future, a systematic
      carrier screening in the community.

      Research Plan: The investigators propose a descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study,
      in which a representative sample of the Mexican Jewish Community (Which composes of
      Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Middle-Eastern Jews) of 250 patients, in which we´ll collect a
      saliva sample with a collection kit. Furthermore, the sample will be sent to a private
      commercial laboratory to perform the Comprehensive Carrier Screening to analyze the 301 genes
      included in the test plus the 13 add-on genes.

      Analysis: Other demographic variables will be collected from the patients at the time of the
      sample collection to identify possible risk factors (geographical origin, number of Jewish
      grandparents, history of genetic diseases, et. al) and a correlation analysis will be
      performed to verify the strength of those risk factors on the carrier status of the patients.
