  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effects on safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of MK-1942 and
      donepezil when co-administered to participants with Alzheimer's Disease with mild-to-moderate
      cognitive impairment stably treated with donepezil. The objectives of this study include
      determining if the combination of MK-1942 with donepezil increases the incidence or severity
      of adverse events (AEs) previously reported for these agents, or results in unanticipated AEs
      in the patient population targeted for MK-1942 treatment. In addition, any changes in the PK
      parameters of either MK-1942 or donepezil as a result of co-administration will be assessed.

    <time_frame>Baseline Up to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with clinically significant 12-lead ECGs will be presented. Twelve lead ECGs will be obtained during the study using an ECG machine that automatically measured ECG parameters of PR, QRS, QT, and QT corrected by Bazett's formula (QTcB), QT corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) intervals. Twelve lead ECGs will be performed with the participant in a semi-recumbent position having rested in this position for at least 10 minutes beforehand. Measurements that deviate substantially from previous readings will be repeated immediately.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Reported Suicidal Ideation and/or Behavior on Study Based on Responses to the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first day of study treatment through study follow-up (Up to Day 42)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with suicidality using the C-SSRS will be presented. The C-SSR will be used in this study only for the purpose of safety monitoring by measuring the incidence of different types of suicidality categories during treatment. C-SSRS assessment will be based upon a clinician's interpretation of the participant's responses to the C-SSRS questions, not by a numbered scale. Suicidal ideation and/or behaviors identified on the C-SSRS may not be considered an adverse event, based on the investigator's judgment. Participants who report at least one occurrence of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation will be counted as having experienced suicidality. Suicidal behavior includes suicide attempt, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, or preparatory behavior. Suicidal ideation include a wish to die or active suicidal thought with or without method, intent or plan.</description>
