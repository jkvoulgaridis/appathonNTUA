      Background:

      In patients with dyaphagia the modification of viscosity of oral liquids with thickeners ia
      needed to guarantee an effective and safe swallowing, and to ensure a proper state of
      hydration. There are two types of thickeners: thickeners obtained from modified starch or
      from food gums (suchxanthan gum)

      Aim:

      To evaluate the acceptance of different types of thickeners, with and without the addition of
      flavorings, and their relationship with water intake.

      Methods:

      Randomized, controlled, pilot study of nutritional intervention. Forty hospitalized patients
      with oropharyngeal dysphagia were randomized to 4 parallel groups: modified starch without
      flavoring, modified starch with flavoring, xanthan gum without flavoring, xanthan gum with
      flavoring. Each patient was asked to assess the odor, taste, appearance, and overall
      valoration of the thickened liquid with the different preparations, using a structured
      questionnaire. The number of glasses consumed by the patient over 3 consecutive days was also
      recorded to calculate de volume of liquid they consumed.
