  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of Chitosan
      scaffold and Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) when used as pulpotomy agents in mature
      permanent teeth with irreversible pulpitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty permanent mandibular molars of patients with signs and symptoms of irreversible
      pulpitis will be selected. They will be randomly allocated into two groups, Group 1(Chitosan
      scaffold/ MTA pulp dressing materials), Group 2 (MTA pulp dressing material). A single visit
      full pulpotomy procedure will be carried out. Chitosan scaffold and / or MTA will be used as
      the pulp dressing materials. The teeth will be then restored with base of Glass ionomer
      cement followed by composite restoration.

    <description>Chitosan 3-D porous scaffold will be prepared. The chitosan scaffolds will be examined with the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze the surface of the chitosan scaffolds. The scaffolds will be sterilized by Ethylene oxide and stored until further use. A piece of 2-mm thick chitosan scaffold will be gently placed onto the pulp chamber floor and covering the canal orifices, and then a 2-3 mm thick layer of fast setting EndoCem Zr MTA will be applied onto the chitosan scaffold and will be gently condensed with moistened cotton pellet to attain adequate thickness which will be confirmed radiographically. MTA will be allowed to set for 4-5 mins.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants free from any systemic disease.

          -  Deep caries in a permanent lower molar with mature roots.

          -  Probing pocket depth and mobility within normal limits.

          -  No signs of pulpal necrosis including sinus tract or swelling.

          -  Vital bleeding pulp tissue should be present in all canals after complete pulpotomy.

          -  The tooth is restorable.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis based on subjective and
             objective examinations:

               -  Subjective examination: Patients complaining of intermittent or spontaneous pain
                  or pain exacerbated by dramatic temperature changes especially to cold stimuli
                  and lasting for a few seconds to several hours.

               -  Objective examination:

                    -  Clinical examination: Teeth that will experience immediate, excruciatingly
                       painful sensation as soon as the cold stimulus is placed on and which may
                       last for a while even after the removal of the stimulus.

                    -  Radiographic examination: Preoperative radiographs will be taken using a
                       paralleling device.

                    -  The periapical index developed by Orstavik et al. (1986)(35) will be used to
                       score cases with periapical rarefaction during diagnosis and follow-up
                       periods. It consists of five categories:

                         1. Normal periapical structures.

                         2. Small changes in bone structures.

                         3. Change in bone structure with mineral loss.

                         4. Periodontitis with well-defined radiolucent area.

                         5. Severe periodontitis with exacerbating features. Score 1 and 2 are
                            considered healthy, score 3—5 are considered diseased

                    -  The teeth that will be included should have score 1 or 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Negative response to cold testing.

          -  No pulp exposure after caries excavation.

          -  Bleeding could not be controlled in 10 minutes after 2.5% NaOCl

          -  Absence of bleeding from any of the canals.

          -  Teeth with radiographic signs of internal resorption.

          -  Pulpal calcifications.

          -  Participants with stainless-steel wires and brackets.
