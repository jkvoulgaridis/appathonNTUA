  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 25 individuals living with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) who can stand
      but have limited ability to elicit a step without physical assistance or upper limb (U/L)
      support will be recruited for this study. The first objective of the study will aim to
      investigate the orthotic effect (i.e., immediate effect) of FES on the reactive stepping
      response. The second objective is to investigate the therapeutic effect of a novel balance
      intervention, perturbation-based balance training (PBT) combined with FES (i.e., PBT+FES) on
      reactive stepping ability, measures of postural sway during quiet standing (i.e.,
      biomechanical measures), and scores on clinical measures of balance and walking.

    <description>The PBT program will consist of repetitive practice of reactive stepping for one hour. The participants will be equipped with the Odstock 2-Channel stimulator on one or both sides depending on their deficits. One channel of stimulation may be applied to the common fibular nerve to elicit a flexor withdraw reflex and elicit a step. The second channel of stimulation may be applied to the quadriceps muscles to assist with the supporting phase of the reactive step, as required. Participants will experience about 60 perturbations per session during balance exercises. To create a perturbation, the researcher will apply unexpected pushes or pulls to a safety harness around the participant's trunk. Throughout the hour-long session, participants will complete challenging balance tasks, customized to their ability level, during standing and walking. The training will be supervised by a licensed physiotherapist and administered by a licensed physiotherapist or registered kinesiologist.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. have a motor incomplete SCI (i.e., AIS grade C or D) that is non-progressive;

          2. be at least one year post-injury (i.e., chronic injury);

          3. â‰¥ 18 years old;

          4. be able to stand independently for 60 sec;

          5. unable to take a step bilaterally without physical assistance or upper extremity
             support;

          6. able to understand spoken English;

          7. free of any other condition besides SCI that significantly affects walking or balance
             (e.g., no vestibular disorder, significant vision loss, stroke);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications for EMS. Electrical stimulation will not be used if:

               -  it will be applied to areas where it could cause malfunction of electronic
                  devices, including cardiac pacemakers;

               -  a woman is pregnant;

               -  the applied region has known or suspected malignancy;

               -  there are active bleeding tissues, or the person has untreated hemorrhagic
                  disorders;

               -  there are damaged skin areas or at-risk skin areas that would result in uneven
                  conduction of current;

          2. severe spasticity is present in the legs;

          3. the person has contractures in the lower limbs that prevent achieving a neutral hip
             and ankle position, or extended knee;

          5. the leg muscles are unresponsive to electrical stimulation (i.e., peripheral nerve
             damage in the legs).

          6. Pressure sores on pelvis or trunk, where safety harness will be donned.
