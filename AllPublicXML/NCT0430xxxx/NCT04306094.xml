    <textblock>
      This study is a cohort study with patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients will answer
      questionnaires about symptoms and quality of life and will be submitted to physical and blood
      tests, and computer tomography. The aim of this study is to estimate prognostic factors
      predicting survival to 3 months in patients with advanced NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently the neoplasm leading in deaths worldwide and
      in Brazil. NSCLC has a high incidence, is usually diagnosed in advanced stages and has poor
      survival rates. The ability to refine the prognosis of a disease has implications at the time
      of diagnosis and decision about treatment. Clinical and laboratory factors are studied to
      evaluated the prognosis of diseases. Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP score), Karnofsky
      Performance Status Scale (KPS), Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI) are applied in patients
      with many types of solid tumors. The Charlson Score evaluates comorbidities and the
      attributed risk for presence it. Others predictors of prognostic are cachexia, quality of
      life, inflammatory factors, sarcopenia. There is a need to improve the ability to estimate
      the prognosis and to identify the factors responsible to low survival rates in patients with
      NSCLC diagnosed at advanced stage, also as a tool for a better treatment selection.

      This is an observational and prospective study, including patients diagnosed with NSCLC and
      admitted in ICESP, staged as IV at admission, with no previous systemic treatment and
      classified as ECOG 2-4. Demographic data, presence of a caregiver, anthropometry, MRC dyspnea
      scale, KPS, Edmont Symptom Scale, Charlson's Comorbidity Score, PPI and PaP were evaluated in
      each patient. Evaluation of sarcopenia and cachexia with abdominal CT (Slice-O-Matic, v.5),
      arm circumference, handgrip strength test and quality of life using EORTC score QLQ C-30 and
      QLQ-CAX-24 were also evaluated. Significant prognostic factors will be selected by
      multivariate analysis in a training set estimated as 217 patients.
