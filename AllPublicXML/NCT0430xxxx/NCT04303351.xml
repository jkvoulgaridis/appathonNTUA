      This study aimed to evaluate the association between periodontitis and atherosclerosis of the
      cerebral vasculature in the Chinese population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis has been demonstrated as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke in several clinical
      studies. Atherosclerosis of the cerebral vasculatureis an important pathological process
      causing ischaemic stroke. The investigator's study aims to investigate the relationship
      between tooth loss(used as a surrogate of periodontal disease) and atherosclerotic-related
      arterial stenosis in the Chinese population. An estimated 1,000 participants that underwent
      cerebral angiography at Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine between Apirl 2020
      and January 2022 will be recruited in this trial. Arterial stenosis features of each
      participants will be collected based on the results of digital subtraction angiography (DSA).
      The missing teeth counts of each participant will be collected and some of them will recieved
      comprehensive periodontal examination. Besides, blood samples will be collected in order to
      investigate the serum inflammatory markers(CRP,WBC,albumin,IL-6,IL-10). The relationship
      between tooth loss and atherosclerotic-related arterial stenosis will be analysed by
      regression models adjusted for conventional risk factors (sex,age, obesity,smoking,Alcohol
      drinking,diabetes,hypertension,hyperuricaemia,hyperhomocysteinaemia)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The relationship between atherosclerotic-related stenosis in different brain arteries and tooth loss categories</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The arteries of the brains will be partitioned into the following segments: common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid arteries (ICA, C1-C7), the external carotid artery (ECA), the anterior cerebral artery (ACA, A1-A2), the middle cerebral artery (MCA, M1-M2), the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), the basilar artery (BA), the vertebral artery (VA,V1-V4) and the subclavicular artery (SUB) .The chi-square test and Fisher's exact test will be used, as appropriate, to estimate the relationship between tooth loss and stenosis distributed in different branches</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The relationship between the severity of artery stenosis and tooth loss categories</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of vascular stenosis will be categorized into five group: no stenosis, mild stenosis, moderate stenosis, severe stenosis and occlusion. Ordinal logistic regression will be performed to analyse the relationship between the tooth loss categories and the degrees of artery stenosis.</description>
