    <textblock>
      The reported literature suggests that knowledge about pharmacovigilance is on a lower side
      and ADR reporting is not common in developing countries. This survey may help us to identify
      the common gaps in knowledge and practices about pharmacovigilance so that we can devise the
      strategy on the basis of outcome.

      Safety evaluation of a product in a market is like a moving ball which need re-evaluation as
      the data gather in its life cycle.(1) As per the definition of International society of
      harmonization and World Health Organization, adverse reaction is Adverse drug reaction (ADR)
      is defined as &quot;A response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses
      normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for modification of
      physiological function.&quot; (2) Adverse reaction and adverse event are interchangeable use in
      pharmacovigilance sector by knowing the difference is that ADR term used when drug is causing
      the effect (1). The frequency of ADR is getting higher due to the increasing prevalence of
      chronic disease with the growing trend of combination drugs (3). The non-profitable
      organization of pharmacovigilance is playing tremendous role in disseminating the awareness
      of proper usage of drug globally.(3) According to Uppsala database statistics, approximately
      3 million reports were listed as suspected ADRs. (4) Nearly 6.7% of hospitalizations were due
      to serious ADRs (5)

        A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 1500 HCPs in 11 countries
        (Afghanistan, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Laos, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines,
        Sri Lanka, and Sudan). The participants were approached at various scientific events and
        academic interactions during the period and were requested to participate in the survey on
