  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, randomized controlled study, which aims to determine if a
      maternal scent intervention improves the sleep wake states, brain maturation, and heart rate
      variability in premature infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Infants
      will be randomized to either 24 hours of exposure to maternal scent or standard of care.
      Sleep wake states will be obtained using behavioral coding. Brain maturation will be measured
      using several electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters. Heart rate variability will be collected
      as part of vital sign collection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is important for the growth and development of infants. There are different states that
      make up sleep wake cycles including quiet sleep, active sleep, and transitional sleep. The
      amount of time that infants spend in quiet sleep increases as they mature. There are
      different tools that can be used to measure sleep state including EEG, behavior, and vital
      signs. Recent research has looked at ways to improve sleep in infants admitted to the NICU
      including music and maternal voice. The investigators are interested in studying maternal
      scent. Maternal scent has been shown to improve infant feeding and to reduce infant crying
      during painful procedures. Therefore, the investigators are interested in studying how
      maternal scent might affect sleep wake state in infants admitted to the NICU. The
      investigators will observe infant behavior and use EEG and vital signs to assess sleep state
      in infant after they are exposed to maternal scent.

    <measure>Number of mothers diagnosed with acute stress disorder based on score on the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The SASRQ questionnaire is used to assess symptoms of stress after a difficult event. There are four sub-scales including 1) Dissociative Symptoms 2) Re-Experiencing 3) Avoidance and 4) Increased Anxiety. These sub-scales are scored to determine if the diagnosis of acute stress disorder can be made. A symptom is scored as present if the respondent marks it as occurring at least &quot;sometimes,&quot; which includes a response of 3, 4 or 5 on the 0-5 scale. A diagnosis of Acute Stress Disorder requires at least 3 symptoms out of the five types of dissociative symptoms, 1 reexperiencing symptom, 1 avoidance symptom, and 1 marked anxiety/increased arousal symptom. In order to count a symptom as present, circled response must be 3 or higher.</description>
