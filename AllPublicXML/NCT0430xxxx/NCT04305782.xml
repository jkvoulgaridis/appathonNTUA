      The goal of the research is to create and evaluate a new technology for management of daily
      residual limb fluid volume fluctuation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Limb fluid volume changes that can occur in the residual limb of a lower-limb amputee can
      result in changes in socket fit that lead to discomfort, skin injuries, and reduced mobility.
      It is known that limb fluid volume fluctuations can be reduced for some people by
      intermittently removing (doffing) the socket throughout the day. It is believed that
      partially doffing the socket may have a similar benefit, and could be made more convenient
      thereby promoting easier compliance for prosthetic users.

      The goal of the research is to create and evaluate a new technology for management of daily
      residual limb fluid volume fluctuation. The technology enables partial doffing through the
      release and relock of a socket panel and the prosthetic pin used to hold the limb in place.
      The expected outcomes are an enhanced understanding of how socket adjustments after activity
      facilitate limb fluid volume recovery, subsequent fluid retention, and improved socket fit.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline period (no release/relock) to test period (release/relock), commonly each 1 hour long and separated by a seated period of approximately 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Limb volume fluctuations will be measured in real-time as socket release/relock strategies are tested. This will be accomplished using a portable bioimpedance device with thin sticky electrodes that are placed on the residual limb. Specifically, the change in limb volume will be assessed from a baseline period where no socket adjustments are made to another period within the same test session where socket adjustments are made.</description>

    <description>The participants will operate the test socket in one of two test conditions: (1) pin re-lock before panel re-lock and (2) panel re-lock before pin re-lock. Participants will test each of the two conditions in a random order, in lab, following a structured protocol. Tests will determine if the order of the re-lock mechanisms influences changes in limb volume.</description>
