  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      to compare the efficacy of HIFU treatment with standard treatment in two situations:

        1. as first-line cancer treatment, HIFU is compared to radical prostatectomy.

        2. for patients with recurrence after external beam radiotherapy, HIFU treatment is
           compared to radical prostatectomy.

    <description>The main objective for patients is to compare recurrence-free survival (i.e., the rate of salvage therapy by external beam radiotherapy and/or hormone therapy) in patients treated by HIFU and those treated by radical prostatectomy. The implementation of salvage therapy will be decided according to several non-exclusive criteria (positivity of margins (for patients with radical prostatectomy), PSA at 3 months, biologic recurrence (increase in PSA &gt; 0.2 ng/ml after radical surgery, &gt; Nadir +2 after HIFU), control biopsies positive, the appearance of metastases</description>

    <description>The surgical approach can be open or laparoscopic. The procedure begins with lymph node dissection for the intermediate risk groups (PSA &gt; 10 ng/mL and/or presence of grade 4 Gleason score). Total prostatectomy includes removal of the seminal vesicles. It can preserve 1 or 2 neurovascular bundles, depending on the cancer stage and/or the choice expressed by the patient. The vesicourethral suture is either a running or interrupted suture, and there is drainage by a bladder catheter for at least 5 days.</description>

    <description>The treatment with High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) evaluated in this study will be delivered by 2 types of medical devices currently available on the market, Ablatherm® and Focal One®. They are both computer-controlled and provided with an endo-rectal probe with integrated ultrasound, enabling planning and the monitoring of treatment of localized prostate cancer in realtime.</description>
