  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess patient acceptance and preference among screening modalities,
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), Transnasal Esophagoscopy (TNE), and Cytosponge for
      Barrett's esophagus (BE). Subjects will undergo administration of Cytosponge and transnasal
      endoscopy (TNE) prior to their scheduled clinically indicated upper endoscopy performed per
      routine standard of care. Following the procedure, a follow-up phone call will be made during
      which an impact of events scale related to the subjective distress of each procedure, a
      preference and acceptance questionnaire, and adverse events related to study participation
      will be collected.

      Potential subjects will be identified via protocol and Institutional Review Board (IRB)
      methods prior to obtaining written informed consent. Once written informed consent is
      obtained and baseline demographic and medical history is collected, subjects will undergo
      administration of Cytosponge and transnasal endoscopy (TNE) prior to their scheduled
      clinically indicated upper endoscopy performed per routine standard of care. Following the
      procedure, a follow-up phone call will be made during which an impact of events scale related
      to the subjective distress of each procedure, a preference and acceptance questionnaire, and
      adverse events related to study participation will be collected.

    <description>Impact of Events Score (IES): scale was developed to assess the distress associated with a specific life event. IES scores range from 0-75, with higher scores indicating more severe distress associated from an event. Scores ≥ 44 indicate a event has severe impact on self-reported distress while scores ≤ 25 indicate the event may have an effect on distress.</description>

    <description>In a seated position, subjects will swallow the Cytosponge capsule with 150-250 mL of water. Seven minutes and 30 seconds to ten minutes after ingestion, the sponge is then withdrawn by gentle traction on the suture. After retrieval, the string is cut and the retrieved foam sphere containing the cytological specimen is immersed in fixative and stored refrigerated (1° to 12°C [34° to 54°F]).</description>
