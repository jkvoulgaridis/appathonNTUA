      One of the most effective surgical treatments for obstructive sleep apnoea / hypopnoea
      syndrome (SAHS) with global impact on the upper-airway (UA) is the maxilla-mandibular
      advancement (MMA). Retrospective-prospective observational study of: clinical outcomes, UA
      and dental-cranium-facial (DCF) morphology.

      Population sample will be patients treated in the Maxillofacial Surgery department of
      &quot;Hospital de Cruces&quot;. As inclusion criteria: ≥18 years-old, moderate-severe SAHS in supine
      position, multidisciplinary committee of sleep pathology evaluation for surgical indication,
      and written informed consents. As exclusion criteria: pregnant woman, SAHS of central origin,
      cranium-facial deformities that significantly modify normal UA, different surgery than MMA
      and inconclusive / incomplete tests. It is estimated ≥90% males; ≥90% 30-59 years-old; ≤10%
      extreme weights; 25% complementary surgeries; and sample size 40. Medical ethics code of the
      Declaration of Helsinki will be taken into account. To collect the pre- / postoperative data
      we will use, calibrated and standardized: polysomnography (PSG), computed tomography (CT),
      right face profile picture (RFP) and lateral teleradiography of the cranium (LTC).
      Furthermore, the Epworth scale and non-validated subjective self-perception test of facial
      aesthetics will be performed.

      Clinical outcomes will be evaluated from PSG using apnoea / hypopnoea index and pulse
      oximeter oxygen saturation, and from Epworth scale. UA morphology from CT, globally and by
      specific locations, through lengths, volumes, areas, dimensions, and other measurements. DCF
      aspects from RFP and LTC, by Ricketts cephalometric basic analysis and facial aesthetics
      test. Statistical, descriptive analysis of frequencies and comparative by pairs of
      quantitative data will be by t-Student or Wilcoxon test, after checking the variables
      normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      H0: Upper-airway (UA) morphology does not change as a consequence of maxilla-mandibular
      advancement (MMA) in patients with moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnoea / hypopnoea
      syndrome (SAHS).

      H1: UA changes as a consequence of MMA in patients with moderate-severe SAHS. To answer this
      hypothesis, the following will be determined: Vertical UA length, volume, axial areas,
      ellipticity, uniformity, prevertebral soft tissue (PST) and soft palate (SP) lengths and
      position of the hyoid bone.

      As secondary hypotheses:

      H0: Clinical outcomes of MMA in moderate-severe SAHS are not successful. H1: Clinical
      outcomes of MMA in moderate-severe SAHS are successful. To answer, the apnoea / hypopnoea
      index (AHI), pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SPO2) and daytime sleepiness will be
      determined.

      H0: DCF morphology is unfavourable as a result of MMA in moderate-severe SAHS. H1: DCF
      morphology is not unfavourable as a result of MMA in moderate-severe SAHS.

      To answer, the parameters of the Ricketts cephalometric basic analysis will be quantified and
      interpreted, and the patient's self-perception will be assessed.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Specify and quantify morphological changes in key anatomical locations of the UA by computed
      tomography (CT), in terms of vertical lengths, volumes, areas, axial dimensions, and other
      measurements. These changes happen after MMA surgery in patients diagnosed with
      moderate-severe SAHS from a representative cohort. We are intended to demonstrate:
      shortening, increase in volume and areas, more elliptical and uniform shape, modifications of
      PST and SP and more anterior-superior hyoid bone position.

      As secondary objectives, inherent to the treatment received, it is first intended to
      determine and evaluate clinical outcomes: objectively by PSG, and subjectively by the Epworth
      scale. Secondary, it is intended to specify and quantify changes in DCF morphology:
      objectively by a two-dimensional cephalometric analysis from lateral teleradiography of the
      cranium (LTC) and right face profile picture (RFP), and subjectively by a non-validated
      facial aesthetics test (FAT).

        1. DESIGN:

           Observational retrospective-prospective study, which does not make any modification of
           the usual clinical practice (surgical indication criteria, procedures, examinations,
           surgical techniques...), of: clinical outcomes, UA morphology, and DCF aspects of SAHS
           patients undergoing MMA.

             -  Logistic and organizational process for the participants: Explanations, invitation
                to participate, resolution of doubts, delivery of written information sheet and
                informed consent, collection of them and FAT. Everything will be done in two
                face-to-face clinic consultations that are already part of the usual work protocol
                of the Maxillofacial Surgery department of our hospital for patients with SAHS. It
                is estimated that it only involves about 10-15 minutes per consultation of extra
                time, without the need of additional specific appointments for the present study.
                With regard to clinical history, complementary examinations and surgical procedure,
                nothing additional is required regarding the usual workflow for SAHS patients in
                our department.

             -  Logistic and organizational process for researchers: It is based on office and
                digital work, without biological samples.

        2. PARTICIPANTS:

           Population sample are patients treated in a single centre: Maxillofacial Surgery
           department, &quot;Hospital de Cruces&quot;. The time period of the retrospective aspect is from
           01/01/2012 to 02/25/2020, the date of acceptance by the regional ethics committee of
           clinical investigation &quot;CEIC OSI Exkerraldea-Enkarterri-Cruces&quot;. The time period of the
           prospective aspect is from that date until 01/31/2021.

           Inclusion criteria are: ≥18 years-old, diagnosis by PSG of moderate-severe SAHS in
           supine position, approval of the surgical indication by the multidisciplinary sleep
           committee of our hospital, written informed consent (IC) of photography or image
           recording, orthognathic surgery program inclusion and facial deformity surgery. In
           addition, previous information and indispensable with the facial deformity IC signed and
           delivered, the patient must grant the specific IC for inclusion in the present study.

           Regarding the retrospective cohort, in a face-to-face appointment of scheduled
           outpatient consultation, the patient will be explained and invited to participate in
           this study. Questions will be resolved and the specific IC and information sheet (for
           the retrospective cohort) of the study will be delivered for reading. In other
           consultation, specific IC will be signed if the patient accepts participation and more
           doubts will be resolved if they arise. The time between the two consultations will be at
           least one week.

           Regarding the prospective cohort, having previously granted the signed facial deformity
           surgery IC, either in scheduled outpatient consultation or in team session, the patient
           will be explained and invited to participate in this study. Questions will be resolved
           and the specific IC and information sheet (for the prospective cohort) of the study will
           be delivered for reading. In other consultation, specific IC will be signed if the
           patient accepts participation and more doubts will be resolved if they arise. The time
           between the two appointments will be at least one week and must be before having
           performed the MMA surgery. Refusing to participate will not have any change or
           involvement in the treatment and monitoring of the patient (techniques, complementary
           examinations, clinical appointments…).

           Exclusion criteria are: pregnant woman, central SAHS, medical-surgical history (trauma,
           tumour, major congenital craniofacial deformity) that significantly alter the normal UA
           anatomy, different orthognathic surgery than MMA and inconclusive / incomplete tests and
           data.

           ≥90% of men are expected in the sample with respect to the gender perspective; ≥90% with
           age range 30-59 years-old; ≤10% extreme weights; 40% without facial deformity or
           malocclusion; and 25% with complementary surgeries with added impact on UA at the same
           time of the MMA., A sample size of 40 subjects is estimated, compiling previous studies
           and the Granmo® calculator. This would achieve significant statistics in all the
           parameters considered to answer the main hypothesis, and most of the secondary ones.

           The Declaration of Helsinki code of medical ethics for research in human beings will be
           taken into account, protecting the health of the participant, being voluntary the
           inclusion, interrupting the investigation if it can be detrimental to the well-being of
           the participant and agreement of confidentiality in the IC. The &quot;CEIC OSI
           Exkerraldea-Enkarterri-Cruces&quot; committee has approved the study (Code CEIC E19/39).

        3. VARIABLES:

           For the collection of pre- / postoperative data we will use the following medical tests:
           Clinical history, scale / test (Epworth and FAT) and complementary calibrated and
           standardized examinations (PSG, CT, RFP and LTC). The pre- must have been made 3 months
           before the MMA and the post- 3 months after it. A &quot;data collection sheet&quot;, coded by a
           number in chronological order by the date of the surgery, will be done for each
           participant. All these data will be non-identifying and collected in an Excel® file,
           called SAHS-2. The code of each patient can only be related to their medical history and
           other alphanumeric data in a different encrypted Excel® file, called SAHS-1, to maintain
           confidentiality. Only the principal investigator will have access and the SAHS-1
           password.

           Identifying data of the patient are: name, surname, hospital history number, dates
           (recruitment, birth, surgery, PSG pre- / post-, Epworth pre- / post-, CT pre- / post,
           RFP pre- / post-, LTC pre- / post-, FAT).

           General data to be collected are: code, informed consent (yes / no), cohort
           (retrospective / prospective). As background: age (in years-old); ethnicity (white /
           pacific islander / latino / black / asian / american indian); sex (male / female),
           weight (in kg), height (in m), body mass index (kg/m^2), Angle class (I / II / III),
           Mallampati scale(I / II / III / IV)). As planning movements: anterior advancement at the
           central superior incisor (in mm), vertical movement measured at the same place (in mm),
           posterior vertical movement at the upper right and left first molar (in mm). As other
           data: previous UA related surgery (septoplasty, adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy,
           uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion...), simultaneous
           UA related surgery (genioplasty, genioglossus advancement...), repositioning system,
           follow-up timing), complications (intraoperative, short-, medium-, long-term).

           Clinical outcomes will be evaluated from PSG using AHI (global, supine and lateral),
           apnoea number (obstructive, central, mixed), hypopnoea number, and SPO2 (mean, basal and
           minimum); and from the daytime sleepiness Epworth scale (0 to 24).

           UA morphology will be evaluated from CT scans, globally and by compartments:
           retropalatal (RP), retro-glossal (RG) and hypopharynx (HPh). The axial series in digital
           imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) format is imported into the measurement
           software. Coronal, sagittal and three-dimensional reconstructions are performed
           automatically. The working skull is oriented manually with anatomical references:
           nasopalatine duct, odontoid apophysis, crista galli, anterior nasal spine (ANS) and
           posterior (PNS), most antero-inferior point of the second cervical vertebra (AIC2). The
           main planes are defined in a midsagittal section: the hard palate (HP) (ANS-PNS) and the
           perpendicular plane that passes through AIC2. The compartments are delimited by planes
           parallel to HP plane that pass through the uvula tip (UT), epiglottis tip (ET) and the
           inferior edge of the hyoid bone (IEHB). Vertical longitudinal measurements (in mm) are
           taken parallel to the AIC2 plane: total, RP, RG, HPh and summation. Air volume (in mm^3)
           is delimited by antero-posterior-lateral soft tissues: total, RP, RG, HPh and summation.
           Areas (in mm^2) are measured in axial slices: HP plane, parallel UT, ET, IEHB and
           minimum. Anteroposterior and transverse dimensions, understood as maximum continuous
           length in the same axial slices of the areas, are taken. Other horizontal lengths,
           parallel to the HP plane and from the AIC2 one, are registered: PST and antero-inferior
           hyoid bone point. Also, the soft palate length is measured. Average area, ellipticity,
           uniformity and vertical length correction formulas are applied.

           The DCF parameters will be evaluated from the RFP and LTC, using the Ricketts basic
           cephalometric analysis. They are imported in jpg format the software measure, calibrate
           and merge them. The following cephalometric points are marked: sella, nasion (Na),
           basion (Ba), orbital, porion, pterion, ANS, PNS, A, B, pogonion, chin protrusion, chin,
           gonion, gnathion, condylion, upper and lower incisor apex, upper and lower incisor root,
           occlusal of molars, glabella, soft Na, nasal eminence, columella, subnasal, soft A, soft
           B, chin-tangent, chin eminence, soft gnathion and soft chin. The points of the condyle
           neck and mandibular ramus centre (Xi) are drawn automatically; and the following
           cephalometric planes: occlusal, Frankfurt, facial, mandibular, facial axis, mandibular
           body axis, condylar axis, Ba-Na line, Na-A line, dental line, Xi-ANS line, pterygoid
           vertical, upper and lower central incisor axis and Ricketts E line. Cephalometric
           factors are automatically obtained. In the mandibular area are: facial axis angle (in
           grades), facial depth (in grades), mandibular plane angle (in grades), lower facial
           height (in mm), mandibular arch (in grades). In the maxillary area: facial convexity (in
           mm), maxillary depth (in grades). In the dental area: incisor protrusion (in mm),
           inclination (in grades), extrusion (in mm), interincisal angle (in grades) and upper
           molar position (in mm). In the aesthetic area: labial protrusion (in mm).

           DCF morphology will also be assessed by the patient itself subjectively, from the FAT
           with the following items: general satisfaction (none / little / ok / a lot of)
           modifications perceived by the patient itself (much worse / worse / no changes / better
           / much better), modifications perceived by family members and friends (much worse /
           worse / no changes / better / much better), smile (much worse / worse / no changes /
           better / much better), face rejuvenation (older / no changes / younger) and face
           slimness (bulkier / no changes / slimmer).

        4. DATA ANALYSIS:

           All qualitative and quantitative non-identifying data will be coded and sorted in an
           Excel® table, mark as SAHS-2. Once exported to the statistical analysis software, we
           will analyze the qualitative and continuous quantitative variables in categorical
           variables. Descriptive statistics of frequencies will be calculated. For statistical
           inference, only comparisons are made between two continuous variables, all dependent and
           paired (pre- / post-). To verify that the variables follow a normal distribution, the
           Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic will be used. The comparisons will then be made with the
           t-Student test for two dependent samples or the Wilcoxon ranks test if they do not
           follow a normal distribution. Statistically significant results will be considered if p
           ˂0.05.

        5. STUDY LIMITATIONS:

      In terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the women representation will be too little to
      stratify by gender. Other ages different form the fourth-fifth decades and the prospective
      cohort will be too small as well to analyze independently. Additional surgeries at the same
      time of the MMA overestimate the favourable impact on UA and DCF outcomes.

      As an observational study, it is not possible to perform randomization, since all
      participants undergo the same MMA surgery. There is hardly any possibility of applying
      blinding. Surgical planning, clinical examination for the study (PSG, CT, LTC, RFP, Epworth),
      even the surgical act itself, are externally protocolized from the study, with its inherent
      acquisition and execution errors. UA and cephalometric measurements cannot be blinded to the
      researcher, since the evidence betrays which cases are pre- or post- due to the presence of
      osteosynthesis material. There are other measurement automatic methods, other references and
      also valid measures that have not been considered, as in the nasal cavity or the nasopharynx
      space. The statistical analysis cannot be blinded because the intervention is the same in all
      cases and is performed independently pre- / post- to compare them afterwards.

      There are also inherent errors in computer algorithms for measurements and statistical
      analysis, especially in those that are not open-access.
