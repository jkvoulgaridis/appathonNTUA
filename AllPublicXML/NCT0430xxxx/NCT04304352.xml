    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study assessing the activity and safety of metronomic chemotherapy with
      cyclophosphamide and capecitabine and vinorelbine in advanced breast cancer patient in four
      different cohort of patients:

        1. Untreated (naïve) patients with endocrine responsive disease

        2. Pretreated patients with endocrine responsive disease

        3. Untreated (naïve) patients with triple negative disease

        4. Pretreated patients with triple negative disease The primary endpoint will be the
           progression-free survival

      This is an institutional, monocentric, open-label, phase II study of oral &quot;metronomic&quot;
      Vinorelbine plus Capecitabine and Cyclophosphamide (VEX) in patients with advanced breast
      cancer .

      Patients will receive the combination regimen as follow:

      Cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily Capecitabine 500 mg, thrice daily Vinorelbine 40 mg orally
      thrice a week

      Four independent cohorts of patients will be evaluated in the study:

        1. Untreated (naïve) patients with endocrine responsive disease

        2. Pretreated patients with endocrine responsive disease

        3. Untreated (naïve) patients with triple negative disease

        4. Pretreated patients with triple negative disease Combination will be administered until
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      The primary endpoint will be to assess the Time to progression (TTP) of VEX combination in
      the four different cohorts

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre- or post-menopausal women (age ≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically
             (cell block) proven, locally advanced (inoperable) or metastatic breast carcinoma.

             human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and epidermal growth factor receptor
             (EGFR) according to European Institute of Oncology guidelines is mandatory.

          2. Patients with HER2 overexpressed tumors, are eligible if they had received previous
             trastuzumab therapy for advanced disease, and/or a treatment with anti HER2 targeted
             therapy.

          3. Patients fulfilling one of the following criteria:

               -  Patients with measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1 criteria. This is defined as
                  at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension
                  (longest diameter to be recorded) as 20 mm with conventional techniques or as 10
