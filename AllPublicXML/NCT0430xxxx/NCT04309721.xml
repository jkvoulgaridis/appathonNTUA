    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial on focal motor status epilepticus (SE), studying the add-on
      efficacy of the enteral administration of perampanel (PER) to a conventional intravenous
      antiepileptic drug.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of the use of various antiepileptic drugs, the SE, generalized or focal, are
      refractory to the treatment in around 25 % of the cases. There is therefore a need to develop
      new therapy with novel synaptic targets.

      New antiepileptic drugs emerge as potential drugs for SE. Perampanel (PER) is a new drug
      available for add-on therapy in patients with a focal epilepsy. The mechanism of action of
      this drug is original, as it is a non-competitive
      α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist. Several studies
      suggested that AMPA-mediated glutamatergic transmission plays an important rule during the
      SE.

      In this study the investigator will focus on patients suffering from early focal motor SE,
      for several reasons:

      (i) There is no randomized controlled double-blind trial in this population, and therefore no
      evidence to help physicians.

      (ii) The investigator aims to perform a trial on early SE, after failure of only one drug (a
      benzodiazepine, recommended as first line treatment), in order to properly evaluate the
      effect of the tested drug (add-on of perampanel).

      (iii) The perampanel is available only for oral administration. Focal SE usually does not
      affect the vital prognosis and can be treated less aggressively. Use of oral loading doses of
      antiepileptic drugs is frequent, and therapies may be changed or adapted in the time-frame of
      hours or days.

      (iv) Patients with a focal SE, presenting motor symptoms, can be included without the need of
      an EEG. Similarly, the primary end-point, cessation of the motor events, does not require
      specific exam, and can also be done clinically.

    <description>Test add-on efficacy of enteral administration of perampanel (versus placebo) to the conventional second line intravenous antiepileptic drug, on seizure cessation, measured within the 2 and 3 hours after administration (between H2 and H3), in benzodiazepine-resistant focal motor status epilepticus:
cessation is defined clinically by the absence or cessation between H2 and H3 of any epileptic movements (clonic, tonic or myoclonic)
once the seizures stop, no seizure recurrence should be observed during at least 60 minutes. Recurrence is defined by reappearance of epileptic movements. For instance, if seizures stops at H2+30mn, no reappearance of epileptic movements should occur before H3+30mn to be qualified as seizure cessation within H2 to H3
without the use of an additional second line intravenous antiepileptic drug between H0 and H3. The first conventional antiepileptic drug scheduled after the administration of perampanel or placebo is not an additional antiepileptic drug</description>
