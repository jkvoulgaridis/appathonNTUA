  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate whether use of a pedometer following radical cystectomy decreases
      post-operative narcotic use and time to return of bowel function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled prospective study looking at the effect of using a pedometer
      with graduated step-count goals following radical cystectomy on rate of ileus, return of
      bowel function and post-operative narcotic use. Subjects will be randomized into a control
      group or study group. The control group will receive standard of care, with information
      provided regarding the importance of ambulation following surgery. The study group will
      receive a pedometer with graduated step-count goals from post-operative day 0 to
      post-operative day 21. Both groups will be given a standardized post-operative narcotic
      regimen, and will be asked to record initial passage of flatus and first bowel movement.
      Subjects will remain on the study until post-operative day 21.
