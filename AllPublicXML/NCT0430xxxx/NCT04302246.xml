    <textblock>
      Post-operative care following liver transplantation is characterized by a high incidence of
      infective and immunological complications. Restauration of liver function following liver
      transplantation is progressive and characterize a period of immuno-infective vulnerability.
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the early post-operative immune function in
      children after liver transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within a few decades, liver transplantation has become an effective treatment of end-stage
      liver diseases associated with high spontaneous mortality. However, the consequences of
      immediate transplants are frequently complicated by infective (nosocomial infection) and
      immunological complications (acute graft rejection) in up to 40 to 60% of liver transplanted
      patients. In order to ensure graft immunotolerance, immunosuppressive therapy based mainly on
      calcineurin inhibitors, is initiated soon after liver transplantation. Immunosuppressive
      therapy is intended to reduce the response of cytotoxic lymphocytes and NK cells. As a
      result, an important component of the immune response is blocked. In addition, function of
      the transplanted liver, which is a key organ for both immuno-inflammatory signalling and host
      defense against pathogens, is progressively restored post-operatively. Thus in this
      post-transplant period, there is a critical period where liver function is severly impaired
      and progressively get restaured. The aim of this study is to characterize the restauration of
      immune function in the early post-operative period and evaluate its correlation with
      occurence of infective or immunological complications.
