  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Befriending services deliver companionship to older adults through regular volunteer visits.
      ALONE is a charitable organisation providing befriending services to older adults in Ireland.
      It is the mission statement of ALONE to use befriending to reduce the negative impact
      loneliness has on health, but evidence for this use of befriending is yet to be sufficiently
      provided. Providing such evidence would help organisations like ALONE to convince
      policymakers of the need for, and importance of, their services. The research uses a rigorous
      scientific approach to evaluate the effect of befriending services on health. Two domains of
      health thought to be particularly important for ageing adults are evaluated: health-related
      quality of life (HrQoL), and cognitive function. Maximising HrQoL should be a goal of any
      healthcare intervention, while cognitive function is associated with dementia risk, a major
      factor threatening independence in later life. The research is also investigating whether
      befriending can reduce the negative effect that loneliness is known to have on health of
      older adults. Service users, befriending volunteers, and professionals involved with the
      service, will be interviewed by researchers, to see if there are other ways that befriending
      might improve health. An economic analysis of the service, to evaluate its cost, is also
      planned. Findings will then be translated all findings into befriending service
      recommendations for the Department of Health.

      To conduct this research, 85 new befriending service users are needed. 10-15 pairs of
      befriender-befriendees will also be interviewed, and 5-10 health and social care
      professionals involved with the service. Expected outcomes are to provide ALONE with
      scientific evidence related to the effects of befriending services on health, and to
      influence policymakers by clarifying the extent of the economic and health benefits of
      befriending services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Loneliness is related to poor health in later life. One way in which loneliness
      is often addressed is via befriending services, such as those offered by ALONE. The mission
      statement of ALONE's befriending service is to reduce the impact of loneliness on poor
      health. ALONE have identified a need for an empirical evaluation of the potential benefits of
      befriending services. Aims: The proposed research aims to create empirical evidence regarding
      the impact of befriending services on health and loneliness, assisting ALONE in developing
      and refining their mission statement. The research question is: &quot;Do befriending services
      improve health (measured as health-related quality of life and cognitive function), and do
      they mitigate the impact of loneliness on health?&quot; A secondary aim is to identify, using
      exploratory methods, potential mechanisms through which befriending impacts health.

      Plan of Investigation: A mixed methods design, integrating qualitative and quantitative
      methods, is planned.

      The quantitative component comprises an AB single-case experimental multiple baseline design,
      analysed using generalised additive modelling, and the qualitative component comprises
      semi-structured interviews (with befriender-befriendee dyads and healthcare professionals
      associated with the service) designed and analysed according to the principles of grounded
      theory. Results will be integrated according to mixed methods guidelines, undergo
      triangulation, and an economic analysis will evaluate the cost should the service be rolled
      out nationally. All results will be integrated to form the basis of recommendations for the
      befriending sector, to be disseminated to policymakers. Results will also be disseminated via
      peer-reviewed publication and lay report.

      Potential Impact: The study has potential to improve the service offered by ALONE by
      empirically testing its effectiveness and mechanisms of action, influence policy with this
      information, and contribute to theoretical understanding of the nature of the relationship
      between befriending, loneliness, and health.

    <description>An AB single-case experimental design will be used. An RCT would be inappropriate since the befriending intervention is known to improve wellbeing. As such participants will have data collected in a pre- and post-intervention phase, for a maximum of 13 time points. This approach has been identified by What Works Clearinghouse as an acceptable empirical design to include in evidence based practice reviews (Kratchowill et al., 2010).</description>
