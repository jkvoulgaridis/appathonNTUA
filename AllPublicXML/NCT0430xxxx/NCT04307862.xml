  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, double blind study with ZEP-3NA 0.1% or 1% vs. vehicle-control in
      subjects with mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis. The IP will be administered topically twice
      daily for 12 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two
      concentrations of ZEP-3NA compared to vehicle-control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      165 subjects, 5-75 years old with mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis will be enrolled to the
      study.

      The investigational product which is the synthetic analogue of the natural compound found in
      the rattle snake venom will be administered topically twice daily.

      The duration of the study will be up to 17 weeks consisting of up to 3 weeks of screening, 12
      weeks of treatment, followed by 2 weeks of follow-up.

      Efficacy will be measured by IGA, EASI and SCORAD. Lesions will be photographed throughout
      the study. Physical examination and vital signs will be measured during every visit. Patients
      will complete quality of life questionnaires, itching scale and diaries.

          1. Male or female 5 to 75 years old, inclusive.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of Atopic Dermatitis (as defined by Hanifin and Rajka criteria).

          3. Atopic Dermatitis should be present for at least three months with stable disease for
             ≥ 1 month prior to screening.

          4. Total Body Surface Area (BSA) of Atopic Dermatitis involving minimum 20 cm2 for
             children and 40 cm2 for adults (excluding the scalp area) during screening.

          5. IGA score of 2 or 3 (mild or moderate) during screening and baseline.

          6. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             screening and use an adequate contraceptive method throughout the study. Males with
             partners of childbearing potential should inform them of their participation in this
             clinical study and use an adequate contraceptive method throughout the study.

          7. Willing and able to comply with study instructions and commit to attending all visits.

          8. The patient/parent/guardian has the ability to understand, agree to and sign the study

             years old should be willing and able to sign Assent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unstable or actively infected atopic dermatitis.

             dermatitis, psoriasis, etc.) or other medical condition(s) which may interfere with
             the investigator's ability to evaluate the subject's response to study drug.

          3. Patients with Atopic Dermatitis affecting only the scalp will be excluded from the
             study. In addition, patients with the scalp representing ≥ 25% of the affected area

             opinion, could affect the subject's atopic dermatitis (e.g Antihistamines). Subjects
             using such medications and have been stable on treatment for at least one month prior
             to study entry and no changes to these medications are planned during study, may be

             the study, at the investigator's discretion.

         12. History of immunodeficiency syndrome (e.g. atypical rash morphology, FTT, serve
             bacterial, fungal or viral skin infections, etc).

         13. Subjects who are receiving any investigational drug or who participated in a clinical
             trial with an investigational product within the last 30 days or 5-half-lives of the
             investigational product, whichever is longer.

         14. History of any anaphylactic reaction or history or evidence of allergies requiring
             acute or chronic treatment (except seasonal allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis).

         15. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the study drug.

         16. Known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse.
