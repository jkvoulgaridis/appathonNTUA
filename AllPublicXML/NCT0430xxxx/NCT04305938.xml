  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Kaligia Biosciences KBS Systems 1.0(b) analyte monitoring device is to
      measure the blood analyte levels in patients. The KBS Systems 1.0(b) device avoids the common
      practice of accessing the vein to draw blood for conventional laboratory analysis. Instead,
      the KBS Systems 1.0(b) device uses Raman Spectroscopy to acheive the measurement of various
      blood analytes through the use of only approximately 40Âµl of blood. Such a small volume of
      blood can be sampled via a finger prick procedure rather than needing a larger volume of
      blood sampled via a venipuncture. The spectra contain information of all the molecules
      present in the blood (RBCs, hemoglobin, glucose, sodium, potassium, etc.). From these
      spectra, the system is able to analyze the blood and provide results in a matter of minutes,
      rather than hours or even, in some cases, days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults &gt; 18 yrs of age.

          -  Willingness and ability to provide informed consent

          -  Hospital patients with a physician-prescribed laboratory blood test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. People with clotting factor disorders and/or currently taking anticoagulation
             medication.

          2. Has any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             interfere with the person's participation in this study (i.e. double arm amputee).

          3. Any skin abnormalities or tattoos located on the palm(s) of the hand(s). The left palm
             is preferred for this study; however, the right palm can be used if the left palm is
             excluded.

          4. Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia, tremors, or similar that may make it challenging for
             said person to hold their hand on the device in a still and stable manner.
