      The proposed parallel-group randomized controlled trial add-on superiority of the iCBT-I
      program with CAU as a control condition will let us investigate the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of iCBT-I. Analysis of baseline characteristics of the participants aims
      to find predictors of outcome

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Application of internet-delivered cognitive-behavior treatment for insomnia (iCBT-I) is a
      perspective method that can fill the gap created by the discrepancy between insomnia cases
      and the number of trained professionals. Although the effectiveness of this method was proven
      in multiple studies conducted in research settings, it is unclear if iCBT-I outperforms
      pharmacotherapy which remains a widely used alternative of cognitive-behavior therapy of
      insomnia (CBT-I). Predictors, mediators, and moderators of treatment effect remain uncertain
      since previous studies often give contradictory results. The present study aims to
      investigate clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an internet-based CBT-I program
      Sleepsy in comparison with care as usual (CAU) among patients with chronic insomnia (CI)
      recruited from clinical settings. Baseline data will be further analyzed to find predictors
      of treatment outcome

      For these purposes, a parallel-group randomized controlled trial add-on superiority of the
      iCBT-I program with CAU as a control condition was designed. 110 participants will be
      referred from the medical doctors in Moscow. Both groups will have access to CAU, treatment
      prescribed by the referred doctor. Patients of the first group will additionally get access
      to the iCBT-I program with the opportunity to contact a specialist within the program
      (guidance on request) in a secured environment. The primary outcome is insomnia severity
      change from pre- to posttreatment and to post-follow-up. Secondary outcomes include change
      subjective sleep characteristics, daytime symptoms, comorbid affective disorders,
      dysfunctional cognitions and behavior, healthcare consumption, and productivity losses.
      Predictors analysis will include baseline scores of the aforementioned outcomes along with
      treatment expectancies, personality traits

      To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first study of iCBT-I to be conducted
      in clinical settings. We expect that this approach lets us determine the target group more
      precisely and exclude health problems that may interfere with treatment. It is also expected
      that patients, referred to iCBT-I from the doctor's office will be more motivated to finish
      the treatment course that will reduce the drop out rate. CAU as control condition let us
      reconstruct clinical situation facing practicing doctor. On the other hand, CAU may result in
      a loss of power to detect a meaningful difference. Limitation of our study is in the
      impossibility of blinding participants to the treatment condition

The total score is interpreted as follows: absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28)</description>

    <time_frame>pre- to post-treatment 2 months, pre- to post-follow-up 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of iCBT-I. The first part of TIC-P consists of 14 questions on the volume of health care uptake: including the number of medical consultations, dose, and frequency of medication, days of inpatient care. Multiplication of these data by the actual price of medical help produces the cost of medical care as the outcome. The higher outcome represents higher costs of medical care</description>

    <time_frame>pre- to post-treatment 2 months, pre- to post-follow-up 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of iCBT-I. The second part of TIC-P is represented by the Short Form- Health and Labour Questionnaire (SF-HLQ), an instrument to collect data on productivity losses (presenteeism and absenteeism) due to health problems. Costs of productivity losses are calculated by multiplication of missed working hours by standard cost price of productivity. The higher outcome represents higher costs of productivity losses</description>

    <measure>Success expectancy</measure>
    <time_frame>Once at baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Aims to measure patients' beliefs about the expected treatment success as one of the important outcome predictors. For its evaluation we will use one adapted question of Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire: &quot;At this point, how successfully do you think this treatment will be in reducing your insomnia symptoms?&quot; at scale from 1 to 9. This question was chosen as well representing high correlation for both factors: credibility and expectancy, and most logically formulated for the intended purpose</description>

    <measure>User satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>After completion of iCBT-I course: week 8 after randomization for arm iCBT-I +CAU; week 28 after randomization for arm CAU</time_frame>
    <description>feedback questionnaire developed for this study. It includes 1 question about satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the treatment with a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 (very poor/not at all useful) to 5 (very, good/very useful).
The questionnaire also contains open questions aiming for utilitarian goals, i.e. to improve the program (possible negative effects of the intervention if any: deterioration of insomnia symptoms, adverse effects, novel symptoms; and about improvement suggestions, what participants liked most if they would recommend it to a friend with insomnia). These questions are not included in questionnaire score</description>

    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>After completion of iCBT-I course: week 8 after randomization for arm iCBT-I +CAU; week 28 after randomization for arm CAU</time_frame>
    <description>10-item non-specific questionnaire used to collect a user's subjective rating of a product's (products, websites, applications, hardware, or software) usability and learnability. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (&quot;strongly Disagree&quot;) to 4 (&quot;strongly Agree&quot;). For positively-worded items (1, 3, 5, 7 and 9), the score contribution is the scale position minus 1. For negatively-worded items (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10), it is 5 minus the scale position. To get the overall SUS score, multiply the sum of the item score contributions by 2.5. Thus, SUS scores range from 0 to 100 in 2.5-point increments. Higher SUS score reflects better subjective usability of the program.</description>

    <description>The 2-month intervention consists of educational material divided into 8 modules, which provide the rationale for the CBT-I interventions: sleep restriction; stimulus control; cognitive techniques; relaxation techniques. Information is presented in 10-minute videolectures.
The program includes a sleep diary to insert bedtime and waketime, sleep latency, total sleep time, night awakenings.
All material will be delivered through the internet program and expected to be elaborated by the patient but with the opportunity to contact a specialist via the feedback form (guidance on request) in a secured environment if they face difficulties or possible negative effects of the intervention. The content of the program is based on an already established internet-based self-help program against insomnia that was already tested in a previous study.</description>
