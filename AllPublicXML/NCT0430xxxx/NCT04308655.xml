  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a mixed methods longitudinal observational study to assess patient and provider
      perspectives on pain and pain management among pregnant women with opiate use disorder (OUD).
      The findings from this study will inform patient-centered approaches to pain management.
      Themes surrounding mothers' pain/recovery experiences that correlate with quantified pain and
      analgesia endpoints will be identified. Findings will also shape an appropriate
      patient-centered research agenda for obstetric pain management in patients with OUD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A fine understanding of the attitudes and beliefs about pain and its management for patients
      with opioid use disorder is currently lacking. These psychological aspects of pain and
      analgesia are expected to have significant effects on nociception, pain experience, analgesic
      efficacy, and opioid requirements and its subsequent risks for relapse/treatment
      noncompliance. There is also have little understanding of provider-held attitudes and beliefs
      which can influence pain and its treatment for this population.

      The findings from this study will inform patient-centered approaches to pain management for
      obstetric patients with OUD. They will also shape an appropriate patient-centered research
      agenda for obstetric pain management in patients with OUD. This work will find new
      patient-centered endpoints for this special population that may be currently overlooked with
      existing standard pain assessments.
