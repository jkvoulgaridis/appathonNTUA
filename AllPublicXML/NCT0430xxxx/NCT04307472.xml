      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of nudges to clinicians, patients, or
      both to initiate statin prescriptions for patients that meet national guidelines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Statins
      have been demonstrated to be an effective tool for reducing the risk of CVD-related events
      and mortality, but statins are often not prescribed for patients that meet evidence-based
      guidelines. In this study, the investigators will evaluate nudges to clinicians, patients, or
      both to initiate statin prescriptions for patients that meet the United States Preventive
      Task Force guidelines, patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
      condition, and patients with a history of familial hyperlipidemia. In partnership with the
      health system, this will be conducted as a 4-arm factorial, cluster randomized trial to
      evaluate the effect of the interventions.

    <intervention_model_description>The four-arm factorial trial will randomly assign primary care practices to one of the following arms for the intervention:
Control
Clinician nudge using an active choice prompt in the electronic health record at the time of the patient visit and a monthly peer comparison message on statin prescribing performance relative to peer clinicians at Penn Medicine delivered through the electronic health record
Patient nudge using a mailed letter sent 1-2 weeks before the primary care clinician appointment that informs them of their eligibility for a statin, the risks and benefits, and asking them to discuss the role of starting a statin with their clinician
Both clinician nudge and patient nudges.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Investigators, statisticians, and analysts will be blinded during the intervention and analysis. Study staff (project director, manager, and research coordinators) will be unblinded throughout the study in order to deliver the appropriate interventions and to manage participant communications. The project manager will be tasked with maintaining codes to associate the blinded assignments to the clinical practices.</masking_description>

    <description>The clinician nudge using an active choice intervention in the electronic health record will be delivered to the clinician during the patient's visit. This will be through a Best Practice Advisory that describes the guideline criteria for which the patient is eligible for statin therapy, provides pre-selected options for a statin with alternative options.
The clinician nudge using monthly peer comparison messages will be sent as an inbox message through the electronic health record. Clinicians will be told what percent of their eligible patients have been prescribed a statin and how that compares to peer clinicians at Penn Medicine.</description>

    <description>The patient nudge will be mailed letter. Patients with a visit scheduled with their primary care clinician will be identified and sent this letter about 2-3 weeks before their visit. The letter will remind them of the visit, inform them of their eligibility for a statin, describe the benefits and risks of statin therapy, and ask the patient to discuss statin therapy with their primary care clinician during the visit.</description>
