  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to prove similar efficacy of PE/rATG (intervention) and PE/rATG/IVIG (centre
      standard of care) induction regimens to prevent biopsy proven antibody-mediated changes and
      TCMR as composite endpoint within 12 months after HLA incompatible kidney transplantation.

      There have been no published clinical studies evaluating rATG/IVIG induction protocol in
      comparison with rATG alone in defined cohort of HLA incompatible kidney transplant
      recipients. Prescribing IVIG in management of prevention of transplant rejection is
      considered off-label use, however IVIG remains part of induction protocols in many transplant
      centres. IVIG therapy is demanding due to high cost and limited resources of these human
      origin products. Trial participants will be end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients listed
      for deceased donor / living donor kidney transplantation with anti HLA antibody screening
      performed within 12 months before transplantation and with last DSA 1 000 - 5 000 Mean
      Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) and negative CDC (Complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch
      test) prior to transplantation. Participants will be randomized into one of the treatment
      groups (PE/PP(Plasmapheresis) + rATG + IVIG, PE/PP + rATG) and as a primary outcome a
      composite endpoint defined as occurrence of antibody- or T-cell mediated rejection within 12
      months after transplantation will be evaluated.
