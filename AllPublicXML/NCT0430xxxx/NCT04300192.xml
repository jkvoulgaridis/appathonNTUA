      Primary Objectives :

        -  To describe the long-term humoral immune responses to pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus
           after homologous and heterologous pertussis vaccine priming regimens

        -  To determine the effects of the priming regimen on humoral responses to booster
           vaccination with Tdap-IPV vaccine

        -  To describe the long-term cell-mediated immune responses to pertussis after homologous
           and heterologous pertussis vaccine priming regimens

        -  To determine the effects of the priming regimen on cell-mediated immune response to
           booster vaccination with Tdap-IPV vaccine

             prospective participants should not be included in the study until the condition has
             resolved or the febrile event has subsided (temporary contraindication)
