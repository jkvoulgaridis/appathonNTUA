  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project the potential beneficial effect of the drug colchicine on vascular reactivity
      and blood pressure will be assessed. Colchicine is a commonly used anti-inflammatory
      medication approved for the treatment of gout, Familial Mediterranean Fever and pericarditis
      in Denmark. The current project idea is based on accumulating evidence in the literature for
      a beneficial role of colchicine treatment in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in
      parallel with novel mechanistic insight from our own research. Recently, colchicine was
      associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, including reduced myocardial
      infarctions, strokes and acute coronary syndrome . However, none of these trials have
      investigated the effect of colchicine on arterial tone or stiffness, changes to which may
      underlie the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease associated with colchicine. In support of
      the hypothesis that colchicine will improve vascular reactivity, a study in 1985 by Lagrue et
      al. found that daily, low-dose colchicine improved arterial stiffness in a small cohort of
      hypertensive patients. More recently, colchicine was shown to improve arterial stiffness in
      patients with Familial Mediterranean fever supporting a cardiovascular protective role of
      colchicine. Finally, colchicine is also proposed to have anti-inflammatory effects in the
      vascular system.
