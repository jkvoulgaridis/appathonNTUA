  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy of a beginning treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with
      Behavioral Activation (BA). Cambodian men and women who screen positive for PTSD will be
      randomized to receive six individually delivered sessions of either: 1) Stabilization
      Techniques alone (ST); or 2) ST+BA. After two months, all participants who continue to report
      clinically meaningful elevations in PTSD will receive Eye Movement Desensitization
      Reprocessing (EMDR). All participants will complete a follow-up assessment at four months
      post-randomization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of the Cambodian population reports elevated levels of psychological distress and
      PTSD. The high levels of psychological distress are linked directly to the report of remote
      and more recent trauma exposures, the most notable of which is the agrarian political regime
      of the Khmer Rouge during the 1970s, which occurred in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.
      During this period, approximately 1.5 million Cambodian residents died of starvation and
      sickness, 500,000 individuals were executed, and another two million were displaced over the
      course of several years. Political stability took shape in the early 1990s after the
      enactment of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. However, the prior
      violence undermined an already fragile healthcare system, including mental health
      institutions and physicians providing direct patient care.

      The combination of high trauma exposure, sustained conflict, and limited psychiatric capacity
      has created heightened vulnerability for Cambodians, and the need to assist those struggling
      with PTSD. There is a pressing need to reverse this trajectory using novel approaches to
      address mental health needs that are effective and scalable, providing a strong basis to
      conduct the proposed work in Cambodia. In partnership with the Cambodian Department of Mental
      Health and Substance Abuse, Ministry of Health, this NIH-sponsored study will examine the
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy integrating BA into trauma treatment
      that is being delivered by the Mekong Project in Cambodia.

    <description>Participants randomized into ST will receive 6 weekly 1-hour sessions of Stabilization Techniques from a Khmer-speaking mental health professional. Sessions provide an opportunity to improve emotion regulation and provide coping skills for managing symptoms of PTSD.
Participants will complete a follow-up assessment 2 months after randomization in which PTSD symptoms will be re-assessed using the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Those who exhibit a 50% reduction in PTSD symptoms from baseline and no longer meet criteria for PTSD will be designated as responders and will receive no further treatment. Participants who continue to display clinically meaningful elevations in PTSD symptoms (i.e., non-responders) will receive EMDR, which is the standard of care for trauma treatment in Cambodia. EMDR sessions will be delivered by a Khmer-speaking mental health professional.</description>

    <description>The Stabilization Techniques intervention provides an opportunity to improve emotion/affect regulation and coping skills. The overarching goal of these sessions is to introduce different ways of managing emotional distress through imagery and stress reduction techniques. ST sessions focus on providing coping mechanisms for managing important symptoms of PTSD (i.e., hyperarousal, negative emotions, and physical symptoms).</description>

    <description>The Stabilization Techniques with Behavioral Activation intervention includes stabilization techniques as well as sessions targeted at increasing time engaged in physical activities during times outside of the intervention session. Preferred activities are selected by the participant. Strategies to foster engagement in the selected activities will include self-monitoring, structuring and scheduling daily activities, rating the degree of pleasure and accomplishment experienced during engagement in specific daily activities, exploring alternative behaviors related to achieving goals, and using role-play to address specific barriers. Establishing/maintaining routines and behavioral strategies to reduce avoidance and mange negative emotions are emphasized.</description>

    <description>EMDR is an exposure-based treatment that is the standard of care for PTSD delivered by the Mekong Project in Phnom Penh. EMDR utilizes sensory stimulation when participants are engaged in mental processing of traumatic material. EMDR follows a sequential framework targeting 1) past memories, 2) present symptoms, and 3) future actions.</description>
