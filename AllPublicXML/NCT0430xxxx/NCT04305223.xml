  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial. The primary aim of this study is to
      compare the effectiveness of dry needling of myofascial trigger points in the muscles of the
      head and cervical spine in addition to an upper extremity strengthening/stretching exercise
      program compared to a dry needling group alone on pain scores, cervical range of motion, pain
      sensitivity and changes in severity and frequency of pain symptoms in individuals with
      cervicogenic headache.

      This is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial. Eligible participants who agree to enroll
      in the study will be asked to attend four testing sessions. Participants in both groups will
      receive dry needling to the involved head and cervical muscles and the other group, in
      addition to receiving a dry needling intervention, will be instructed in a standard home
      exercise program consisting of strengthening and stretching exercises for the upper quarter.
      All dry needling (using standard clean technique) will be performed by licensed physical
      therapists board certified in orthopaedic physical therapy and having a minimum of 5 years of
      experience treating patient populations with dry needling.

      The aim of this research study is to compare he effectiveness of dry needling alone with dry
      needling and a home exercise program on pain, pain sensitivity, cervical range of motion, and
      changes in the severity and frequency among individuals with headache symptoms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in visual analog score for pain level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1 to 4 post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is reported using a Visual Analog Scale from 0-10 and evaluates the frequency, severity and duration of the pain. Higher score indicates worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain pressure threshold (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1 to 4 post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure algometry is a method described to determine pressure pain threshold (PPT) by applying controlled pressure to a given body point. Measured with a pressure algometer: 0-50 KPa/s (kilopascal/second squared), minimum score representing increased pain to light touch/measuring allodynia.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cervical range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1 to 4 post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Will measure C1-2 Active Range of Motion, min score, 0; max score 50 degrees, lower score more limited (worse outcome).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional outcome measure: Change in neck disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1 to 4 post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Score ranges from 0-50 points: higher scores indicate higher levels of disability; Minimal detectable change (MDC), 5 points.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional outcome measure: Change in headache disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1 to 4 post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Score ranges from 0-72: 0 is no disability, 72 is more severe disability. Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MCID) is 29 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Frequency-Severity-Duration (PFDS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1 to 4 post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>PFSD scale ranges from 1-140 with higher scores indicative of higher disability.
There is a composite score that ranges from 0-140. Higher score correlates with worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a combination of dry needling and upper extremity stretching.
Dry needling in regions of the head and cervical spine will be positioned supine, sidelying or prone with the relevant myofascial trigger points treated using a Seirin L- type 30 mm needle (Seirin America, Inc., Weymouth, MA). The needle will be inserted to a depth no greater than three-quarters length of the needle for 30 seconds using a vertical pistoning technique and then statically up to 5 minutes.
