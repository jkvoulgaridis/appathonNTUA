  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to provide preliminary data to determine if an acute
      increase in airway inflammation, provoked by an inhaled allergen challenge, is associated
      with an increase in microglial activation and may inform whether individuals with asthma, in
      the long-term, are at increased risk for neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and forms of
      dementia. Though in the long-term airway inflammation may be associated with
      neurodegenerative processes, these changes reflect the accumulation over a lifetime of
      allergen exposures and disease-related changes. This relationship between peripheral
      inflammation and microglial activation is analogous to the impact of sleep loss. No single
      night of poor sleep will lead to long-term change in brain structure, function, or cognitive
      function, but the accumulation of frequent and repeated sleep loss over a lifetime has been
      shown to have a major impact. These data will be used for a larger scale study to determine
      if asthma is a risk factor for neurodegeneration, and will inform brain health issues in
      asthma more broadly.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of Neuroinflammation measured by TSPO observed via PET scan</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 9 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators propose that, in subjects with asthma, provocation of airway inflammation activates microglia, indicative of a neuroinflammatory signal. The hypothesis is that microglial activation will occur following an inhaled allergen challenge, relative to pre-challenge. Activation of microglia will be measured using positron emission tomography (PET) with the radiotracer [18F]FEPPA, a tracer selective for translocator protein (TSPO) binding, which is elevated in activated microglia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intensity of Airway Response measured by Exhaled Nitric Oxide Level</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 11 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators propose that a more intense airway inflammatory response, created by the inhaled allergen challenge, will be associated with a greater increase in microglial activation. The hypothesis is that the increase in markers of airway inflammation, such as exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) will be positively associated with the increase in microglial activation. Exhaled nitric oxide level will be determined using the Niox VERO instrumentation to measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). The test requires the participant to exhale into the mouthpiece of the FeNO measuring instrument for approximately 10 seconds.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intensity of Airway Response measured by Sputum Eosinophil Count</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators propose that a more intense airway inflammatory response, created by the inhaled allergen challenge, will be associated with a greater increase in microglial activation. The hypothesis is that the increase in markers of airway inflammation, such as sputum eosinophil count will be positively associated with the increase in microglial activation. Sputum induction is a relatively simple, repeatable, and non-invasive method to collect airway secretions and are a highly relevant biological sample to assess airway inflammation.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Functionality Measured by Statistical Significance of Co-variation between Cognitive Tasks or Self-Report Instruments and Microglial Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators propose that a greater increase in microglial activation will be associated with reduced performance on tasks that assess cognitive function and greater psychological symptoms. The hypothesis is that a greater post-allergen challenge increase in microglial activation will be associated with a decrement in performance, relative to baseline, on measures of memory, attention, or executive function and elevated reports of depressive and anxious symptoms. The instruments may include the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, Stress and Adversity Inventory, Childhood Trauma and Adversity, and Peak Flow Diary (a diary of asthma symptoms recorded daily).</description>
