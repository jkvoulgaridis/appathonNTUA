    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

        Neoadjuvant Therapy:

          -  Pathologically documented NSCLC

          -  Molecular testing results from Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
             (CLIA)-certified laboratories and showing at least one of the following abnormalities:
             ALK gene rearrangement; ROS1 gene rearrangement; NTRK1/2/3 gene rearrangement; BRAF
             V600 mutation

          -  Molecular testing results used for patient eligibility should be obtained from the
             most recent tumor biopsy. Alternatively, and for patients with ALK, ROS1, and
             NTRK1/2/3 molecular alterations, molecular testing results used to determine patient
             eligibility could have been obtained from a recent blood sample (up to 2 months prior
             to enrollment) described in the study design

          -  Measurable disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) v1.1

          -  NSCLC must have a solid or subsolid appearance on computed tomography (CT) scan and
             cannot have a purely ground glass opacity appearance. For sub-solid lesions, the tumor
             size (i.e., clinical T stage) should be measured based on the solid component only,
             exclusive of the ground glass opacity component

          -  Evaluated by the attending surgeon prior to study enrollment to verify that the
             primary tumor and any involved lymph nodes are technically completely resectable and
             verify that the patient is medically operable

          -  Adequate pulmonary function to be eligible for surgical resection with curative intent

          -  Adequate cardiac function to be eligible for surgical resection with curative intent

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1

          -  Adequate hematologic and end-organ function

          -  Male patients must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception.
             Treatment-specific contraceptive requirements will be in the specific protocol
             appendix for each study drug

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use acceptable methods of
             contraception. For treatment-specific contraceptive requirements, please see the
             specific appendix for each study drug

        Adjuvant Therapy:

          -  Patients whose tumors have pathologic response or lack of radiographic progression

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1

          -  Adequate hematologic and end-organ function

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  NSCLC that is clinically T4 by virtue of mediastinal organ invasion or Stage IIIB by
             virtue of N3 disease

          -  Any prior therapy for lung cancer, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
             immunotherapy, or radiotherapy, within 2 years

          -  Patients with prior lung cancer that have been in remission for &lt; 2 years with the
             exception of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma or incidental typical carcinoid tumors

          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Malignancies other than the disease under study within 3 years prior to Cycle 1, Day
             1, with the exception of patients with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and
             with expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer,
             localized prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, or ductal carcinoma
             in situ treated surgically with curative intent) or undergoing active surveillance per
             SOC management (e.g., Rai Stage 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prostate cancer with
             Gleason score &lt;/= 6, and prostate-specific antigen (&lt;/= 10 ng/mL, etc.)

          -  Treatment with an investigational agent for any condition within 4 weeks prior to
             Cycle 1, Day 1 (or within 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is
             longer)

          -  Known HIV positivity or AIDS-related illness

          -  Pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant during the study
