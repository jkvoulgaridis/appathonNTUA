      Determine the relationship between a non-physiological parameter obtained by Machine
      Learning, the Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) and two physiological parameters
      representative of the microcirculation and the presence of renal damage associated with
      surgery: oxygen saturation in tissue (StO2) and the risk of acute kidney damage (AKIRisk),
      respectively.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between a non-physiological
      parameter obtained through Machine Learning (HPI) and physiological parameters such as StO
      and the Integration of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2) and the factor
      binding protein of insulin growth 7 (IGFBP-7), as a representation of microcirculation and
      the presence of renal damage respectively associated with surgery. The integration of this
      non-physiological parameter (HPI) in daily clinical practice would achieve an improvement in
      the care of the surgical patient, improving their postoperative prognosis.

      The most recent recommendations of the Societies of Experts in the treatment of perioperative
      acute renal failure promote early detection of renal damage, even before it causes organ
      dysfunction. For this purpose, they recommend measuring biomarkers of kidney damage,
      including their alteration, within the definition of IRA. In this sense, to solve the great
      inaccuracy of creatinine when defining renal failure and to detect and treat kidney damage
      before it progresses to dysfunction, renal biomarkers emerge promisingly (TIMP-2 and IGFBP-7
      are the two most promising biomarkers).

As a pattern replacement of interstitial space, we will use balanced crystalloid (Isofundin®) at 1-3 ml / kg / h in case of laparoscopic surgery and 5 to 7 ml / kg / h in case of open surgery.

The protocol action for the intravascular space will be based on a recently published hemodynamic optimization algorithm (Heming N, Moine P, Coscas R, Annane D.
