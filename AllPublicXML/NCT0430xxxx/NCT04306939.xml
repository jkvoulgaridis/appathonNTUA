  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, descriptive, observational research study designed to observe and
      document the clinical practice by domain experts, and how the knowledge of new findings that
      are published in the medical literature affect clinical decision making.

      The study will evaluate risk factors and co-variants, including genetic variants that are
      associated with disease progression such as pain, inflammation, organ dysfunction, disability
      and quality of life.

      The Genomic Resource to Enhance Available Therapies (GREAT1.0) Study is a research program
      for personalized medicine. It is a highly annotated genetic and biosample resource for
      multiple nested observational cohort studies. It is designed to begin to understand the
      mechanisms underlying complex diseases using clinical information from the UPMC electronic
      health record (EHR), from case-report forms, and from biological samples.

      Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that point-of-care electronic health record (EHR)-based
      phenotyping and clinical measures will be useful for classifying patient by disease risk,
      subtype, activity, complications, quality of life or using statistical or systems approaches.

      Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that common diseases can be subtyped using genotype data.

      Aim 3. To test the hypothesis biological samples will provide additional functional and
      mechanistic information about subject health, disease or state.

      The study will be conducted using UPMC patients and population controls. Consent will allow
      EHR and/or case report form data, plus biological samples to be given a unique code number
      and transferred to researchers for analysis. Consent will also allow for a secure link to be
      maintained allowing the research data or samples to be updated, and to contact the clinical
      team and/or subject to provide them with additional information.

    <measure>Define the molecular disorders contributing to clinicopathological disease definitions for common complex disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Diseases are defined by symptoms and pathologic features in specific tissues. The study uses genetic variants associated with disease to define the underlying genes associated with disease, and uses cell biology methods to understand which mechanisms within the specialized cells lead to disease under specific conditions.</description>

    <measure>Define risk factors for disease progression, severity, complications and poor quality of life.</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Life-style (e.g. alcohol, smoking, diet, exercise), medications, metabolic, genetic and epigenetic factors alter the features of disease. Nested studies, subgroup analysis, stepwise regression, statistical and machine learning will be used to develop disease models where early intervention may alter disease progression and severity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Common disease mechanisms and repurposing of medications.</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Many chronic diseases, including inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, have similar disease features that arise in different organs. Harmonization of similar disease processes in different organs will be used to increase study power, and to determine if there is evidence that therapeutic interventions for one disease may be effective in another disease, providing evidences to consider drug repurposing and new treatment approaches.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain profile</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is measured using visual analogue scales, pain quality, pattern and interference using standardized questionnaires. Patients with similar disease stages and severity often have markedly different levels of pain. Validated tools will be used to observe responses to disease treatments between similar patients, and to observe factors that may be targetable to lessen pain in future intervention studies.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Case/Chronic complex disorders</arm_group_label>
    <description>Chronic complex disorders are composed of multiple population sub classifications - many of which have not been fully defined. Thus, all eligible patients should be included to maximize study power. Sufficient numbers of controls, those individuals in the general population, who may or may not have complex disorders are needed to match future comparison studies for a subset of questions, and so should also be included.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control</arm_group_label>
    <description>The number of controls that are anticipated for this study is less than patient numbers since they will not be needed for calculating the minor allele frequency of the majority of genetic polymorphism of interest in genetic association studies. This data is already available in public and research databases. Controls will be useful for evaluating case report form questions, providing assessment of the local genetic pool, and for possibly participating in future studies as provided by the consent.</description>

      Biological samples will provide functional and mechanistic information about subject health,

      The protocol allows the collection of biological waste, defined as any biological sample that
      is left over from a laboratory test or procedure such as surgery or endoscopy.

      Blood sample in addition to waste may be obtained at the time of venipuncture for clinical
      testing to optimize sample collection for biomarkers that may be affected by delays in
      clinical testing. An extra 21cc of blood can be accepted, up to 4 time a year, and with the
      approval of the attending physician Research blood collection is also an option via
      venipuncture if the subject is not scheduled for clinical testing. This will also be limited
      to 21cc of blood, up to 4 time a year, and with the approval of the attending physician.

      Research samples that are non-invasive, such as those from saliva, urine, stool, hair, etc.
      may also be collected with patient consent.
