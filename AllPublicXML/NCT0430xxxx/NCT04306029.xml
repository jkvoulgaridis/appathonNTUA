      Our overarching goal is to enable providers to consistently offer and deliver highly
      effective postpartum family planning methods in accordance with international guidelines. Our
      primary objective in this research is to assess the implementation and effectiveness of the
      &quot;Postpartum Family Planning Package (PFPP),&quot; an implementation strategy that consists of the
      following components: 1) a provider training on contraceptive methods available in the
      immediate postpartum period, and techniques for their placement in the case of intrauterine
      devices and implants, with quarterly booster trainings, and 2) promotion of the WHO
      MEC/Postpartum Family Planning Compendium mobile application as a provider decision tool to
      aid in postpartum family planning counselling.
