  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stomach cancer is the fifth most common digestive cancer and third main cause of death from
      cancer in the world. Modern management of Gastric cancer involves a multi-disciplinary
      approach involving surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, gastroenterologists and
      oncological radiologists. The most common clinical approach to Gastric adenocarcinoma is to
      begin with staging, which usually involves CT scan/ MRI combined with endoscopic US for more
      accurate T, N staging. Once the patient is deemed to have locally advanced gastric cancer
      (T3/T4,N0/+), a staging laparoscopy is recommended to rule out obvious or microscopic
      peritoneal metastatic disease. Additionally, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is initiated and
      followed by surgery +/- adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy.This protocol involves the
      addition of neoadjuvant HIPEC at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy as well as neoadjuvant
      radiation therapy for improved local and systemic control. The goal of this phase II clinical
      trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-modality approach to treating patients with
      locally advanced Gastric cancer by incorporating diagnostic laparoscopy with HIPEC,
      neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy, followed by surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.
      The trial aims to assess this multi-modality approach in inducing pathological complete
      response; decreased rates of disease progression during neoadjuvant therapy; and increased
      overall, disease-free, and peritoneal disease-free survival.
