  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether wearable sensors can be used to track changes in
      cognitive-motor performance in response to a disease or an intervention.

      Our specific aims are twofold, first we aim to explore whether and how a clinical condition
      such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) may
      impact motor-cognitive performance measurable using validated wearable devices (e.g., LEGSys,
      BalanSENS, and Frailty Meter). Second, we will explore whether an exercise intervention
      provided via tele-medicine (tele-rehabilitation) can enhance motor-cognitive performance.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our specific research questions: (1) Which motor-cognitive parameters measurable by wearable
      sensors (e.g. gait, balance, frailty index, etc) are linked to specific diseases (e.g. COPD,
      CHF) (2) Which motor-cognitive parameters are most responsive to identify changes in patients
      ambulatory performance related to Tele-rehabilitation

      We will recruit a minimum of 15 per clinical condition with a maximum of 150 per clinical
      condition in subjects suffering from different disorders, which may impact motor-cognitive.
      Targeted disorders: COPD and CHF. Other chronic illness may also be recruited such as
      Diabetes, Peripheral Arterial Disease, Morbus Parkinson, Cancer, Neuropathy, Frailty, Mild
      Cognitive Impairment, Depression, and patients undergoing major surgical intervention.
      Fifteen or more people with the same disorder would form a group.

      We will measure motor-cognitive performance from each subject. For this purpose several
      sensors will be attached to the body using elastic straps. Each subject will be asked to
      dedicate approximately 1 hour of their time for each visit. A series of health related
      questionnaires will be used to evaluate the quality of life, clinical problems, cognition,
      and pain intensity levels, respectively. Medical history (from the subject's chart) and
      demographic information will be obtained.

      This study consists of Core and Ancillary Measurements. Core Measurements (Motor cognitive
      test) will be performed during all visits whereas Ancillary Measurements may not be required
      for anyone.

      If the subject is undergoing tele-rehabilitation intervention, which may also benefit
      functional status (e.g. improvement in balance), we will re-examine motor-cognitive
      performance using the test described above to evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed test
      in tracking outcomes in response to the intervention or predict outcomes based on baseline
      assessments. Specifically, depending on the type of intervention and frequency of standard of
      care visits for follow-up at the clinic, we may re-assess functional performance at each
      follow-up standard of care visit, upon the availability of the subject. Please note that the
      number of follow up visits will not exceed 12 visits over the course of 12 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any individual 18 years old or 65+ older is eligible to participate. Must be diagnosed
             with a chronic illness such as COPD or CHF and should be refereed to one of the
             tele-rehabilitation program offered at VA-Houston.

        We will be enrolling veteran subjects

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they were non-ambulatory (unable to walk with or without
             assistance a distance of at least 10 meter) and were unlikely to fully comply with the
             protocol (e.g., long-distance travel if multiple follow-up visits are required), or if
             they were unwilling to provide informed consent. Patients with be also excluded if
             they have severe visual and hearing problems who may not be able to interact with
             tele-rehabilitation. Other exclusion criteria include unstable medical region (those
             who may change medication over next 12 weeks), those with severe cognitive impairment
             and psychiatric problems who may not be able to follow tele-rehabilitation
             instructions based on judgement of clinical investigators, those who are participating
             in another active intervention that may affect cognitive-motor performance, and those
             who do not have capacity to consent

        We will not exclude patients with internal devices such as a deep brain stimulator or
        electronic devices for pain management, but we will not be placing our Bioharness device in
        people with such conditions.
