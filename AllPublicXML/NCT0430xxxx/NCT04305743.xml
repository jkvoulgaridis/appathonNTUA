  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, in clinical practice there has been no standardization in the number of injections
      a single dose of intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxin A is administered in. Given the increasing
      use of this treatment modality, the aim of this study is to compare outcomes for patients
      given a 100 unit dose of onabotulinumtoxin A split into 5 as compared to 20 injections for
      the treatment of overactive bladder or urgency urinary incontinence refractory to medical
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxin A for treatment of idiopathic overactive
      bladder and urgency urinary incontinence refractory to anticholinergic or Î²-agonist treatment
      was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013. Since then,
      multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the
      treatment. Currently, Allergan, Inc. and the FDA recommend the intravesical administration of
      onabotulinumtoxin A with dilution to 100 units/10 mL with preservative-free 0.9% Sodium
      Chloride Injection, as 20 injections of 0.5 mL each. Currently, in clinical practice there
      has been no standardization in the number of intravesical injections, with a single dose of
      onabotulinumtoxin A being administered in as few as 1 injection to as many as 40 injections
      into the detrusor muscle. Given the increasing use of this treatment modality, the
      investigators aim to compare patient outcomes for patients given a 100 unit dose of
      onabotulinumtoxin A split into 5 as compared to the recommended 20 injections for the
      treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder or urgency urinary incontinence refractory to
      medical treatment.

    <description>Participant's bladder is backfilled with 50 mL of 1% lidocaine for 15 minutes, then drained prior to procedure start. Dose of 100 units onabotulinumtoxin A with dilution to 100 Units/10 mL with preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is prepared. Cystoscopy is performed. The 23 gauge Laborie InjeTAK needle is inserted 3 mm into the detrusor. 5 injections of 2 mL each (total volume of 10 mL) in a single procedure is performed 1 cm apart in the bladder body. For the final injection, approximately 1 mL of sterile normal saline should be injected such that the remaining onabotulinumtoxin A in the needle is delivered to the bladder.</description>
