      The purpose of this study is to optimize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for
      imaging pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and correlate MRI biomarkers with the expression of
      the tumor suppressor gene SMAD4 and clinical outcomes with the goal of identifying which
      biomarkers are predictive of treatment response or non-response. This study will test
      magnetic resonance techniques on FDA approved clinical MRI machines in treatment-naïve
      patients with biopsy-proven PDAC.

      Specific Aims

        1. To optimize the following multiparametric MRI sequences for imaging of Pancreatic ductal
           adenocarcinoma (PDAC): Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent
           (BOLD), Magnetization Transfer (MT), and reduced field-of-view Diffusion Weighted
           Imaging (DWI, including low b-values for intravoxel incoherent motion measurements and
           high b-values for Diffusion Kurtosis analysis).

        2. To measure these MRI biomarkers in 20 treatment-naïve patients with biopsy-proven PDAC
           who have been referred to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) Pancreatic
           Cancer Program for neoadjuvant chemo-radiation therapy (CRT).

        3. To correlate these MRI biomarkers with histopathology, i.e. the expression of the tumor
           suppressor gene SMAD4 and clinical outcomes with the goal of identifying which
           biomarkers are predictive of treatment response or non-response.

      The investigators hypothesize the following:

        1. It is feasible to develop dedicated MRI protocols with novel MRI techniques including
           Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD), Magnetization
           Transfer (MT), and reduced field-of-view Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), and to
           develop appropriate evaluation methods.

        2. The implementation of these new protocols and evaluation methods in patients with
           pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) provide biomarkers which correlate with
           histology and outcome in treatment-naïve patients.

        3. The biomarkers are also predictive of therapy response in patients with PDAC during
           neoadjuvant chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) and correlate with the expression of the tumor
           suppressor gene SMAD4.
