             analogs, aluminum hydroxide antacids, systemic corticosteroids, acetazolamide, and
             thiazides within 7 days prior to scheduled initial administration of investigational
             drug

          2. Planned or recommended orthopedic surgery (implantation or removal), including
             staples, 8 plates or osteotomy, during the study period

          6. Use of any investigational product (except for investigational product of the
             preceding study) or investigational medical device within 4 months prior to scheduled
             initial administration of investigational drug, or requirement for any investigational
             agent prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments

          7. Use of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody other than KRN23 within 90 days prior to
             scheduled initial administration of investigational drug

          8. History of being positive for HIV antibody, HBs antigen and/or HCV antibody
