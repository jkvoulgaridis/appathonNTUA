  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main theme of the cohort of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients is the determination of
      nutritional status, its evolution and the evaluation of its management in patients with
      scleroderma.

      The main objectives are :

        -  To determine the incidence of malnutrition and its main determinants (disease
           characteristics, severity, eating habits, physical activity) in patients with
           scleroderma.

        -  For patients with undernutrition at inclusion or at 18 months follow-up:

      evaluate the impact of a standardized nutritional intervention (dietary advice, oral
      supplements, artificial, enteral or parenteral nutrition) on nutritional and disease
      parameters.

      Follow-up visits will take place every 6 months for 2 years. (M6, M12, M18 et M24).

      During each visit: a clinical examination, with anthropometric measurements, a 3-day dietary
      survey and a blood sample (10 ml), completion a multiple-choice of quality of life and
      physical activity evaluation.

      Paraclinical evaluation : echocardiography, lung function tests, screening for osteoporosis
      (M6 and M18).

      If undernutrition is detected during a follow-up visit, the subject will be referred to a
      specialized service.

        The study population is patients aged 18 or more with scleroderma. From preliminary data
        obtained in our department, we can estimate that 50% of participants will meet the
        definition of malnutrition (BMI&lt;21kg/m2 or weigh loss &gt;10% in months) at baseline.
