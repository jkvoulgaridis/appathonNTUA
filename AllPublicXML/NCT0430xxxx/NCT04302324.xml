  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center single-arm phase 2 study in which patients will receive daratumumab
      in combination with clarithromycin/pomalidomide/dexamethasone (D-ClaPd) until progressive
      disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever comes first. This study will test the
      hypothesis that in patients with previous daratumumab exposure, combination therapy of
      clarithromycin/pomalidomide/dexamethasone (ClaPd) will yield higher Very Good Partial
      Response (VGPR) rates in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients than historical
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone treatment.
