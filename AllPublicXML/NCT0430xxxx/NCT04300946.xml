    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to check the role of the cerebellum in time prediction in healthy
      volunteers, by means of magnetic transcranial stimulation targeted on the cerebellum, and
      recording of behavioural measures indexing time prediction

    <description>Impact on EEG performance (preparation wave in temporal tasks) of cerebellar stimulation by MSD in healthy subjects. The contrast between the post-stimulation effects of verrum stimulation and placebo stimulation will indicate the magnitude of the effect and will allow us to optimize the type of protocol that may be useful in schizophrenia.</description>
