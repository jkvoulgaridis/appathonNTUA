  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatectomy induces moderate to severe postoperative pain. Patient-controlled intravenous
      analgesia has been used in many medical centers for post-hepatectomy analgesia, but the
      effects are limited and often cause undesirable adverse effects.

      Regional Block has been used for postoperative analgesia in many surgeries. Some studies
      suggest that regional analgesia has an opioid-sparing effect and can reduce the incidence of
      chronic pain. Also, the programmed intermittent bolus infusion is better than continuous
      infusion, with less analgesic consumption and fewer adverse effects.

      Studies on the early and late postoperative analgesia and recovery effects of paravertebral
      block for open hepatectomy are scarce. Therefore, the investigators aim to conduct a
      prospective, randomized, subject and assessor-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled
      study to test the hypothesis that the programmed intermittent bolus infusion of right
      thoracic paravertebral block reduces postoperative intravenous analgesic use and pain scores
      and improved patients' satisfaction.

      This study aims to compare the early postoperative morphine consumptions, pain scores, rescue
      analgesics, adverse effects and recovery indices, and the late postoperative life quality
      between patients with and without paravertebral block.
