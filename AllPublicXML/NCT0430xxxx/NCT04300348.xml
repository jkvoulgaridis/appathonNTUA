      Introduction: The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy potential of using real-time
      positive auditory feedback to improve gait pattern in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD).
      The components of walking are commonly affected in patients with PD. Gait training for PD is
      usually based on verbal cues from the therapist that are only moderately effective. Based on
      good principals of gait and neuroplasticity, the Heel-To-Toe (Heel2Toe) sensor was developed
      to provide real-time auditory feedback during walking training. Methods: A two-group,
      randomized feasibility trial is planned with repeated measures of gait parameters and walking
      outcomes. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Outcomes after the 5
      training days will be obtained directly from the Hee2Toe device for both groups (with and
      without auditory feedback). The primary outcome is walking capacity measured by the
      Six-Minute Walk Test and the Standardized Walking Obstacle Course. Gait parameters will be
      captured by the Heel2Toe device Expected Contributions: Gait training using the Heel2Toe
      sensor will be potentially effective for improving walking pattern in people with PD.

    <description>The Heel2Toe group will have the 5 therapy sessions to learn to trigger the sensor with a strong heel strike and how to use device for home practice for 3 months. During the home practice, participants will be instructed to walk with the device for a minimum of 10 minutes per day in feedback mode.</description>
