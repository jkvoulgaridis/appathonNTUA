  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about what happens in the human body after
      consuming a meal that contains ultra-processed foods like hamburgers, and if this is
      different to what happens after consuming a meal that contains lots of whole foods, like
      fresh vegetables, instead.

      The purpose of this study is to discover more about how the human body and the bacteria
      living in our intestines, known as &quot;gut flora,&quot; react to different foods a person may
      consume. The investigators want to know if there are differences in compounds measured in a
      participant's blood and urine after eating different foods. Specifically, the investigators
      are interested in seeing if there are differences in these compounds after eating
      ultra-processed foods, like hamburgers and french fries, versus eating whole foods, like
      fresh fruits and vegetables. The investigators also want to know if the bacteria in our
      intestines may change the levels of these compounds. To this end, some subjects will be asked
      to take antibiotics to suppress the gut flora for three days before eating the challenge
      meal. Suppression of gut flora is a known effect of the antibiotics used in this study.
      Participants will have two study visits.

    <description>Subjects in Arm 1 will take antibiotics for 3 days before the meal challenge to suppress the gut flora. The antibiotics to be used are: vancomycin, 125 mg three times daily; metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily; ciprofloxacin, 500 mg twice daily; and neomycin, 1 gram three times daily. These subjects will then consume a challenge meal of ultra-processed foods.</description>

    <description>An ultra-processed diet challenge test utilizing 1) potatoes fried in highly refined and processed vegetable oil, including corn, soybean, or canola oil, with wheat and milk derivatives; 2) a beef patty sandwich containing processed American cheese, enriched refined flour, mold inhibitor, preservatives and oxidation/reduction additives such as ascorbic acid, potassium/calcium iodate, alpha-amylase, and azodicarbonamide; and 3) a beverage composed of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and caramel coloring. The ultra-processed challenge meal will be obtained from a local restaurant on the day of the challenge test.</description>
