  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a observational, multicenter study to identify novel variants of the DPYD gene which
      are possible deleterious in patients of non-Western descent.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that DPYD-guided dose-individualization based on 4 DPYD variants (DPYD*2A,
      c.1236G&gt;A, c.2846A&gt;T and c.1679T&gt;G) can significantly reduce severe fluoropyrimidine-related
      toxicity. However, these 4 variants are most likely not predictive for toxicity in patients
      of non-Western descent. In this study the DPYD gene of patients of non-Western descent will
      be sequenced to identify novel variants that could be associated with a reduced DPD enzyme
      activity and an increased risk of developing severe fluoropyrimdine-related toxicity.
      Additionally, the ability to predict if a DPYD variant is possibly deleterious by a
      recombinant model systen (DPYD-varifier) will be studied.
