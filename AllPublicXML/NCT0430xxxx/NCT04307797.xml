  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to explore the cardiovascular effects of co-agonism at the glucagon and
      (glucagon-like peptide-1) GLP-1 receptor. Glucagon and exenatide will be intravenously
      infused into participants with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Overall, the aim of the study is to
      further the investigator's understanding on the role these endogenous substances have on
      normal cardiac physiology, myocardial energetics and myocardial glucose uptake.

      This is a single centre Prospective Randomised Open Blinded End-point (PROBE) pilot study
      designed to understand the role the GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide, and glucagon receptor
      co-agonism has on normal cardiac physiology, myocardial energetics and myocardial glucose
      utilisation. Overweight participants with type 2 diabetes will act as their own control and
      will undergo a series of four imaging visits (in a randomised order) as detailed below:

        1. Cardiac positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) with carbon-11
           acetate (11C-acetate) - placebo infusion

        2. Cardiac PET-MRI with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) - placebo infusion

        3. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) - placebo infusion. Followed by Cardiac PET-MRI
           11C-acetate - exenatide and glucagon infusion. Followed by CMR - exenatide and glucagon
           infusion

        4. Cardiac PET-MRI with 18F-FDG - exenatide and glucagon infusion

      Study outcome measures are detailed below
