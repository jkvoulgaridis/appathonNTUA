  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) and obesity are major contributors to impaired health
      worldwide. Statins are among the most prescribed medications with well-established safety and
      efficacy. Statins are recommended in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, which has
      been linked to both MDD and obesity. Moreover, statins are promising candidates to treat MDD
      because a meta-analysis of pilot randomized controlled trials has found antidepressive
      effects of statins as adjunct therapy to antidepressants. However, no study so far has tested
      the antidepressive potential of statins in patients with MDD and comorbid obesity. Therefore,
      we hypothesize that Simvastatin add-on to standard antidepressant Escitalopram will improve
      depression to a greater extent than add-on placebo in patients with comorbid obesity and
      major depression. We will randomize 160 obese MDD patients at 8 recruiting centers to either
      Simvastatin or placebo as add-on to Escitalopram for 12 weeks. If successful, our trial would
      have immediate impact on clinical practice given the fact that Simvastatin and Escitalopram
      are available as inexpensive generic drugs with established safety.
