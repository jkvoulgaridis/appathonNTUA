  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Standard postoperative treatment of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutated grade 2
      and 3 glioma (IDHmG) consists of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The improving prognosis of
      these patients leads towards more emphasis on the long-term effects of treatment.
      Specifically radiotherapy has been implicated in the development of delayed neurocognitive
      deterioration. The impact of modern radiotherapy techniques (such as intensity modulated
      radiotherapy, volumetric modulated radiotherapy and proton beam therapy) and chemotherapy on
      general toxicity, late neurocognitive outcomes and imaging changes is currently unclear.

      Objectives:

        -  To report treatment outcomes and radiation-induced toxicity from a prospective,
           multicentre observational cohort of IDHmG patients treated with radiotherapy and
           chemotherapy,

        -  To integrate radiotherapeutic dose distributions, imaging changes and neuropsychological
           outcome in IDHmG.

        -  To evaluate the Dutch selection criteria for proton therapy applied to IDHmG based on
           the outcomes collected in this observational study.

        -  To assess the impact of proton and photon therapy on health-related quality of life
           (HRQoL) and health-related economics (HR-E) in IDHmG patients.

        -  To collect genetic material for future translational research into the interaction
           between germline DNA, prognosis and radiation-induced toxicity.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: This project is a multicentre, observational cohort of patients undergoing
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy for IDHmG. The protocol closely follows the local guidelines
      for clinical follow-up. Specific to the study are extra questionnaires and specific imaging
      acquired during scheduled MRI's. Routine neuropsychological investigation is standard of care
      in Erasmus Medical Center (Erasmus MC), but not in all participating centers. We feel the
      additional burden of participation in this study to be low.

    <measure>Toxicity (selected CTCAE 5.0 items)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 displays Grade 1 to 5, ranging from 'mild' to 'death'. The case report form will include a predefined set of CTCAE items of expected radiotherapy related toxicities. In addition, other CTCAE toxicities grade â‰¥ 2 that are likely, possibly or definitely related to the radiotherapy should be recorded in the case report form (CRF), when they occur. All items will include a causality assessment: likely or definitely attributable to radiotherapy, unrelated or unlikely attributable to radiotherapy, or not assessable.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurocognitive testing</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurocognitive functioning will be assessed with a standard and well established short neuropsychological test battery, developed for use in clinical trials. The following tests are included: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), Trail Making Test part A and B (TMT A/B), Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA), Medical Outcomes Study Cognitive Functioning Scale (MOS), Diagnostic Instrument for Mild Aphasia (DIMA)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>48 months</time_frame>
    <description>NIFS is defined as time from first irradiation to date of initiation of further treatment after radio- and/or chemotherapy or death (any cause), whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first irradiation to progressive disease, according to (any of) the Response Asessment in Neuro Oncology (RANO) criteria for progressive disease in low grade glioma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL will be assessed with the EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) supplemented by the neuro-oncological module (QLQ-BN20) and the Euro Quality of Life questionnaire (EQ5D-5L)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health - Related Economics</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the Health Related Economics (HR-E) analyses, the EQ5D - 5L questionnaire will be used in conjunction with the Productivity Costs Questionnaire (iPCQ) and the Medical Consumption Questionnaire (iMCQ). These questionaires are optional.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Radiological data</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>If feasible, pre- and 4 months post-treatment a scan protocol will be used that, besides the standard clinical imaging, will focus on (micro-)structural and microvascular characteristics that could predict neurocognitive outcome and treatment efficacy. This feasibility is site-specific.</description>
