  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the widespread provision of grandparental child care, examining its impact on
      grandparents' energy-expenditure related behaviors in the broader context of health is
      imperative. The maintenance of functional independence and good quality of life is critical
      at a more advanced age. It has been put forward that an increased duration, frequency and
      intensity of physical activity (PA) combined with a restriction of sedentary behavior (SB) is
      the most important strategy to reduce morbidity risk and to foster health in an aging
      population. The present study aims to fill a gap in current knowledge on (changes in)
      caregiving grandparents' PA levels and SB patterns. An observational follow-up study will be
      conducted to examine and compare both energy-expenditure related behaviors linked to body
      composition and health-related quality of life among caregiving grandparents, non-caregiving
      grandparents and non-grandparent peers, both momentarily and over time. This fundamental
      research aims to provide scientific evidence contributing to the promotion of healthy
      grandparenting in people on the threshold of old age in modern society.

  <detailed_description>

      The first objective of the study is to provide a detailed overview of habitual levels of
      physical activity and sedentary behavior among caregiving grandparents in relation to their
      body composition and health-related quality of life (including both physical and mental
      function), and to identify to what extent these outcome measures are associated with the
      number, sex and age of the grandchild(ren) as well as with the intensity of grandparents'
      provision of child care, while taking some demographic characteristics of the grandparent
      (i.e., age, sex, marital status, socio-economic status (SES)) into account.

      The second objective is to compare caregiving grandparents' energy-expenditure related
      behaviors (i.e., physical activity and sedentary behavior) and their link with health-related
      measures of interest (i.e., body composition and quality of life) with both non-caregiving
      grandparents and non-grandparent peers as relevant control groups.

      The third objective is to investigate (age-related) changes in physical activity and
      sedentary behavior linked to body composition and health-related quality of life among
      caregiving grandparents versus non-caregiving grandparents as well as non-grandparents both
      in the short and the longer term, and to identify possible predictors of these changes over
      time. Additionally, it is the intention to examine the impact of middle-aged and older adults
      making the transition to (caregiving) grandparenthood on both energy-expenditure related
      behaviors as well as the health-related measures of interest.

    <description>An observational follow-up study will be implemented over a period of 2 years, consisting of 3 test occasions with a fixed time interval of 1 year in between (T0 = baseline, T1 = 12 months, T2 = 24 months). Data will be collected in participants who provide grandchild care in a non-residential grandparent context as well as in a sample of non-caregiving grandparents and a sample of middle-aged and older adults not being a grandparent. All three samples will thus be prospectively monitored over a period of 2 years.</description>
