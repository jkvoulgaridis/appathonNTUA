  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a hospital stay, older adults often become physically deconditioned and lose their
      ability to perform activities of daily living. Afterwards, they commonly require
      rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility to regain independence. Even at discharge,
      however, many older adults are still far below their pre-hospitalization level of function
      making them at risk for adverse events such as falls, rehospitalizations, and loss of
      independence. Two reasons for inadequate outcomes may include that 1) physical and
      occupational therapy interventions are delivered at too low an intensity to incur substantial
      physiological gains, and 2) residents are largely sedentary outside of structured therapy
      time. These two problems represent critical targets for interventions that optimize care in
      skilled nursing facilities. Therefore, the investigators designed High-Intensity
      Rehabilitation + Mobility (HeRo), a patient-centered approach to skilled nursing facility
      care that incorporates a combination of high-intensity (i.e. high resistance, low repetition)
      functionally-based resistance training along with a structured mobility program outside of
      therapy time.

      HeRo includes: 1) a team approach to patient-centered care; 2) a physical activity
      intervention that incorporates principals of behavioral economics, which uses incentives,
      goal setting, and gamification to optimize patient engagement and health outcomes and 3) a
      challenging, high-intensity rehabilitation intervention that pushes patients to expand their
      limits. The investigators expect that HeRo will improve physical function and physical
      activity while reducing sedentary time for older adults in the skilled nursing facility. The
      study team will assess the feasibility and acceptability of HeRo for multiple stakeholders
      including patients, physical and occupational therapists, nursing staff, and administration.
      This research will improve patient care in the skilled nursing facility environment, getting
      older adults on a fast track to developing independence after a hospital stay.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single arm study but will use two historical cohorts as comparison groups to assess outcomes: 1) usual care and 2) high-intensity, functionally based resistance training alone. The historical cohorts were included in a previous study (Clinical Trials Registry identifier: E2193-P). This design will include independent cohorts of patients within a single SNF, using the facility as its own control. This design optimally controls for facility-level variables that vary widely between SNFs and may influence care delivery, such as staffing levels, staff experience, and productivity standards.</intervention_model_description>
