  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would be a first step towards mobile-health associated Sustainable Development
      Goals by World Health Organization, as there are no mobile-health driven oral health
      activities in Karachi, Pakistan. Concurrently, it will help in improving knowledge and
      practices of adolescents towards general dental hygiene as this age is crucial for the
      prognosis of newly erupted permanent teeth. This would help in preventing chronic problems of
      adulthood. This will also help in reducing the number of days missed from school, increasing
      self-confidence of individuals as bad breath has a negative impact on one's self-esteem and
      confidence, giving a positive sense of aesthetics and will also keep in check over-all body
      health.Persistent unmaintained dental hygiene also overburdens families due to its
      high-maintenance outcomes like caries and early tooth loss. Dental treatment is considered as
      fourth most expensive treatment in developing countries . According to recent studies,
      households of low and middle income countries are at a higher risk of falling below the
      poverty line due to expenditure on dental problems. Such a simple intervention making use of
      modern-day technology would enable adolescents to keep their oral health in check and would
      prevent them from facing consequences of poor oral health.
