  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal aims to investigate a novel light-based treatment to reduce morbidity in
      shoulder surgical patients. This has potential to improve outcomes and reduce health care
      utilization associated with infectious complications of shoulder arthroplasty. Participants
      will be healthy male volunteers at least 18 years of age. They will be on study for
      approximately 2 days.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will have two study visits (consent plus treatment and swabs for culture). These
      visits will be conducted at the main UW Hospital, UW Health at the American Center, or UW
      Health at 1 S. Park. All visits will be conducted in reserved conference rooms at each
      location.

      Once a subject is determined to be eligible and has consented to the study, they will be
      randomized into one of three treatment groups. Study team has blank envelopes that contain
      one of the three treatment groups enclosed. After a subject consents to the study, the study
      team will randomly draw an envelope to assign a treatment arm.

      Arm 1. One group will receive 5% topical benzoyl peroxide gel plus 2% chlorhexidine gluconate
      with 70% isopropyl alcohol

      Arm 2. One group will receive blue light therapy plus 2% chlorhexidine gluconate with 70%
      isopropyl alcohol

      Arm 3. One group will receive both of the above treatments

      All participants will have their contralateral shoulder serve as the control (2%
      chlorhexidine gluconate with 70% isopropyl alcohol only). All treatment will be provided by
      the study team. Participants will also be asked to complete a research intake form.

    <description>FDA cleared blue light product, Omniluxblue (Globalmed Technologies, Glen Elen, CA), which emits a 415 nm blue light irradiance of 40mW/cm2. Following the application of blue light protective eyewear, the blue light therapy device will be centered over the deltopectoral interval according to device standardized use instructions and a 23-minute treatment will be administered to dry skin. As was done in the topical BPO group, following treatment, both the treatment shoulder and control shoulder will be sterilely prepped with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution with 70% isopropyl alcohol and allowed to dry for 3 minutes. Following chlorhexidine preparation, a single set of cultures will be obtained from each shoulder. Participants and research personnel conducting the blue light treatments will be wearing medical grade blue light protective glasses for safety.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>5% Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Gel</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>A pea-sized amount, ~0.5 grams, will be applied to a 10cm strip over the deltopectoral interval beginning the morning 48 hours prior to schedule research visit to obtain cultures. The benzoyl peroxide will be applied on dry skin after a shower. The gel will be applied once in the morning and once in the evening for two consecutive days as well as the morning of the scheduled research visit. Following treatment, both the treatment shoulder and control shoulder will be sterilely prepped with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution with 70% isopropyl alcohol and allowed to dry for 3 minutes. Following chlorhexidine preparation, a single set of cultures will be obtained from each shoulder.</description>

    <description>5% topical benzoyl peroxide treatment will be performed on dry skin immediately after a shower as described in the above paragraph. Again, five total treatments will be performed prior to research visit. On the day of the research visit, the blue light therapy protocol described above will be performed exactly the same followed by culture obtainment.</description>
