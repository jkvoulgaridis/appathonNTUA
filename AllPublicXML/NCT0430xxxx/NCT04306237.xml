      The objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of
      IMB-1018972 on patients with refractory angina. Study will assess functional capacity
      employing a modified Bruce Protocol treadmill ETT, patient reports of angina symptoms via an
      electronic diary, and activity using an accelerometer.

             (eg, angina diary during screening) and complete specific follow-up evaluations.

          4. Has coronary artery disease confirmed by at least one of the following:

               -  Documented prior MI, CABG surgery, or PCI -OR-

               -  Angiography performed within the 24 months prior to Visit 1 confirming CAD (eg,
                  evidence of ≥70% stenosis of at least one major coronary artery or diffuse CAD).

          5. Has evidence of stress induced ischemia documented by either:

               -  Protocol-specified ETT ECG demonstrating at least 0.5 mm exercise-induced ST
                  segment depression with onset &lt;9 minutes on at least 1 of the screening ETTs -OR-

               -  Prior evidence of stress-induced reversible perfusion defect in the last 24
                  months (without intervening revascularization) identified by at least one of the
                  following:

                    -  Radionuclide imaging study

                    -  CFR &lt;2.5

          6. Has a minimum 3 month history of exertional angina, including angina with a minimum
             frequency of 2 anginal episodes per week on average for the 2 weeks prior to enrolling
             in the study while on optimal guideline directed medical therapy for their angina.

          7. Is on optimal, dual agent, antianginal therapy for their angina for at least 1 month
             prior to the first screening ETT. Consistent with ACC/AHA and ESC Class I guideline
             directed medical therapy (GDMT), criteria for optimal therapy include treatment with
             both: (a) a beta-adrenergic blocking agent and treatment with (b) a calcium channel
             blocker OR a long-acting nitrate. If unacceptable side effects are intolerable and
             documented with a therapy listed in (a) or (b), treatment with only 1 antianginal
             medication is acceptable. Additionally, patients should be treated with short-acting
             nitrates per GDMT.

             in the opinion of the principle investigator at the time of screening through 6 months
             after randomization.

          9. Has a CCS score of II, III or stabilized IV for 1 month prior to screening.

         10. Meets the following requirements after 2 screening modified Bruce protocol ETTs:

             a. Stopping the treadmill test due to angina on each test b. Total exercise duration
             must fall between 3 and 9 minutes on each test c. To document inducible myocardial
             ischemia: i. For those patients with interpretable ECGs, at least 0.5 mm exercise
             induced ST segment depression must occur with onset &lt;9 minutes on at least 1 of the
             screening ETTs.

             d. Difference in TED between the 2 qualifying ETTs must not exceed 20% of the longer
             test or 1 minute, whichever limit is smaller.

             e. Consideration of a third ETT may be discussed by the investigator with the study
             medical monitor, who may authorize the performance of a third ETT a minimum of 5 days
             and no more than 10 days after the second ETT
