  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is the second most common haematological cancer with a cancer incidence of
      around 500 new cases in Austria per year . Novel treatment methods have significantly
      increased the cancer-specific survival rate in patients with multiple myeloma. For Austria,
      this means that 5- and 10-year survival rates rose from 32.1 to 46.4% and from 19.0 to 25.6%
      from the end of the 1980s to the end of the 2000s.

      Longer survival is associated with the need to maintain independence and quality of life in
      the longer term. In this context, regular physical training has seen a significant increase
      in the importance of cancer in recent years.The guidelines of the American College of Sports
      Medicine still contain very general training recommendations for cancer patients. Either 150
      minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of intensive endurance training per week are recommended,
      supplemented by at least two units of strengthening training and stretching exercises for the
      large muscle groups.

      In a recent cross-sectional and pilot study with multiple myeloma patients that was carried
      out at the Clinic for Physical Medicine, Rehabilitation and Occupational Medicine at the
      Medical University of Vienna (EK 1725/2018), it was on the one hand identified that there was
      a discrepancy between these patients on the one hand has given actual and perceived risk of
      falling, and on the other hand it is concluded that training recommendations should be
      carried out separately in group and individual training according to the actual risk of
      falling and fracture.

      The present project is the follow-up to this cross-sectional investigation. The aim is to
      examine the feasibility and effects of a structured, physical training program carried out
      over a period of 12 weeks on physical performance, quality of life, body composition and the
      risk of falling. The effects of patients with increased risk in individual training sessions
      are compared to those of lower risk patients in group training sessions. Furthermore, the
      study patients will be able to bring training partners with them to their own training units
      if available and for their own security. They are evaluated separately according to
      qualitative criteria.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of individualized
      training support for multiple myeloma patient populations divided into high and low risk
      according to their fall and fracture risk. The primary hypothesis is that multiple myeloma
      patients who meet the criteria for a high risk of falling and / or fracture can achieve
      equivalent adherence rates and training effects through individually compiled individual
      training, such as multiple myeloma patients with low risk of falling who conduct group
      training.

      The adherence rates are recorded via attendance lists for training and video conferences as
      well as a training diary for independent training. To record the training effects, physical
      performance and functionality are measured and the quality of life, sexuality, depression,
      fatigue, sleep quality, work ability and risk of falling are assessed using standardized,
      validated questionnaires.
