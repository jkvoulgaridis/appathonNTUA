  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, single dose, open-label clinical study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of SHR6390 under fasting conditions in healthy
      caucasian volunteers

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the comparative pharmacokinetics, safety and
      tolerability of single oral dose of reformulated SHR6390 in healthy volunteers under fasting
      conditions.

      Each subject will receive a single dose of SHR6390, blood samples will be collected before
      dosing and at various time points up to 144 hours after drug administration, safety and the
      statistical analysis of the pharmacokinetic data will be obtained from this study
