  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study of screened women compared to historical controls. The
      objectives refer to comparisons made between the entire test arm and the control arm.
      Exploratory analyses will also include comparison of outcomes made within the test arm.

      The goal of the study is to use proteomic screening to identify pregnant women who are at
      higher risk of pregnancy outcomes inclusive of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and to
      intervene with a pre-specified multimodal intervention protocol to reduce incidence of
      adverse outcomes of pregnancy in prospective subjects compared to historical controls.

      The goal of the KITCHEN study is to use proteomic screening to identify pregnant women who
      are at an increased risk of preterm labor (thus having adverse pregnancy outcomes of neonatal
      morbidity and mortality) and intervene with a multimodal treatment protocol to reduce the
      incidence of adverse outcomes of preterm pregnancy in prospective subjects compared to
      historical controls. The blood test utilized for the proteomic screening is known as PreTRMÂ®.

      With the utilization of the PreTRM test plus the intervention strategy (weekly nurse
      follow-ups, progesterone, low-dose aspirin, two additional transvaginal ultrasounds, cerclage
      - if medically necessary), the investigators anticipate measuring the outcomes of preterm
      birth, NICU admission and NICU length of stay.

      To review the prospective patients of the KITCHEN study against standard of care controls,
      the investigators will be collecting medical records and claims data on ~5600 historical
      controls. Controls will be defined within a historically eligible period and within a
      geographic region defined for each site and will be screened for inclusion and exclusion
      criteria using data from the HIRD and medical records.
