  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substudy 02C is part of a larger research study that is testing experimental treatments for
      melanoma, a type of skin cancer. The larger study is the umbrella study.

      The goal of substudy 02C is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of investigational treatment
      arms in participants with Stage III melanoma who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy to
      identify the investigational agent(s) that, when used in combination, are superior to the
      current treatment options/historical control available.
