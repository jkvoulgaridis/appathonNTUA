  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrous oxide gas is used in several application areas : medical as an anesthetic drug ; in
      food industry as a foaming and a mixing agent ; industrial to speed combustion. It is also
      misused for its hilarant, euphoric and hallucinogenic effect. For this purpose the gas is
      transfered in a balloon to be inhaled.

      As its effects are briefs, its consumption is often perseived as safe. However, some risks
      exist and are majorated by the way of use and for some groups of people.

      Since 2016, the French observatory of drug and substances addiction (OFDT) describes an
      increasing misuse of nitrous oxide amoung teenagers and young adults. In november 2019, a
      french press release alerts on the recent increasing of neurologic side effects related to
      the misuse of nitrous oxide.

      That's why, it seems to be interesting to improve the screening of nitrous oxide abuse, in
      particular amoung adolescents and young adults.

      In our study, the investigators would like to determine the characteristics (social, medical,
      any drug abuse) of teenagers and young adults who misuse nitrous oxide. Through a
      questionnaire, the investigators plan to select teenagers and young adults who consult in an
      addictology center dedicated to young drug consumers in Montpellier. This questionnaire is
      anonymous. The data will be collected only after obtaining the patient's agreement.

      The final goal is to create a tool to help general practitioners in screening young people at
      risk of nitrous oxyde misuse.
