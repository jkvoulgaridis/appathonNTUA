      This research is a pretest, posttest, follow-up, randomized controlled experimental study.
      The research was carried out in Şehitkamil and Şahinbey districts, which are two central
      districts of Gaziantep Province. 60 parents with disabled children were included in the study
      (intervention: 30 parents, control: 30 parents). The research data was collected as pretest,
      posttest and follow-up test from the intervention group between April and December 2019, and
      the control group between April and September 2019 in three stages. Parental Identification
      Form, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
      (DASS-21), Adult Psychological Resilience Scale (RSA-21) were used as data collection form.
      After the pre-test data was collected, the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Based
      Intervention Program was applied to the intervention group in six sessions. The duration of
      each session lasted on average 60-90 minutes. A session was held for each parent once a week.
      The control group participated in the training carried out by the guidance service.

    <description>The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress.
Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items, divided into subscales with similar content. The depression scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest / involvement, anhedonia and inertia. The anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The stress scale is sensitive to levels of chronic non-specific arousal. It assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset / agitated, irritable / over-reactive and impatient. Scores for depression, anxiety and stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items.</description>
