  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A well-managed bowel program is an essential part of daily life for many people with a SCI.
      Nevertheless, constipation is frequently reported (42-95%). Constipation embraces a spectrum
      of harms including both physical &amp; psychological distress. Initial exploratory studies
      suggest abdominal FES may be useful for decreasing overall bowel management time, decreasing
      colonic transit time and reducing discomfort. The current study will seek to reproduce
      previous findings in a 12 week study, using overall bowel managementitme as a benchmark for
      establishing proof of principle. The study will include 36 people with a spinal cord injury
      aged 18 and over with an above T12 injury, a complete or incomplete lesion in a medically
      stable condition, one year or more after injury. Participants will be randomised into two
      groups. One group will receive abdominal electrical stimulation and the other group low dose
      abdominal electrical stimulation. Participants will be asked to keep a bowel diary and
      complete questionnaires examining quality of life and bowel management.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        People with a diagnosis of SCI (age=&gt;18) above T12 complete or incomplete lesion in a
        medically stable condition with a reflex bowel =&gt;1 year post spinal injury).

        -

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A history of organic bowel obstruction, frequent opioid use, intrathecal baclofen or
        percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, inflammatory bowel disease, abdominal hernia, any
        gastrointestinal or abdominal surgery (not necessarily excluded unless recent will require
        further investigation), lower motor neuron lesions, suspected strictures or fistulae along
        the gastrointestinal tract, physiologic gastrointestinal obstruction. Other causes of
        constipation such as hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia and a prior history of constipation
        predominant IBS prior to diagnosis of SCI. Involvement in other research trial
        interventions likely to have an impact on the protocol or results of the current study.

        Contra indications to electrical stimulation Poorly controlled epilepsy, cardiac pacemaker
        in situ or other implanted electrical devices (will require further investigation to
        examine whether there is an interaction between the device and FES) pregnancy or pregnancy
        planned, cancerous tissue in the abdominal region, any major skin disorders affecting the
        abdominal area) severe autonomic dysreflexia (tested at initial assessment).
