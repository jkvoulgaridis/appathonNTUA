      Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate and determine clinical and biochemical
      comparison of 3 different methods including Er:YAG laser, diod laser, and conventional
      techniques.

      Method: This study was conducted on 32 female, 13 male, a total of 45 individuals (study
      group patients) with an indication of resective gingival surgery in the anterior region of
      the maxillar anterior regions and 11 female, 4 men, a total of 15 individuals (negative
      control group patients) with a healthy gingiva. Clinical periodontal parameters, gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) KGF-2 and VEGF-A levels and gingival temperature levels were recorded
      before the investigation and during operations with 3 different techniques, gingival
      temperature was measured. Gingival temperature and epithelization levels in 3, 7, 14 and 21
      days; GCF KGF-2 and VEGF-A levels in 14 and 21 days and pain levels between 1-7 days of
      post-operative healing process were evaluated. Preoperative anxiety and postoperative
      satisfaction were evaluated through questionnaires

      Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate and determine clinical and biochemical
      comparison of 3 different methods including Er:YAG laser, diod laser, and conventional
      techniques commonly used in resective gingival surgeries in terms of preoperative anxiety,
      postoperative satisfaction, epithelization, gingival temperature, inflammation and pain
      levels in post-operative healing process.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Operative and post operative gingival temperature levels of the application region measured and recorded with using a noncontact infrared thermometer. The temperature measurement during the process was performed by an infrared thermometer (Optris GMBH, Manuel LS, Berlin, Germany). The device had a measurement and recording range from -35 ° C to 900 ° C, optical resolution 75: 1, thermal resolution 0.1 ° C, waveband range 8-14, USB interface and graphical software program.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Gingival Epithelization</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Epithelization levels of resection region were measured and evaluated with using Image J software. Wound surface epithelization in the healing process was evaluated with a staining solution (Mira-2-tone, GMBH &amp; Co., Duisburg, Germany). The treatment area was isolated. The solution carrier was applied with cotton pellets. The excess solution was removed by air-water spray. The standardized photographs were taken and transferred to the java based analysis program (Image J 1.31o, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The dark stained areas were calculated in the computer environment</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Gingival Pain Levels: Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain levels were evaluated with Visual Analog Scale in post operative process.A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate pain after surgeries. Patients were asked to mark the pain levels at the levels from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most severe pain) on the scale</description>
