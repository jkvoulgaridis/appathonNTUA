  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Imago relationship therapy (IRT; Hendrix, 2008) is an integrative approach to couples therapy
      that has been practiced and extensively disseminated for more than 30 years. IRT may be
      delivered through traditional in-office therapy with a couple, or the Imago principles and
      skills may be taught to couples through the &quot;Getting the Love You Want&quot; Workshop (GTLYW
      Workshop), a manualized, 2-day, psychoeducational workshop conducted by certified presenters
      to groups of couples. The present study is a RCT designed to examine the efficacy of IRT for
      couples experiencing distress in their committed romantic relationships, and to extend the
      findings of previous research. Ninety (90) couples with relationship distress will be
      recruited for the study. Couples will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Imago
      therapy alone, a Getting the Love You Want (GTLYW) Workshop followed by Imago therapy, or
      bibliotherapy, a control condition, in which couples will be given a self-help book on dyadic
      communication to read during a 12-week waiting period, followed by a GTLYW workshop.

    <measure>Change in Relationship Quality Interview (RQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RQI (Lawrence, Barry, Brock, Bunde, Langer, Ro, et al., 2011) is semi-structured, behaviorally anchored individual interview that takes about 60 minutes to administer. The RQI provides an objective assessment of relationship quality as a dynamic dyadic construct across 5 dimensions: (a) quality of emotional intimacy in the relationship, (b) quality of the couple's sexual relationship, (c) quality of support transactions in the relationship, (d) quality of the couple's ability to share power in the relationship, and (e) quality of conflict/problem-solving interactions in the relationship. The RQI will be used to measure change from: pre-randomization to post-intervention or post-waitlist, and from post-intervention or post-waitlist to 3-month follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Marital Adjustment Test (MAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 15-item self-report questionnaire that measures relationship satisfaction. The scale focuses on issues such as involvement in joint activities, demonstration of affection, frequency of marital complaints, level of loneliness and well-being, and partner agreement on significant issues. The MAT will be used to measure change from: pre-randomization to post-intervention or post-waitlist, and from post-intervention or post-waitlist to 3-month follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 32-item self-report inventory designed to measure satisfaction in intimate dyads. It is a commonly used inventory and has good psychometric properties. The 19 items of the DAS that do not overlap with the MAT will be used to measure change from: pre-randomization to post-intervention or post-waitlist, and from post-intervention or post-waitlist to 3-month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IRI is a 28-item self-report scale that measures both cognitive and affective components of empathy, and consists of four different 7-item subscales, representing different components of interpersonal sensitivity. The IRI is reliable, well validated and widely used (Davis, 1980). The IRI will be used to measure change from: pre-randomization to post-intervention or post-waitlist, and from post-intervention or post-waitlist to 3-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Communication Patterns Questionnaire (CPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Communication Patterns Questionnaire assesses a person's perceptions of dyadic communication about relationship problems, and yields scores on three subscales: demand/withdraw, criticize/defend, and positive interaction. The CPQ has demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity. The CPQ will be used to measure change from: pre-randomization to post-intervention or post-waitlist, and from post-intervention or post-waitlist to 3-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Couple Satisfaction Inventory -16</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CSI-16 is a 16-item self-report that measures current degree of relationship satisfaction. Scores can range from 0 to 81. Higher scores indicate higher levels of relationship satisfaction. The scale has good psychometric properties; see Funk, J.L., &amp; Rogge, R.D. (2007). The CSI-16 will be used to measure change from: pre-randomization to post-intervention or post-waitlist, and from post-intervention or post-waitlist to 3-month follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS SR-16) (Rush, Trivedi, Ibrahim, Carmody, Arnow, Klein, et al., 2003)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS SR-16 is a 16-item self-report measure of depression. It has good internal consistency. The QUIDS SR-16 will be used to measure change from: pre-randomization to post-intervention or post-waitlist, and from post-intervention or post-waitlist to 3-month follow-up.</description>

    <time_frame>3 to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD 7 is a 7-item scale developed to diagnose generalized anxiety disorders. It has sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 82% and is commonly used as a brief scale with goo reliability and validity. The GAD 7 will be used to measure change from: pre-randomization to post-intervention or post-waitlist, and from post-intervention or post-waitlist to 3-month follow-up.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Imago Relationship Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Imago relationship therapy (IRT) involves learning the Imago dialogue process, which helps couples to understand more clearly and deeply why they and their partners react as they do. Couples then practice communicating with one another in a manner that helps them move from reactivity and blame to understanding and empathy. The dialogue is used to transform conflicts, which all couples have at times, into opportunities for healing and growth, and to connect more deeply and effectively with one another. The specific topics of therapy are determined by the couple's needs and goals but in general, the therapist helps them to use the Imago dialogue to promote understanding, heal painful emotions, make requests of one another to change behaviors, and improve relationship quality.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group receive Imago relationship therapy (IRT) as described in the Imago Relationship therapy (IRT) arm and additionally receive the &quot;Getting the Love You Want&quot; (GTLYW) workshop. This is a weekend-long workshop that is an intensive educational and experiential process that involves a group of couples and is facilitated by two people - an Imago clinician and a co-facilitator. Education is provided and communication skills that are designed to promote understanding and empathy are taught. This is followed by a series of exercises facilitated by the workshop leaders as couples break out to practice these (i.e., couples are separated off to different sections of the room to practice).</description>
