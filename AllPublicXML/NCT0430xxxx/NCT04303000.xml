  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deaths relating to opioid overdose have rapidly increased over the past two decades. Due to
      the serious public health concern of the opioid epidemic, federal agencies recommend
      employing various harm reduction interventions. The implementation of Opioid Overdose
      Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) programs is effective in reducing opioid overdose
      mortality, yet these programs do not reach many high-risk individuals. Traditionally, OEND
      program venues are found in large, urban medical centers, drug treatment facilities, and
      needle exchange programs. Identifying unreached, high-risk individuals and providing training
      and naloxone kits through online recruitment could significantly expand access to this
      life-saving intervention. The primary goal of the current proposed project is to examine the
      acceptability and feasibility of online recruitment, online opioid overdose and naloxone
      administration education, and postal distribution of naloxone kits.
