  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homebound older adults are among the highest users in health care systems. The high use of
      health care services is related to their physical limitations compounded by complex health
      and social care needs. Homebound older adults can be difficult to reach because they seldom
      participate and engage in community services due to their functional limitations, which
      leaves their health needs largely unrecognized at an earlier stage. This study tries to bring
      this group of older adults to the providers' attention and design a health-social oriented
      self-care mHealth program and subject it to empirical testing.
