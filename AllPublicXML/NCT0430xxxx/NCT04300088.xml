  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic targeting of immune checkpoints PD-1/PD-L1 and/or CTLA-4 is efficient in several
      solid cancer subtypes, however only some patients do experience clinical benefit from these
      treatments. One explanation could be that multiple redundant checkpoints are present within
      the tumor, simultaneously keeping in check the patient's immune response. The immune
      checkpoint HLA-G is neo-expressed in over 50% of cases in some cancer subtypes and associated
      with more dismal prognosis. The immunosuppressive effects of HLA-G may result in resistance
      to current immunotherapy drugs.

      The GEIA study explores the impact of HLA-G tumor expression on the efficacy of cancer
      immunotherapy in solid cancer patients.
