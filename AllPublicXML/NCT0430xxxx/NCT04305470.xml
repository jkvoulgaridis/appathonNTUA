    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 open-label single-arm study is designed to investigate the safety, diagnostic
      performance, and clinical usefulness of Gleolan for the real time detection and visualization
      of meningiomas during tumor resection surgery. The study is planned to run for 15 months with
      individual study participation lasting for approximately 2 months.

      This Phase 3 open-label single-arm study is designed to investigate the safety, diagnostic
      performance, and clinical usefulness of the imaging agent Gleolan™ (Aminolevulinic Acid
      Hydrochloride, ALA HCl, ALA, 5-ALA), an orally administered imaging agent for the real time
      detection and visualization of meningiomas during tumor resection surgery. ALA is a prodrug
      that is metabolized intracellularly to form the fluorescent molecule Protoporphyrin IX
      (PpIX). The exogenous application of ALA leads to a highly selective accumulation of PpIX in
      tumor cells. Following excitation with blue light (BL) (λ = 375 - 440 nm), the PpIX, which
      has accumulated selectively in tumor tissue, emits a red-violet light. This phenomenon allows
      for the real-time visualization of tumor tissue during resection surgery.

      Patients about to undergo resection for suspected meningioma [World Health Organization (WHO)
      Grade I, II, III] will be screened and informed consent will be obtained prior to surgery and
      prior to study participation. Eligible study participants will receive an oral solution of
      Gleolan (20 mg/kg body weight) 3 hours, (target range 2-4 hours) prior to anesthesia, and
      then undergo surgery for meningioma resection. During the surgery, the surgeon will use a
      microscope equipped with WL and BL for visualization of Gleolan-induced PpIX fluorescence for
      the selection of protocol-driven tissue locations and to assess fluorescence status.

      Study participants will be evaluated within 48 hours post procedure, 2 weeks post procedure,
      and 6 weeks post procedure for study safety assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A pre-operative MRI within ≥ 90 days of study enrollment documenting a suspected
             meningioma or suspected recurrence of a meningioma for which a complete meningioma
             resection is indicated and has been planned.

          2. Adult age ≥ 18 years.

          3. Patient must have normal organ and bone marrow function and be appropriate surgical
