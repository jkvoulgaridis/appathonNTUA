  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A fetal hydrops, also called a fetal anasarca, is the buildup of fluid in the serosa and / or
      fetal subcutaneous tissue. The diagnosis is made by ultrasound, possibly from the first
      trimester of pregnancy.

      The etiologies of hydrops can be immune or non-immune. The historically classic immune causes
      are linked to fetal-maternal alloimmunizations in erythrocyte blood groups. The
      implementation of systematic prevention of these anti rhesus immunizations since the 1970s
      has significantly reduced the incidence of immune hydrops Non-immune hydrops (NIH) now
      represent 90% of fetal hydrops. Known causes of NIH can be classified in several ways
      depending on the mechanism or organ involved.

      The prognosis for NIH is closely linked to the cause. Fetal anemia due to maternal-fetal
      infections can heal spontaneously or give rise to in utero transfusions. Cardiac rhythm
      abnormalities are accessible to medical treatment. Chylothorax compressions may benefit from
      in utero drainage, but chromosomal or metabolic causes cannot benefit from antenatal care.
      The term of pregnancy in which the hydrops is discovered also has an impact on survival,
      which however remains poor.

      In France, certain pathologies can be considered as particularly serious without the
      possibility of treatment and give rise to a request for medical termination of pregnancy.
      This possibility is subject to acceptance by two practitioners who are members of a
      multidisciplinary prenatal diagnostic center (CPDPN). This preliminary multidisciplinary
      reflection participates in the development of prenatal counseling with the greatest precision
      in diagnostic hypotheses. This prenatal advice is essential for a couple on the decision to
      make a pregnancy in progress but also for future pregnancies, given the 25% risk of
      recurrence due to the autosomal recessive mode of transmission.

      Thus the current screening strategy for inherited metabolic diseases on amniotic fluid is
      fragmented. The resulting subdiagnosis explains the objective of the study of using the new
      high throughput sequencing techniques (NGS) in this indication. This approach should make it
      possible to reduce the number of cases classified as idiopathic, to allow the parents
      concerned to receive suitable genetic counseling with a view to new pregnancies, and to
      refine the knowledge of the prenatal epidemiology of these pathologies.
