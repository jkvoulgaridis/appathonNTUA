  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and major functional disability worldwide.
      Treatment options for acute stroke are limited with many patients having residual neurologic
      impairment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elezanumab
      and assess change in neurologic function in participants following an acute ischemic stroke.

      Elezanumab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of acute ischemic
      stroke. This 52-week study is &quot;double-blinded', which means that neither the participants nor
      the study doctors will know who will be given elezanumab and who will be given placebo (does
      not contain treatment drug). Participants will be assigned to one of two groups, called
      treatment arms. Participants in one arm will receive elezanumab and participants in the other
      arm will receive placebo. There is a 1 in 2 chance that participants will be assigned to
      placebo. Approximately 80 subjects will be enrolled in 30 sites worldwide.

      Participants will receive elezanumab or placebo by intravenous (IV) infusion within 24 hours
      of &quot;last known normal&quot; (time when the participant was last known to be without signs and
      symptoms of the current stroke) and every 4 weeks thereafter for 48 weeks for a total of 13
      doses.

      There will be a higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a
      hospital or clinic. The effect of elezanumab will be checked by medical assessments, blood
      tests, evaluation of side effects, and completion of questionnaires.

    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a neurological examination used to quantitatively measure the severity of acute stroke by evaluating impact of cerebral infarction on level of consciousness, gaze, visual field, facial palsy, motor ability of arm and leg, limb ataxia, sensation, language, dysarthria, and extinction/inattention. Domains are scored on a scale of 0 to 2, 0 to 3, or 0 to 4, for a total range of 0 -42 points with higher scores indicating impairment.</description>

    <description>The mRS is used to assess participant's disability and functional dependence. It is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (severe disability), with additional rating of 6 if the participant is deceased.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke in anterior circulation, supported by
             acute brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) consistent
             with the clinical diagnosis.

          -  Able to initiate study drug administration within 24 hours of last known normal.

          -  National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) total score of 7 to 21, inclusive.

          -  Participants or their legally authorized representative confirms that prior to index
             stroke, no significant impairment in participant's ability to perform activities of
             daily living without assistance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of severe stroke on imaging based on available acute imaging studies
             performed under the standard of care.

          -  The index acute ischemic stroke is intended to be treated with endovascular therapy.

          -  Evidence of seizure at the onset of index stroke.

             (other than current acute ischemic stroke) or any other reason, including any
             physical, psychological, or psychiatric condition that in the investigator's opinion
             would compromise the safety or interfere with the participant's participation in this
             study.

          -  Known medical history of repeated episodes of complex migraine. Participants with
