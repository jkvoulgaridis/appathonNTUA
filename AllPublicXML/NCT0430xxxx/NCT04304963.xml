  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycaemia or low blood glucose, and its fear are major barriers to achieving optimal
      glucose control. New technology, such as continuous glucose monitors (CGM), help to better
      identify hypoglycaemia and develop strategies to avoid it. These devices measure glucose in
      the skin, rather than in the blood, and provide information not only on how low glucose is,
      but also for how long. Recent studies showed that over half of episodes of low glucose with
      these systems are not recognised by people with diabetes, and even people without diabetes
      have sensor values that are below the current thresholds for hypoglycaemia [ low blood
      glucose] that we measure with traditional monitors.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the impact of symptomatic as well as
      asymptomatic episodes of low sensor glucose on a variety of clinical, patient-related and
      health economic outcomes such as mood, quality of sleep and productivity. The investigators
      will test different levels and durations of low sensor glucose to identify the one that best
      matches episodes that are symptomatic to best define hypoglycaemia using these systems.

      The investigators will also look at factors that influence this such as sleep or activity as
      well as diabetes management behaviours (such as insulin dosing, carb counting, etc). At the
      end of this study, the investigators will be able to provide a better definition of
      clinically relevant low sensor glucose readings that will help inform clinical as well as
      academic interpretation of CGM data.

    <description>To evaluate the impact of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia on different domains of Quality of Life (QoL) and health economic variables measured by a bespoke mobile phone application.
We will use the definition of LIG identified in the primary objective, 〖LIG〗_PRH (h_opt,t_opt), to evaluate the impact of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia on various outcome variables. To do this, we will divide the days into one of 4 categories LIG-PRH- :no hypoglycaemia LIG+PRH- :asymptomatic biochemical hypoglycaemia ( CGM false positive) LIG+PRH+ :symptomatic biochemical hypoglycaemia LIG-PRH+ :symptomatic without biochemical hypoglycaemia (CGM false negative) We will then compare the scores in different domains collected on the app ( eg reported mood, quality of sleep, alertness, productivity, time off work) between the 4 categories.</description>
