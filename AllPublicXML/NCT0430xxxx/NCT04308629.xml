  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of disability and diminished quality of living that frequently
      includes impairments of postural control and upper extremity (UE) function. The interaction
      of posture and UE coupling in terms of movement planning, initiation, and execution is not
      well understood. StartReact responses triggered by a loud acoustic stimulus (LAS) during the
      planning and preparation of goal intended actions has been used to probe the state of
      brainstem neuronal excitability related to posture and movement sequencing. The purpose of
      this study is to examine posture and goal-directed movement planning and execution using
      startReact responses and to evaluate posture and UE movement sequence during reaching while
      standing in individuals with chronic hemiparesis and healthy controls. Secondly, the
      investigators will determine the modulatory role of the cortical premotor areas (PMAs) in
      startReact responses in healthy controls and in persons with stroke by using transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) to up- or down-regulate PMAs excitability.
