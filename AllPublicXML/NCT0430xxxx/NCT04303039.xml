  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, single-dose, 2-way randomized crossover design in which
      12 healthy subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (AB or BA). Treatments A
      and B will consist of single oral dose of tablet formulation (1.0 mg as 1 x 1.0 mg) in the
      fasted and fed state administered with approximately 240 mL of water. Each period will be
      separated by a washout interval of 4 days.
