  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical trials were developed to test the outcomes of skin closure with tissue
      adhesive, staples and monofilament synthetic suture after cesarean section with Pfannenstiel
      incision: both clinical outcomes such as blood loss, surgical site infection, length of
      postpartum hospitalization, or wound disruption, as well as Patient and Observer Scar
      Assessment Scale (POSAS) scores 8 weeks after surgery, were comparable between these
      different skin closure methods.

      Despite the available studies are often based on robust methodologies and appropriate
      assessment scales, most of them were aimed to evaluate cosmetic outcomes in primary cesarean
      section, whereas data analyses published so far do not allow to draw a firm conclusion about
      repeated cesarean sections. Based on these elements, the aim of this study is to evaluate
      cosmetic outcomes after skin closure of Pfannenstiel incision with tissue adhesive or staples
      in a selected population undergoing repeated cesarean section.

    <description>The Observer Scar Assessment Scale (OSAS) rates 5 variables: vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, and pliability. Each variable uses a 10-point scoring system, with 1 representing normal skin. Ratings of individual variables may be summed to obtain a total score ranging from 5-50, with 5 representing normal skin.</description>

    <measure>Patient Scar Assessment Scale (PSAS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after repeated cesarean section</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Scar Assessment Scale (PSAS) consists of 6 items on scar-related pain, itchiness, color, stiffness, thickness, and irregularity. Each item uses a 10-point scoring system, summed to obtain a total score ranging from 6-60, with 6 representing normal skin with no associated symptoms.</description>
