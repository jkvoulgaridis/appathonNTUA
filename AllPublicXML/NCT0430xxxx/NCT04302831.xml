  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor skill training therapy aims to improve the brain's control of walking and can improve
      clinic-based measures of walking in older adults. However, it is unknown whether the benefits
      of motor skill training extend to real world mobility measures. The investigators will test
      the effects of motor skill training on measures of community mobility of older adults and
      assess the mechanisms through improved motor control at the level of the brain. These results
      will inform intervention approaches to maintain community mobility of older adults and
      prevent disability and institutionalization.
