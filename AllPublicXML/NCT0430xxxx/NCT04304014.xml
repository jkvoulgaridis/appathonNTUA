  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the effect of three factors (delivery type, feeding type and the
      use of two different dietary supplements) on rebiosis after disbiotic delivery. This is a
      randomized, single-blinded study with two parallel arms. Group 1 will receive L. reuteri
      DSM17938 (10^8 CFU) once a day, group 2 will receive B. longum CECT7894 and P. Pentosaceus
      CECT8830 (10^9 CFU) once a day.

    <textblock>
      Gut colonization during the first days of life represents the start of the infant's own
      microbiota. This process is influenced by different factors: delivery type, feeding type,
      antibiotic treatment, etc. On the one hand, vaginally delivered babies are in contact with
      mother's vaginal and faecal microbiota. This fact will drive a neonatal gut colonization
      composed of vagina-associated bacteria. In contrast, babies born by C-section are more
      susceptible to be colonized by microorganisms present in the mother's skin. On the other
      hand, antibiotic administration during vaginal delivery also produces alterations in the
      vaginal microbiota of the mother. Described scenarios have been correlated to immunological
      and metabolic diseases such as asthma, allergies, diabetes or obesity. Moreover, disbiosis
      has also been associated to functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in babies such as
      infant colic and functional constipation. After a disbiotic delivery, medical doctors usually
      recommend the use of probiotics to prevent rebiosis. Since the probiotics.

      L. reuteri DSM17938, and B. longum CECT7894 and P. Pentosaceus CECT8830 have shown efficacy
      on FGID amelioration in previously published articles, these two probiotics were selected for
      the present study. All together, this study aims to characterize the role of three different
      parameters: type of probiotic, delivery type and feeding type.
