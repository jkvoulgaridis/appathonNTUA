      Patients with complex biliary stone disease are challenging to treat. The investigator
      present their experience in using urological interventions to treat challenging biliary
      stones.

      Methods:

      Fifteen patients with biliary calculi underwent 21 interventions using either extracorporeal
      shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopy, percutaneous
      transcystic choledochoscopy, or a combination of these.

      The investigator conducted a retrospective review to investigate the outcomes of urological
      treatments for biliary calculi from January 1, 1999, to August 31, 2016, focusing on
      percutaneous endoscopic methods and/or ESWL. The primary outcomes of interest were symptom-
      and stone-free rates, length of hospital stay, and complications. Our institutional ethics
      review board approved the study (IRB-2018-01-119). Due to the retrospective nature of the
      study, the need for informed consent was waived. One endourologist evaluated all patients
      preoperatively.

      Urological intervention techniques The three different approaches used (ESWL, PTHC, and PTCC)
      are described below.

        Most patients were elderly (median age, 60 years). The male-to-female ratio was higher than
        the norm for biliary stones (1:1.4). The most common reasons for failure of conventional
        endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were high American Society of
        Anesthesia (ASA) score (8 patients 53%), technical failure of ERCP (4 patients, 27%),
        previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (two patients, 13%), and post-common bile duct (CBD)
        injury with T-tube insertion (one patient, 7%). The stone sites were the CBD, gallbladder,
        and intrahepatic bile duct in nine (60%), three (20%), and three (20%) patients,
        respectively
